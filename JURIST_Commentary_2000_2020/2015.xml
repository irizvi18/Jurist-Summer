		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Ashley Varnado, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2015, is the author of the ninth article in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law/academic-programs/student-journals/journal-civil-rights-and-economic-development">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Varnado discusses the exclusionary discipline that bars Chicago public school students from education...</j:header><strong>I</strong>magine an African American Chicago Public School (CPS) freshmen student named Anthony. He wakes up every day at 6:30 a.m. to get ready for school. Anthony takes a shower, brushes his teeth, eats a bowl of oatmeal, checks over his homework and then heads out the door to school. The first faces Anthony sees when he arrives at school are city police officers who command the metal detectors that he must pass through before he begins class.</p>

<p>During second period, Anthony takes out his cell phone to let his mother know that he arrived safely at school, but the teacher reprimands him for violating the school code on cell phone use and sends him to the principal's office. Anthony receives a three-day, out-of-school suspension. Anthony's parents work during the day, and for those three days he remains at home unsupervised, hanging out with students who have similarly been suspended. Anthony returns to school during the week of finals and fails three of his tests because he missed important review sessions while he was suspended. Even though Anthony is only a freshman, he is now off track to graduate on time. He is suspended again during his sophomore year for being late to class and becomes more alienated from school. By Anthony's junior year, the out-of-school suspensions have caused him to fall so far behind academically that he loses hope and drops out of high school. His dream of attending college is now a distant memory. Like many high school dropouts, Anthony's job prospects are not promising. To make ends meet, Anthony falls into a life of crime that ultimately lands him in prison. What makes this story even more depressing is that this downward spiral started from an out-of-school suspension for his simple use of a cell phone. Anthony's story is not unique, and CPS is currently in hot water for the disparate rate at which African American students are being removed from classrooms for even minor infractions. <a href="http://www.suspensionstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/overrepresentationofblackyouth.pdf">Exclusionary discipline</a> [PDF] is any form of discipline that removes students from the classroom and includes in-school suspensions, out-of-school suspensions and expulsion. Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.ctunet.com/blog/ctu-statement-obama-school-discipline">unequal treatment</a> of African Americans in Chicago's school system is not new and has deep roots in the nation's third largest city.  </p>

<p>After the Supreme Court's ruling in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13102254740887304967">Brown v. Board of Education</a>, Chicago officials took conscious steps to prevent African American students from integrating with white students. My uncle, Ernest Herron, was one of the first African American students to integrate Fengar High School on the city's South Side. He recounts the unfair treatment that he and his classmates faced, including disproportionate school discipline. Race fights were not uncommon, and African American students often barred the brunt of the discipline. In 2014, some of these same cultural and racial biases still hold true. A <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2012-data-summary.pdf">study</a> [PDF] conducted by the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights confirmed the federal government's fears and found that African American students are over three-and-a-half times more likely to be suspended or expelled from school compared to white students. Further, the study found that African Americans comprised 18% of the students in the study but 35% of those suspended a single time and 39% of students expelled.</p>

<p>The Obama administration is <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/08/22231509-obama-administration-takes-aim-at-cutting-racial-disparity-in-school-discipline?lite">taking aim</a> to help eradicate the rate at which minority students are disproportionately removed from the classroom and exposed to extreme forms of discipline. Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/08/22231509-obama-administration-takes-aim-at-cutting-racial-disparity-in-school-discipline?lite">stated</a>: "Effective discipline is, and always will be, a necessity. But a routine school discipline infraction should land a student in a principal's office&#8212;not in a police precinct." The overzealous use of exclusionary discipline has become so out of hand in school districts across America that the federal government has issued a <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201401-title-vi.pdf">guide</a> [PDF] on proper classroom discipline. </p>

<p>While this is a national problem, special attention needs to focus on Chicago. The Department of Education study found that African Americans comprised 45% of the enrollment in CPS but comprised 76% of the students who were suspended. In contrast, white students accounted for 9% of the student enrollment in CPS but comprised 3% of the students who were suspended. In the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rev-jesse-jackson/race-school-suspensions-_b_1399598.html">2010-2011</a> school year, CPS students missed 306,731 days of school due to exclusionary disciplinary action. A whopping 94% were for minor infractions such as cell phone use.  </p>

<p>An effective strategy to decrease the disproportionate rate at which African American students are removed from school is to restructure CPS's <a href="http://www.cps.edu/Documents/Resources/StudentCodeOfConduct/English_StudentCodeofConduct.pdf">Student Code of Conduct</a> [PDF]. As the code currently stands, behaviors are categorized into six groups, ranging from "Inappropriate Behaviors" to "Illegal and Most Seriously Disruptive Behaviors." CPS's Student Code of Conduct gives principals discretion in determining the "appropriate" punishment for students that have violated the code. This discretion in the code allows for racial bias, whether intentionally or subconsciously, and comes into play when an African American student is punished. As a result, African American students are receiving more extreme forms of punishment at substantially higher rates than white students. For example, under Group 3 "Seriously Disruptive Behaviors," a student's punishment for unauthorized use of a cell phone can range from a teacher/student conference to an out-of-school suspension. With such a wide range of disciplinary latitude, a principal who holds a racial bias could easily suspend an African American student from school where a warning would have been sufficient. In addition, under Group 2 "Disruptive Behaviors," a student's punishment for disobeying the authority of school personnel can range from a student self-reflection sheet to an in-school suspension. Again, this leeway makes it very easy for a principal to issue punishments that remove African Americans from school, causing dire future consequences.   </p>

<p>While CPS has recognized that African American students are being removed from school at a higher rate than white students and have made limited changes to its Student Code of Conduct, more steps need to be taken to eradicate this problem. For starters, the punishment must be in direct correlation with the student's offense. Cell phone use does not warrant an out-of-school suspension. A principal should not be able to order that one student have a parent/teacher conference while another receives a suspension for the same offense. Until the leaders of CPS are willing to sit down and address this disparate discipline issue, African American students will continue to suffer from this disparity. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Danielle Ardner,  <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University Law School</a>, Class of 2016, discusses the lawsuit filed by district attorneys from San Francisco and Los Angeles regarding the safety of Uber ... </j:header></p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n Tuesday, December 9th, district attorneys from San Francisco and Los Angeles filed a consumer protection <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_27102694/biz-break-san-francisco-and-l-sue-uber">lawsuit</a> against Uber, a popular ridesharing company based in San Francisco and operating in over 250 <a href="http://wane.com/2014/12/11/is-rider-safety-the-real-achilles-heel-for-uber-and-lyft/">cities</a> in 50 countries. The complaint alleges that Uber misleads consumers about their safety, overcharges them and completely disregards California law. </p>

<p>"Uber has refused to comply with straightforward California laws that protect consumers from fraud and harm," San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon and Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey stated. "These companies can be innovative in the way they deliver services without ignoring the laws that protect the public."</p>

<p>Uber's rival, Lyft, also based in San Francisco, <a href="http://time.com/3626922/san-francisco-los-angeles-uber-lyft/">settled</a> with the city for $500,000 over similar accusations of making "false and misleading statements" to consumers over adequate background checks on their drivers. Lyft additionally agreed to stop all airport pickups until necessary permits are obtained and to submit its app to a state testing agency to assure their calculation of fares are proper.</p>

<p>Specifically, Gascon and Lacey state in their complaint that Uber allegedly portrays misleading statements regarding <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-uber-lyft-20141209-story.html">background checks</a> the company obtains on their drivers, while also falsely charging a $1 "Safe Rides Fee" and a "fraudulent" $4 airport fee.</p>

<p>Uber's $1 "<a href="https://support.uber.com/hc/en-us/articles/201950566-What-is-the-Safe-Rides-Fee-">Safe Rides Fee</a>" "supports continued efforts to ensure the safest possible platform for Uber riders and drivers, including a Federal, state and local background check process, regular motor vehicle checks, driver safety education, development of safety features in the app and more." Gascon and Lacey stated that Uber's rationalization for applying this $1 fee was because drivers underwent rigorous <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-09/uber-sued-by-san-francisco-los-angeles-prosecutors.html">screening</a>, beyond local requirements. </p>

<p>Uber fails to use fingerprinting technology to link prospective drivers to their criminal history. Instead, Uber relies primarily on potential drivers submitting their personal information online, then contracts with a private company, Hirease, to perform background checks. However, without fingerprinting, Gascon considers the background check "completely worthless" since there is no way of telling whether the information provided is definitively associated with the driver. The $1 "Safe Rides Fee" may not be justified since taxi drivers are required by law to participate in a more comprehensive background check, which includes fingerprinting.</p>

<p>If you are catching an Uber to or from the San Francisco International Airport, expect to be charged an additional $4 airport toll fee, even though drivers are not paying any money to the airport, according to Gascon.</p>

<p>Uber's policies also include <a href="http://time.com/money/3626486/uber-insurance-background-checks/">no preliminary drug screening</a>, so drivers are screened only after passengers have complained. Insurance coverage for Uber drivers is also $50,000 per injury, with a max of $100,000 per ride, if a driver has not started the trip when the accident occurs. In comparison, taxi drivers in Portland, Oregon are required to hold insurance that includes $500,000 per incident.</p>

<p>This consumer protection lawsuit seeks a court order blocking Uber from making false statements regarding background checks on their drivers, restitution to consumers for fees, as well as penalties of up to $2,500 for tens of thousands of violations, Gascon states. Uber could probably afford to settle with the city, like Lyft, since they recently were given a <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/12/05/morning-agenda-uber-garners-40-billion-valuation/?_r=0">$41.2 billion valuation</a>.</p>

<p>Eva Behrend, a spokesperson for Uber, told <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/now-san-francisco-and-los-angeles-are-suing-uber-2014-12">Business Insider</a>, "Californians and California lawmakers all agree&#8212;Uber is an integral, safe and established part of the transportation ecosystem in the Golden state. Uber has met with the District Attorneys to address their concerns regarding airport operations, the Uber POOL product, background checks and operation of the app. We will continue to engage in discussions with the District Attorneys."</p>

<p>This lawsuit has followed after a string of unfortunate events for Uber recently. On Monday, December 8th, Uber was banned in <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/news/ci_27093640/rape-accusation-against-uber-driver-leads-ban-new">New Delhi</a>, after a driver allegedly raped a passenger. Uber could potentially be facing a nationwide ban in India. A former Uber driver is also facing a <a href="http://abc7news.com/business/uber-driver-faces-charge-after-hitting-sf-girl-/428283/">vehicular manslaughter charge</a> after hitting a 6-year-old girl last New Year's Eve. Resistance of Uber has also been met with bans in the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/08/us-uber-netherlands-idUSKBN0JM0XJ20141208">Netherlands</a>, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/thailand-orders-uber-halt-taxi-services-says-operating-085240169.html">Thailand</a> and <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_27101781/uber-temporarily-banned-spain">Spain</a>. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/12/08/portland-sues-uber/">Portland, Oregon</a> is even suing the company.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/worldwide-pushback-against-uber-could-spell-trouble-ridesharing-startup-1745465">Richard Torrenzano</a>, chief executive of the Torrenzano Group, a reputation and high stakes issues management firm stated "there will be an enormous backlash by governments and a push by Uber's competitors in cities around the world who are more established and have been required to meet various government regulations."</p>

<p>In California, the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-uber-lyft-20141209-story.html">Public Utilities Commission</a> (CPUC) recently clarified requirements for ridesharing companies like Uber to operate, demanding them to hold more comprehensive insurance polices, as well as conducting more thorough background checks on potential drivers and safety inspections on vehicles. Additionally, the CPUC <a href="http://www.policygenius.com/blog/insurance-secret-uber-doesnt-want-know/">categorized</a> Uber, Lyft and Sidecar (yet another ridesharing company) as a new category of transportation services called transportation network companies (TNCs). However, the definition of a TNC has led to confusion. According to the<a href="http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/NR/rdonlyres/1788F1F1-EA38-4B68-B221-4116994F2252/0/TNC_App_Instrctns.pdf"> CPUC</a>, a TNC is defined as "a company or organization operating in California that provides transportation services using an online-enabled platform to connect passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles." Government officials remain unimpressed by the notion that ridesharing companies are not operating as taxis, therefore getting to avoid regulation.</p>

<p>Thilo Koslowski, vice president and automotive practice leader at the technology analysis firm Garter, said the regulatory obstacles Uber is facing is no surprise, since the company "is still young." Koslowski noted Uber's expansion speed as a factor of the problems it is facing, but it is a "part of growing up." Koslowski warned that Uber should address more than better background checks for their drivers and advises technological solutions such as "security cameras or an SOS button in each car for passengers."</p>

<p>Taxicab companies are also battling ridesharing companies like Uber. Melwood Global and Interactive Strategies have been working together to represent the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/taxi-group-ups-fight-against-ridesharing/2014/03/28/c0027b84-b525-11e3-b899-20667de76985_story.html">Taxicab, Limousine, & Paratransit Association</a> on a campaign called "<a href="http://www.whosdrivingyou.org">Who's Driving You</a>?" which blasts safety lapses within the ridesharing industry. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT8Kv7Et0OI#t=442">campaign video</a> entices viewers with four alleged myths about Uber: (1) that Uber is a technology company, (2) insurance or uberX services keeps people safe and covered, (3) Uber is a ridesharing company that doesn't need to follow taxi laws, (4) UberX doesn't need regulation [because] deregulation is a good thing. Colorado Governor <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_25907057/colorado-first-authorize-lyft-and-ubers-ridesharing-services">John Hickenlooper</a> seems to agree with the notion of deregulation for TNCs, stating: "rules designed to protect consumers should not burden businesses with unnecessary red tape or stifle competition by creating barriers to entry."</p>

<p>With all the backlash Uber is facing, is there a bright side? Yes. A new <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/12/11/taxi-drivers-so-crazy/">study</a> found that taxi drivers are more prone to take risks and speed than Uber or Lyft drivers, as well as regular drivers. <a href="http://blog.zendrive.com/post/104915142448/taxi-vs-rideshare-in-sf">Zendrive</a>, a driving analytics company, tested the driving habits of more than 1,000 San Francisco drivers and concluded that taxi drivers were 46% more likely to speed than rideshare drivers and 18% more likely to speed than average drivers. The study also concluded that taxi drivers were particularly bad at obeying traffic laws, since 60 percent of the taxi rides in the study included a safety violation (such as speeding or phone usage). </p>

<p>Ridesharing companies like Uber continue to remain more <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/what-uber-is-doing-to-cabs-in-san-francisco-in-1-crazy-chart/380378/">popular</a> than traditional taxis as well. As for the safety pushback Uber is receiving, I prefer to take an Uber or Lyft over a taxicab any day. As soon as you open Uber's app and start the process of getting a ride, you can see the drivers that are closest to you via tiny moving cars on your smartphone's screen. After you choose a ride successfully, you can track the location of your ride using Uber's map, which even offers an estimated time of arrival. Uber also provides you with the make and model of the car picking you up and a picture and name of the driver. Once you get into your Uber, you are provided with another estimated time of arrival, this time to your destination. </p>

<p>Over light conversation, your Uber driver gets you where you need to go in a fast and efficient manner. Uber also has a feature where you can "share" your ride information with others through a text message, so another person can track your ride as well. This is especially beneficial when you are traveling to a friend's house, because they can track when you will arrive, what kind of car you are traveling in and who the driver is. It is like having a second set of eyes watching you. Watch for Uber's "<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304250204579433113467536876">surge</a>" pricing during rush hour or other popular times, however, which can make your ride more expensive.</p>

<p>Bottom line: ridesharing companies like Uber, Lyft and Sidecar are innovators in the technology industry. Ridesharing companies provide convenience and better availability than taxis. It is easier to catch a ride with a ridesharing company than it is to hail a cab. Passengers in ridesharing cars also only pay with their credit card via the application, which is beneficial since credit cards have become the most user-friendly method of payment. An additional safety plus, at least for me, is that ridesharing companies track everything with GPS technology using smartphones. The companies know the identity of the driver, the identity of the passenger and the location of the final destination, which is more than I can say for a traditional taxicab. Getting into a car with a stranger is more reassuring when multiple people have the ability to track your every movement.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://pennstatelaw.psu.edu/faculty/wadhia">Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia</a>, of Penn State Law, discusses President Obama's executive actions on immigration and analyzes the two main immigration reform programs ...</p><strong>O</strong>n November 20, 2014, President Obama announced a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration/immigration-action">series of executive actions</a> on immigration aimed at reducing deportations for people who present positive equities such as a close family relationship or long term residence in the US. In <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/obama-announces-immigration-reforms.php">announcing</a> these actions, the President used the phrase "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/20/remarks-president-address-nation-immigration">families not felons</a>" to explain his plan to prioritize immigration enforcement against some groups over others. This commentary describes the ingredients of and relationship between two programs announced by the president&#8212;the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction">Deferred Action for Parental Accountability Program</a> and <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_prosecutorial_discretion.pdf">Revised Enforcement Priorities</a> [PDF].   </p>

<p>The Deferred Action for Parental Accountability Program or "DAPA" will enable certain undocumented parents to request for deferred action if they meet the following criteria: 1) continuous residence in the US since January 1, 2010; 2) parental relationship to a US citizen or lawful permanent resident born on or before November 20, 2014; and 3) not an enforcement priority for removal.  The <a href="https://pennstatelaw.psu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/pdfs/Immigrants/executive-action-law-prof-letter.pdf">legal basis</a> [PDF] for the DAPA program is rooted in the US Constitution, case law, immigration statute, regulations and policy guidance and enjoys a long history. Deferred action is one form of prosecutorial discretion, which in immigration law refers to the Department of Homeland Security's choice about who to target for removal if at all. The policy reasons behind the DAPA program are largely humanitarian and are aimed at keeping families together if the dependent enjoys a permanent immigration status and the parent has resided in the US for a meaningful period of time.  There are also economic reasons for creating programs like DAPA to the extent it facilitates better management of limited resources. According to <a href="http://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/releases/2011/110302washingtondc.pdf">one estimate</a> [PDF] the Department of Homeland Security has the resources to remove 400,000 or less than 4% of the total removable population. </p>

<p>The DAPA bar (the requirement that the parent is not an enforcement priority) is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laurenbrooke-eisen/felons-not-families-overs_b_6212550.html">controversial</a> and requires one to study the scope of the revised priorities memo (RPM). Effective January 5, 2015 the RPM supersedes several earlier guidance documents issued by the Department of Homeland Security on prosecutorial discretion and civil enforcement priorities and targets roughly three classes of people: 1) threats to national security, border security and public safety, including but not limited to those with felony convictions; 2) misdemeanants and recent entrants, including but not limited to those convicted for driving under the influence or misdemeanors for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or more; and 3) other immigration violators, including noncitizens with final orders of removal on or after January 1, 2014. For attorneys and advocates involved in criminal or removal defense, the scope of these classes is breathtaking as it includes a range of misdemeanors, non-violent felonies and immigration violations that do not meet the ordinary understanding of a "crime." The DAPA bar is automatic for a person otherwise eligible for DAPA such as a mother of three children born in the United States who is working as the primary caretaker for her children and has lived in the United States for many years but with a misdemeanor that falls within the RPM. Despite the controversy, the choice made by the administration to exclude enforcement priorities from the DAPA program was a policy choice within the domain of its authority. </p>

<p>Importantly, there are noncitizens living in the United States who may neither qualify for DAPA nor be labeled as an enforcement priority. For example, there could be a parent with no criminal history whose only child is a recipient of <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) and therefore cannot satisfy the requirement that the child be a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident. Similarly, a single male in his 20s may be working on a farm without a family or transgression and therefore fall outside the DAPA policy and the priorities memo. This is not a new phenomenon. The Department of Homeland Security uses more than one dozen kinds of "non-enforcement" actions (i.e. canceling a charging document) and positive actions (i.e., granting deferred action) when making prosecutorial discretion decisions. In other words, deferred action is not the only way the Department of Homeland Security may exercise prosecutorial discretion favorably. Possibly, the mom of a DACA child or the farmworker above may be considered individually for another type of prosecutorial discretion like a stay of removal or dismissal of a case under a theory that they do not constitute enforcement priorities. </p>

<p>Perhaps a more provocative piece of the President Obama's executive actions is its attempt to carve out exceptions to the categories listed in the RPM. For example, in describing Priority 1, the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_prosecutorial_discretion.pdf">RPM states </a> [PDF]<blockquote>[A]liens in Priority l must be prioritized for removal unless they qualify for asylum, or other form of relief under our laws, or unless in the judgment of [DHS] there are compelling and exceptional factors that clearly indicate the alien is not a threat to national security, border security, or public safety and therefore, should not be an enforcement priority.</blockquote> Based on a plain reading of this language, a person with compelling equities like long term residence in the United States or a seriously ill relative would be considered for a form of prosecutorial discretion even if she has a felony conviction from many years ago. This has not always been the case. Having studied scores of deferred action cases processed by the Department of Homeland Security in the last several years, there was a concern that single reasons were driving deferred action denials. <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2195758">Lamenting</a> over one data set of 698 deferred action cases I obtained from ICE in 2012 I reflected: <blockquote>[ICE's] findings do not include an analysis about how a negative factor interacts with a positive one. For example, how does ICE treat someone who has a criminal history and a USC dependent? This kind of information is vital as it contributes to the public understanding about whether having a criminal history is fatal or just a factor behind a deferred action determination.</blockquote> Insofar as the Department of Homeland Security historically avoided articulating a policy for protecting people with strong equities and a criminal history because it was too political or for other reasons, the Obama Administration should be acknowledged for incorporating these more complex cases into its policy.   </p>

<p>Ultimately, the "devil is in the details" and to predict how the President Obama's executive actions will play out in practice would be premature. Importantly, whether and how these programs are implemented will matter to immigrants and their families who make the choice to come out of the shadows and apply for DAPA or another form of prosecutorial discretion. The administration is expected to issue more precise guidelines about its executive actions in the future, but will have to tread cautiously against the <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/virginia/goodlatte-signs-legal-brief-fighting-obama-immigration-action/article_6c633293-d286-5df7-bdf5-bf51d4a0749f.html">politics</a> that have already accompanied the DAPA program even before it has become operational. Nevertheless, there remains a real possibility for a robust policy consistent with President Obama's DAPA program and revised enforcement priorities. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.acluga.org/about-us/staff/azadeh-shahshahani/">Azadeh Shahshahani</a>, of the ACLU of Georgia, discusses a recent controversy surrounding a mosque in Georgia ...</p> <strong>M</strong>uslim-Americans in Kennesaw, Georgia who had hoped to use space in a retail shopping center as a prayer center recently had to confront hateful and ignorant comments from some residents, accusing them of being "enemies" and "infiltrators."  </p>

                <p>Even though community members who had applied for the permit had agreed to parking and other restrictions, the Kennesaw City Council <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/12/02/3598518/georgia-mosque-denied/">refused to issue a permit</a> by a 4-1 vote. The city's "retail only" excuse quickly fell apart considering that the city council had granted a permit to a Pentecostal church in a retail center. This pointed to blatant discrimination.</p>

                <p>Faced with the threat of litigation and a Department of Justice Civil Rights investigation, the Kennesaw City Council changed its decision. "We hope that this will end the issue of us being outsiders," the mosque spokesperson Amjad Taufique told the news media.</p>

                <p>But this is not the first time that a Muslim community in metro Atlanta has faced obstacles in building or expanding a mosque in recent years. Muslim-Americans in Lilburn and Alpharetta also encountered roadblocks. Local officials only backed down after a filing of lawsuits and intervention by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/">Department of Justice Civil Rights Division</a>. </p>

                <p>This unfortunate pattern of discrimination is not unique to Georgia either. As an <a href="https://www.aclu.org/maps/map-nationwide-anti-mosque-activity">ACLU map</a> of anti-Muslim activity shows, Muslims across the country, from California to New York, to Texas to Ohio, have faced vandalism or other criminal acts targeting their places of worship or refusals by local officials to issue necessary zoning permits for the construction and expansion of mosques. And while the excuse often proffered is noise, traffic and parking, local officials or residents can hardly fool anyone that what actually lies behind such attitudes is bias towards Muslim-Americans.  </p>

                <p>Preventing Muslims or any other group from practicing their faith is unAmerican. Religious freedom is one of America's most fundamental liberties and a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">central principle</a> upon which this country was founded.</p>

                <p>Denying people of faith a permit to construct a place of worship because of their faith violates the law. Federal law protects the right to build a church, synagogue, mosque or any other house of worship. In fact, in 2000 Congress recognized the need to protect religious freedom by passing legislation against religious discrimination in zoning regulations. <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/hce/rluipaexplain.php">The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA</a>), passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, prohibits local governments from using zoning regulations to substantially burden religious exercise or to discriminate against houses of worship. This law was passed to ensure that in the face of controversy, local governments do not play favorites with religious groups or prevent certain groups from practicing their religion.</p>

                <p>The connection between land use and the fundamental right to practice one's religion is crucial, as emphasized in the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/rluipa_q_a_9-22-10.pdf">Joint Statement of Senators Hatch and Kennedy</a>, RLUIPA's co-sponsors: "The right to build, buy or rent such a space (for churches and synagogues) is an indispensable adjunct to the core First Amendment right to assemble for religious purposes."  </p>

                <p>RLUIPA's provisions apply to programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance and where local procedures permit the government to make "individualized assessments of the proposed uses for the property involved."  </p>

                <p>Per RLUIPA, if a zoning decision imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a faith group, the city must show that the decision is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means to achieve that purpose. This federal law also requires local governments to treat houses of worship on equal footing with similar non-religious facilities. RLUIPA also mandates that different religious groups be treated equally by government.</p>

                <p>This statute represents a Congressional attempt at providing a mechanism for enforcing the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. It does not however supersede the traditional remedies for free exercise violations available under the First Amendment. Municipalities can be held liable for monetary and injunctive relief as a result of their unconstitutional or illegal laws and policies which run counter to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/free_exercise_clause">First Amendment Free Exercise Clause</a>.</p>

                <p>In examining these claims, strict scrutiny applies where, as in Kennesaw, the burden on religion results from an individualized governmental assessment.  Zoning decisions, by their nature, impose individual assessment regimes in that they involve case-by-case evaluations of the propriety of proposed activity against land use regulations. Courts have recognized the "vulnerability of religious institutions&#8212;especially those that are not affiliated with the mainstream Protestant sects or the Roman Catholic Church&#8212;to subtle forms of discrimination when, as in the case of the grant or denial of zoning variances, a state delegates essentially standardless discretion to nonprofessionals operating without procedural safeguards."  </p>

                <p>In Kennesaw, given the fact that the city had already granted a permit to another religious institution in a retail center and the fact that the mosque applicants had already agreed to a variety of measures to address any supposed concerns regarding parking and traffic, it was highly unlikely that the city would be able to meet the high standard of review. <a href="http://www.kennesaw-ga.gov/city-council/#">Kennesaw City Council</a> members made the right calculation in changing their decision on granting a permit to the mosque; their position would stand no chance in court. It would have been much better however if they had acted in favor of religious liberty in the first place and not only when faced with the potential for litigation. </p>

                <p>Our political leaders and the constituents they represent must be reminded that discrimination is a losing proposition and that adherence to the Constitution is not optional. We must ensure that those who have lived and worshipped peacefully in Georgia for decades have the right to continue to do so. "I would invite our neighbors to really come and visit us and be understanding who we are, what we are, what we do and if any hard feelings are there, that would hopefully remove any of that," said Taufique.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.nus.edu.sg/about_us/faculty/staff/profileview.asp?UserID=lawvmk">Victor Kattan</a> of the National University of Singapore Law Faculty, discusses the reasons for and consequences of Palestine's accession to the ICC and considers possible scenarios for developments around the Palestine question...</p><strong>I</strong>srael's <a href="http://paperchase/2015/01/israel-to-withhold-tax-revenue-against-palestinian-leaders.php">decision</a> to delay transferring Palestinian customs and excise revenues to the Palestinian Authority (PA) in response to President Mahmoud Abbas's accession to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court</a> [PDF] (ICC) was entirely predictable. After all, as recently as 2012 Israel <a href="http://paperchase/2012/12/israel-rejects-palestinian-authority-statehood-despite-un-resolution.php">halted</a> such transfers after the UN General Assembly passed a <a href="http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/19862D03C564FA2C85257ACB004EE69B">resolution</a> acknowledging Palestine as a non-member state. These customs revenues account for nearly two-thirds of the PA's budget, while the US Congress is said to be <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/with-israel-war-crimes-gambit-pa-risks-loss-of-us-funding/">reconsidering</a> $400 million in annual US aid to the PA.</p>

<p>Abbas' decision to join the court came in the wake of a failed attempt to persuade a majority of the UN Security Council members on December 30, 2014 to vote in favor of a draft Jordanian <a href="http://timesofisrael.com/reported-text-of-draft-un-resolution-on-palestinian-statehood/">resolution</a>. The Jordanian resolution called for an end to Israel's occupation of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by 2017&#8212;50 years after Israel seized those territories in the June 1967 war&#8212;when the UN Security Council <a href="http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7D35E1F729DF491C85256EE700686136">affirmed</a> in Resolution 242 that the establishment of a lasting peace included the withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in that conflict and the termination of all claims or states of belligerency. The draft Jordanian resolution <a href="http://theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/us-israel-un-reject-palestinian-resolution-nigeria-security-council">failed</a> to acquire the minimum nine votes to pass due to the negative votes of the US and Australia and five abstentions.<br />
 <br />
On January 1, 2015 Australia, South Korea and Rwanda completed their two-year terms and were replaced by Angola, Malaysia and Venezuela as <a href="http://un.org/en/sc/members/">rotating members</a> of the Security Council. If the intention of Abbas was to force a US veto, he could have waited for the beginning of the new year when the composition of the Security Council changed and when he would have had a better chance of securing nine votes.<br />
 <br />
So why did Abbas apply to join the ICC when he did?<br />
 <br />
It is possible it was out of pique and frustration. After all he had threatened to join the court previously, and warned he would do so again in the event the US blocked the draft resolution. The US had called Abbas's bluff before, so he might have felt that his credibility and standing within his own political party was on the line. But it has also been <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/opinions/mahmoud-abbas-is-again-insisting-on-failure/2014/12/29/6119435e-8f87-11e4-a900-9960214d4cd7_story.html">suggested</a> that Abbas pushed for the vote because he wanted to preserve his lines of communication with Washington by not forcing the US to veto the draft resolution. By insisting on a vote ahead of January 1 that Abbas knew would fail, Abbas would be able to present his maximalist position to placate his Palestinian <a href="http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=749072">critics</a> as well as have a reason to accede to the Rome Statute.</p>

<p>Importantly Abbas not only acceded to the Rome Statute, but also lodged a <a href="http://icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/press/Palestine_A_12-3.pdf">declaration</a> [PDF] directly with the Registrar of the ICC recognizing the jurisdiction of the court from June 13, 2014. This date was chosen in the resolution adopted by the UN Human Rights Council to establish a fact-finding mission to begin an inquiry into the origins of last summer's hostilities in Gaza. The fact-finding mission is due to present its report to the Human Rights Council in March 2015. This means that the mission will be able to take Palestine's accession into account while it compiles its report.</p>

<p>In addition to acceding to the Rome Statute on December 31, 2014, Abbas also signed accession <a href="http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/47d4e277b48d9d3685256ddc00612265/6ac3115500c569e985257dc100552b95?OpenDocument">instruments</a> for another 16 <a href="http://nad-plo.org/userfiles/file/fact%20sheets/Q&A%20Accession.pdf">treaties</a> [PDF]. These are in addition to the treaties that Palestine acceded to in April 2014.</p>

<p>Because the UN Secretary General had already accepted treaties deposited by Palestine, it was not surprising that his office was quick to accept Palestine's application to join the ICC. On January 6, 2015 Ban Ki Moon, acting in his capacity as depositary, <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2015/CN.13.2015-Eng.pdf">confirmed</a> [PDF] that the Rome Statute will enter into force in Palestine on April 1, 2015. Of course the exact geographic scope of the territory of Palestine has yet to be determined. But Israel's status as the occupying power in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including East Jerusalem, was recently reaffirmed by the <a href="http://news.admin.ch/NSBSubscriber/message/attachments/37764.pdf">Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention</a> [PDF] on December 17, 2014. Assuming that Palestine's territory consists of territory occupied in June 1967, the Rome Statute will enter into force in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, 14 days after <a href="http://jpost.com/Israel-Elections/Knesset-meeting-now-to-discuss-date-of-upcoming-elections-383529">Israel's general election on March 17, 2015</a>. </p>

<p>Accordingly from April 1, 2015 the Prosecutor of the ICC will be able to initiate a preliminary investigation into crimes that appear to fall within the jurisdiction of the court. This will undoubtedly include crimes that occurred during last summer's hostilities in Gaza. The Prosecutor may also open an investigation into Israel's <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/content/what-would-happen-if-palestine-joined-international-criminal-court/13783">settlement policy</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst this means that Palestinians may also be subject to an ICC investigation, it is possible that the Prosecutor may conclude that the Hamas rocket attacks aimed at Israel during last summer's conflict that killed <a href="http://ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_sitrep_04_09_2014.pdf">4 Israeli civilians</a> [PDF], whilst deplorable, will not be of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the court. (The others killed included 66 soldiers directly engaged in hostilities, one security coordinator, and a foreign Thai worker). This conclusion would be in line with the findings of the Prosecutor's <a href="http://icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-COM-Article_53%281%29-Report-06Nov2014Eng.pdf">preliminary examination</a> [PDF] into the events that occurred on-board the M.V. Mavi Marmara when the Prosecutor concluded that the deaths of 10 Turkish nationals by Israeli commandos were not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the court.</p>

<p>The Prosecutor will also have to take into consideration the extent to which Israel is investigating or prosecuting Israeli soldiers and officials implicated in crimes under the Rome Statute. If it appears that Israel is unwilling to carry out proper investigations, the Prosecutor may conclude that the case is admissible. It is unlikely that Israel will investigate or prosecute senior Israeli officials implicated in Israel's settlement policy for example. No senior Israeli official has been investigated or prosecuted for crimes that occurred in Gaza during the last two conflicts. Nor have senior Israeli officials ever been investigated or prosecuted for Israel's settlement policy. </p>

<p>Because Abbas acceded to the Rome Statute, he can always appeal the Prosecutor's decision in the event that she decides not to proceed. </p>

<p>Although Abbas has acceded to the Rome Statute, he will still need to <a href="http://ecfr.eu/article/commentary_palestine_and_the_international_criminal_court303">ensure</a> that at least one of the five permanent members of the Security Council will be willing to veto (or threaten to veto) any resolution that Washington might try to introduce in the Security Council in an attempt to defer an ICC investigation or prosecution. This could explain why Saeb Erekat, an executive member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and close confidant of Abbas, <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/0/3A0A51C9B8A7C3CEC3257DB70051B81E">met</a> with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow in December 2014.</p>

<p>Looking ahead it is not clear what will happen next. For now Israel has already announced it will withhold the customs and excise it collects from the Palestinians. There are also myriad <a href="http://palestine-studies.org/jps/fulltext/186675">other ways</a> Israel could retaliate.</p>

<p>Further, Abbas's decision might result in the loss of much needed Congressional funds for the PA. This is because on December 16, 2014, President Obama signed into law the <a href="https://congress.gov/113/bills/hr83/BILLS-113hr83enr.pdf">Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015</a> [PDF] passed by Congress. Section 7041(j), A(i)(II) would prohibit the grant of American aid to the Palestinians if "the Palestinians initiate an International Criminal Court judicially authorized investigation, or actively support such an investigation, that subjects Israeli nationals to an investigation for alleged crimes against Palestinians."</p>

<p>The Palestinians have not, however, initiated an ICC judicially authorized investigation. Accession to the Rome Statute and the lodging of an <em>ad hoc</em> declaration directly with the Registrar do not automatically trigger investigations. Nor has Palestine made a 'self-referral'. Under the Rome Statute the Prosecutor can initiate an investigation into alleged crimes on her own initiative (<em>proprio motu</em>) without any input from the Palestinians. </p>

<p>It is not clear from the Consolidated Appropriations Act whether the word 'Palestinians' would cover the information provided to the Prosecutor by non-governmental organizations based in Palestine that could amount to support for such an investigation. Arguably it would not. The wording used in the bill would certainly not cover the information that will be provided to the Prosecutor by the <a href="http://paperchase/2014/08/un-names-experts-to-gaza-war-crimes-panel.php">UN Human Rights Council's fact-finding mission</a> when it presents its report in March. Moreover, US Secretary of State John Kerry can always invoke his powers under the Act to waive the funding cut by certifying to the Committees on Appropriations that withdrawing American aid to the PA is not in the national security interest of the US, and submit a report detailing how the waiver and the continuation of assistance will assist in furthering Middle East peace. (Aid from the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs pays for the training of and equipment for the presidential guard and the national security forces in the West Bank for example.)</p>

<p>The Consolidated Appropriations Act also provides for withholding aid to the Palestinians in the event that "the Palestinians obtain the same standing as member states or full membership as a state in the UN or any specialized agency thereof outside an agreement negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians." Long-standing Congressional <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/PLO-UN-legislation.pdf">legislation</a> [PDF] also requires the US to withhold American funding for any UN specialized agency that admits Palestine as a member. Unlike the Consolidated Appropriations Act this legislation has no provision for waiver. This is why the US <a href="http://theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/31/unesco-backs-palestinian-membership">stopped</a> funding the UNESCO after it admitted Palestine to membership in 2011. </p>

<p>Palestine will not be able to attain membership in the UN due to the US veto, and apart from UNESCO, Palestine has not recently applied for membership in any of the other <a href="http://un.org/Overview/uninbrief/institutions.shtml">specialized agencies</a>. Congressional legislation requiring the US to withdraw funding to any specialized agency that admits Palestine is, in any case, a double-edged sword. This is because there are specialized agencies like the International Atomic Energy Agency and the WIPO that are important to the US, and which the US would be loath to have to withhold funding from in the event that Palestine becomes a member.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that President Abbas is pursuing a high-risk strategy and one that could have detrimental consequences for the PA. According to a State Department <a href="http://state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/01/235695.htm">spokesperson</a> "Neither the steps that the Palestinians have taken, nor the actions the UN Secretariat has taken in performing the Secretary-General's functions as depositary for the Rome Statute, warrant the conclusion that the Palestinians have established a "state," or have the legal competences necessary to fulfill the requirements of the Rome Statute."</p>

<p>It is of course up to the ICC, not the US, to determine whether Palestine has the legal competences necessary to fulfill the requirements of the Rome Statute. Nonetheless it could take time for the court to make this determination, and it is by no means a foregone conclusion that the court would decide that Palestine is a state with the legal competences necessary to fulfill the requirements of the Rome Statute. In the interim Abbas would be wise to use the time that he has to shore up his authority, update Palestine's legal and political system, strengthen Palestinian institutions, heal the divisions with Hamas, and locate alternative sources of funding, in addition to any further moves at the UN.</p>

<p>Ultimately, President Abbas still favors negotiations to end the conflict but only if they have a reasonable prospect of success. As Khaled Elgindy at the Brookings Institution <a href="http://brookings.edu/blogs/markaz/posts/2015/01/07-abbas-icc-elgindy">argues</a>, his strategy is "not designed to bypass or preclude negotiations but to give the Palestinians some badly-needed leverage in a future negotiations process&#8212;albeit one that is built on an entirely different framework and structure." But in the event that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is re-elected on March 17, Abbas may feel that he has no alternative but to present another draft resolution at the UN Security Council calling for an end to Israel's occupation. He may even threaten to join the specialized agencies if the US vetoes the resolution. Given Washington's intransigence, Abbas might also consider appealing to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) by seeking an <a href="http://ecfr.eu/article/commentary_palestinian_options_at_the_united_nations_and_the_internation334">advisory opinion</a> on the legal consequences of a prolonged illegal occupation. An appeal to the ICJ could also help move things along at the ICC.</p>

		<title>Unknown Impact of Torture on 9/11 Justice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist B. Shaw Drake, <a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/">Georgetown University Law Center</a>, Class of 2015, discusses how the use of torture may be counterproductive to American military efforts...</j:header><strong>A</strong>s a Case Management Coordinator at the <a href="http://www.survivorsoftorture.org/">Bellevue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture</a>, I have seen first-hand the devastating impact of torture. My former clients from over 80 countries experienced the worst in humanity: treatment that broke down the contract to which we all prescribe as human beings, turning my clients into non-humans&#8212;enemies of the state&#8212;justifying their ill-treatment. Whether considered through a legal, religious or moral lens, most can agree that torture is never permissible and is abhorrent to the very foundation of mankind. However, a more complicated question persists: can the torturer fairly prosecute the tortured?</p>

<p>Numerous issues are playing out in the pre-trial hearing stage before Judge Col. James Pohl. Issues concerning violations of attorney-client privilege, an FBI investigation and female guards assigned to transport detainees continue to delay the 9/11 case. After a cost of $90,000 each way, to fly observers, media, linguists, prosecution and defense teams to Guantanamo Bay, the scheduled December hearings were canceled. Consistent estimates among defense counsel and other officials put the beginning of the actual trial well into 2018, some 17 years after the occurrence of the charged crimes. While the adage that "justice delayed is justice denied" may ring true for victims' families, torture will likely pose the greatest barrier to legitimate justice in the case of the 9/11 five. </p>

<p>Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak bin Attash, Ramzi bin al Shaibah, Ammar al-Baluchi and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi have been charged with crimes relating to 9/11, for which they could be sentenced to death. The Executive Summary of the Senate Intelligence Committee's Torture Report details gruesome torture suffered by these defendants. Several were forced to stay awake for days, standing for most of the time, including Walid bin Attash, who has one leg and was hung from his wrists for hours. Alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was water boarded so many times he began to signal interrogators during the water boarding, showing he knew exactly how long the torture should last. Other deeply disturbing treatment included "rectal rehydration," suffered by both Mohammed and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, who now sits on a pillow in court due to "an anal fissure and symptomatic rectal prolapse" resulting from his past torture. Defense counsel James Harrington, representing Ramzi bin al Shaibah, strongly asserts that the Executive Summary of the Torture Report is just the "tip of the iceberg." Cheryl Bormann, representing Walid bin Attash, is barred by classification rules from revealing all that was done to her client during his years in secret prisons, but also suggests that the released summary of the Torture Report only scratches the surface. </p>

<p>These and other defense counsel have strongly questioned the legitimacy of the Military Commission from the beginning but remain involved to defend the principles of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/overview">US Constitution</a> they believe should be provided, even to alleged 9/11 masterminds. The revelations of extensive torture further tests the legitimacy of the proceedings and provides the defense with further support for challenges they expect to go all the way to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The 9/11 five trial is poised for months or even years of legal battles over the disclosure, value and credibility of evidence received from defendants who were subject to years of unspeakable torture. Ultimately a panel of high-ranking military service members, the equivalent of a civilian jury, will have to decide whether guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and administration of the death penalty can be carried out in a case likely to rely to some extent on information obtained through torture. </p>

<p>Chief Prosecutor General Martins has stated he will put on a case against the 9/11 five without using any classified information. General Martins also asserts that no statements assessed to be involuntarily will be used, as prohibited by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/948a">Military Commissions Act of 2009</a>. Martins also argues the release of information in the Senate's Torture Report will further accelerate the ability of the prosecution to turn over previously classified information to the defense regarding the Rendition, Detention and Interrogation (RDI) Program. It remains to be seen what evidence will be presented against each of the five defendants. Defense counsel argues that the government lacks independent and credibly obtained evidence and that a trial can simply not be fairly carried out against the tortured by the torturers. </p>

<p>The 9/11 trial is charting new ground. Nuremburg was about prosecuting torturers for crimes against humanity; not prosecuting the tortured. These new circumstances raise questions poised to reach the Supreme Court. What remedy is appropriate for torture carried out against the 9/11 five? Can evidence obtained during or following torture be admitted in the Military Commission system? As many call for indictments against those responsible for the governments torture program, the question of legitimate justice for 9/11 may be a more likely consequence for State-sanctioned torture. </p>

<p>A recent article by a 9/11 victim family member argued that the Senate Intelligence Committee's Torture Report inappropriately turned "the enemies into victims," betraying the true victims of 9/11. I would however assert that admitting and dealing with the fact that the alleged 9/11 conspirators were victims of State-sanctioned torture does not detract from the tragedy suffered by those on 9/11. In seeking justice for 9/11 through the current Military Commission, the questions of defining the defendants as victims of torture is likely less legally significant as the difficult legal questions surrounding the use of torture induced evidence.    </p>

<p>In my opinion, our government undermined the "war on terror" the moment when it abandoned American values and justified the use of torture against our enemies. Now, faced with seeking justice for the families of the most appalling act of violence ever carried out on American soil, our nation is faced with the consequences of its actions. In the end, the trial against the 9/11 five may be less about guilt or innocence or life or death and more about the repulsive reality of the actions of our nation in its darkest hour. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.cuny.edu/faculty/directory/borgmann.html">Caitlin Borgmann</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/index.html">City University of New York School of Law</a>, discusses recent circuit court decisions addressing state abortion laws and predicts that one of the decisions may reach the US Supreme Court...</p><strong>F</strong>ederal Courts of Appeals have recently addressed two important abortion cases, either of which could end up before US Supreme Court. Last week, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-on-texas-abortion-laws.php">heard</a> oral arguments on the merits of a Texas law that requires abortion facilities to meet hospital-like building and construction standards. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued a <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/141150.P.pdf">decision</a> [PDF] in late December striking down a <a href="http://ncleg.net/Sessions/2011/Bills/House/PDF/H854v1.pdf">North Carolina pre-abortion ultrasound law</a> that requires abortion providers to perform a sonogram before an abortion and to display and describe it to the woman. Each case is important for abortion rights in different ways, but a common theme the cases raise is the question of abortion exceptionalism: whether courts should treat abortion as an exceptional case when states purport to regulate it for health and safety reasons (in the Texas case) or when state restrictions encroach on the right against compelled speech (in the North Carolina case)?</p>

<p>The Texas <a href="http://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/id/870667">law</a> at issue in the Fifth Circuit case demands that abortion clinics meet the building and construction requirements of ambulatory surgical centers. It is one of a series of measures Texas and other states have enacted that target abortion providers and facilities with special regulations. These laws do not purport to promote the state's interest in embryonic or fetal life (unlike a waiting period law, for example). At the same time they do not simply treat abortion like any other medical procedure. Rather they impose burdensome restrictions that do not apply to other medical procedures of comparable or even greater risk. It is clear that their true goal is to force clinics to shut down. In fact since Texas's hospital admitting privileges requirement went into effect, about half of the state's clinics have closed.  </p>

<p>Under the 1992 Supreme Court decision <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>, a state can single out abortion for special regulation in order to promote its preference for childbirth. But Texas's law does not purport to do that. The state claims it wants to make abortion safer, not harder to get. The question thus arises whether states should be allowed to target abortion for special, burdensome regulations in the name of health and safety and, if so, why? If there is anything medically exceptional about abortion it is that it is extraordinarily safe. A first-trimester abortion, for example, carries a <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_induced_abortion.html">less than 0.05 percent risk</a> of major complications that might need hospital care. However vigorously Texas may assert that it aims to promote women's health, it is clearly treating abortion differently than other medical procedures and not based on any evidence that stricter regulation is needed. The judges at last week's oral argument directed some tough questions to Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell during oral arguments expressing skepticism about the state's safety rationale. Such judicial skepticism of&#8212;not deference to&#8212;the states' rationale for these laws is warranted.  </p>

<p>Thus far however the Fifth Circuit has generally recognized states' power to impose burdensome regulations on abortion in the name of women's safety. Except in the case of <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/mississippi-appeals-abortion-law-ruling.php">Mississippi's admitting privileges law,</a> which would have shut down the state's last remaining clinic, the Fifth Circuit has held that such abortion regulations do not impose an undue burden even when&#8212;as in Texas&#8212;they prompt a wave of clinic closures. In the case now pending before the Fifth Circuit, a different panel of judges previously ruled that the plaintiffs were unlikely to prevail in their undue burden challenge. Other courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14583084829032626521">have been more doubtful</a> of states' attempts to subject abortion to special regulations that do not apply to comparable procedures. These courts have seemed to recognize that the health justification is a subterfuge, hiding an illicit motive to hinder women's access to abortion. This developing conflict in how courts of appeals are analyzing these laws is one the Supreme Court will likely feel compelled to resolve. If it does, the court should call upon states that purport to regulate abortion in order to protect women's health to justify those regulations, given that the laws' most glaring effect is to make abortion not safer but less accessible.</p>

<p>North Carolina's pre-abortion ultrasound requirement, recently invalidated by the Fourth Circuit, raises a different issue about abortion exceptionalism. Plaintiff abortion providers challenged the law not under the undue burden standard but as a violation of the <a href="http://law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> right against compelled speech. The question here is whether such challenges to abortion restrictions should be treated differently than other compelled speech claims. This is a point of disagreement between the Fourth and Fifth Circuits, a difference that again increases the likelihood of Supreme Court review.</p>

<p>North Carolina's law requires abortion providers to perform an ultrasound, display it, and describe the image in detail to women seeking abortions. Unlike the Texas regulation, North Carolina's law was openly enacted to further the state's interest in discouraging abortion. The Fourth Circuit panel found that the law unconstitutionally required "quintessential compelled speech" that is "ideological in intent and in kind." The court applied intermediate scrutiny to the law because it considered it a "content-based regulation of a medical professional's speech." Importantly the court declined to treat the plaintiffs' claim differently because the law at issue was an abortion regulation: <blockquote>The fact that a regulation does not impose an undue burden on a woman . . . does not answer the question of whether it imposes an impermissible burden on the physician under the First Amendment.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>In considering a Texas ultrasound mandate nearly identical to North Carolina's, the Fifth Circuit took a very different approach and upheld the Texas law. The court effectively merged its analysis of abortion providers' compelled speech claims with the undue burden standard, which addresses women's access to abortion. This was true even though the plaintiffs did not challenge the ultrasound requirement as imposing an undue burden. Refusing to recognize the plaintiffs' First Amendment claim as distinct, the court noted <blockquote>[I]f [the law] would not violate the woman's privacy right under the [<em>Planned Parenthood v.] Casey</em> plurality opinion, then Appellees would, by means of their First Amendment claim, essentially trump the balance Casey [which established the undue burden standard] struck between women's rights and the states' prerogatives.</blockquote></p>

<p>The Fifth Circuit is not the first court to suggest that the undue burden standard occupies the field of constitutional claims whenever an abortion restriction is challenged. For example other lower courts have similarly interpreted the undue burden standard as displacing the analysis that would normally apply to bodily integrity or equal protection claims when those claims have been asserted against abortion restrictions. I have called this judicial move "undue burden preemption."  In contexts not involving abortion, the courts have traditionally recognized that challenges to state laws can implicate more than one constitutional provision and thereby call for different constitutional analyses. But in the abortion context courts applying undue burden preemption seem to view non-undue-burden claims with suspicion, as though plaintiffs are trying to gain an unfair advantage by avoiding the undue burden standard. If the Supreme Court takes up the pre-abortion ultrasound issue, it will face an important opportunity to affirm the Fourth Circuit's position that there is no reason to treat compelled speech challenges to abortion restrictions any differently than similar claims in other contexts.</p>

<p>One or both of these cases are likely to end up before the Supreme Court. If so, the court should clarify that, even under current abortion precedent, abortion exceptionalism is inappropriate in either case.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Pauline Wein, <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University Law School</a> Class of 2016, discusses why sex workers should be paid even though their work is illegal...</j:header><strong>S</strong>uppose your employer fails to pay you for work you have done. The US Department of Labor states that your employer owes you <a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/wages/backpay.htm">back pay</a> and that you can file suit for lost wages. Now suppose that you are sold for sex, you are forced to continue the work and your trafficker keeps everything that you have earned. Then he or she is arrested and convicted and is ordered by the court to pay you restitution&#8212;compensation for your losses. The <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/tip/laws/61124.htm">law</a> states that mandatory wages are due to you, but the courts may still deny you some or all of the total amount owed&#8212;even if you were forced, coerced or induced into the work&#8212;because your work is illegal and you are considered a criminal.  </p>

<p>In 2000, the US Department of State instituted the <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/tip/laws/61124.htm">Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act</a>, an Act that was meant to combat human trafficking, with special attention given to slavery, the sex trade and involuntary servitude. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1593">Section 1593</a> of the Act, which is entitled "Mandatory Restitution," states that "the court shall order restitution for any offense" committed against anti-trafficking laws. It further states that victims shall be compensated the full amount of their losses.  However, mandatory apparently no longer means mandatory.  </p>

<p>The Human Trafficking Pro Bono Legal Center and the law firm of William Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP recently co-published and released a <a href="http://www.htprobono.org/htprobono-mandatory-restitution-report-9-2014/">report</a> concerning criminal restitution obtained in federal prosecutions of human traffickers. The report summarized the results of a review of federal criminal human trafficking indictments brought between 2009 and 2012. The results revealed that courts failed to provide legally required criminal restitution to human trafficking victims in almost two-thirds of the cases. Restitution was only awarded to sex and labor trafficking victims in thirty-six percent of the 186 cases resulting in guilty pleas or guilty verdicts. Though sex trafficking in the US is far more lucrative than other forms of domestic human trafficking, the report also noted that victims of other types of forced labor in the US are more likely to receive higher restitutions than sex trafficking victims.  </p>

<p>But how is it possible that the courts can deny adequate compensation to sex trafficking victims&#8212;assuming that the courts award restitution at all&#8212;when the federal statute mandates compensation for the victims' losses?  </p>

<p>According to the report, it is the federal prosecutors who hold the proverbial ball in their courts. A key determinant of whether and how much the defendants are ordered by the courts to pay restitution to any human trafficking victims depends on how hard the prosecutors fight for monetary compensation&#8212;if they fight for it at all. The report also notes that prosecutors failed to request any compensation in nearly half of the trafficking indictments that were brought in the federal criminal courts over the four year span. When compensation was requested, the <a href="http://www.htprobono.org">average court order</a> in sex trafficking cases only awarded to victims about $46,000, which was much lower than the $214,000 obtained in forced labor cases.  </p>

<p>But why the vast difference? It is likely that the facts, which surrounded each situation, along with the illegality of the activities involved with the sex trafficking cases in particular, were factors that influenced the prosecutors' decisions&#8212;even when the victims were forced, or induced, in situations concerning child sex trafficking victims.  Though restitution is mandatory and would help to deter and punish traffickers and make their victims whole, the disconnect between the illegal work and the statutory restitution requirement makes restitution requests difficult for prosecutors to defend and gives ample grounds upon which defense attorneys may object.  </p>

<p>With the <a href="http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000772">exception</a> of eleven rural counties in Nevada, prostitution is illegal in the US. Thus, the defense attorney may say, if a person voluntarily enters into the sex industry, he or she is considered a criminal and the work is illegal. Whatever their losses, whether adults or children, whether they are forced, coerced, threatened or entered the industry willingly, defense attorneys often argue that sex workers should not be compensated for their ill-gotten gains.  </p>

<p>But suppose that restitution is ordered by the courts. The defense attorney may return the proverbial ball back to the prosecutor with a couple of important questions in mind: how can the courts measure the value of illegal work and from where would the compensation come?  </p>

<p>The physical, emotional and economic damages that human trafficking victims experience can be difficult to measure in terms of monetary awards. The value of sex services is also much greater than what one earns working for minimum wage, but again, the work is illegal. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 thus provides a formula to calculate the mandatory restitution and counter the effects of being trafficked. The formula is derived from the <a href="http://www.doa.louisiana.gov/ohr/employ_laws/flsa.htm">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> (FLSA) and requires that awards in sex trafficking cases must include whichever is greater: the value of the work under the FLSA or the value to the defendant of the victim's forced or induced services. Section 1593 requires that the recovery must come from the defendant, so the defense would have to present a compelling reason to successfully argue against the order.  </p>

<p>At this point in the debate of whether sex trafficking victims should be awarded back wages, as is guaranteed under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-8">FLSA</a>, the tax payer should not readily fear any out-of-pocket payments in order to make the sex worker whole again. Human trafficking in general has become the <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2012-01-22-us-human-trafficking_N.htm">second fastest criminal industry</a>&#8212;just behind drug trafficking&#8212;and according to the restitution report, sex trafficking is much more prevalent and profitable than other forms of trafficking. Because pimps and traffickers often force sex workers to give up their earnings, prosecutors should have a storehouse from which they may have <a href="http://www.aequitasresource.org/Assisting-Human-Trafficking-Victims-with-Return-of-Property-and-Restitution.pdf">money or property seized</a> [PDF] and applied toward restitution to the victim. Stripping the defendant of their ill-gotten gains would be an effective way to help make the victims whole and give them an opportunity to leave the industry behind.  </p>

<p>But why should the average citizen advocate to pay sex workers compensation for their losses? After all, their work is still illegal, and many citizens working in <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/linkedin-settles-over-wage-violations-1407182441">legitimate jobs</a> experience wage violations and are due payment for their services.  </p>

<p>Suppose a person is laid off and needs some quick income. Maybe the worker is a single mom who has bills to pay and kids to feed. Or the person is a college graduate or law student looking to pay off his or her loans. Maybe someone's adult child is offered an alluring work opportunity across the country and neglects to check out all of the details. What if the worker is you, or worse? What if it is your under-aged child who has been kidnapped and enslaved in the sex industry?  </p>

<p>You are desperate to get your child back and make the trafficker pay. Maybe you are ready to quit your own work, but your trafficker forces you to keep working, threatens you or your family and demands all of your past and future income. Arresting and convicting the traffickers would free you and your child from the bonds of sexual slavery. The law states that the traffickers must pay, but the courts declare you and your child will not be compensated because the work was illegal. How will your bills get paid? How will you feed your kids? How will your child be made whole again? From where will your back pay come?  </p>

<p>Remember, mandatory apparently no longer means mandatory.  </p>

		<title>An Unexceptional Aspect of President Obama&amp;apos;s Immigration Executive Actions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.widener.edu/Academics/Faculty/ProfilesHbg/FamilyJillE.aspx">Jill Family</a>, Widener University School of Law, discusses Obama's recent <a href="paperchase/2014/11/obama-announces-immigration-reforms.php">immigration executive actions</a> and the Obama administration's exercises of executive power...</p><strong>T</strong>he push and pull between President Obama and Congress over various issues often too quickly boils down to descriptions that pit the President and Congress in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/04/obama-2015-agenda-republican-congress-mitch-mcconnell/21255051/">battle</a>. A popular narrative is that because the President and Congress <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/another-year-of-executive-action-113963.html">can not work together</a>, President Obama increasingly has relied on <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/12/16/obama-presidential-memoranda-executive-orders/20191805/">exercises of executive power</a>, pushing the boundaries of what a president can or should do on his own. </p>

<p>On closer examination, not every issue raised by President Obama's use of executive power is novel to these times. For example, it turns out that at least one controversy related to President Obama's recent immigration executive actions is ordinary and common.</p>

<p>President Obama announced actions <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration/immigration-action">affecting immigration law</a> on November 20, 2014. His announcement covered a <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/special-reports/guide-immigration-accountability-executive-action">broad range of immigration initiatives</a>. Among other things, he proposed to establish the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction">Deferred Action for Parental Accountability</a> (DAPA) program, which will allow the parents of US citizen children and the parents of lawful permanent resident children (their children have green cards) to apply for deferred action. Deferred action is a promise not to deport for a certain period of time. It does not provide a legal immigration status, but it does reassure an individual that he or she is a low enforcement priority and that the government promises not to try to deport that person for a certain period of time.</p>

<p>Procedurally speaking, what exactly did President Obama do on that day in November? He did not issue any executive orders. He did issue two presidential memoranda, which address only two narrow issues of all of the changes he announced (improving the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/21/presidential-memorandum-modernizing-and-streamlining-us-immigrant-visa-s">efficiency of the immigration bureaucracy</a> and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/21/presidential-memorandum-creating-welcoming-communities-and-fully-integra">promoting the integration of immigrants</a>). The DAPA program is addressed in a policy memorandum.  </p>

<p>The actual document creating DAPA is a <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_deferred_action.pdf">memorandum</a> [PDF] from the Secretary of Homeland Security to other agency officials explaining what the Secretary of Homeland Security would like to see accomplished. In administrative law, such a memorandum is known as a "guidance document." Other terms often used include "sub regulatory rule" or "non-legislative rule."</p>

<p>Agency guidance documents are used heavily throughout the executive branch and are common to administrative law. In administrative law, the term "rule" is used very broadly to include both legislative and non-legislative rules. Legislative rules are legally binding while non-legislative rules are not. A legislative rule must follow either the formal or informal rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Informal rulemaking is more common: the executive branch agency places notice of a proposed rule in the Federal Register, allows for an opportunity for the public to comment and then considers those comments and publishes a final rule.  </p>

<p>The APA allows for an exception to the informal rulemaking requirements for guidance documents. These non-legislative rules are not subject to the notice and comment requirements of the APA, but as a consequence of the procedural shortcut, they are not legally binding on the public. That means that a regulated party may argue that a different rule, other than the one in the guidance document, should apply in any enforcement proceeding.</p>

<p>All types of federal agencies use non-legislative rules. Non-legislative rules are the workhorse of the executive branch.  Guidance documents allow an agency to move more quickly, and to communicate more frequently with regulated parties.  A policy memorandum such as the memo announcing the DAPA program expresses an agency's enforcement plans.</p>

<p>Agency guidance documents are controversial, but that has nothing to do with President Obama or our current Congress. The use of non-legislative rules has been controversial for decades. There have been efforts to reform agency use of guidance documents since the 1960s.  <br />
 <br />
Agency guidance documents are controversial because when an agency uses a non-legislative rule to exercise the power Congress delegated to it, the concern is that the non-legislative rule binds practically without the procedural protections of notice and comment rule making. Even though a policy memorandum is not legally binding on the public, regulated parties probably will conform to what the memo says, because the agency is expressing its enforcement plans. The fear is that the rule has a legally binding effect despite that it is not the subject of notice and comment rulemaking.    </p>

<p>Federal courts, especially the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, commonly hear challenges to agency use of guidance documents. It is <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2009436">difficult to summarize</a> the DC Circuit's approach to uncovering policy statements that really are improperly formulated legislative rules. The court usually looks to the language of the policy statement and the agency's behavior. If the document does not use binding language and the agency does not treat the rule as binding, the rule may truly be non-legislative.</p>

<p>A group of states is <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/249082004/17-State-Lawsuit-Over-President-Obama-s-Immigration-Executive-Order">suing</a> to halt the implementation of President Obama's DAPA program. In addition to other challenges, such as an asserted violation of the <a href="http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43708.pdf">Take Care Clause</a> [PDF], the states are asserting a procedural APA violation. The states are arguing that instead of using a policy memorandum, the executive branch should have used notice and comment rulemaking to develop and announce the DAPA program. </p>

<p>This administrative law challenge to President Obama's immigration executive actions is nothing new. It is not unique to this president, to these times or to immigration law. This is a common type of administrative law challenge that raises well-worn legal arguments.</p>

<p>President Obama's recent executive actions do raise newsworthy issues and administrative law issues are important. But we should be careful not to paint with too broad of a brush when we describe the Obama administration's exercises of executive power. Not every executive action pushes boundaries or puts our country into uncomfortable territory.  </p>

		<title>Successions in Europe: What&#039;s New in 2015?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Angelique Devaux, French Qualified Attorney, discusses the newest occurrences of succession in Europe ...</p><strong>I</strong>t is just the beginning of 2015, and it is accompanied by a number of new reforms, new laws and new regulations that shall be implemented along with the New Year. 2015 shall be an important milestone into the ongoing process of European harmonization, as from August 17, 2015, Succession Conflicts of Law finally become harmonized with the entry <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:201:0107:0134:EN:PDF">EU Regulation No 650/2012</a>.</p>

                <p>The new European tool answers the outcome of a long process of reflection and negotiation that started with the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/councils/bx20040617/tampere_09_2002_en.pdf">European Council of Tampere</a> in 1999 in order to progressively establish an area of freedom, security and justice in Europe.</p>

                <p>And for good reason: the free movement of people within the European Union has created many cross-border situations such as owning estates in different countries. This European and/or international ownership entails the application of multiple inheritance laws and creates conflict of law rules for succession that are currently deeply heterogeneous between the European member states. Some member states apply the law of the nationality to govern a succession, in others the law where the person is a resident; some retain a principle of scission between movables and immovables, while others address the issue as a unity.</p>

                <p>The European succession regulation (hereafter "SR") puts an end to this legislative cacophony for the approximately <a href="http://www.ejtn.eu/PageFiles/6333/Brussels_IV_nutshell.pdf">450,000 cross-border successions</a> [PDF] that are settled in Europe each year.</p>

                <p>Except for Denmark, United Kingdom and Ireland, the new regulation provides a direct application in all SR member states and enjoys a universal character&#8212;the selected law can be the law of a member state, a third state or a non-member state. This means, for example, that an American citizen who owns a property in Europe could use these provisions. Therefore, the SR deserved to be known by any person holding estates in Europe, and to be comprehended by any international attorneys whose clients know cross-border elements in consistency with Europe.</p>

                <p>The text is primarily geared to avoid conflicts of laws of succession. It provides the principle of the unity of the succession as "a whole"&#8212;a single law is now applicable to all the deceased's estates irrespective of their nature and their location. The goal is to simplify and to unify the law of the succession as a natural consequence of globalization, rather than to solve complex connecting issues between domestic and international laws. Therefore, SR provisions become the new base of international estate planning in Europe. </p>

                <p>However, the scope of application is reduced to succession law only. Matrimonial property law, trust law and tax law are expressly excluded from the regulation. Accordingly, international lawyers shall continue to draw attention to these surrounding legal issues in order to provide global and adequate estate planning strategies.</p>

                <p>In the absence of any choice of law, the law of the state in which the deceased had his habitual residence at the time of death governs his succession as a whole. For instance, a Spaniard has his habitual residence in Italy; Italian law shall govern the law applicable to his succession, and shall be applied to all of his movable and immovable estates whether their locations are in Spain, Italy or Belgium.</p>

                <p>The major feature of the regulation is the introduction of a <em>professio juris</em> mechanism&#8212;jcurrently prohibited in several European jurisdictions, such as France, Belgium or Luxembourg&#8212;has the expression of "party autonomy." In other words, this means that the possibility for an individual to express the choice of law applicable to his or her future succession. The use of choice of law is an excellent tool for international estate planning by demonstrating a secured devolution of properties. Moreover, the person becomes Master of his estates' fate in an international context. However, in order to avoid any forum shopping temptation, the choice of law is confined to the law of the nationality the deceased possesses at the time of making the choice or at the time of death. </p>

                <p>Some practical aspects strengthen the implementation of this new mode of European harmonization. In order to ensure efficiency and rapidity to the settlement of a succession, SR imposes the principle of mutual recognition and enforcement of decisions in the area of succession between the member states. Thus, no special procedure or review as the substance is required for a decision to be recognized or enforced in another member state. The principal innovation of the SR is the creation of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/civil/family-matters/successions/index_en.htm">European Certificate of Succession</a> (ECS), a new cross-border instrument which ensures to prove the capacity and powers of heirs, surviving spouse, executor or administrator of the estates throughout the member states. For this purpose, a standard form of ECS has been recently published in the <a href="http://www.ojec.com/">Official Journal of the European Union</a> and is now available in 23 languages. In order to harmonize the different legal systems in the best possible ways, the regulation also calls member states to adapt unknown right in rem to the closest equivalent right in rem under the law of that other member state. For example, if French law governs the succession law, a legal equivalent concept of Anglo-American trusts shall have to be considered if such device is concerned, although French law does not know these trusts.</p>

                <p>One can easily consider that the SR solves the legal issues in matters of succession in Europe, based on a thorough harmonization of conflict of laws. But in fact, SR suffers from exceptions, which underline a renewal of conflict of laws and legal issues. For instance, the SR accepts the mechanism of <em>renvoi</em> when the law of a third state, including its private international rules, governs by default the succession and sends back to the law of a SR member state or another third state. This situation may happen when American law is the default governing law that sends back to the law of the situs applied to immovables according to the American succession conflict of laws. Therefore, depending on the situation, the unity of the applicable law is being weakened when the deceased has his habitual residence in a third state. </p>

                <p>Another controversial situation is the possibility to disregard a foreign law when its application in exceptional circumstances would be contrary to the public policy of a SR member state. The European public policy does not elicit much debate since all member states subscribe to the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0389:0403:en:PDF">Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a> and are parties to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a>; however there is still a pending discussion among scholars about the appreciation of domestic public policy since the domestic laws are not unified. For instance, the concept of forced heirship&#8212;unknown in common law jurisdictions&#8212;is ruled as a public policy in France, owns a constitutional value in Germany, but does not enjoy such strong protection in Spain. Therefore, the interpretation of these potential exceptions will be the Court of Justice of the European Union's heyday.</p>

                <p>Most importantly, the practice of succession law becomes deeply international with the implementation of such regulation. Lawyers become indirectly international lawyers, and the stage directors of the unification of legal systems despite themselves, under the cloak of an implementation of freedom of movement, legal security and justice. The issue is how best to play in the international lawyers' game at a time when there are 28 jurisdictions in Europe, and thus so many domestic laws and languages to know. This would entail in particular a stronger legal training in comparative and international law, and an alliance of skills between legal international professionals. </p>

                <p>To what extent would it be enough to ensure quality and legal security for individuals? There is a subsidiary issue of whether/how to balance between a&#8212;voluntary or involuntary&#8212;convergence of legal systems and the safeguarding of the individual legal culture of each member state. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[JURIST has retracted "Back-Alley Banking in China: the Next Financial Crisis" by Dr. Bashar Malkawi. The piece was originally published in our Academic Commentary section on 9 November 2013.

On 7 January 2015, we were advised that the piece was copied from another author's work. We investigated this claim and found it to be credible. As part of our investigation, we contacted Dr. Malkawi who acknowledged that the now-retracted piece was not a product of his own efforts.

Dr. Malkawi's piece drew several passages verbatim from the work of Professor Simin Gao, now of the Tsinghua University School of Law. Professor Gao addressed the issue of shadow banking in China in her SJD dissertation while a student at the University of Pennsylvania, and circulated a version of that paper for peer review after her dissertation was complete. The work published in JURIST was derived to an unacceptable degree from this circulated work.

JURIST began as an outlet for law professors to share their research, findings, opinions and theories. As such, we sincerely regret the false attribution of this unique work of academic effort to another author.

Any questions or comments about this retraction should be directed to Andrew Morgan, Executive Director, at <a href="mailto:executivedirector@jurist.org">executivedirector@jurist.org</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Ayanna Thomas, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2015, is the author of the tenth article in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law/academic-programs/student-journals/journal-civil-rights-and-economic-development">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Thomas discusses racial discrimination in the workplace...</j:header><br />
	<br />
A federal jury in New York shocked the nation in 2013 <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2488633450548458884&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">when it ruled</a> that a black male supervisor created a racially-hostile work environment when the supervisor called the employee the "n-word." Brandi Johnson, the plaintiff in that case, was awarded $280,000 in damages after the jury found in her favor. Many people were either confused by the ruling or viewed this case as a victory for victims of racial harassment in the workplace. They may say, "How can a black person find the 'n-word' offensive? It's used frequently in the black community, and it's even in rap lyrics." However, people may fail to realize the context of the word is significant. If your supervisor repeatedly told you to stop acting like an "n-word" in the workplace, you would probably feel degraded, hurt, disrespected and embarrassed just like Brandi Johnson, regardless of whether your supervisor is black or white. </p>

<p>To successfully establish a claim of racial harassment in the workplace under <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII</a>, the plaintiff must prove that a supervisor's behavior was sufficiently severe or pervasive in creating a racially-hostile work environment. This standard requires the jury to determine whether the harassment was objectively offensive (a reasonable person would find the harassment hostile and abusive) and subjectively offensive (the plaintiff perceived the working environment to be offensive). In interpreting this standard, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15103611360542350644&q=faragher+v.+boca+raton&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">the court determined</a> that jurors have to consider the "frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with the employee's work performance or terms and conditions of one's employment." </p>

<p>This legal standard should be changed for situations where a supervisor calls the employee the "n-word" for three reasons: (1) the "n-word," in itself, is offensive; (2) societal norms deem the word to be offensive and obscene and (3) courts have ruled in racial harassment cases that the "n-word" alone is offensive. Therefore, the process for jury determination should be simpler, and the jurors should have to decide only whether a supervisor called an employee the "n-word" to disparage or belittle him or her instead of having to consider if the word is objectively and subjectively offensive. </p>

<p><strong>The "N-Word," In Itself, Is Offensive</strong></p>

<p>The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines the "n-word" as "the most offensive and inflammatory racial slur in English." The word was used and is still used to intimidate African Americans and to point out their alleged moral and intellectual inferiority. Some may argue that the word is detached from its negative origin because black rap artists use the word in their rap lyrics to give the word a positive meaning. Hip-hop artists use the word to emphasize a self-empowered and self-determined African American identity. Even when blacks drop the "-er" from the word and replace those letters with an "-a," the word can be used in the context of expressing disapproval of someone's actions, and it can retain a negative meaning. Organizations, such as theNational Association of the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), are working to dispel the myth that the "n-word" does not have a negative meaning. <a href="http://www.naacp.org/press/entry/the--n--word-is-laid-to-rest-by-the-naacp">The NAACP held a funeral</a> and burial for the "n-word" in Detroit, Michigan to discourage the entertainment industry from using the "n-word" in videos, songs and stand-up routines. Nevertheless, jurors should not have to prove that the "n-word" is offensive since it is already offensive by definition. </p>

<p><strong>Societal Norms Deem the Word to Be Offensive and Obscene</strong><br />
	<br />
The use of the "n-word" is socially disapproved, and the use of the "n-word" in literature is also disapproved or banned. Mark Twain's <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> is the fourth most-banned book in schools because the "n-word" appears 219 times. In 1957, the New York City Board of Education removed the book from approved textbook lists for elementary and junior high school students. A new edition of the novel replaces the "n-word" with "slave" in an effort not to offend readers.</p>

<p>High-profile or influential individuals, such as actors, television hosts, professional athletes, singers, politicians and teachers, suffer severe consequences for using the "n-word." Jonathan Rhys Meyers, an actor on the television show, <em>The Tudors</em>, was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/jonathan-rhys-meyers-used_n_578619.html">banned</a> from a United Airlines flight when he used the "n-word" to berate an airline employee. Richie Incognito, a football player for the Miami Dolphins,was  <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000276100/article/richie-incognito-suspended-by-miami-dolphins">recently suspended indefinitely</a> for calling his teammate the "n-word" in a voicemail. Jerry Spivey, the District Attorney for North Carolina's Fifth Prosecutorial District, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8274362747539336966&q=in+re:+jerry+l.+spivey&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">was removed from office</a> after repeatedly calling an African-American man the "n-word" in a bar. In addition, an English teacher at a high school in Denver, Colorado was suspended for using the word during a class discussion. Since societal norms deem the isolated use of the "n-word" unacceptable, the word should be treated the same in the workplace.<br />
	<br />
<strong>Courts Rule That the "N-Word" is Offensive</strong> </p>

<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7954401626667812473&q=rodgers+v.+western-southern&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Courts say</a> the "n-word" does not belong in the workplace. Why? Because "no single act can more quickly alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment than the use of an unambiguously racial epithet such as 'nigger' by a supervisor in the presence of his subordinates." </p>

<p>These courts have captured the essence of societal norms, and a new standard would ensure that court rulings are consistent with societal norms. Courts should adopt a "discrimination <em>per se</em> standard" to rule in circumstances when a supervisor uses the "n-word" to belittle or disparage an employee in the workplace. Under this standard, the "n-word," in itself, would be considered to be offensive without considering other factors, such as the number of times a supervisor called his or her employee the word, the race of the supervisor or if the use of the word was objectively offensive. This standard is consistent with societal norms and previous court rulings because using the "n-word" in the media is morally disapproved and courts have ruled, without further analysis, that the word does not belong in the workplace. When jurors are presented with a use of the "n-word" case, they would only have to determine (1) if a supervisor used the "n-word" (2) in the workplace (3) to disparage or belittle an employee. If all three factors are met, the supervisor's employer would be liable for causing a racially-hostile work environment. The employer can assert affirmative defenses. For instance, the employer can show that (1) the employee consented to the use of the word with his supervisor; and (2) the "n-word" was not used to demean the employee because the employee misunderstood the context in which the word was used.</p>

<p>It is simply unprofessional and unacceptable for supervisors to call their employees the "n-word" to disparage or belittle them in the workplace. We can only imagine the number of Brandi Johnsons across the nation who are dealing with uncouth supervisors that drop the "n-word" to intimidate their employees. Hopefully the ruling will deter supervisors from using the "n-word" in the workplace, and plaintiffs will no longer have to convince a jury that it is offensive when a supervisor calls their employee the "n-word" to belittle him or her.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist John Mario Acosta Jr., <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University Law School</a> Class of 2016, discusses and evaluates several methods of force used by police ... </j:header><strong>T</strong>hroughout recent history police officers have been scrutinized for the things they do. Even today not much has changed. The evolution of technology has brought their job to every television in the US. Shows like COPS, Disorderly Conduct and many others shed light into the secret world of law enforcement.    </p>

<p>Today, the nation's police officers aim to be better trained and better equipped to deal with most any situation. Police academies throughout the world <a href="http://discoverpolicing.org/what_does_take/?fa=training_academy_life">educate</a> police officers in many different areas from writing reports to use of force. Law enforcement agencies around the world rely on this initial training in hiring officers. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.usccr.gov/">US Commission on Civil Rights</a> has stated that in diffusing situations, apprehending alleged criminals and protecting themselves and others officers are legally entitled to use appropriate means including force. Two questions remain: what is <a href="http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/default.asp?Item=1374">reasonable force</a> and what is <a href="http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/default.asp?Item=1374">excessive force</a>? Reasonable use of force is the amount of force necessary to arrest or gain suspect compliance. Excessive force is generally any force that is grossly disproportionate to arrest or gain suspect compliance. This type of force can be inspired by malice rather than mere carelessness or overzealousness and not only does it shock the conscience of the court but citizens alike.</p>

<p>Police academies educate new officers to use the amount of force necessary and reasonable to arrest a suspect. Today's academy instructors are current or former police officers with a wealth of knowledge and experience, who train officers to utilize the proper force in the performance of their duties. The different <a href="http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/Use-of-Force.pdf">levels of force</a> police officers have at their disposal are as follows: </p>

<p>Officer Presence: The mere appearance, demeanor and non-verbal communication that should create an atmosphere of compliance. </p>

<p>Verbal Commands: Clear and concise orders or commands given by the officer to the individual and should create an atmosphere of compliance. </p>

<p>Soft Hands: Control techniques that have a low probability of causing connective tissue damage, lacerations of the skin or broken bones and should create compliance. Some soft hand techniques are pressure points and arm bars.<br />
 <br />
Hard Hands: Control techniques that have a probability of causing connective tissue damage, lacerations to the skin, or broken bones and should create compliance. Some hard hand techniques include hand and leg strikes.  </p>

<p>Pepper Spray: A less lethal chemical compound that makes the eyes tearful. The active ingredient in pepper spray is an inflammatory agent that swells up the eyes and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract causing pain and temporary incapacitation.  </p>

<p>Taser: A less lethal weapon that fires barbs attached by wires to batteries causing temporary paralysis.</p>

<p>Asp Baton/Impact Weapon: A less lethal impact instrument. When expanded, ASP batons can be as short as 16 inches and as long as 31 inches. They are normally around 7 inches long when they are not expanded.</p>

<p> K-9 Units: Highly trained handlers and dogs. They follow both verbal and hand commands of their handler. </p>

<p>Presentation of Deadly Force: The moment when police officers draw their weapons and utilize it as a deterrent or compliance tool but do not discharge their weapon.</p>

<p>Deadly Force: The taking of an individual's life in the line of duty. A last resort. </p>

<p>According to a <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbse&sid=18">study</a> conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, contact between police and the public are about equal. About <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/press/pbtss11rpa11pr.cfm">51 percent</a> of police contacts occurred when persons requested police assistance and <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/press/pbtss11rpa11pr.cfm">49 percent</a> were police initiated, such as when police pulled over drivers during traffic stops or stopped persons in public places. Of that 49 percent, about <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/press/pbtss11rpa11pr.cfm">1 percent</a> of drivers pulled over in traffic stops had physical force used against them by police. Of these drivers <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/press/pbtss11rpa11pr.cfm">55 percent</a> believed the police behaved properly during the stop. </p>

<p>The two recent high profile uses of force incidents, the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrea-lyon/hammond-indiana-police-brutality-case_b_5976678.html">first</a> in Hammond, Indiana involving Jamal Jones and Hammond Police Department and the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29373115">second </a>in Columbia, South Carolina involving Levar Jones and former State Trooper Sean Groubert. Both incidents were captured on camera, but each had different outcomes. These incidents, like <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/police-reviews-in-deaths-scrutinized-1421016273">many others</a>, have refueled a burning fire that has never been extinguished: police officer use of force. </p>

<p>The encounter between Jamal and the Hammond police was due to a traffic infraction for both front seat occupants not having their seatbelts on. Police officers gave Jamal numerous opportunities to comply with their verbal commands. Currently this incident is under investigation to determine whether the police officers were justified. In my opinion, these officers utilized the amount of force necessary to gain compliance. In my experience, one of the most difficult situations to deal with as a police officer is a passive non-compliant individual. </p>

<p>Whereas looking at the South Carolina incident Levar Jones was compliant and non-aggressive. Once again this involved a traffic stop for a seatbelt violation. Levar was following the officer's commands to get his license when he was shot. Currently Sean Groubert, the State Trooper involved was fired and facing a charge of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature. This felony carries up to 20 years in prison. In my opinion this officer utilized unnecessary, unreasonable and excessive force. Levar did make an overt movement after being instructed to get his identification. In my knowledge, training and experience Levar's actions did not rise to the level of being shot. </p>

<p>When an officer is sued for using excessive force what will courts look at? In <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/490/386/">Graham v. Connor</a> the US Supreme Court held that all alleged excessive force cases would be analyzed on a case-by-case basis using the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment's </a>"objective reasonableness" standard rather than under a due standard process. The Supreme Court set forth three factors to consider:</p>

<p>1. The totality of the circumstances<br />
2. Force should be judged by a reasonable standard <br />
3. Whether a reasonable police officer with the same training and experience faced with a similar situation would do the same.  </p>

<p>Courts take into consideration that all law enforcement agencies have a policy that if a specific situation arises where the use of deadly force is authorized that the  police officer may shoot to stop the threat. However, the officers should not discharge their weapons to kill but rather stop and incapacitate the individual from completing a potentially deadly act.</p>

<p>Courts also recognize that officers aim for maximum effectiveness in stopping the suspect while creating minimal danger to innocent bystanders. Moreover, once the individual has been stopped the officer should render appropriate first aid when  possible. </p>

<p>What measures are in place once a police officer is involved in a use of force incident? The officer is typically placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. This investigation is conducted internally and sometimes externally, or both. Once the investigation is complete the case is typically presented to a grand jury to determines whether to indict the officer or not. This is the checks and balance system used to ensure the officer did not use excessive force. Once cleared the officer is placed back into active service, if not cleared then disciplinary proceedings will commence. These proceedings typically involve the officer's termination or resignation from the department.   </p>

<p>The public must understand that police officers make split second decisions but they are people and make mistakes.  Measures are already in place to ensure the force used was reasonable. </p>

<p>The common knee jerk reaction is to condemn the officer for his actions before seeing all the evidence. The criminal justice system is innocent until proven guilty. This includes police officers. </p>

<p>One way this growing epidemic could be eliminated is with better communication between police and citizens. For example by establishing a citizen review board comprised of members of the community, local judges, attorneys, police officers from other jurisdictions, etc. to give an informed decision on whether the force utilized was reasonable and to keep other citizens informed.  </p>

<p>Another step might be to establish a citizen's police academy. These academies would give local citizens a chance to interact with the police officers and learn aspects of the job they may not understand until placed in the role of a police officer.  </p>

<p>The overall goal is to bring police officers and the community together. Once citizens and police officers work to keep each other safe, both will better understand their roles. This produces a stronger, safer and more unified place to live.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Anjelica Violi, <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University Law School </a> Class of 2016, discusses the education of men and boys on female equality ...</j:header><strong>I</strong>n the last six months the UN has gained newfound attention with its strong <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/gender-equality">efforts </a>to perpetuate the education of males on female equality and human rights. This past September 2014 <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en">UN Women</a> officially launched the <a href="http://www.heforshe.org/">HeForShe</a> campaign with actress and UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/partnerships/goodwill-ambassadors/emma-watson">Emma Watson</a>, at the helm. HeForShe is a solidarity movement for gender equality that aims to engage men and boys to advocate and take action for achieving gender equality. The campaign seeks to have one billion men by July 2015 to become advocates for women around the world. UN Women seeks to engage global country offices to develop programs in support of gender equality, collaborate with government officers, men's organizations and schools to promote events and campaign within their respective communities. Through education of men and boys about gender equality the UN seeks to create role models who are willing to stand up for women.</p>

<p>While Emma Watson and the UN Women's HeForShe movement has been <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/xojane-/emma-watson-feminism_b_5884246.html">criticized</a> by many as focusing too much on women's rights instead of men's, another criticism is that the campaign promotes men to stand up for women as saviors rather than stand with them for basic human rights. The problem with this criticism is that it completely neglects the basic facts and focus of the campaign.</p>

<p>In a recent <em>Time</em> <a href="http://time.com/3432838/emma-watson-feminism-men-women/">article</a> this year, the author only criticizes Emma Watson (without even mentioning, let alone criticizing, the UN) for neglecting discrimination against men. The author discuses how problems affecting men and boys should be brought to light and how the campaign focuses on "First World problems." However, what the author and many others do not seem to realize is that this campaign seeks to create change in other countries aside from "First World countries" like the US and Britain where women have less rights and respect. To take the HeForShe campaign and criticize it for the work it truly aims to do is baffling. Perhaps the UN has something in the works for men's and boys' rights but in the meantime focusing on women in other countries around the world who are persecuted solely for being female is a worthy cause.</p>

<p>UN Women <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2013/7/post-2015-long-paper">seeks</a> to advocate for government implementation of national laws, policies and strategies in order to create equality for women globally. The keyword which many seem to overlook is global. While discrimination exists in various forms for various people the aim of this campaign is to focus on the more serious problem of discrimination and violence towards women. According to global reports, <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures">35 percent</a> of women globally have experienced physical or sexual violence, and <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures">70 percent</a> have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner. In the US, <a href="http://www.girlsleap.org/#!the-need/c1zgm">83 percent</a> of girls grades 8 through 11 have experienced sexual harassment in public schools. Furthermore women in urban areas are<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"> twice as likely </a>as men to experience violence, particularly in developing countries. </p>

<p>In a <em>Huffington Post</em> blog from earlier this year, the author <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/xojane-/emma-watson-feminism_b_5884246.html">argues</a> that instead of standing up for women, as the HeForShe movement implies men should instead be standing with women. While this is true, there are places in the world where some women might need that support and have men stand up for them and fight for their rights. Furthermore, the author suggests, "...there is nothing feminist about a campaign that reinforces a gender binary that is harmful to people whose gender identities don't fit into such tidy boxes." Unfortunately, this campaign does not focus exclusively on countries where many people might have the option of different "gender identities." For example, the well-known Pakistani activist for female education and the youngest Nobel Prize winner <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23241937">Malala Yousafzai</a> is from a part of the world where it is unacceptable to have different gender identities outside of society's norms. </p>

<p>What these and other writers do not understand is that in many countries women need to have men stand up for them because they cannot always stand up themselves. By educating men to advocate for women and respect women it makes it possible for women and men to be able to stand together side by side. More than <a href="http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58008.html">1 in 3</a> girls worldwide are married before age 15 and around <a href="http://data.unicef.org/child-protection/sexual-violence">120 million</a> girls have experienced forced intercourse or sexual acts. Over <a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGM-C_Report_7_15_Final_LR.pdf">133 million females</a> have experienced female genital mutilation (FGM), specifically in Africa and the Middle East and <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/lang--en/index.htm">around 4 million</a> females are forced into sexual exploitation through human trafficking around the world. If men do not stand up for these females when they stand up for themselves, who will?</p>

<p>Part of Emma Watson's <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/9/emma-watson-gender-equality-is-your-issue-too">work</a> with UN Women is to help clarify misconceptions of feminism and what it truly means. "I decided I was a feminist and this seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word. Apparently I am among the ranks of women whose expressions are seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, anti-men and, unattractive," stated Watson. "Why is the word such an uncomfortable one? I am from Britain and think it is right that as a woman I am paid the same as my male counterparts. I think it is right that I should be able to make decisions about my own body. I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policies and decision-making of my country. I think it is right that socially I am afforded the same respect as men. But sadly I can say that there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to receive these rights."</p>

<p>According to UN Women discrimination and inequality are at the root of violence against women. If women and men have not been able to question gender roles and beliefs they may be unaware of their rights or are unable to claim them. As Malala Yousafzai <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20754891,00.html">told</a> the world, "I said to myself, 'Malala, you must be brave. You must not be afraid of anyone. You are only trying to get an education&#8212;you are not committing a crime.' I would even tell [my attacker], 'I want education for your son and daughter.'" </p>

<p>UN Women supports prevention activities, research, advocacy, education, community involvement and legal and policy reforms in order to create an international impact. By working specifically with men and boys, UN Women seeks to create perpetual advocacy for ending or at least decreasing violence against women worldwide.</p>

<p>Raising awareness to end violence against women also requires changing the hearts and minds of those in government and the public. Societies need to implement education and understand respecting all humans both male and female. Governments must also recognize the importance of educating both genders on equality at local levels and national levels. Men need to be a vital part of the equation in order for there to be equal rights between men and women. Without men advocating for women there are many who may never experience equality in their lifetime.</p>

<p>Instead of criticizing a solidarity movement meant to generate positive change in the lives of women globally we could applaud those involved with UN Women and commend Emma Watson for her work in spreading change. Gender equality is not uniquely a women's issue; it is a human rights issue that affects everyone of every gender. If society continues to criticize campaigns created to invoke positive change for gender equality then we have not socially evolved as much as we thought we have in this twenty-first century. </p>

Varner, Diane Penneys Edelman and Leila Amineddoleh of <a href="http://culturalheritagelaw.org/">Lawyers' Committee for Cultural Heritage Preservation</a> respond to the piece by Walter Olson on Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and counter his assertion that the Act has the effect opposite to what Congress intended...</p><strong>R</strong>ecently JURIST Guest Columnist Walter Olson of the Cato Institute Center for Constitutional Studies <a href="/hotline/2014/11/walter-olson-nagrpa-burials.php">wrote</a> about the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-32">Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act</a>, or NAGPRA. In the article Mr. Olson claims that NAGPRA is one example of a law passed by Congress whose effect is the opposite of what Congress intended. Rather than "respecting the rights of the dead, the right to an undisturbed resting place" as articulated by the late Congressman Morris Udall in 1990 when NAGPRA passed the House of Representatives, according to Mr. Olson, NAGPRA "has come to the point of threatening to order that otherwise undisturbed graves from long ago be dug up."</p>

                <p>Mr. Olson was led to the above view as a result of a legal case that <a href="http://www.cwlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Jim-Thorpe-Documents.pdf">originated</a> [PDF] in the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania and was appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=814364494722378015&q">Thorpe v. Borough of Jim Thorpe</a>, the surviving sons of legendary athlete Jim Thorpe sued the Borough of Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania for failing to comply with the requirements of NAGPRA. In that case the court declared that NAGPRA (specifically, its provisions governing inventories and repatriation of Native American human remains and associated funerary objects in museum and federal agency holdings or collections) is applicable to the remains of Jim Thorpe, an enrolled member of the Sac and Fox Nation, that are presently interred in municipal land in the Borough of Jim Thorpe. According to the court's interpretation of NAGPRA, interred human remains are deemed to be "holdings or collections" and therefore the statute authorizes&#8212;even <em>requires</em>&#8212;that where human remains are in a grave controlled by an institution or a state or local government agency that receives federal funds, the human remains must be disinterred and transferred to a lineal descendant or culturally affiliated Indian tribe when requested. Thus according to the court, Native American graves <em>protection</em> occurs through disinterment or, in other words, we need to destroy graves in order to protect them.</p>

                <p>On appeal the Third Circuit <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/132446p.pdf">reversed</a> [PDF] the District Court, holding that "the Borough is not a 'museum' under NAGPRA for the purposes of Thorpe's burial." Concluding that it was "confronted with the unusual situation in which the literal application of NAGPRA will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intention of its drafters," the court felt it had to "look beyond the text of NAGPRA to identify the intentions of the drafters of the statute, and that intent must control our analysis."</p>

                <p>The Third Circuit reversed the District Court on the grounds that "Congress did not intend the result required by a literal application of the text of NAGPRA." The court did not find the law in the text of the statute.</p>

                <p>Reading and digesting the reasoning used by both courts to reach their opposite decisions in <span class="casename">Thorpe v. Borough of Jim Thorpe</span>, Mr. Olson cannot be blamed for asserting that few if any lawmakers had foreseen such a fact pattern in the original debate over NAGPRA. Still contrary to Mr. Olson's assertion, Congress <em>had</em> foreseen it. The text of NAGPRA <em>should</em> have been used to decide <span class="casename">Thorpe v. Borough of Jim Thorpe</span>. The courts were not looking in the right place.</p>

                <p>In NAGPRA, Congress included a provision stating that "[n]othing in this [Act] shall be construed to ... limit any procedural or substantive right which may otherwise be secured to individuals or Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations." Jim Thorpe, who died intestate in March 1953, was a California resident. At the time of his death, California law provided that the priority of right to control the disposition of his remains and the duty of interment devolved upon his surviving spouse, Patricia Thorpe. In May 1954 Patricia Thorpe entered into an agreement with the Boroughs of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania. The parties agreed on the terms and conditions for consolidating the Boroughs and renaming them the Borough of Jim Thorpe, and for the interment in Borough land of Jim Thorpe's remains.</p>

                <p>To apply NAGPRA to the buried remains of Jim Thorpe would limit the right of his surviving spouse, Patricia Thorpe, to control the disposition of his remains under California law. That outcome contradicts the text of NAGPRA.</p>

                <p>Perhaps one reason that Congress included limitations on applying NAGPRA was in order not to place the Act in tension with the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> of the US Constitution ("The powers not delegated to the US by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people"). The power to determine the priority of the right of custody of a corpse for the purpose of the disposition of the corpse (including burial) has traditionally been reserved to the states. Similarly the states traditionally have exercised authority over the disinterment of human remains that are buried on non-federal and non-tribal lands. Thus, the plaintiffs in <span class="casename">Thorpe v. Borough of Jim Thorpe</span> may ask that Jim Thorpe's remains be transferred to them, but they should be doing so before a Pennsylvania state court and not a federal one. For its part though, NAGPRA is the antithesis of a law that disrupts the physical repose of the dead by authorizing the disinterment of Native American burials.</p>

                <p>As 2014 came to a close, the remains of more than 180,000 Native American individuals had been listed in museum and federal agency inventories. More than 50,000 individuals had been included in Federal Register notices of inventory completion, which established the right of the Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations listed in the notices to receive control of those ancestors. In addition approximately $40 million had been awarded by the Secretary of the Interior to museums, Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations to assist with fulfilling the consultation, documentation and transfer requirements of NAGPRA.</p>

                <p>The NAGPRA compliance process is ongoing and, based on the annual reports published by the <a href="http://nps.gov/nagpra">National NAGPRA Program</a>, the progress has been profound. According to two NAGPRA representatives from for the Caddo Nation, "[w]ith the help of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act ... we have continued to not only claim and rename our past but also have asserted the identity of the Caddo as being the 'Real Chiefs' governing our history and culture." The NAGPRA coordinator for a museum adds, <blockquote>From the consultations and conversations that result from dealing with NAGPRA, museums have the potential of creating new kinds of relationships with Native American communities. When tribes see that museums are genuinely committed to NAGPRA ... new friendships and partnerships can develop.</blockquote></p>

                <p>NAGPRA is not an example of a law whose effect is the opposite of what Congress intended. Rather Congress may proudly claim, in the words of Morris Udall, "[i]n the larger scope of history, this is a very small thing. In the smaller scope of conscience, it may be the biggest thing we have ever done."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/about/contact/singleton.php?&singleton=true&cruz_id=yykwan">Yvonne Y. Kwan</a>, doctoral candidate of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, discusses the politics surrounding the Khmer Rouge genocide tribunals ...</j:header><strong>P</strong>olitical narratives of pain and suffering are most often constructed by those who sanction the production and circulation of those narratives. Such critiques of history are particularly salient and important when considering how long it has taken for the UN and Cambodia <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/cambodia-khmer-rouge-tribunal-restarts-genocide-hearings.php">to identify and try Khmer Rouge</a> leaders for their crimes against humanity, genocide and autogenocide. Genocide refers to the collective experience that resulted from the killing of people who belonged to a specific national, ethnic, racial or religious group (e.g., Cham and Khmer Krom) while autogenocide refers to the collective experience that resulted from the killing of Cambodian-identified people. The lack of international recognition and justice, despite the prevalence of continued suffering among survivors, is one of the many ways in which violent histories have been silenced. </p>

<p>By denying an outlet for survivors to seek justice, the painful realities experienced by the Cambodian people and the Cambodian diaspora remain isolated and suppressed. Until recently, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8350313.stm">no accounts of the Khmer Rouge genocide were included</a> in national textbooks approved by the Cambodian Ministry of Education. The uncooperative nature of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP)&#8212;which is run by long-time Prime Minister <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/meghabahree/2014/11/19/whose-rights-is-the-hun-sen-government-in-cambodia-protecting/">Hun Sen</a>, a former Khmer Rouge soldier that has been accused of not serving or protecting the interests of the Cambodian electorate&#8212;and the inability of the UN to create an international criminal court to try former Khmer Rouge leaders in a timely manner show how both the Cambodian government and Western nations have had certain investments in keeping the truths about the Khmer Rouge genocide hidden. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/316738/Khmer-Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> was overthrown by the Vietnamese on January 7, 1979. However, this genocidal period was followed by an extensive civil war that lasted until 1998&#8212;when Pol Pot, leader of the Khmer Rouge, passed away and when the official Khmer Rouge political system and military structures were dismantled. During the civil war, extensive suffering by civilians continued. Those realities were exacerbated by the complicity of the Western world, which allowed the Khmer Rouge to continue to hold its seat in the UN until 1982, without any vocal objections raised by representatives. Because the American military aided Khmer Rouge guerrillas to fight against the Vietnamese who controlled and occupied Cambodia after 1979, the US had actually led most of the Western world to support the exiled Khmer Rouge over the Vietnamese-sponsored government of Cambodia. The US had hoped to use Cambodia to offset the balance of power in Asia, especially after having lost the Vietnam War just a few years earlier. <br />
<br />
Issues of international recognition of the Khmer Rouge war crimes and the necessary steps that needed to be taken to hold Khmer Rouge leaders accountable continued to be overlooked even when Cambodian independence from Vietnam was reinstituted. At the Paris Peace Accords of 1991, human rights concerns were raised in <a href="http://www.cambodia.org/facts/?page=1991+Paris+Peace+Agreements">Article 15</a>, but they only stated that the Cambodian government must ensure that the Khmer Rouge does not return and that human rights conditions are monitored. Again, there was no mention of creating an international tribunal that would invoke the Genocide or Geneva Conventions on behalf of victims. </p>

<p>Even though the Cambodian government initiated a request for assistance from the UN to try Khmer Rouge leaders for their crimes against humanity in 1997, it was used primarily as a ruse to detract from the political coup that Hun Sen was planning against Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the FUNCINPEC opposition party. Ever since, Hun Sen and the CPP has resisted the establishment of an international criminal court. In a public speech in March 2009, Hun Sen openly said that he would rather the courts run out of money and fail than to pursue additional cases against former Khmer Rouge leaders, many of whom, including Hun Sen, continue to serve as high-ranking officials in the CPP.</p>

<p>Because of the acrimonious debates and impasses instigated by the Cambodian government, it took almost seven years for the UN to agree to a hybrid tribunal. The <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/legal-documents/KR_Law_as_amended_27_Oct_2004_Eng.pdf">Law on the Establishment of Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia for the Prosecution of Crimes Committed During the Period of Democratic Kampuchea</a> was signed into effect on June 6, 2003. Ultimately, Hun Sen agreed to a hybrid tribunal that would prioritize the Cambodian section of the court, allowing for a Cambodian judge majority. Also, <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/about-eccc/introduction">as stated by the United Nations</a>, "[t]he government of Cambodia insisted that, for the sake of the Cambodian people, the trial must be held in Cambodia using Cambodian staff and judges together with foreign personnel." And according to the law, the ECCC "can only prosecute two categories of alleged perpetrators for alleged crimes committed between April 17, 1975 and January 6, 1979: 1) Senior leaders of Democratic Kampuchea; and 2) those believed to be most responsible for grave violations of national and international law." So far, the tribunal has only considered four main cases: Case 001, 002, 003 and 004. More than ten years after the establishment of the ECCC and more than $200 million in donations later, it has only handed out two verdicts: one against Kaing Guek Eav, alias "Duch," in Case 001 and one against Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in Case 002/01. Case 002/02 is currently being considered, and persons of interests for Case 003 and 004 have not been officially released.</p>

<p>In 2010, Duch was found guilty of crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, especially as related to his involvement in Security Office 21 (S-21) Tuol Sleng Detention Center. Initially, Duch was slated to only serve nineteen years. His sentence was reduced by five years for being illegally detained in military court and by eleven years for that which he served while in detention. But after numerous appeals and public outrage, in February 2012, the "Supreme Court Chamber affirmed Duch's conviction and sentenced him to life imprisonment." The courts also clarified the charges and entered separate convictions for "the crimes against humanity of persecution, extermination (encompassing murder), enslavement, imprisonment, torture and other inhumane acts." </p>

<p>In Case 002, there were four initial defendants: Khieu Samphan, the former nominal head of state; Noun Chea, also known as "Brother Number Two" and the movement's former ideologue; Ieng Sary, the former foreign minister; and Ieng Thirith, Ieng Sary's wife and the former minister of social affairs. But on August 7, 2014, only two judgments for Case 002/01 were handed down because because Ieng Sary passed away in March 2013, and his wife, Ieng Thirith was found unfit for trial because of her degraded mental state from Alzheimer's Disease. Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment. On December 29, 2014, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan's defense lawyers filed for an appeal against their judgments. The 270-page appeal focuses less on the innocence of the defendants and more on the legal proceedings of the hybrid court system (e.g., definitions of inhumane acts, timelines of forced population movements, political interference and witness questioning). With charges of corruption, graft and government bias and interference, the futures of Case 003 and 004 remain fraught with uncertainty. <br />
<br />
Because the ECCC has only made two judgments more than thirty-five years after the fall of the Khmer Rouge, many question the efficacy of the joint tribunal. While most survivors were relieved to have finally sought some sort of recognition and justice, those who were found guilty were already in their 80s and will likely die soon from old age. After the judgments of Case 002/01 were handed down, instead of celebrating the successes of having sought justice, many Cambodian people mourned the losses of opportunities to try more than just three leaders of the Khmer Rouge. With a record of corruption, a lack of funding and international judge resignation, it is unsure how long the ECCC will continue. The multiple contradictions of this hybrid tribunal continue to raise questions about the purpose of the courts, the motives of the CPP and the international community's lack of timely consideration and investment in trying Khmer Rouge leaders.</p>

		<title>The Limits of Inviolability: UN Facilities During Armed Conflict</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.emory.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/faculty-profiles/blank-profile.html">Laurie Blank</a>, of <a href="http://law.emory.edu/">Emory University School of Law</a>, discusses the protection of UN premises during armed conflict and argues that, while critically important, such inviolability cannot be absolute in light of the fundamental purposes of the law of armed conflict...</p><strong>T</strong>he nature of conflict fought unceasingly in civilian areas places a constant strain on organizations dedicated to civilian protection and humanitarian assistance during conflict. In ideal circumstances, their personnel and facilities remain immune from the violence, allowing them to carry out their essential tasks of feeding, sheltering, educating and providing medical care.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the reality bears little resemblance to this ideal. When terrorists and armed groups use protected sites and facilities as headquarters, weapons storage and launch sites, what should be important immunity for protected sites becomes unwarranted and unjustified immunity for fighters violating the fundamental tenets of the law of war. Understanding the parameters&#8212;and limits&#8212;of inviolability for protected sites is therefore crucial to applying the law effectively to protect civilians and ensure lawful military operations.</p>

<p>During the 2014 <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international/211931-getting-the-law-right-on-the-israel-hamas-conflict">Israel-Hamas conflict</a> for example, Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza regularly and repeatedly launched rockets and mortars from within or immediately next to UN facilities&#8212;whether schools, medical clinics or other locations. Multiple times, rockets were found in such facilities, and militants used the area in or around such facilities in the course of tactical maneuvers and attacks. </p>

<p>On several occasions <a href="http://theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/un-dragged-conflict-israel-hamas-gaza">Israeli airstrikes</a> or artillery fire targeting these militants and rocket launchers near or in these facilities&#8212;so as to stop attacks on Israeli civilians or Israeli forces under fire in Gaza, and destroy Hamas' capability to launch more attacks&#8212;tragically killed or wounded men, women and children seeking shelter from the hostilities raging around them.  </p>

<p>In condemning these Israeli attacks, top officials at the UN Relief and Works Agency in Gaza and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/un-urges-respect-of-its-gaza-facilities/1969251.html">stated</a> emphatically that UN facilities are inviolable and any shelling of UN schools is "<a href="http://aworldatschool.org/news/entry/ban-ki-moon-visits-bombed-Gaza-school">absolutely unacceptable</a>."  Five years earlier a UN Board of Inquiry relied on the same notion of <a href="http://www.innercitypress.com/banrep1gaza.pdf">absolute inviolability</a> [PDF] when examining responsibility for damage resulting from attacks near or within UN schools during <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/israel-asks-un-rights-committee-to-cease-probe-into-2008-2009-gaza-conflict.php">Operation Cast Lead</a>. </p>

<p>UN facilities around the world enjoy protections enshrined in the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ethics/pdf/convention.pdf">1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the UN</a> [PDF]. In particular, Article 3 of the Convention affirms that "the premises of the United Nations shall be inviolable." This protection helps to enable the UN&#8212;and its many components, agencies and other offshoots&#8212;to carry out the critical work of protecting, feeding and supporting individuals and communities around the world in tense and violent situations. </p>

<p>Although essential, inviolability cannot be absolute however. The idea of absolute immunity runs counter to the very framework of the law of war, which balances the protection for certain sites (such as hospitals or religious and cultural property) with the legitimate needs of military operations in the face of fighters abusing that protection. More specifically, absolute immunity incentivizes such abuse by granting protection to those misusing protected sites&#8212;ultimately harming only the civilians in desperate need of the UN and other organizations' services.   </p>

<p>There is little doubt that the overall requirement of inviolability of UN premises helps to protect civilians who have sought shelter at such locations. As with all protected sites, the law mandates that such protection is only lost if the site is used for acts harmful to the enemy; as with all conduct during wartime, the law requires that any attacks comport with the fundamental <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1596214">principles</a> of distinction, proportionality and precautions.</p>

<p>Absolute inviolability, however, would mean that no matter how much one side abuses such protections for their own military and propaganda purposes, the other side can never take any action to counter that threat. As a result, this absolute immunity thoroughly upends the law of war's delicate balance between military necessity and humanity; between the military objective of defeating the enemy and ending or deterring the threat it poses, and the humanitarian imperatives of protecting innocent civilians from the hazards and destruction of war.  </p>

<p>Imagine this same principle of "absolute immunity" applied across the board to protections in armed conflict. Civilians who pick up arms and engage directly in hostilities would remain immune from attack&#8212;meaning that soldiers would be unable to defend themselves against civilians fighting on behalf of enemy forces, not even as a basic act of self-defense. Militants could turn hospitals, mosques, ambulances and churches into headquarters, rocket launch sites and tactical transportation with the shield of absolute immunity preventing opposing forces from taking any action to deter or repel their attacks. And soldiers facing attack from forces tucked into UN school courtyards would be left with no recourse to return fire or even cover their withdrawal from the area. Such rules would have no force because they would make no sense&#8212;and civilians would bear the brunt of war without rules, because civilians are the ones the law seeks and was designed to protect.</p>

<p>But "absolute inviolability" also creates a second, more insidious danger. As demonstrated by the commentary during the 2014 conflict in Gaza, attacks against Hamas and other militants near or at (and therefore misusing) UN premises triggered criticism, creating incentives for the militants to induce more such attacks with persistent abuse of UN premises. When parties gain both an operational advantage and a propaganda windfall for using protected sites for military operations, every UN school will become a <a href="http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2753176/Hamas-DID-use-schools-hospitals-Gaza-Strip-human-shields-launch-rocket-attacks-Israel-admits-says-mistake.html">launch site</a>, every mosque a storage facility and every hospital a command post.  </p>

<p>Beyond the tactical advantage parties would gain through the abuse of critical legal protections, the misuse of UN and other specially protected sites has a broader and more problematic, strategic purpose. After drawing attacks near or on erstwhile protected sites&#8212;notwithstanding the fact that they have lost their protection because of misuse and abuse of legal protections&#8212;militants use the resulting civilian deaths as a strategic tool to accuse the attacking party of war crimes, subject it to international criticism, delegitimize its military operations and strategic imperatives and potentially even cause it to withdraw its forces. Granting absolute immunity, regardless of abuse, to certain facilities or sites, strongly incentivizes one party's forces to simply surround themselves with civilians in every conceivable location and circumstance, effectively guaranteeing greater civilian casualties and increased civilian suffering. Civilians thus become merely a pawn for tactical, strategic and political advantage&#8212;in direct contravention of the obligation for all parties to conflict to take constant care to spare civilians, the civilian population and civilian objects from the dangers of military operations.</p>

<p>Inviolability of UN premises is critically important and all sides must respect it at all times. But absolute respect for inviolability is different from absolute inviolability. Understanding the limits of that inviolability however is just as essential to the protection of civilians and the efficient and effective workings of the law of war. In a legal framework focused on protecting civilians and built on balance and pragmatic realities, "absolutes" ultimately undermine the law's central purpose and incentivize ever-greater abuse and manipulation of the very civilians the law is designed to protect.</p>

No sentiment concerning voting rings truer than this expression of former Secretary of State <a href="http://http://www.huffingtonpost.com/courtney-sokol/turn-out-and-turn-up-the-_b_6101560.html">Hillary Clinton</a>. In the wake of the midterm elections, many attribute low voter turnout supporting the Democratic Party, on restrictive <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/11/17/voter-id-laws-a-microcosm-of-a-divided-america/">voter </a> ID laws. Many sympathetic to the plight of recently disenfranchised voters compare the new suppressive voter ID laws to post Civil War poll <a href="http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/sep/12/american-civil-liberties-union/voter-id-laws-poll-tax-not-equivalent/">taxes</a>. There have been many changes to voter laws throughout the <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx">country</a>. </p>

<p>In Kansas, over 20,000 people were stopped from registering to vote because they lacked proof of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/us/voter-id-laws-midterm-elections.html?_r=0">citizenship</a>. North Carolina's early voting was cut by seven days. Democrats say that Texas passed the country's toughest voter ID law that contributed to a congressman losing a tight race to his Republican rival. Recent studies have shown that generally voter ID laws are an ineffective way to steal elections and do not affect the outcome of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/us/supreme-court-upholds-texas-voter-id-law.html">elections</a>. This should not be a partisan issue but an American issue that all should be fighting to resolve. My goal is to enlighten and involve others in this discussion in order to facilitate practical solutions drawing from realistic goals.</p>

<p>Before the midterms, many citizens bemoaned the voter ID laws demanding an overturn, claiming the laws would disenfranchise thousands of registered voters, terminating their eligibility from <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/176641/judge-who-framed-voter-id-laws-constitutional-says-he-got-it-wrong">voting</a>. Recently, the US Supreme Court upheld a 2011 Texas <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx">law</a> requiring specific voter identification as constitutional. The Texas law declared that voters must provide government issued photo identification, like a Texas driver's or gun license, a military ID or a passport. Many individuals, including US Attorney General, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/justice-department-to-challenge-states-voting-rights-laws/2013/07/25/c26740b2-f49b-11e2-a2f1-a7acf9bd5d3a_story.html">Eric Holder Jr</a>., civil rights groups and the Obama administration, have challenged the Texas law. Justice Ginsburg wrote in her dissent that this law "may prevent more than 600,000 registered Texas voters (about 4.5 percent of all registered voters from voting in person for lack of [proper] identification.)" Also, she added, that "a sharply disproportionate percentage of those voters are African-American or Hispanic." Yet, Texas officials called Ginsburg's math "preposterous."</p>

<p>The reason given for so many disproportionate victims is that it is difficult for minorities to obtain the required form of identification. Ginsburg wrote, that "more than 400,000 eligible voters face round trip travel times of three hours or more near a government office issuing ID." Furthermore, birth certificates needed for government issued IDs are unaffordable for many. Although, the state usually offers reduced cost birth certificates for election purposes, it is not publicized as an option.</p>

<p>A recent North Carolina Board of Elections <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/upshot/why-voter-id-laws-dont-swing-many-elections.html">study</a> showed that the "so called margin of disenfranchisement" for people without photo identification "grossly overstates the potential electoral consequence of these laws." Primarily, the true number of registered voters without photo identification is grossly overestimated than what is suggested in statistics. The numbers are usually calculated by matching voter registration files with state ID databases, but perfect matching is impossible. In Texas, if you register to vote with a name like "Nate" but your ID says "Nathan" you will be counted as a registered voter without a photo ID. However, you would be able to vote at the polling station because it is "substantially similar" to the one on file. The Board of Elections decided to match the names by additional matching criteria like Social Security numbers and date of birth, causing "the number of unmatched registered voters to plummet from 1.24 million to 318,643."</p>

<p>Furthermore, people who are without IDs are less likely to vote than other registered voters. The North Carolina study showed that 43 percent of registered voters who did not meet the matching criteria, voted in 2012 while more than 70 percent of matched voters exercised their voting rights. Due to these differences in participation, it is unclear whether those without a photo ID would have overwhelmingly supported Democratic candidates. It is clear that voter ID laws had a disparate impact on traditional Democratic-leaning demographics, including young, nonwhite, poor, immobile and elderly voters. However, in this study 22 percent of these voters were registered Republicans making it unlikely the alleged 70/30 margin is fully consistent with Democratic concerns about voter suppression. Thus, a 70/30 fabricated margin is not enough votes to decide anything beyond extremely close elections. Lastly, many of the voters without photo identification will generally cast provisional ballots. Though provisional ballots are not an adequate long-term remedy for voters without identification, 37 percent of provisional ballots cast because of ID reasons were counted in Kansas and 26 percent were counted in Tennessee in 2012. </p>

<p>With all the mitigating factors, it is difficult to show a relationship between voter ID laws and swinging <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-know-about-voter-id-laws">elections</a> unless it is a very close election. Throughout history, Democratic candidates won in states with voter ID laws. For example, President Obama won in Indiana directly after the state <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/01/11/145044060/political-battle-brewing-over-new-voter-id-laws">passed</a> a restrictive voter ID law in 2008. Despite this, history has proven that: voter fraud is nonexistent and voter ID laws do not swing elections. But that should not be the focus since both party's interests creates a solvable paradox. The two competing interests at stake deserving of focus are voter fraud and voter disenfranchisement. Both political parties should acknowledge the others concerns and partner to solve them. However, once again lawmakers have been allowed to politicize the issue making it a partisan rather than an American <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/11/17/voter-id-laws-a-microcosm-of-a-divided-america/">issue</a>.</p>

<p>The goal should be to shed light on the issue expanding the audience in search of solutions. It is saddening to see the number of people affected by discriminatory laws. Whether the law's intention was to discriminate or not, the outcome is unacceptable. It appears we are not digging deep enough into this issue. It is doubtful that the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s would have allowed an ID law to stop their community from voting. </p>

<p>The solution is clear&#8212;overturn the laws. Yes, striking down the laws would initiate a long and ominous process. But in order to strike down voting discrimination laws, state legislatures and the judiciary must agree that these laws are unconstitutional. How long must citizens wait for their voting rights to be restored? Minorities do not need the government to solve every issue. Understanding the history of racism in this country, is key to recognizing that certain people are subject to laws with a discriminatory effect on minorities. The main issue with voting laws is that people have a hard time getting IDs because of financial and transportation troubles. Rather than wasting precious time trying to convince the government to strike down these laws, we must develop quick and practical solutions to overcome this discrimination. </p>

<p>For example, if finances pose an issue then community based groups need to raise money for indigent people. In addition, if transportation is an issue these groups need to build transportation systems to help these people get to government offices. There are many benefits to having a government issued ID besides <a href="http://www.dmv.org/id-cards.php">voting</a>, but absent solutions, lawmakers will continue to discriminate against minorities in other areas. Minorities are powerful when connected and supporting each other to develop outcomes to current problems, without depending on the government to properly govern.</p>

		<title>The Evolution of a More Perfect Union: The Development of Same-Sex Marriage in the United States</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Chris Wester, <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/">New England School of Law</a>, Class of 2016, discusses how rights for same-sex couples in the US have evolved...</j:header><strong>M</strong>any of the rights that our society refers to today as basic, uninhibited and fundamental to the lives of all American citizens were not constitutionally guaranteed without substantial civil unrest and debate. The development of LGBTQ rights within society, specifically those affording same-sex couples the right to marry, is clearly no exception. Recently, our country has seen tremendous action on society's national stage with regards to the debate over same-sex couples' constitutionally fundamental right to marry. It is truly incredible how much our society has evolved since the first instance in which this issue was raised before and dismissed by the US Supreme Court "for want of a substantial federal question" in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14283825888588258352&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Baker v. Nelson</a>. Such evolution is clear evidence that the fundamental rights enumerated within the Constitution have revolutionized in congruence with societal advancement and are substantially affected by social unrest. The history of the same-sex marriage debate, coupled with the unparalleled developments set forth over the last decade by federal and state legislative and judicial branches have the supporters of marriage equality viewing the Supreme Court's most recent decision in an optimistic and positive light. While it is guardedly presumptive to predict a possible outcome of the pending decision before the Supreme Court, it is likely that the justices will continue the tradition of redefining the scope of marriage equality by officially extending such right to all American citizens.  </p>

<p>As is outlined in Judge Sarah Zabel's Florida Circuit Court <a href="http://www.nclrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Pareto-Marriage-Equality-Decision-July-25-2014.pdf">decision</a> in <span class="casename">Pareto v. Rubin</span>, social unrest and debate leads to the expansion and recognition of constitutionally fundamental rights. The debate over same-sex couples' fundamental right to marriage exploded onto the national canvas throughout 2014. In response to this discussion and the social conflict that has spawned from it, the Supreme Court made an announcement on January 16, 2015 that our country and, indeed, the entire global society, was anxiously awaiting: the court will finally address the constitutional issue of state bans on same-sex couples' right to marry. And, while this decision is clearly going to be a controversial one, it is most certainly not premature from a social, political or judicial viewpoint. To date, 36 states have adopted laws that recognize same-sex couples' fundamental right to marriage, either through judicial decree or legislative procedures. That is more than half of the US individual jurisdictions combined. Support for the benefits of marriage equality has come from practically every aspect of society, either tacitly or through more direct forms of communication. In May 2012, President Obama publicly supported the extension of the fundamental right to marriage for same-sex couples, becoming the first sitting President in our nation's history to do so. Even the Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church, arguably one of the most conservative and traditional organizations in the world, has expressed a change in view regarding the benefits of unions for same-sex couples, albeit far from the open arms that American society seems to be extending. While neither the Executive Branch of the US Federal Government nor the Roman Catholic Church has the authority or power to interpret, broaden or else expand the fundamental rights of the US Constitution, communication from these institutions, and so many others, is illustration of the breadth, depth and scope that this universal debate has had on our global society. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the significant increase of states that officially recognized same-sex marriage within their jurisdictions over the last four months is a clear indication that the recognition of marriage between same-sex couples is no longer the scandalous and dramatically misunderstood issue that it once was even less than five years ago. As Mr. Lyle Dennison, contributor to SCOTUSblog, writes, "Since the Supreme Court last took action on [this] issue, denying review on October 6 of cases from five states, same-sex marriages have become legal in seventeen more states." As this issue continues to develop through the judicial system on both the state and federal levels, it is becoming increasingly clear just how highly fundamental the right to marry is considered to be within the American culture. </p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how the justices approach the final resolution of this provocative consideration. The academic and professional arenas agree that the main substantive issues that the court must decide will focus on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process</a> elements of this matter: deciding, once and for all, the generation-long question of whether or not same-sex couples have a constitutionally protected right to marry. Moreover, the court will be tasked with the everlasting burden of determining which level of scrutiny will be appropriately applied to this decision-making process. If approaching the analysis from a position that primarily focuses on Equal Protection, the court will likely apply strict scrutiny in determining whether or not a particular state's statute has a legitimate governmental interest in its purpose, and whether or not such an alleged interest can be more narrowly tailored by the State so as to not affect the fundamental right at issue. Alternatively, if the court approaches the analysis from an angle that focuses in on the Due Process arguments, all that the Court must do is apply a rational basis review in determining whether or not the State successfully argues that there is a substantial governmental interest that is rationally connected to the statute in question. Or, the court might perhaps tread a course that falls in between the two extreme levels and adopt a more intermediate level of scrutiny in balancing a particular state's interest against the right of individual citizens that is at stake. Yet, it is abundantly clear how essential the majority of the US holds the right to marry to be a constitutionally protected right of all American citizens, regardless of sex, gender or sexual orientation. Furthermore, it is important to note that it would likely be detrimental to the current position of case law, and indeed much of the current legislation involving Equal Protection, for the Court to hold that marriage is not a fundamental right afforded to all American citizens since the development of the Supreme Court's precedent over the last few decades has interpreted the country's constitutional law to hold otherwise. </p>

<p>While arguments that oppose the official recognition of same-sex marriage adamantly hold that the Supreme Court should apply a modest "rational basis" test under a Due Process analysis, such opinions will likely not pass muster with the court. Opponents of marriage equality focus their argument on the fact that states have a legitimate interest in the protection of traditional family values and in regulating marriage for the purpose of sustaining the legitimacy of biological childrearing. The crux of the opposition's argument does not extend its substantive reasoning much beyond the formalism of traditional family values and the protection of the conventional child-rearing process. However, it has been determined time and again that the societal structure of the modern family has significantly evolved beyond that of the traditional, biological organization. As Judge Zabel aptly wrote in <span class="casename">Pareto</span>, "Tradition alone does not constitute a rational basis for any law..." Furthermore, there is ample research and documentation that the benefits of a family relationship can be, and are, established in dynamics that diverge from the traditional household. In today's society, modern families are created in a plethora of motivated structures&#8212;adoptive families or close bonds between extended family members or friends just to name a few common relationships. Just as the breadth and expansion of fundamental, constitutional rights have occurred over the centuries, so similarly has the definition and interpretation of the concept of family. As such, it is unsound to adamantly argue that the fundamental right of marriage should be denied to same-sex couples on the grounds of tradition preservation and child rearing. Such arguments simply do not reflect the evolution of society in the twenty-first century.</p>

<p>The debate surrounding marriage equality that our nation has witnessed over approximately the last thirty years truly is a testament to the essential processes of a democratic society&#8212;freedom of speech, freedom of expression and the ability to safely articulate one's genuine beliefs as part of an environment in which we are not civically oppressed and quelled. All of these characteristics summarize the hallmark of a true democracy. The political history of global society throughout the centuries has shown us that societal evolution is inevitable as a result of public unrest. Our own nation has seen such evolution through the last few decades and the continuation of such progression through the official recognition of same-sex couples' constitutional right to marry is the next logical step in our society's formulation of a more perfect union. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.wayne.edu/profile/robert.sedler/">Robert A. Sedler</a>, of <a href="http://law.wayne.edu/">Wayne State University Law School</a>, discusses the constitutionality of Michigan's ban on marriage for same-sex persons ... </p><strong>I</strong>n <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2301009007497891174&q">Caspar v. Snyder</a>, decided on January 15, 2015, Judge Mark A. Goldsmith of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan issued a preliminary injunction and held that Michigan was <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/federal-judge-orders-michigan-to-recognize-323-same-sex-marriages.php">required to recognize 323 marriages</a> for same-sex persons that took place during a brief window of a few hours on March 22, 2014. Around 5:00 PM on Friday, March 21, 2014, Judge Bernard A. Friedman of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, issued his decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=403997648235087664&q=deboer+v.+snyder&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">DeBoer v. Snyder</a>, holding that Michigan's ban on marriage for same-sex couples violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a>. The next morning, Saturday, March 22, 2014, four county clerks opened their offices and issued marriage licenses to these 323 couples. The "stay window" closed in the afternoon of March 22, 2014, when the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a temporary stay of that order pending appeal. After the Sixth Circuit granted a full stay pending appeal, Michigan Governor Richard Snyder, the defendant in the <span class="casename">DeBoer</span> case, publicly announced that although these were legal and valid marriages, Michigan would not recognize these marriages or provide any benefits to the married same-sex couples unless the stay was removed or Judge Friedman's decision was upheld by a higher court on appeal.</p>

<p>In finding that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on the merits of their claim, Judge Goldsmith invoked the due process clause and the fundamental right of marriage. The judge focused on marriage as a fundamental right under the due process clause and stated that this case implicated the right to maintain one's marital status once it has been lawfully acquired under the laws of the state seeking to defeat it. The liberty interest represented by the marriage relationship is an ongoing interest, one of committed intimacy that hopefully will last as long as the both parties live. And the defendants did not argue, as they could not, that the denial of benefits or rights to married persons "eviscerates that status" and makes them the functional equivalent of unmarried persons.</p>

<p>The judge went on to point out that Michigan's refusal to recognize the martial status of persons lawfully married pursuant to marriage licenses issued under Michigan law as it stood at the time the marriages were solemnized was completely unprecedented. He noted that the state defendants failed to provide a single court decision that approved of a state's efforts to vitiate the marital status of a couple lawfully married under that state's law. He then cited and discussed "a long history of decisions and legislative enactments, under a variety of theories, reflecting a national consensus rejecting the view that a person's marital status may be invalidated by a state after it was lawfully acquired under a state's law." One aspect of this history was "plethora of court decisions that interpret statutes modifying marriage-eligibility requirements so as to exempt marriages that would otherwise be invalidated under the change in the law." They included: a change in Arizona law that now declared void out-of-state marriages between first cousins, which was interpreted as prospective only so as not to destroy the "vested rights" in existing first cousin marriages; a New York court interpreting a statute abolishing common law marriage as applying prospectively only; a US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit case interpreting as prospective only a change in New York law voiding a subsequent marriage based on the disappearance of a spouse unless the prior marriage had been terminated by divorce and the decision of the California Supreme Court holding that a voter-adopted state constitutional amendment prohibiting the recognition of marriages between same-sex persons (subsequently declared to be unconstitutional) did not apply to the estimated 18,000 same-sex couples who had married after the issuance of the earlier court decision recognizing their right to marry. There were also a number of statutory amendments for existing marriages in the face of laws changing marriage requirements,.</p>

<p>Judge Goldsmith then concluded that there was a consensus that the right to the continued validity of a marriage was "deeply rooted in this Nation's tradition," so long as the marriage was authorized at the time it was solemnized under the law of the state that now was seeking to defeat it. Thus, this right could only be defeated by a narrowly tailored and compelling state interest and the interests asserted by the State of Michigan, such as that if Judge Friedman's decision was not upheld on appeal, these marriages were void <em>ab initio</em>, were rejected.</p>

<p>It may be noted that an identical decision was reached last May by the US District Court for the District of Utah in <span class="casename">Evans v. Utah</span>, involving the validity of marriage licenses issued to same-sex couples in Utah, between December 20, 2013, when the federal court declared Utah's ban on marriage for same-sex persons unconstitutional, and January 6, 2014, when the US Supreme Court stayed that decision pending appeal.</p>

<p>Judge Goldsmith specifically made it clear that his decision in <span class="casename">Caspar v. Snyder</span> was unaffected by the ultimate result in <span class="casename">DeBoer v. Snyder</span>. That is, the decision in <span class="casename">Caspar</span> involved the right to maintain an existing marriage, not the right to acquire the status of being married, which is the issue involved in <span class="casename">DeBoer</span>.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, on January 17, the day after Judge Goldsmith's decision, the US Supreme Court granted certiorari in <span class="casename">DeBoer</span> and three other cases coming from Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky that had been decided by the Sixth Circuit together with <span class="casename">DeBoer</span>. The court's ruling on these cases had held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not require the states to license marriages between same-sex persons or to recognize such marriages that took place in another state. The court will render a decision in these cases at the end of its current term in June 2015.</p>

<p>We are hopeful, of course, that the Supreme Court will hold that the Fourteenth Amendment embodies the value of marriage equality and requires Michigan and every other state to license marriage between same-sex persons. But one never can say with certainty what the Supreme Court will do until it does it and any prediction about a Supreme Court decision is necessarily speculative. Judge Goldsmith's decision in <span class="casename">Caspar v. Snyder</span> seems clearly correct and ensures that howsoever the Supreme Court will decide <span class="casename">DeBoer v. Snyder</span>, the 323 Michigan couples who married in Michigan during the "stay window" will continue to be married.</p>

		<title>&#034;The Civil Rights Issue of Our Time&#034;: Transgender Equality and the Right to Choose Your Bathroom</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Brian Eisner, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2015, is the author of the eleventh article in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law/academic-programs/student-journals/journal-civil-rights-and-economic-development">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Eisner discusses the California's School Success and Opportunity Act and transgender equality...</j:header><strong>I</strong>magine you are a first grade boy. Growing up, you were not like other boys. Instead of wearing shorts and a tee shirt, you preferred the feel of a dress; when you went to play, you were more likely to play with Barbie than GI Joe; you even went so far as to tell your mother that you feel like a girl. In your mind and heart, you are a girl. Although your parents are, at first, disconcerted with your behavior, they soon begin to accept your feelings as natural and treat you as a girl.</p>

<p>Then you enter public school. Unfortunately, your school district does not feel the same way about your desire to be treated like a girl. Instead of allowing you to express yourself as a girl, the school decides to force you to use the bathroom associated with your birth certificate. When you complain and ask to use the girl's bathroom they respond by allowing you to use the faculty bathroom: a single-person bathroom. But, this singles you out because you are the only student using this bathroom; thus, by allowing you access to the staff bathroom the school has made it clear you are different than all the other children and must be treated as such.</p>

<p>The above story is not unique to any one individual, but rather is one of the shared experiences by children who identify as transgender, which means that the gender with which they identify does not match the sexual identity assigned by their birth certificate.</p>

<p>In California, Governor Jerry Brown signed the <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB1266">School Success and Opportunity Act</a>, which allows any child in K-12 public schools to use the bathroom, locker room and participate on sports teams of their gender identity, irrespective of what their birth certificate says that their sex is. In this context, gender identity is a person's private sense of gender. However, since its inception, the law has been under <a href="http://equalitymatters.org/emtv/201308130002">constant attack</a> from groups who are adamantly against allowing transgendered individuals to use the bathroom of their gender identity. While so far their efforts through the ballot initiative system have failed to garner enough verifiable signatures to put it on the ballot, a more insidious challenge is about to be undertaken by these groups. They have begun to <a href="http://www.pacificjustice.org/ab1266.html">solicit potential plaintiffs</a> for lawsuits based on the alleged infringement of the right to privacy of the objecting children who would share the same bathroom with the transgendered children. And the problem is that based on the current judicial landscape these sorts of challenges have the power to overturn the law and force transgendered children to using the bathroom of their birth certificate sex. The reason is that many courts have concluded that the right to privacy includes the right to be free from the opposite sex when using the bathroom. Since there is no indication that the courts' interpretation of this constitutional right will change, a great danger exists that the law will be declared unconstitutional. </p>

<p>If the law is declared unconstitutional, then transgender students in California will once again be forced to use the bathroom of their birth sex and not their gender identity. This will have dire consequences for transgender students because they will be forced to realize that they are different than other students and treated differently than them. Every time that a transgender student uses the bathroom he/she would be forced to realize that he/she is "abnormal that there was something so grotesque or unsafe about her that her very presence in a place as delicate as a bathroom was intolerable." In essence, overturning this law would make an entire subsection of the student population feel like outcasts.</p>

<p>To make certain that the transgender student body is allowed the same freedoms as their non-transgender counterparts, society must begin to move to a more transgender inclusive model of bathrooms: the gender neutral bathroom. This model envisions bathrooms that consist of multiple stalls where people could "do their business" and then there would be a communal sink area. Anyone could use this bathroom because there would be nothing in the bathroom that would make it inherently made for one sex or gender (like a urinal). </p>

<p>These sorts of bathrooms would be in step with society's direction. For instance, many colleges, such as Grinnell College in Iowa, have begun to install gender-neutral bathrooms. Further support comes from new guidelines promulgated by the Department of Education on how teachers and administrators should deal with gender identity in public schools. In Massachusetts, the Department of Education recently <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/ssce/GenderIdentity.pdf">established guidelines</a> [PDF] that schools should follow to ensure students can access bathrooms that match their gender identity. Connecticut also <a href="http://www.ct.gov/chro/lib/chro/Guidelines_for_Schools_on_Gender_Identity_and_Expression_final_4-24-12.pdf">passed</a> [PDF] similar guidelines.</p>

<p>There is no question that a change to the structure of bathrooms (a closely held societal norm) would have its opponents, especially when it comes to implementation in public schools. Many would argue that younger children would be uncomfortable using the bathroom with children of the opposite sex and gender because they are at an age where the opposite sex is still seen as "having cooties." However, this concern is ameliorated when looking at how children begin to use bathrooms when they are growing up. Normally, a child using public bathrooms will be accompanied by a parent. When the parent of the same sex is not available, the child will generally follow the parent of the opposite sex into the "opposite" bathroom. Thus, children who are younger will have already been exposed to bathrooms of the opposite sex and this can be used as a learning experience for the child. The parents can talk to their children and help them understand that a bathroom is simply a place to "do their business" and not for anything else. Much like other public spaces that are used, early implementation and parental teaching will help the child to adjust.</p>

<p>Even further, opponents would argue that as children aged and began to go through the hormonal changes associated with manhood and womanhood, these bathrooms would be problematic because putting both sexes and genders in the same location could lead to misuse of the bathroom and potential feelings of discomfort. This misuse could include increases in sexual harassment, while the discomfort could come from  situations such as when a girl begins to menstruate when a  male is in the bathroom. However,  this potential problem is combated by the structure and early implementation of the bathrooms. Since the gender-neutral bathrooms would be implemented when the students  were young, as they grow older, the bathrooms would lose their novelty and would simply be a place to do their business. Any wrongdoing that would occur in the bathroom would be monitored the same way as if there was wrongdoing now: it would be reported by a fellow student who observed the wrongdoing, and the offender would be reprimanded and hopefully taught to abide by the rules. If a particular student continues to use the bathroom in inappropriate ways (i.e. as a means for easy access to the opposite sex in order to harass them), then he/she should be punished and not the transgender students who only want to use the bathroom that allows the full expression of the person that they are inside. </p>

<p>Also, the structure of the bathroom should help people feel more comfortable. Even in a situation where a girl begins to menstruate or might feel uncomfortable with a male in the bathroom, the fact that there are stalls gives a modicum of privacy to the individual. Since this is a public bathroom the students would not have complete privacy, but only the privacy that is found in bathrooms now. Thus, a student who is uncomfortable would have to be dealt with along the same lines as a student who is uncomfortable in the bathroom around other people of the same sex now. They would be given the option to use a faculty bathroom or made to feel comfortable through education and the like.</p>

<p>The California law is necessary to protect transgender students from harassment and to allow them to feel comfortable in a school setting. Unfortunately, there is a <a href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/01/08/breaking-efforts-repeal-calif-trans-student-law-remain-alive">good probability</a> that the law will be overturned on right to privacy grounds. To make certain that transgender students are given the equality they seek, it is necessary for society to do what the courts cannot: create bathrooms that are gender neutral. It is only in this way that equality will be achieved.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.wvu.edu/faculty-staff/full-time-faculty/kendra-huard-fershee">Kendra Huard Fershee</a>, of West Virginia University College at Law, discusses the legal and social issues within West Virginia's struggle to uphold same sex marriage ...</p><strong>S</strong>ame-sex marriage supporters in West Virginia&#8212;and several other states&#8212;went to bed on Sunday night, October 5, 2014, not knowing that they should be as excited as Cindy Lou Who on Christmas Eve. The next morning, those supporters awoke to news that the US Supreme Court had <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/us-supreme-court-refuses-nationwide-ruling-on-same-sex-marriage.php">cleared the way</a> for some states to begin granting marriage certificates to same-sex partners seeking to marry. The court denied certiorari to several applications for appeal of Circuit Court decisions to strike state laws against same-sex marriage as unconstitutional. That denial of certiorari, while legally the equivalent of the rejection of a dinner invitation, set the wheels in motion to lift stays on several judicial opinions that struck bans on same-sex marriage from Circuit Courts and District Courts scattered throughout the country. And without missing a beat, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit followed the Supreme Court's denial of <em>certiorari</em> almost immediately with a decision to uphold a lower court decision to strike a ban on same-sex marriage in Idaho. And so it was, in the span of about a week, same-sex marriage became&#8212;at least in theory&#8212;legal in 13 more states than it had been on October 5, 2014.</p>

<p>The legal theory that made same-sex marriage legal in so many states at one time is <em>stare decisis</em>&#8212;the theory of binding legal precedent&#8212;which means that courts falling under the jurisdiction of a higher court must follow the higher court's authority. So, because one of the decisions the Supreme Court decided not to consider on appeal was the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit's decision to uphold a lower court's ruling that a ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional; the Fourth Circuit's decision became a final decision and took effect. And because it took effect, the courts that fall under the jurisdiction of the Fourth Circuit have to follow suit. Conceptually, this is not too difficult to understand, but practically, it can be a lot more complicated. Those additional complications do not necessarily get in the way of same-sex marriage happening eventually, but they can delay the effective date, which has to be beyond frustrating to those same-sex couples who had been fighting for the right to marry in the states sitting in appellate jurisdictions that had ruled in their favor.</p>

<p>A great example of the potential for a complicating delay in a state can be illustrated by looking at what happened in West Virginia after the Supreme Court decided not to decide those same-sex marriage cases last October. West Virginia is in the Fourth Circuit, so it sits in a jurisdiction where an appellate court has decided to strike a state's ban on same-sex marriage. But the Fourth Circuit reviewed Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage, not West Virginia's ban. So, in theory, West Virginia could argue that its ban is somehow constitutional, even though the Fourth Circuit said Virginia's ban was not. If nothing else, a judge willing to entertain that argument could have slowed the beginning of same-sex marriage in West Virginia, because county clerks charged with issuing marriage licenses could refuse them to same-sex couples until forced to do so by the appropriate authority. That did not happen, but the possibility was real that a court could have held that West Virginia's statute banning same-sex marriage is different enough from Virginia's that a court could hold that West Virginia's ban is constitutional. </p>

<p>That never came to pass, however, because a West Virginia federal judge made it abundantly clear that the pending case challenging the same-sex marriage ban in West Virginia had come to an end, and that the plaintiffs had been victorious. In<a href="http://freemarry.3cdn.net/ce5282c64d8d75f370_68m6bx3ny.pdf"> McGee v. Cole,</a> [PDF] Judge Robert C. Chambers lifted a stay on that case that held it in limbo on the anticipation of a ruling from the Supreme Court regarding the Fourth Circuit's decision to strike the Virginia ban on same-sex marriage the <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/courts/ca4/141167.P.pdf">Bostic v. Schaeffer</a> [PDF]. When the Supreme Court declined to review <span class="casename">Bostic</span> on October 6, 2014, the ruling in <span class="casename">Bostic</span> took effect and the same-sex marriage ban in Virginia fell. The question for West Virginians became when the stay that Chambers had issued in McGee would be lifted, allowing the case to move ahead on its merits. That decision came on October 7, 2014, when Chambers lifted the stay and asked the defendants to respond, within a couple of weeks, to the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, which is where the case was frozen until the stay was lifted.</p>

<p>After receiving the defendants' reply to the motion for summary judgment, Chambers wasted no time in granting the plaintiff's motion. In doing so, Chambers made clear that West Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage can no longer stand. The Fourth Circuit struck Virginia's ban as unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court refused to weigh in at that time. Any further legal wrangling over same-sex marriage in West Virginia would have to end, and the wedding ceremonies that began after October 6, 2014 could continue. The only thing that could change things back to the way they were would be a ruling from the Supreme Court that same-sex marriage bans in the states are constitutional, and that did not seem likely to happen soon because the court had so recently decided not to hear appeals on the issue.</p>

<p>And then, on January 16, 2015, the Supreme Court announced it will hear an appeal coming out of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, wherein the appellate court decided to uphold a ban on same-sex marriage. This is widely regarded as good news for supporters of same-sex marriage, because it is an opportunity for the court to strike bans on same-sex marriage in all of the US. If the Supreme Court decides to uphold the Sixth Circuit's decision, however, it could create chaos in states, like West Virginia, that have permitted same-sex marriages to proceed for the last several months on the basis of the Supreme Court's refusal to take the appeals sought last October. Stay tuned!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://en.mishpat.ac.il/yael_ronen/">Ya&euml;l Ronen</a>, of <a href="http://en.mishpat.ac.il/תפריט_ראשי/About_Us/Sha_arei_Mishpat_Academic_Center/">Sha'arei Mishpat Academic Center</a>, and <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/about-us/full-time-faculty/d-a-jeremy-telman">Jeremy Telman</a>, of <a href="http://valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University Law School</a>, discuss the policy of demolishing the homes of those considered as terrorists in light of petition filed with the Israel Supreme Court challenging legality of such policy...</p><em>The Petition Challenging Regulation 119 on Home Demolitions</em></p>

<p><strong>I</strong>n November 2014 eight Israeli human rights organizations filed a <a href="http://hamoked.org/files/2014/1159000_eng.pdf">petition</a> [PDF] before the Israel Supreme Court, sitting as the High Court of Justice, challenging the Israeli military forces' renewal in the summer of 2014 of the practice of demolishing and/or sealing off the homes of those deemed terrorists. The policy is grounded in Regulation 119 of the Defense (Emergency) Regulations, which were introduced by the British Mandate authorities in 1945 and constitute part of the law in the West Bank.</p>

<p>Although the court has heard hundreds of challenges to the policy, it has not undertaken a fundamental review of the policy's legality since the 1980s but has limited itself to a review of its appropriateness in individual cases. The petitioners sought review of the policy, both because the court has never addressed the criticism directed at its position on the merits in the early decisions and in light of subsequent developments in international law. The petition was supported by an <a href="http://hamoked.org/files/2014/1159001_eng.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF] by four Israeli international law experts.</p>

<p>On December 31, 2014, a three-justice panel of the court issued its <a href="http://hamoked.org/images/HD-HaMoked-General%20Petition-Judgment-4-1-15.pdf">judgment</a> [PDF] in the case, <span class="casename">HaMoked v. Minister of Justice</span>, in which it unanimously rejected the petition, with each justice writing separately but joining in the main opinion. For the most part the court reiterates its past positions relating to the policy. We will review the court's analysis on six issues raised in the petition and identify fundamental issues that we think the court failed to address adequately.</p>

<p><em>Regulation 119 Viewed in the Light of International Law</em></p>

<p>In its first judgments on the legality of Regulation 119 in the late 1970s and 1980s, the court held that the Regulation was not subject to a test of legality under international law, since as the law of the land, Regulation 119 trumps international law. Moreover it held that Regulation 119's validity is protected by <a href="https://icrc.org/ihl/WebART/195-200053?OpenDocument">Article 43</a> of the Hague Regulations, which requires the occupying power to respect the "laws in force" in the occupied territory unless absolutely prevented. </p>

<p>The petitioners in <span class="casename">HaMoked</span> argued that this jurisprudence was flawed both from an international and a domestic legal perspective. From an international legal perspective, domestic law cannot trump international law. Article 43 certainly does not, as the court had held, raise the normative status of domestic law above that of the laws of occupation; indeed, the incompatibility of Regulation 119 with the law of occupation renders it the sort of "law in force," that under a proper application of Article 43 Israel is "absolutely prevented" from respecting. Moreover because Regulation 119 grants a discretionary power, no "law in force" would be violated by its abandonment. From a domestic legal perspective, the petitioners argued that the perspective of the Israeli legal order, under which international law defers to contrary domestic legislation, does not apply to the law applicable in occupied territory. As a consequence the validity and use of Regulation 119 must be reviewed from the perspective of international law.</p>

<p>None of the opinions address petitioners' arguments that Article 43 cabins Regulation 119 rather than entrenches it. Justice Rubinstein who authored the primary opinion in the case essentially reiterates existing jurisprudence, according to which the use of Regulation 119 is compatible with the law of occupation. Regulation 119 is a "law in force" that the Israeli authorities must respect under Article 43. He concludes that Article 43 could not be held to limit the powers granted to the occupant under the law of the West Bank.   </p>

<p>The opinion distinguishes between the authority to use Regulation 119 and the discretion to do so. It states that authority undoubtedly exists and so the main question was whether the Israeli authorities have exercised their discretion in a reasonable manner.  </p>

<p><em>Does Use of Regulation 119 Deter Terrorism?</em></p>

<p>Rubinstein states that the purpose of Regulation 119 is deterrence rather than punishment. However, as the petition notes, Israel suspended the policy in 2005 on <a href="http://haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-panel-recommends-ending-punitive-house-demolitions-for-terrorists-families-1.150620">the recommendation</a> of a committee of high-ranking Israeli military officers (the Shani Committee). The Shani Committee found that the policy operated at the threshold of legality and may have done more harm than good in terms of deterrence. Rubinstein notes that the court will not second-guess a determination by the military as to the deterrent effect of any particular demolition. Such determinations follow normative guidelines developed in the case law.</p>

<p>According to Rubinstein, the history of Israel's implementation of the policy illustrates the Israeli authorities' sensitivity to the need to ensure that its use is reasonable in light of the circumstances, including the abandonment of the policy following the Shani Committee's findings. In light of the recent rise in attacks on civilians in Jerusalem, Rubinstein determines that the renewed use of the policy is reasonable. Rubinstein acknowledges the difficulty in establishing that the policy is effective as a deterrent and the need for state agencies to continuously re-evaluate the policy's efficacy. Justice Hayut echoes this sentiment in her separate opinion. Justice Sohlberg wrote separately to stress the "moderate, balanced and responsible" manner in which the Israeli authorities have made use of Regulation 119. Much of Sohlberg's opinion summarizes empirical studies indicating that demolitions are an effective deterrent.</p>

<p>The court's approach more or less assumes that the policy's lawfulness is to be analyzed with respect to its purpose as a deterrent but the court does not seem to have settled on an understanding of deterrence. Rubinstein mentions that one purpose of the demolition may be to prevent the house from being reused for terrorist purposes and prevention is distinct from deterrence. Sohlberg's reference to the role of the family in morally supporting the perpetrator of the terrorist attack suggests that the measure is punitive to some extent. The policy may further the different goal of encouraging families to actively dissuade perpetrators from realizing their plans, but it strains logic to characterize such a goal as within the bounds of deterrence. </p>

<p><em>Does the Policy Amount to Collective Punishment?</em></p>

<p>The petition, supported by numerous authorities, claims that the policy violates the prohibition on collective punishment found in <a href="https://icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument&documentId=B2D5C9BD27F0DC51C12563CD005168FB">Article 50</a> of the Hague Regulations and <a href="https://icrc.org/ihl/WebART/380-600038">Article 33</a> of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Rubinstein rejects petitioners' argument that "any demolition whatsoever ... necessarily amounts to collective punishment ... ." Instead Rubinstein holds that the extent to which persons not accused of terrorist action are harmed by the demolition should be examined in light of the principle of proportionality. </p>

<p>It is not clear why and how the court regards proportionality as a relevant criterion in identifying collective punishment. For one thing the prohibition on collective punishments is absolute and not subject to a proportionality analysis. Moreover the court fails to distinguish between measures that cause incidental injury to uninvolved persons (in which an inquiry into proportionality would be appropriate) and those that target the uninvolved (in which it would not be appropriate). The justices also distinguish harm to persons from deprivation of property, again disregarding the absolute prohibition on collective punishment.  </p>

<p>The court had held that the people subject to house demolitions are not in all cases innocent in that they were (at the very least) aware of the terrorist activities of family members that led to the demolition order. As noted above, this suggests that the purposes of the policy extend beyond deterrence. Moreover a demolition can proceed even if the Israeli authorities cannot "show that the inhabitants of the house knew of the suspect's terrorist activity." Indeed in petitions submitted in 2009, the state acknowledged that demolitions targeted innocent family members. The court does not explain why such demolitions are not collective punishment.</p>

<p><em>Article 53 and the Prohibition on the Destruction of Private Property</em></p>

<p>Rubinstein also rejects petitioners' claim that any house demolition violates <a href="https://icrc.org/ihl/WebART/380-600060?OpenDocument">Article 53</a> of the Fourth Geneva Convention, noting that Article 53 itself permits demolitions where "rendered absolutely necessary for military operations." Rubinstein holds that deterrence was a legitimate military necessity. Only disproportionate use of demolitions would violate Article 53. </p>

<p><em>Proportionality</em></p>

<p>Having rejected petitioners' allegation that the policy inherently violates the prohibition on collective punishment, Rubinstein focuses on the need to ensure that the demolition is necessary and does not cause harm that is disproportionate to its goal. A demolition is proportionate if the injury caused by the demolition does not violate the property rights of the affected people in a manner disproportionate to the deterrence benefit to be obtained.</p>

<p><em>Discrimination</em></p>

<p>The petitioners argued that the policy was applied in a discriminatory manner, since only the homes of Palestinians suspected or convicted of terrorist acts are demolished and not those of Jews involved in comparable conduct. Rubinstein and Sohlberg depart from their usual methodological approaches in their treatment of the issue of discrimination. Rubinstein simply states that the petitioners failed to present an adequate factual basis to refute the presumption of the legality of administrative action and thus rejects petitioners' claim. However once the undisputed facts have been presented, it should have been for the state to indicate a relevant difference that justifies the different treatment.  </p>

<p>Solberg's opinion is inconsistent in that he defends the policy based on empirical evidence that demolition is an effective deterrent, but he subjects the question of the effectiveness of the demolition of Jewish homes to no such empirical inquiry. Instead he simply declares that the scale of Jewish terrorist acts and the social reproach with which such acts are received make deterrence unnecessary. He provides no empirical basis for his reasoning here, in contrast to the extensive evidence he marshals in arguing that demolitions have a deterrent effect.</p>

<p>In <span class="casename">HaMoked</span> the petitioners asked the court to consider the legality of house demolitions as a matter of policy, unrelated to any specific incidents. The court rejected the petition, summarily dismissing some of the arguments without any serious engagement with their merits and ignoring others altogether (such as the illegality of house demolitions under international human right law).</p>

		<title>The Dragomir Vasic Indictment: The Need for Post-Conflict Accountability</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://american.edu/sis/faculty/pwilliam.cfm">Dr. Paul Williams</a> and Kelly Brouse of <a href="http://american.edu/">American University</a>, discuss the indictment of Dragomir Vasic by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina and emphasize the necessity for accountability not only during, but also after armed conflicts...</p><strong>O</strong>n December 16, 2014, the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina <a href="http://sudbih.gov.ba/index.php?id=3693&jezik=e">indicted</a> Dragomir Vasic for genocide relating to Vasic's role in the Srebrenica massacre where Bosnian Serb troops <a href="http://mondediplo.com/blogs/why-srebrenica-matters">killed</a> over 8,000 Bosniak men and boys. This indictment provides an example of the ability of accountability-based transitional justice mechanisms, such as international and hybrid tribunals and domestic courts, to strengthen peace by removing war criminals from society.  </p>

<p>Between July 6 and November 1, 1995, Vasic <a href="http://balkaninsight.com/en/article/bosnian-serb-mp-charged-with-srebrenica-genocide">served</a> as Commander of the Zvornick Police Headquarters and as Chief of the Public Security Center. Vasic has been charged with genocide under articles 171(a) and (b), 180, 29 and 31 of the <a href="http://tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/files/docs/Criminal_Code_of_BH_-_Consolidated_text_8_10.pdf">Bosnian Criminal Code</a> [PDF]. Specifically, Vasic has been charged with taking part in the planning and realization of genocide by ordering the use of manpower and equipment for the capture and forcible separation of Bosniak men and boys; the planning and carrying out of the arrests of Bosniak men and boys; the transportation of prisoners to sites of mass execution; executing Bosniak men and boys and burying the bodies of executed prisoners in mass graves. </p>

<p>Since the end of the war in Bosnia, Vasic has remained a <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/bosnia-court-indicts-serb-politician-for-genocide.php">public figure in the Republika Srpska</a> in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He served as a member of the People's Assembly of the Republika Srpska and as a councilor in the Zvornik Municipal Assembly, but High Representative Paddy Ashdown <a href="http://ohr.int/decisions/removalssdec/default.asp?content_id=30263">removed</a> him from those positions in 2003. According to High Representative Ashdown, Vasic obstructed the peace process by participating in activities that provided material support and sustenance to Radovan Karadzic. In October of 2014, Vasic won back his seat in the People's Assembly of the Republika Srpska.  </p>

<p>The war in Bosnia and the break up of Yugoslavia shocked the world with its brutality and reports of genocide and ethnic cleansing. In 1993 the UN Security Council <a href="http://trial-ch.org/en/resources/tribunals/hybrid-tribunals/war-crimes-chamber-in-bosnia-herzegovina.html">created</a> the <a href="/feature/featured/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in response to the atrocities occurring in Bosnia. The Security Council created the Yugoslav Tribunal during the middle of the war, and the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/icty/dayton/daytonannex4.html">Dayton Agreement</a> that ended the war required the cooperation of the newly formed governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Yugoslav Tribunal as part of the implementation of the peace agreement. The Bosnian domestic courts began to hear cases related to the war in 2003 when a UN Security Council Resolution required that the Bosnian domestic courts begin to assist the Yugoslav Tribunal. Serious cases emerging from the war are heard in the War Crimes Chamber of the Bosnia courts. This chamber holds jurisdiction over cases referred to it by the Yugoslav Tribunal or sensitive cases from the local or national level.  </p>

<p>Vasic's indictment by the Bosnian courts reminds us why accountability-based transitional justice mechanisms are indispensable for ensuring a long-term transition from conflict to stable peace.  </p>

<p>Peace agreements are by their very nature negotiated by those involved in the conflict. Often those same individuals are responsible for the atrocities and war crimes committed during the conflict. For instance, three of the four signatories to the Dayton Peace Accords were indicted or declared by the Yugoslav Tribunal to be indictable. Similarly the two leading members of the Serbian government delegation to the Rambouillet Kosovo talks were subsequently indicted by the Yugoslav Tribunal for crimes against humanity. While mediators are often forced to negotiate with individuals with blood on their hands and forgo justice in the moment, ensuring the creation of an accountability-based mechanism creates the possibility that those most responsible will eventual be held to account.</p>

<p>Given that those negotiating a peace agreement are often not simply surrendering, but rather seeking to accomplish at the negotiation table what they failed to fully accomplish on the battlefield, agreements are often imbedded with mechanisms and arrangements which provide an opportunity for those responsible for atrocities to continue to pursue through political mechanism the same outcomes they were pursuing through violence. The indictment of prominent "architects of peace" should (although unfortunately not always) serve to delegitimize the peace agreements which facilitate the objectives of those responsible for atrocities. Such delegitimization may help to create space for amendments to the agreement more suitable to a democratic and functional system of governance. </p>

<p>Moreover, surprisingly often those responsible for atrocities continue to hold positions of political power in post-conflict governance structures and influence the implementation of peace agreements in a way that continues to serve their original purposes. Strikingly after the signature of the Dayton Agreement, Slobodan Milosevic (President of Serbia), Momcilo Krajisnik (Member of Bosnian Presidency) and Biljana Plavsic (President of Republika Srpska) all continued to hold or assumed political office. It was only by the act of the Yugoslav Tribunal that they were removed from office and the fabric of Bosnian and Serbian society.</p>

<p>Accountability-based mechanisms are also crucial for removing mid-level war criminals who too will continue to shape the implementation of the post-conflict political environment, and are seldom addressed in any meaningful way by other mechanisms created during the peace process. For instance, five years after the signature of the Dayton Agreement, the International Crisis Group report <a href="http://crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/Bosnia%2039.pdf">found</a> [PDF] that over 75 indictable war criminals held positions of power (many elected) within the governance and security structures of the Republika Srpska. From those positions they continued the atrocity tainted policies of the wartime Republika Srpska. Vasic's indictment is part of the ongoing effort to remove such mid-level individuals from positions of power. </p>

<p>The indictment of Vlasic also reminds us of the longevity and durability of accountability-based mechanisms. In particular the fact that he was removed from office by the High Representative for aiding Radovan Karadzic, only to then successfully run for office again, reinforces the limits of political mechanisms, such as oversight by the international community, and the value of accountability-based mechanisms will often continue long after other objective political mechanisms have ceased effective operation. But for the War Crimes Chamber, Vlasic would have waited out the political engagement of the international community and continued to shape the future of Bosnia. </p>

<p>The Vasic indictment highlights the need for the international community to ensure that accountability-based mechanisms are woven into peace agreements, and where possible also exist independently, with referral to the International Criminal Court or some other hybrid mechanism. While never the highest priority in a peace negotiation or in planning for a post-conflict transition, accountability-based mechanisms are essential for any peace to be durable and for any real prospect of a transition to a modern democratic state. The inclusion of these mechanisms in future peace negotiations and agreements in conflicts such as Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, the Sudan, Sri Lanka and the Central African Republic should be deemed essential.  </p>

		<title>What&#039;s Wrong with Illinois&#039; New Eavesdropping Law</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2015/01/jacob-huebert-eavesdropping-law/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://jhhuebert.com/">Jacob Huebert</a>, of the <a href="http://libertyjusticecenter.org/about/">Liberty Justice Center</a>, discusses a new Illinois eavesdropping law and argues that the Illinois legislators should repeal the law as it violates constitutional principles and individual freedoms...</p><strong>F</strong>or a few weeks in late 2014, the police killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Eric Garner in New York City dominated the news, and few topics were hotter than police accountability and the importance of citizens' right to record interactions with law enforcement. </p>

                <p>While these events and issues were fresh in people's minds, Illinois legislators provoked public outrage by reviving an eavesdropping law that the Supreme Court of Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/illinois-top-court-strikes-down-eavesdropping-law.php">struck</a> down earlier in the year&#8212;in part because it prohibited citizens from recording public interactions with police.</p>

                <p>Sponsors and supporters of the new version of the law, including <a href="http://sj-r.com/article/20141218/Opinion/141219462">Democrat and Republican legislators</a> and the <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/12/aclu-statement-on-eavesdropping-bill.html">Illinois chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union</a>, insisted that the new statute would allow citizens to record police and that the public's concern was unwarranted. In fact however, <a href="http://ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=098-1142">Illinois' new eavesdropping law</a> is confusing and harsh. Although it does not ban all recording of police&#8212;the court took that off the table&#8212;it discourages it about as much possible. </p>

                <p>But before getting into those details, some background is in order. In most states, it is always legal to record your own conversations with police or anyone else. You never have to get the other person's consent or tell them you are recording.<br />
                    <br />
                    <a href="http://aapsonline.org/judicial/telephone.htm">Twelve states</a>, however, have "two-party consent" laws that generally forbid recording a conversation unless every participant consents. Typically these are part of an "eavesdropping" or "wiretapping" statute, even though most people (<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eavesdrop">and</a> <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/eavesdrop?s=t">dictionaries</a>) consider eavesdropping and wiretapping to involve listening in on someone else's conversation, not recording your own.</p>

                <p>A previous version of Illinois' "two-party consent" law enacted in 1994 was one of the country's most controversial because it was unusually strict and seemed designed to prevent citizens from recording interactions with police and other government officials. Unlike other two-party consent laws, it did not include any exceptions allowing citizens to record police openly (rather than secretly) or in public settings. It did however allow police to record many types of encounters with citizens. It also made illegally recording police, prosecutors or judges a Class 1 felony&#8212;with a sentence of four to 15 years in prison&#8212;but made illegally recording a private citizen a Class 4 felony, with a lower sentencing range of one to three years in prison. </p>

                <p>And in fact the government often enforced the law against people who recorded their interactions with police or others in government. For example, in 2009 <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-10/news/ct-met-drew-obit-20120510_1_eavesdropping-case-eavesdropping-law-separate-case">Christopher Drew</a> was charged with a felony for recording police as they arrested him for selling his artwork on a downtown Chicago sidewalk. In 2010 <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2010/12/07/the-war-on-cameras/singlepage">Michael Allison</a> was charged with a felony for carrying a tape recorder into his own court hearing after the court refused to provide him with a court reporter. ("You violated my right to privacy," the judge told him in open court.)</p>

                <p>That same year <a href="http://huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/08/chicago-district-attorney-recording-bad-cops_n_872921.html">Tiawanda Moore</a> was charged with a felony because she recorded conversations with internal affairs investigators at a Chicago police station after they seemed to be unconcerned about her report of an officer's unwanted sexual advances. (<a href="http://huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/25/tiawanda-moore-acquitted-_n_936313.html">A jury acquitted her.</a>) </p>

                <p>Critics charged that, by preventing people from recording police and others, the law violated the right to free speech. The courts ultimately agreed. In 2012 the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4027403108062769854">ACLU v. Alvarez</a> that the statute likely violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> by preventing citizens from openly recording police officers who were performing their duties in public and speaking loud enough for bystanders to hear them. The US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois later <a href="http://leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020121226755/THE%20AMERICAN%20CIVIL%20LIBERTIES%20UNION%20v.%20ALVAREZ">concluded</a> that the statute indeed violated the First Amendment as applied to that specific conduct.  </p>

                <p>In 2014 the Supreme Court of Illinois struck down the entire statute because it was overbroad and violated the First Amendment in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=437647649824346296">People v. Clark</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15863799197189380538">People v. Melongo</a>. The court held that the law was not narrowly tailored to serve the government's interest in protecting people's privacy because it prohibited recording not only private conversations but also public conversations, including "public interactions of police officers with citizens."</p>

                <p>Before the end of the year the Illinois General Assembly passed, and outgoing Governor of Illinois Pat Quinn signed, the new eavesdropping law, which is similar in many ways to the old one. Like the old law, the new statute prohibits recording a conversation without the consent of all parties&#8212;though now only when the recording is made "surreptitiously" and at least one party to the conversation has a "reasonable expectation" of privacy.</p>

                <p>Like the old law, the new statute punishes unlawfully recording police, prosecutors and judges more harshly than it punishes unlawfully recording anyone else&#8212;though it does not punish it as severely as before. Now unlawfully recording a conversation with a police officer, prosecutor or judge is a Class 3 felony, with a prison sentence of two to four years, while recording a conversation with anyone else is a Class 4 felony, with a sentence of one to three years. So, to be sure, the new law is less offensive in some respects than the old one. </p>

                <p>But it still has serious problems. For one, it is vague. It does not explain how to determine whether someone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, so citizens often cannot know whether recording a given conversation would be legal or a crime. Courts consider questions of when and where someone has a reasonable expectation of privacy on a case-by-case basis, considering numerous factors, usually in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_of_privacy">context</a> of determining whether police conducted a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> "search." It is not reasonable to expect ordinary people to know that entire body of case law, let alone apply it to their own unique circumstances on the fly.</p>

                <p>True, the Seventh Circuit and Supreme Court of Illinois have said that police do not have an expectation of privacy in "public" encounters with citizens, so it should be legal under this law to record police in public. But the courts did not explain what counts as a "public" interaction, so even someone familiar with those decisions could not be sure whether it would be legal to record in many circumstances. As a result people who want to avoid spending years of their lives in prison are likely to avoid recording police (or anyone) anywhere, except perhaps in the most obviously public settings. </p>

                <p>And what about recording in private settings? Presumably that is where crooked cops and politicians prefer to perform their worst deeds, so people's right to record them there should receive at least as much protection as the right to record them in public. </p>

                <p>The new statute's focus on recording "surreptitiously" is not as big an improvement as it might seem. Surreptitious recording could after all be necessary to expose police misconduct&#8212;so banning it could help prevent exposure of misconduct. </p>

                <p>The statute overall appears to be designed, like the old one, to protect and privilege police. Although the maximum sentence under the new law is shorter than the former maximum, the statute still gives longer jail terms to people who record police, prosecutors and judges. The only apparent purpose for that is to make people especially afraid to record police, prosecutors and judges. The new law also allows police to record certain interactions with citizens and to secretly eavesdrop on citizens' conversations for 24 hours without a warrant during investigations of certain crimes.</p>

                <p>In sum, the new law criminalizes recording to the maximum extent that current case law allows. It is a blanket ban on recording without consent, with a narrow carve-out for the (mostly unspecified) circumstances in which courts have said that the state must allow recording, with special punishments for citizens who unlawfully record police and special privileges for police who record citizens. If a legislature wanted to discourage recording&#8212;especially of interactions with police&#8212;as much as possible, it would pass this law.</p>

                <p>Will the court uphold it? It should not. Because citizens often cannot know in advance whether recording a conversation is legal, the law is unconstitutionally vague and violates <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process</a>. And because the statute's vagueness will deter people from making recordings for fear of prosecution, it also frustrates free speech and violates the First Amendment.</p>

                <p>But before the courts can weigh in on the statute, the legislature should just repeal it. Any replacement should, at a minimum, explicitly protect people's right to record their own interactions with government officials regarding their official duties, regardless of when or where they occur. The overwhelming majority of states respect that right, and Illinois has no justification for not doing so&#8212;especially given its well-known history of crime and corruption at all levels of government. If their legislators will not do that much, Illinoisans should question whose interests they are looking out for.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/faculty-staff/profile.cfm?Id=541">Mohamed 'Arafa</a> of Alexandria University (Egypt) and Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, discusses the recent Egyptian criminal court's order of a retrial of Muslim Brotherhood followers and whether the Egyptian criminal justice system should reform to stop the violation of international human rights ... </p><strong>R</strong>ecently, an Egyptian Criminal Court ordered a retrial for some of the Muslim Brotherhood's followers convicted in a mass <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/egyptian-court-orders-retrial-for-152-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">trial</a> in 2014. Some of them were sentenced to the death penalty, and others were punished to life imprisonment for their criminal roles in the violent criminal activities against Coptic Christians and their houses of worship along with murder, attempted murder, threatening public order and scorching some police stations. The attacks are believed to be considered as retaliation's intent for Egyptian security services' forceful scattering of the exiled Islamist President Mohammad Morsi from Office in a popular coup lead by the general public and supported by the military. In the summer of 2014, an Egyptian criminal court in El-Minya confirmed interim death verdicts imposed after a speedy trial that cruelly breached the defendants' due process guarantees rights. In this regard, it was significant for the Egyptian's judiciary to assure that all of the defendants have a quick retrial in accordance with international law principles, especially regarding the fair and just trial standards.</p>

<p>Under the Egyptian criminal justice system, and according to <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/research/Egypt/Criminal%20Procedures.pdf">Egyptian Criminal Procedural Code No. 150 </a> [PDF] of 1950, the country's attorney (prosecutor) general along with the defendants have the option to spontaneously appeals death penalties to the <em>mahkmet al-naqd</em> Supreme Court (Court of Cassation), which can order a retrial and if the retrial results in the same ruling, the defense attorney may again ask the court to grant <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/06/21/egypt-183-death-sentences-confirmed-minya">a retrial procedure</a>. According to Article 2 of the <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/egypt-constitution-approved-by-98-of-voters.php">Egyptian Constitution 2014</a>, "Islam is the State's religion ... and the principles of the <em>Sharie'a</em> is the principal source of legislation." In light of this provision's interpretation, the law of God requires that intentional and serious criminals be put to death which means the <em>lex talionis</em> (equality principle) through satisfying the victims' feelings and then social peace will maintain. Some very classical Islamic scholars argued that Islamic norms are immutable, based on the Supreme Constitutional Court's decision in 1991 on the interpretation of the <em>Sharie'a</em> values. However, the court believes that the <em>Sharie'a</em> law include "relative" philosophies and "updated or modern" doctrines which are capable of being adjusted within the social future development through <em>ijtihad</em> (individual reasoning) and <em>Qiyyass</em> (analogy) and without any paradox to the main <em>maqasid</em> or <em>darouriat</em> (objectives or bulk) of the <em>Sharie'a</em> law (protection of mind, religion, life, property and <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2190217">prosperity</a>). In this domain, the most conventional religious jurists go as far as to claim the renovation of the death penalty for all crimes specified in the <em>Qur'an</em> (e.g., adultery) and others moderate Islamic intellectuals argued for the restoration of the <em>diyyahh</em> whereby criminals can be pardoned (forgiven) by their victim's family by giving them compensation (<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2547327">damages</a>). </p>

<p>The original trial was in obvious defilement of the Egyptian constitutional rules, human rights and international law standards. Egypt's constitution stipulates that all those accused of a criminal offense are "presumed innocent until proven guilty in a fair legal trial in which the right to defend oneself is guaranteed" (presumption of <a href="http://www.sis.gov.eg/Newvr/Dustor-en001.pdf">innocence</a> [PDF]). The Egyptian Constitution does not refer to corporal punishment, but confirmed a certain number of guarantees concerning the respect of individual public rights and freedoms, and it proscribes arbitrary detention and torture and reads that every person "should be judged swiftly by an independent justice and has the right to legal assistance by one's chosen defense <a href="http://www.sis.gov.eg/Newvr/Dustor-en001.pdf">attorney</a> [PDF]." Further, "any citizen arrested, detained or whose freedom is restricted shall be treated in a manner concomitant with the preservation of his dignity. No physical or moral harm is to be inflicted upon him. He may not be detained ... except in places defined by laws ... [p]risons. If a confession is proved to have been made by a person under any of ... duress or coercion, it shall be considered invalid and futile." Moreover, [the] "[P]enalty shall be personal. There shall be no crime or penalty except by virtue of law. No penalty shall be inflicted except by a judicial order. Penalty shall be inflicted only for acts committed subsequent to the promulgation of the law prescribing them." The first trial has been violating all of these concepts which represents a direct transgression to the international standards in which Egypt committed to, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ("UDHR") and the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> ("ICCPR").</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Egyptian Penal Code along with the terrorism laws defines terrorism as: <blockquote>[A]ny recourse to force, violence, threats or intimidation falling within the context of a criminal itinerary [criminal conspiracy] by an individual or a group aimed at disrupting public order, risking public security and safety, if this results in injuring, terrorizing individuals or endangering their lives, freedoms, security or causing damage to the environment, means of transport [communication], public or private property, ... [or] hindering authorities, places of worship, ... from carrying out their functions, or deterring the application of the [c]onstitution, laws or <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/egyptian-president-must-reject-flawed-anti-terrorism-laws-2014-04-09">regulations</a>.</blockquote> International activists described this statute, as very imprecise yet broad wording, can be abused since it includes an extensive and vague definition of terrorism and can therefore interpreted and serves to increase various sorts of crimes punishable by <a href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/egyptsource/egypt-s-new-terrorism-law">death</a>. The problem is the deep flaw on "terrorist offenses" term is that possibly permit the authorities to bring a terrorism case against any peaceful activist that infringes mainly the right to free expression, dents safeguards against torture and arbitrary custody, does not overtly state that "confessions" extracted under torture are null and disqualified as criminal evidence and expands the scope of application of the death <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/research/egypt-constitution.html">penalty</a>. The death penalty can be inflicted only for the gravest crimes, according to legal and constitutional procedures. In sum, this sentence can only be applied by virtue of a final verdict about a crime punishable by death at the time of its commission. </p>

<p>The Penal Code sets this punishment for various <a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/3f827fc44.html">crimes</a>.  Legally speaking, crimes of this punishment are tried by the criminal circuits of the Courts of Appeal in which the criminal rules does not offer a fair system of reasonable administration of justice which constitutes a breach of the UN Safeguards ensuring defense of the rights of those facing the <a href="http://www.un.org/documents/ecosoc/res/1996/eres1996-15.htm">death sentence</a>. The Penal law obliged the court to pass the case file to the <em>Mufti</em> (religious leader) for his opinion, before pronouncing this sentence decision to make sure if it is compatible with Islamic criminal law rules or not. Therefore, the public prosecutor must refer any case resulting in this penalty to the Supreme Court as a <em>memorandum</em>, recording his opinion and within 60 days following the ruling of the penalty which must have been given in the presence of the defendant. The court's appeal should be done: <blockquote>[I]n three months of its being lodged and the court must give its decision within a maximum of two months after the appeal has been heard. In all cases, the appeal process postpones the execution. If the appeal is accepted, the court may decide to set aside the verdict appealed or submitted to it for its opinion by the prosecution and to send the case back to the court of first instance for a retrial and if the appeal rejected, the ruling becomes final and the death penalty activate.</blockquote>  </p>

<p>In Egyptian law, execution can be postponed by retrial's request, as the right to demand a retrial belongs exclusively to the prosecution, the defendant [or legal representative, etc.].  The retrial request is only admissible: <blockquote>[I]n case of a sentence for murder and when it turns out that the victim is still alive; when, after sentencing, a new verdict sentences another accused for the same crime; when one of the witnesses who has been heard was, subsequent to the sentence, tried and sentenced for perjury against the accused; when the decision is based on a judgment which was later annulled and when, after sentencing, a fact is produced or comes to light, or when evidence not known at the time of the hearing is produced and is of such nature as to establish the innocence of the accused.</blockquote> In case that an appeal or retrial request has denied, the justice minister systematically refers the case file to the president to approve the ruling or grant pardon. Sometimes, these abuses are tolerated by the authorities, under the cover of ensuring public order and national security and that considers a severe violation of universal norms, especially concerning the <a href="http://www.apt.ch/en/uncat/">Convention Against Torture and Inhumane Punishment</a>.  </p>

<p>In conclusion, and for practical considerations, it is highly recommended that the Egyptian legislature to adopt a cessation policy on executions, as a first step to abolish the death penalty in most cases&#8212;unless it seems significant in some situations&#8212;in conformity with the international instruments. Additionally, restraining various misconducts punishable by death to those which have serious or lethal consequences according to universal ideals is suggested. Also, ensuring the observation of the Code of Criminal Procedure on those sentenced to death, by counseling them of the decision of the court, setting up a legal remedy to appeal the judgments of the State Security Criminal Courts and guarantee that the conditions of detention for those punished to death and all other prisoners, are harmonious with the respect to human dignity. Further, training criminal judges and law enforcement officers to stand with the principle of inadmissibility of confessions obtained under torture, as provided in the domestic legislation and international jurisdiction along with supporting projects of the Egyptian civil society organizations. Exceptional measures, which are flagrant ruins of human rights should be banned and criminal laws should be more precise in defining the concept of "terrorist activities" then, and only then, there is no need to worry about the punishment's legality. </p>

<p>As a question on the <em>Sharie'a</em> on the death penalty eradication, and based on the constitutional's moderate interpretation of Islamic norms, as Islam should familiarize to the fluctuations which have come about since the Prophet Mohammad's period, addressing <em>Talion Law</em> is an outdated practice which should be swapped by the legislature and the judiciary to end up the debate on death penalty not only in Egypt but also in the Islamic world. For decades, reprisal no longer institutes the basis for punishment, as any development appears to aggregate law's secularization, the purpose of which is to isolate the Prince's law from God's law. Regrettably, the rise in various forms of fundamentalism is not favorable to this expansion.</p>

<p>Egyptian policy of patronage and nepotism has further compromised justice independence. As with other state bodies, the judiciary is fashioned by favoritism, and the selection process is far from meritocratic (e.g., judges' family members or relations are often appointed to judgeships even poor academic credentials that exclude them). Under this status quo, if the judiciary continues generate "special circuits" within the regular criminal courts to try high-profile cases and targeting specific individuals via speedy trials that will lead to non-independence, more demoralized judiciary and will influence the outcome of the legal cases. Fortuitously, Egypt's judicial system is far from monumental and is made up of several magistrates dedicated to crafting an autonomous judiciary that can defend Egyptians from government manipulations and reserve order. But until the rules overriding the judiciary are adjusted to pry it away from the presidency and Justice Ministry, Egypt's heritage of impartiality is condemned to be a detached past and nothing more than an echoing talent.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=http://www.sandiego.edu/law/faculty/profiles/bio.php?ID=731">Steven Smith</a>, of the University of San Diego School of Law, discusses the significance surrounding the decision made in Holt v. Hobbs and our nation's commitment to religious freedom ...</p><strong>I</strong>n <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-6827_5h26.pdf">Holt v. Hobbs</a> [PDF], the US Supreme Court methodically applied the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/hce/rluipaexplain.php"> Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act</a> (RLUIPA) and ruled that a Muslim inmate in an Arkansas prison has a legal right to wear a half inch beard in accordance with his understanding of what his faith requires. A generation ago, such a decision would have been unremarkable. Today, when the nation's longstanding commitment to religious freedom is under challenge, the decision has modestly greater (though uncertain) significance.</p>

<p><em>Religious Freedom Under Challenge</em></p>

<p>The national commitment to religious freedom is manifest in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment"> First Amendment</a> and in statutes such as RLUIPA and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA). A couple of decades ago the commitment seemed securely anchored in public and academic opinion as well, reflecting an American tradition running back to Jefferson, Madison, William Penn and Roger Williams. Liberals such as Justice Brennan were the leading champions of religious freedom.</p>

<p>Much has changed over the last twenty years. In many sectors, religious freedom is now viewed as a sort of special interest policy mainly benefiting religious conservatives while obstructing efforts to end discrimination and to provide access to abortion and contraceptives. In the academic milieu, the classic justifications for protecting religious freedom offered by Jefferson ("Almighty God hath created the mind free"), Madison, Penn and Williams have largely been ruled out of order because they are theological in nature and thus inadmissible in a public discourse that aspires to be secular (or so many academics think). Consequently, the special commitment to religious freedom may come to seem like a historically contingent artifact without contemporary justification. <a href="http://www.law.virginia.edu/lawweb/faculty.nsf/FHPbI/2210483"> Douglas Laycock</a>, a leading scholar and litigator in this field, thus notes that, <blockquote> "[f]or the first time in nearly three hundred years, important forces in American society are questioning the free exercise of religion <em>in principle</em>&#8212;suggesting that free exercise of religion may be a bad idea, or at least, a right to be minimized."</blockquote></p>

<p>The resistance to any vigorous commitment to religious freedom was apparent in the shrill (and often mendacious) denunciations of Arizona's modest effort to strengthen its religious freedom law and in the outcry over the court's unpretentious <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sebelius-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/">Hobby Lobby</a> decision. There is no getting around the fact, of course, that commitments to religious freedom are expressed in the Constitution and in pertinent statutes. So opponents typically do not repudiate religious freedom <em>per se</em>; rather they argue for limitations that would seriously constrict the scope and significance of these legal protections.</p>

<p>One such limitation, vigorously urged by a small group of law professors, is sometimes described (by them, at least) as the "third-party harms doctrine." Since the mid-twentieth century, justices and commentators have sometimes worried about a "conflict between the clauses"&#8212;between the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/free_exercise_clause">Free Exercise Clause</a>. The former was interpreted by the Supreme Court to mean that government cannot <em>advance</em> religion; the latter was construed to mean that government had some obligation to <em>accommodate</em> religion. But isn't "accommodating" a form of "advancing"? The court didn't think so, but without ever providing meaningful clarification the court did occasionally acknowledge that accommodation could go so far as to be a form of unconstitutional advancement. Proponents of the "third-party harms doctrine" have recently excavated some language and results from these old cases to construct an ostensible doctrine that would prohibit government from accommodating religious practice if such accommodation would impose harms or costs on third parties.</p>

<p>The basic idea seems hard to square with the most famous form of religious accommodation&#8212;namely, exemption from military service for religious objectors. If a Quaker is excused from serving in the military, and perhaps in Vietnam, someone else presumably will have to do it: if that is not a harm, it is hard to know what would be. The third-party harms doctrine was scarcely noticed by the court in <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span>. As we will see, however, proponents believe that <span class="casename">Holt</span> offers some help, or at least hope, for their <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2015/01/holt-v-hobbs-and-third-party-harms.html">argument</a>. </p>

<p><em>Reaffirming Religious Freedom&#8212;For Now</em></p>

<p>In this fraught context, probably the most obvious and important feature of <span class="casename">Holt</span> is that it is a unanimous decision that unhesitatingly applies a statute requiring religious accommodation. Along the way, the decision reaffirms understandings that ought to be plain enough but that can become obfuscated under the exigencies of advocacy (as the debate about the <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> case reflected).</p>

<p>Thus, the court made clear that in order to justify a burden on someone's religion, the government cannot merely recite some general policy of importance (like "equality" or "health"); it must show, rather, that a specific and "compelling" interest would be frustrated without compliance <em>by the religious objector</em>. Thus, "prison security" is surely an important interest; but it does not follow that prisons must forbid Muslims from wearing short beards. The court also persuasively explained that so long as an individual's claim is sincere, it is not defeated by the fact that some people who adhere to the same general religion do not share a specific objector's understanding of what the religion requires. Some Muslim men may not believe their religion obligates them to wear beards; many Catholics are not conscientiously opposed to contraception. These facts are simply irrelevant in considering the claims of objectors who <em>do</em> sincerely believe these things. The court's unanimity in <span class="casename">Holt</span> indicates the solidity of these understandings.</p>

<p>Or does it? When we learn that a foreign dictator has reportedly been reelected with the support of 95 percent of the voters, we are naturally suspicious. I confess to having analogous suspicions when, in a deeply contested controversy (such as the controversy over the "ministerial exception" three years in<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/10-553"> Hosanna-Tabor</a>), the Supreme Court offers a unanimous decision about which some of the justices might have been expected to have reservations. Was there some behind-the-scenes arm-twisting? That seems pretty unlikely in a case like <span class="casename">Holt</span>. But justices are busy people, with lots of cases to decide. So could it be that one or more justices did not pay full attention to what the court was saying, or did not quite bother to grasp the larger stakes of the controversy or did not have the time to write a dissenting or concurring opinion registering reservations about what was contained in the majority opinion?</p>

<p>There is no way to be sure. For now, we can say that <span class="casename">Holt</span> straightforwardly and unanimously reaffirmed the received commitment to religious accommodation. Whether the justices will remember to say similar things when the controversy involves not a Muslim prisoner who wants to wear a beard but instead a traditional Christian who is religiously opposed to, say, some aspect or application of an anti-discrimination law...well, we shall see.</p>

<p><em>The "Third-Party Harms Doctrine"?</em></p>

<p>Two justices&#8212;Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor&#8212;did take the trouble to write short concurring opinions. Joined by Sotomayor, Ginsburg explained that she was joining the majority opinion because accommodating the Muslim prisoner "would not detrimentally affect others who do not share the petitioner's belief."  Proponents of the "third-party harms doctrine" promptly seized on this sentence and declared it to be the most notable feature of the decision. They think&#8212;although critics dispute&#8212;that the sentence supplies at least provisional validation for their position. </p>

<p>Are the proponents right? They claim to be expounding a limit derived from the Establishment Clause, but Ginsburg said nothing about the Establishment Clause. No one believes that the obligation to accommodate religious objectors is absolute; accommodation always involves some "balancing" of interests and impact on third parties will always figure in that balancing. Ginsburg may merely have been acknowledging this obvious fact. Still, she did go to the trouble of writing separately to underscore the concern; that makes it look like she was trying to do more than acknowledge what everyone understands anyway.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the proponents correctly interpret what Ginsburg was trying to say in her terse observation. A follow-up question would then arise. Which is more significant? The fact that Ginsburg made the point? Or the fact that only one of her colleagues saw fit to join her (even though it would have been surpassingly easy to do so)? Does Ginsburg's sentence portend a new jurisprudential development? Or has she simply replaced Justice Stevens (who did present a similar argument in Establishment Clause terms) as the lonely representative of an outlier position that has never gotten any traction on the court?</p>

<p>There is no way to answer this question on the basis of the decision itself. The answer will depend on what the court sees fit to do in future cases. And probably on other developments. Like who is elected to be the next President, perhaps. And, more broadly, whether public support for religious freedom persists or declines.</p>

<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>

<p>Lawyers, law professors and advocates generally will push <span class="casename">Holt</span> in one direction or another, as their various causes and agendas dictate; that is what lawyers, law professors and advocates do. Just in itself, and for now, <span class="casename">Holt</span> stands as a modest reaffirmation of the traditional understanding that religious freedom is a central American commitment and that religious freedom means that government ought to accommodate religious beliefs and practices unless there is some "compelling" reason not to.</p>

		<title>Seselj&amp;apos;s Provisional Release: Hate Speech, International Criminal Procedure and Transitional Justice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://cuhk.academia.edu/GregoryGordon/Activity">Gregory S. Gordon</a> of <a href="http://www.law.cuhk.edu.hk/">The Chinese University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law</a>, discusses the decision of the International Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia to grant provisional release to Vojislav Seselj and its repercussions on international criminal law and transitional justice...</p><strong>T</strong>he ongoing seven-year debacle that is the trial of <a href="http://icty.org/x/cases/seselj/ind/en/seslj3rdind071207e.pdf">indicted</a> [PDF] Serb nationalist leader Vojislav Seselj continues. In the <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/yugoslav-war-crimes-tribunal-refuses-to-revoke-release-of-serb-nationalist.php">latest twist</a>, the International Criminal Tribunal (ICTY) for the Former Yugoslavia has <a href="http://icty.org/x/cases/seselj/tdec/en/150113.pdf">denied</a> [PDF] the prosecution's request to revoke its <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/serb-nationalist-released-from-icty-custody-for-health-reasons.php">recent order provisionally releasing</a> Seselj on health grounds. Since he decamped to Serbia, Seselj has been <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/accused-war-criminal-seselj-draws-thousands-serbia-rally-181251886.html">publicly</a> spewing the kind of hate rhetoric that is the object of some of the most serious criminal charges against him. Sadly the provisional release, as well as denial of the prosecutor's request to revoke it, is of a piece with a pattern of case mismanagement that has plagued this proceeding from the start. And in this particular instance, it allows us to understand the pernicious effects of hate speech, not just in the usual context of substantive international criminal law, but in the procedural realm as well, where it can have an adverse impact on transitional justice.  </p>

<p>With respect to case mismanagement, Seselj's provisional release and denial of the prosecutor's motion for revocation represent only the most recent chapter in what has been a circus-like inquest. From the beginning the ICTY has made poor procedural choices in relation to an openly defiant, truculent defendant. An indicted Seselj surrendered himself to the ICTY in 2003 vowing to "destroy" the ICTY. And he wasted little time launching a campaign of in-court sabotage&#8212;grandstanding and speechifying while representing himself in the case. Based on this behavior, the ICTY sensibly <a href="http://icty.org/x/cases/seselj/tdec/en/030509.htm">assigned him legal counsel</a>. He then railed against that decision and went on a <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/serb-nationalist-war-crimes-defendant.php">hunger strike</a>. But the ICTY showed no backbone, <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/serb-war-crimes-defendant-ends-hunger.php">acceding to Seselj's demand</a>, fully aware that he would likely undermine the judicial process as his own attorney. And so it could have come as no surprise that he went on to abuse his self-representation license, disclosing the identities of protected witnesses, taunting and insulting trial participants and earning contempt of court citations on three separate occasions. As a result his trial progressed at a snail's pace.</p>

<p>Then another judicial blunder made the situation worse. After the close of evidence in Seselj's case, as the judges were deliberating, one of them <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/danish-judge-removed-from-war-crimes-tribunal-for-bias.php">sent out inappropriate written comments </a> about the merits of other ICTY cases. This necessitated a replacement, which further delayed the proceedings. In the meantime Seselj was diagnosed with liver cancer. He was operated on and underwent chemotherapy, but the cancer supposedly returned. In June 2014, the trial chamber <a href="http://icty.org/x/cases/seselj/tord/en/140613.pdf">scheduled a hearing</a> [PDF], <em>sua sponte</em>, to consider whether Seselj should be provisionally released to Serbia. But Serbia refused to guarantee the chamber's basic conditions assuring the security of witnesses and the integrity of the proceedings unless Seselj agreed to them first. He refused. And so provisional release was not granted.  </p>

<p>By November Seselj had supposedly furnished the judges with new "confidential" information about a deterioration of his health condition. This time without sharing the information with the Prosecutor or securing any guarantees from Seselj, the trial chamber simply <a href="http://icty.org/x/cases/seselj/tord/en/141106.pdf">released</a> [PDF] him (on the mere stated understanding, not agreed to by Seselj, that he would not try to contact or influence victims, nor obstruct justice and would appear before the chamber when ordered to do so). The haste of the decision and lack of process suggest the ICTY feared Seselj's imminent demise and was looking to avoid a repeat of the <a href="/currentawareness/milosevic.php">Slobodan Milosevic scenario</a>&#8212;when the defendant died in his Scheveningen detention cell after years of trial but before a verdict could be reached.</p>

<p>So Seslj was essentially whisked out of his cell to "provisional" freedom. He triumphantly returned to Serbia, insulting the ICTY, vowing he would never return to it and inciting crowds with the kind of invective used to persecute Croats and Muslims during the Balkan atrocities of the early 1990s. The European Parliament issued a <a href="http://europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION&reference=B8-2014-0304&language=EN">resolution</a> condemning this inflammatory rhetoric and the Croatian Parliament <a href="http://balkaninsight.com/en/article/european-parliament-adopts-resolution-on-seselj">urged</a> the ICTY to revoke the provisional release. The ICTY prosecutor then followed suit filing his motion to revoke that was denied with one judge dissenting. The two judges voting to dismiss justified their decision by describing the prosecution's motion as "inadmissible" because not timely filed and "unfounded" because in their opinion, Seselj's public statements did not "constitute an attempt to influence or threaten victims or witnesses." The prosecutor has appealed the decision.</p>

<p>Given Seselj's track record, it is mind-boggling that the ICTY would release him with these bare-bones, pro forma conditions, especially after he thumbed his nose at the trial chamber in June 2014 regarding witness safety and judicial integrity. And the decision looks even more ridiculous in light of Seselj's active schedule and robust public presentations, which call into question any claims that his health was rapidly deteriorating&#8212;something the prosecutor could have rebutted had he been given access to the records and a chance to respond. This lack of transparency and due process are merely the most recent procedural defects consistent with other ones that litter the case file. </p>

<p>What is of most concern, however, are the hate speech issues inherent in this procedural mess. And those flow from the anemic set of conditions in the provisional release order. It is <em>de rigeur</em> for a criminal trial judge to include as a condition of provisional release that, on pain of re-incarceration, the defendant refrain from engaging in the type of conduct that is the object of the criminal charges. One of the key considerations animating a judge's decision to provisionally release, as well as the conditions of release, is public safety. And yet a focal point of the case against Seselj is ethnic hate speech as a crime against humanity. But the provisional release order does not even allude to such conduct. Seselj indicated in June 2014 that he would flout the judicial process and suggested he would attack the objects of his ethnic hatred. It is simply unconscionable to unleash him on a vulnerable population, still in post-ethnic-cleansing transition, knowing that he would subject it to his verbal venom.  </p>

<p>International criminal law experts, <a href="http://vanderbilt.edu/jotl/manage/wp-content/uploads/Gordon-FINAL.pdf">myself included</a> [PDF], have written about the poisonous effects of hate speech in the lead up to and in the course of mass atrocity. But what about during the ensuing transitional justice process? More specifically what are the legal implications of a defendant's post-atrocity hate speech tacitly sanctioned by a provisional release order void of hate speech restrictions?  </p>

<p>Some might contend that provisional release conditions restrictive of speech impermissibly infringe on hallowed freedom of expression rights. But that argument rings hollow in the case of a defendant charged with the very kind of speech that is the object of the release conditions. Atrocity speech charges will typically be prosecuted in the context of fragile post-conflict societies still trying to overcome their psychic wounds. Hate speech not only re-opens those wounds, it tangibly risks dragging such societies back into the abyss of recurrent cycles of violence. It must be specifically enjoined in any provisional release order during the pendency of such cases. This is especially true given that provisionally-released defendants, who would otherwise be detained but for the indulgence of the bench, do not enjoy the same expansive rights as ordinary citizens.  </p>

<p>Free speech advocates may also claim that it is difficult to define such speech, further exacerbating the problem. But provisional release orders can incorporate by reference the kinds of speech identified in the indictment. That should provide effective notice to the defendant of the sort of conduct prohibited while at the same time protecting the public safety. Giving Seselj <em>carte blanche</em> to re-offend simply cannot be justified on freedom of expression grounds.</p>

<p>Much of the recent criticism of the ICTY has been directed toward its decisions regarding the substantive law&#8212;the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/yugoslavia-war-crimes-tribunal-overturns-convictions-of-two-croatia-generals.php">Gotovina</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/icty-overturns-ex-yugoslav-army-chiefs-war-crimes-conviction.php">Perisic</a> cases are prominent examples in that regard. But its procedural gaffes, especially in the high-profile cases, are equally deserving of censure. The cases of Milosevic, former Bosnian-Serb President <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/karadzic-icty-genocide-trial-ends.php">Radovan Karadzic</a> and General <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/ratko-mladic-opens-defense-at-un-genocide-trial.php">Ratko Mladic</a> have all been characterized by procedural bungling and interminable delays. In Milosevic's case it directly compromised justice. Time will tell whether that is true in the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/international_law/2009/11/why-the-icty-got-it-wrong-in-the-karad%C5%BEi%C4%87-appointment-of-counsel-decision.html">Karadzic</a> and Mladic matters as well. But in the case of Vojislav Seselj, there is no question of its deleterious effects on transitional justice, even before the conclusion of trial.  </p>

<p>Seselj's contempt of process and his manufactured delays with the complicity of the ICTY are bad enough for the transitional justice process. But allowing the silver-tongued radical Serb nationalist to direct his rhetorical blowtorch toward Bosnia's ethnic tinderbox not only smacks of procedural incompetence, it shows willful disregard for the victims of persecution and ethnic cleansing. Post-atrocity hate speech in this context deserves no protection. In fact, it should be proactively prohibited. The Seselj case has been the poster child for the ICTY's procedural dysfunctionality. But with a reasoned ruling from the Appeals Chamber acknowledging the harm of the provisional release order, the Seselj case can break out of its procedural rut and perhaps serve as a kind of bellwether for more coherent case management practice going forward. For the sake of the victims of ethnic cleansing, the legacy of the ICTY and true reconciliation in the region, such a result is devoutly to be wished. </p>

		<title>Yemen: A False Choice on Justice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Belkis Wille, Yemen researcher at <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>, discusses the current dilemma in Yemen...</p><strong>T</strong>he present global turmoil has intensified the debate over whether pursuing justice in fragile and transitional countries leads to instability. Yet Yemen has been brought to the brink of collapse at least in part by a failure to pay heed to demands for justice. Yemen's political class, with the tacit support of the main regional actors, may have helped bring about the country's instability, chaos and escalating violence.</p>

                <p>The Houthis staged an apparently successful coup in Yemen after months of careful groundwork. The once-marginalized northern Zaidi Shia group, now at the head of a well-organized and rapidly expanding insurgency, prefers to be called Ansar Allah. Ansar Allah fighters stormed the presidential palace on January 20 without major bloodshed. On January 22, the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi resigned, leaving Ansar Allah in <em>de facto</em> control.</p>

                <p>Former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ali+Abdullah+Saleh">Ali Abdullah Saleh</a>, who was forced to step down after more than three decades in power as a result of Yemen's 2011 uprising, played a vital role in securing the tribal alliances that allowed Ansar Allah's fighters to leave Saada, their northern stronghold, and occupy Sanaa, the capital, last September. People close to the events have told me that Saleh was also pivotal in ensuring that Yemen's armed forces did not oppose Ansar Allah when it seized Sanaa in September or surrounded the presidential palace in January.<br />
                    <br />
                    The 2011 uprising ended when, in a <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/gcc.htm">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> (GCC) initiative, Saleh handed over power to Hadi, the vice president. In return, Saleh received blanket immunity from prosecution for crimes during his 33-year rule. The agreement also shielded his aides from prosecution for "political crimes" that did not constitute terrorist acts.<br />
                    <br />
                    Despite the agreement, adopted into law in September 2012, Hadi decreed the creation of an independent commission of inquiry to investigate alleged rights abuses committed during the uprising, when government security forces killed scores of protesters. The commission was to recommend measures to hold those responsible to account and recommend redress to victims, but it was never created.<br />
                    <br />
                    During the transition period after Saleh's removal, the UN stipulated that the government should take "steps aimed at achieving national reconciliation and transitional justice, and measures to ensure that violations of human rights and humanitarian law do not occur in future." In response, the departing Hadi government's legal affairs minister had drafted a transitional justice law&#8212;but it is unlikely to be adopted any time soon.<br />
                    <br />
                    The government was not alone in shirking justice. As part of the transitional process, Yemen held a 10-month long National Dialogue Conference (NDC) that brought together many segments of society, with nine working groups, including one on transitional justice. But it could agree only a weak declaration due to the influence of Saleh's General People's Congress party. The best the Dialogue Conference could come up with was: "Human rights violators shall not elude accountability in accordance with the mechanisms defined by the transitional justice law"&#8212;hardly a ringing demand for justice.<br />
                    <br />
                    Moreover, the final Dialogue Conference report, published January 2014, stated that its recommendations "cannot contradict the GCC Initiative and its executive mechanism and its principles and cannot contradict with UN Security Council resolutions 2014 and 2051"&#8212;presumably including the immunity from prosecution for Saleh and his associates.<br />
                    <br />
                    No further steps were taken in 2014 to address past&#8212;or continuing&#8212;human rights abuses. Since he relinquished the presidency in 2011, Saleh has been able to remain in Sanaa and lead his party, which still has a majority of parliamentary seats and wields considerable power. Saleh's interference in the transitional arrangements led the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on him, as well as on two Ansar Allah commanders, in November, including a global travel ban and asset freezes. Hadi moved some Saleh relatives linked to abuses from their earlier posts, but gave them new ones.</p>

                <p>Had there been further steps for justice, including domestic criminal investigations, they may have stigmatized Saleh and peeled away his legitimacy. In other countries, steps toward prosecuting current or former leaders implicated in widespread abuses have severely diminished their political influence.</p>

                <p>While the diplomatic community has paid lip service to the need for justice, accountability and transparency, in private most foreign envoys have given priority to short-sighted notions of national interest and stability over public debate on individual rights. I have had meeting after meeting with foreign diplomats who insisted that Human Rights Watch's continued criticism of the immunity law and its calls for accountability, were&#8212;as one put it&#8212;tantamount to asking to "engulf Yemen in flames."<br />
                    <br />
                    The sad reality now is that Yemen has become "engulfed in flames"&#8212;and things could get worse. Had Saleh and his cronies been made to stand trial for their alleged wrongdoings, rather than given a squalid "get out of jail free card," it is hard to believe that he would have retained the political capital he has used to such destabilizing effect. Of course, the failure to bring Yemen's most powerful rights abusers to justice is not the sole driver of instability and conflict, and there have been many other contributing factors. But the positive impact of pursuing justice is often given short shrift when weighing competing factors in resolving conflicts. At least, as far as Yemen is concerned, there seems little doubt that Saleh has been the main beneficiary of the Yemeni government's failure&#8212;supported by influential allies&#8212;to address impunity.</p>

                <p>Yemen is certainly not the first country where ignoring atrocities has reinforced a culture of impunity. Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sierra Leone, Angola and Sudan, are just a few examples. Human Rights Watch has documented the unwelcome repercussions that can stem from the decision to overlook serious international crimes and include those implicated in human rights abuses in new governmental power structures in an effort to consolidate peace. These can include encouraging an atmosphere of mistrust and revenge that leaders can later manipulate to foment violence for their own political ends.</p>

                <p>Apart from the political argument in favor of effective transitional accountability mechanisms, one also must never forget the more fundamental issue&#8212;that justice is important as a matter of principle, a key element of the rule of law.</p>

                <p>In the short-term, it is easy to understand the temptation to forego justice in an effort to end armed conflict. Some politicians argue that the path to peace is more realistic and immediate if we don't hold abusers to account. However, Yemen is yet another reminder that a decision to ignore atrocities and to reinforce a culture of impunity may carry a high price.</p>

		<title>West Virginia Legislature Proposes Substantial Changes to Deliberate Intent Statute</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.bowlesrice.com/Attorneys/Attorneys/Edwards,-Christopher-Lee">Christopher Edwards</a>, of <a href="http://www.bowlesrice.com/Home.aspx">Bowles Rice, LLP</a> in Charleston, WV, discusses the proposed legislative changes to West Virginia's workers' compensation scheme ... </p><strong>W</strong>orkers' Compensation programs provide important benefits to both employees and employers. If an employee is injured or exposed to illness while on the job, the applicable Workers' Compensation Fund will attempt to compensate that employee for the impairment caused by his illness or injury by granting him a monetary award. In return for paying into the Workers' Compensation Fund, employers are generally immune from any tort liability that could arise as a result of that employee's damages.</p>

                <p>However, some workers' compensation schemes provide for an exception to this general rule of immunity that is commonly referred to as the "deliberate intent" exception. In these states, the deliberate intent exception is a narrow one that applies when an employer acts with a "deliberate intention" to harm its employee.</p>

                <p>The 1978 West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals case of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11059151547357696721">Mandolidis v. Elkins Indus., Inc.</a> was the catalyst that inspired West Virginia's current deliberate intent law. After <span class="casename">Mandolidis</span>, the West Virginia Legislature adopted several of the rules articulated in that decision.</p>

                <p>On its face, West Virginia's current deliberate intent statute is unexceptional. The statute mandates that a participating West Virginia employer can lose its workers' compensation immunity in two instances. The first such instance is when an employer acted with a consciously, subjectively and deliberately formed intent to injure or kill an employee. </p>

                <p>The second exception is broader and can only be met if five criteria are satisfied. These criteria can be summarized as requiring: </p>

                <p>(A) The existence of a specific unsafe working condition which presented a high degree of risk and a strong probability of serious injury/death; </p>

                <p>(B) The employer's actual knowledge of that specific unsafe working condition and the risk it posed; </p>

                <p>(C) That the specific unsafe working condition violated a state or federal safety statute, rule or regulation, or violated a commonly accepted and well-known safety standard (as demonstrated by written evidence) within the industry or business of the employer;</p>

                <p>(D) That despite the existence of the first three criteria, the employer nonetheless exposed the employee to the specific unsafe working condition; and </p>

                <p>(E) That the employee suffered a compensable injury or death as a result of being exposed to the specific unsafe working condition.     </p>

                <p>Pursuant to West Virginia law, all five of these elements must be met in order for a plaintiff/employee to successfully prove deliberate intent. Failure to satisfy even one of these elements necessitates that a deliberate intent claim be resolved in favor of the defendant/employer. However, in practice, this requirement is sometimes not strictly applied. As such, West Virginia has a relatively high number of deliberate intent cases per year, and parties routinely settle claims that would probably not be viable in other states.</p>

                <p>Ten members of the West Virginia House of Delegates and six members of the West Virginia Senate are trying to change the language of the state's deliberate intent statute in an effort to modify how it's applied. West Virginia <a href="http://www.legis.state.wv.us/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=hb2011%20intr.htm&yr=2015&sesstype=RS&i=2011">House Bill 2011</a> ("HB 2011") and <a href="http://www.legis.state.wv.us/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=sb11%20intr.htm&yr=2015&sesstype=RS&i=11">Senate Bill No. 11</a> ("SB 11") were introduced this January. The bills attempt to modify the deliberate intent statute in an effort to restrict that cause of action in West Virginia. Thus far, these efforts have concentrated exclusively on limiting the second method by which a plaintiff/employee can claim a case of deliberate intent.</p>

                <p>The original drafts of the bills proposed three changes to the second exception. Perhaps the most significant of these proposed changes was the addition of language that articulated what was necessary in order for a plaintiff/employee to satisfy the "actual knowledge" requirement of subparagraph (B), stated above. These bills made clear that "constructive knowledge," or proof of what an employer should have known, are not enough to satisfy the actual knowledge standard and further stated that such actual knowledge can never be presumed. The bills further noted that these proposed changes were in direct response to the 2013 West Virginia Supreme Court case <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17736554099785490621">McComas v. ACF Industries, LLC</a>. In that case, the West Virginia Supreme Court said that employers should not be allowed to turn a "blind eye" to workplace hazards. <span class="casename">McComas</span> further held that if a safety statute, rule, regulation or commonly accepted and well-known safety standard within the relevant industry imposed a specific duty upon the employer to inspect for a given danger and that such inspection would have revealed the specific unsafe working condition at issue, that the employer may be found to have actual knowledge of the specific unsafe working condition for purposes of subparagraph (B).</p>

                <p>On January 30, 2015, the West Virginia House Judiciary Committee substituted the original draft of HB 2011 for a modified version of the bill. This new version both adds to and subtracts from the changes proposed in the original draft, but nonetheless contains similar language explaining the requirements necessary for a plaintiff/employee to satisfy the actual knowledge prong of subparagraph (B).</p>

                <p>There have been mixed reactions to the bills. Proponents argue the proposed changes would make West Virginia's deliberate intent law more consistent with the law of other states. These proponents further claim that such tort reform is necessary in order to attract new business to the state and protect existing businesses from expensive litigation. Supporters of the bill also point out that deliberate intent lawsuits will remain an option when an employer acts intentionally or truly possessed actual knowledge of the specific unsafe working condition. Opponents argue the bill puts the state's workers at risk and unfairly insulates businesses from liability. This opposition cites events like the 2010 Big Branch mine disaster as proof that West Virginia needs a robust deliberate intent law.</p>

                <p>While the bills being considered in the legislature are still in their early stages, this proposed legislation could result in significant changes to the deliberate intent law of a state that has historically applied that law in a very distinctive way. While tort reform is usually not the most publicized of issues, anyone who has a job or runs a business in West Virginia could be affected by this change that would modify more than 35 years of West Virginia's Workers' Compensation law. Such a proposed change is certainly worth following.</p>

		<title>Haselwander v. McHugh: DC Circuit Restores Fairness to Its Review of the Boards for the Correction of Military Records</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.militarylawpro.com/profile.html">Raymond J. Toney</a> of the <a href="http://www.militarylawpro.com/">Law Offices of Raymond J. Toney</a> discusses recent changes to the US military's records review process ...</p><strong>S</strong>ince the 1989 decision of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=347178003450003343">Kreis v. Secretary of the Air Force</a>, in which the court held that the already deferential standard of review of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/part-I/chapter-5">Administrative Procedure Act</a> (APA) was not deferential enough for decisions of the Boards for the Correction of Military Records (BCMR), plaintiffs contemplating a judicial challenge to such decisions have had to seriously ponder whether "the game is worth the candle." The DC Circuit employed the gambler metaphor in concluding that the broad congressional grant of discretion to the military secretaries in correcting military records, found at <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/1552">10 USC &sect; 1552</a>, required the courts to apply an "unusually deferential" standard of APA review to BCMR decisions. The consequence of its decision, the court noted, was that "[p]erhaps only the most egregious decisions may be prevented under such a deferential standard of review."</p>

                <p>Twenty-five years on, <span class="casename">Kreis</span> has been widely applied, with arguably disastrous consequences for military personnel and veterans seeking judicial examination of BCMR decisions. The APA's inaptly named "arbitrary and capricious" standard (which fails to include analysis of whether the case at bar is "unsupported by substantial evidence" and/or is "otherwise not in accordance with law") already afforded ample deference to military decisions. With <span class="casename">Kreis</span> added to it, the courts merely need to engage in a connect-the-dots exercise of finding a "rational connection between the facts found and the choice made." This is not an onerous task. <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/DAED_a_00106">As one expert has noted</a> [PDF], the unusual deference accorded to the military means "[it] typically has little to fear from the federal courts."</p>

                <p>A recent decision from the DC Circuit, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3266046013353527365">Haselwander v. McHugh</a>, may change that, if only slightly. While the panel's decision obviously does not overrule <span class="casename">Kreis</span>, it does spell out a three-step process of review that helps restore considerations of fairness and justice to what has arguably become a review process largely unconcerned with those matters. The first two steps explained by the court are familiar and uncontroversial: the court owes the district court no particular deference and reviews BCMR decisions <em>de novo</em> and the court must set aside BCMR decisions not supported by reasoned decisionmaking." It is the final step that offers plaintiffs and appellants a glimmer of hope. </p>

                <p>Reaching for assistance from the US Claims Court, the predecessor to the US Court of Federal Claims and the Federal Circuit, the DC Circuit in <span class="casename">Haselwander</span> approvingly quoted <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9604894679674906800">Yee v. United States</a>, stating, "[W]hen a correction board fails to correct an injustice clearly presented in the record before it, it is acting in violation of its statutory mandate." It also quotes <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12478148497391516700">Caddington v. United States</a>: "We feel that the Secretary and his boards have an abiding moral sanction to determine, insofar as possible, the true nature of an alleged injustice and to take steps to grant thorough and fitting relief." "Applying these principles to the case at hand," the DC Circuit concluded that the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records (ABCMR) "failed to fulfill its statutory mandate and that the denial of Haselwander's application was arbitrary and capricious."</p>

                <p>The facts of the case are illuminating. Mr. Haselwander was serving in Vietnam when an enemy rocket exploded near his tent and injured him. He was taken to an aid station where he was bandaged and photographed. While he was being medically tended, he learned that some of his dogs (he served with the 49th Infantry Scout Dog Platoon) had also been injured in the attack and he immediately left to assist them. He flew with one of the wounded dogs to a veterinary hospital. The medical staff that treated Mr. Haselwander apparently did not complete his paperwork. The Army did not award him the Purple Heart for his wounds. </p>

                <p>Mr. Haselwander first applied to the ABCMR in 2007. He requested that his records be corrected to show that he was awarded the Purple Heart. He supplied photographs of himself in bandages taken on the day of the attack and identified witnesses to the attack, one of whom did receive the Purple Heart. The ABCMR denied his application, stating, "[T]here is no available evidence of record to show that the applicant was treated for a wound that was sustained as the result of enemy action."</p>

                <p>Mr. Haselwander applied a second time, providing additional evidence in the form of letters from fellow soldiers who were eyewitnesses to the rocket attack, to Mr. Haselwander's wounds and to his medical treatment. He also provided a "Daily Staff Journal" of June 6, 1966 that noted the rocket attack and the human and canine casualties of the attack. The journal entry did not identify the victims by name. The ABCMR again denied his application. According to the Board, "[T]he available evidence is not sufficiently substantiating to show that the applicant was wounded as the result of hostile action, that he received medical treatment for any such wound and that such medical treatment was made a matter of official record."</p>

                <p>In 2010, Mr. Haselwander sought review of the ABCMR decisions in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The error alleged by Haselwander was the failure of the Army to record his injuries and medical treatment. He contended the ABCMR's decision not to correct his records and award him a Purple Heart was arbitrary, capricious and unsupported by substantial evidence. </p>

                <p>Rejecting Mr. Haselwander's claim, the court noted:</p>

                <blockquote>[I]t is patently clear from the record that the ABCMR's decision to deny a recommendation of correction with regard to plaintiff's military record was properly based on the lack of substantiating medical records, as required by the strict regulatory criteria for award of the Purple Heart. </blockquote>

                <p>Applying the "unusually deferential" standard of review initiated by <span class="casename">Kreis</span>, the court concluded, "because the record clearly shows that the ABCMR examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made, the ABCMR's decision was not unlawful."</p>

                <p>By the court's reasoning, because the medical staff treating Mr. Haselwander failed to complete paperwork for his injuries (seemingly because Mr. Haselwander left medical treatment to assist the wounded dogs), no official medical records of his injuries existed and because no medical records of his injuries existed, Mr. Haselwander was not entitled to the Purple Heart. The court was technically correct: if there is no medical record, and there was none, the criteria for awarding the Purple Heart are not met. The court evinced no concern that the Army might have erred by failing to complete a medical record that would have entitled Mr. Haselwander to the Purple Heart or that the purpose of the ABCMR is to remedy such errors. </p>

                <p>Reversing the district court, the DC Circuit found that the ABCMR "misapprehends its powers and duties as a record correction body when it denies an application because the applicant's records are incomplete. The void in Haselwander's medical records is the very error that he seeks to have corrected..." The ABCMR's decision, the court concluded, "defies reason and is devoid of any evidentiary support" and is "patently unfair," "myopic" and "unworthy of any deference." A starker contrast with the view of the court is hard to imagine.</p>

                <p><span class="casename">Haselwander</span> illustrates well the blunt instrument that the "unusually deferential" standard of review so often is. Having no concern for the fairness of a decision rendered pursuant to a statute that arguably has fairness as its raison d'&ecirc;tre, <span class="casename">Kreis</span> is ill conceived, notwithstanding the logic and precedent on which it is based. A judicial filter so coarse that only the "most egregious" military decisions are prevented, while "merely egregious" ones get a pass, is repugnant to the principle of co-equal government, not to mention justice. And courts should not have to choose between following the letter of <span class="casename">Kreis</span> and ignoring the remedial spirit of 10 USC &sect; 1552. <span class="casename">Haselwander</span> points in the right direction.</p>

		<title>Application of Due Process to Consumer Online Dispute Resolution</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Anastasia Konina, an LL.M student at the <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a>, discusses how due process rights should be applied in the case of consumer online dispute resolution...</j:header><strong>R</strong>ecent years have witnessed the increasing privatization of enforcement institutions in several areas of European law, including consumer law. With the changes to the EU consumer protection law brought by the Regulation on Consumer Online Dispute Resolution (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0001:0012:EN:PDF">ODR Regulation</a>) and the Directive on Consumer Alternative Dispute Resolution (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0063:0079:EN:PDF">ADR Directive</a>), both adopted in 2013, the EU will be the first one to create an out-of-court dispute resolution system that can be used in buyer-to-consumer transactions. The ADR Directive will allow consumers to refer to private dispute resolution entities in the case of disputes involving different kinds of goods and services purchased online and offline. Disputes arising from online transactions will be referred to a Union-wide ODR platform, which will then transfer the case to an appropriate ADR entity. It is anticipated that the ODR platform will be launched in January 2016.</p>

<p>The supporters of using ODR have pointed out the following advantages of the new system: time and cost savings, greater control of the parties over the proceedings and convenience of the procedure. At the same time, the proposed system of consumer rights enforcement has been heavily criticized for a number of reasons, such as "putting efficiency above judicial scrutiny," loss of public access, pressure due to general confidentiality of ADR and ODR proceedings and banning access to courts. While national judicial enforcement systems are increasingly losing their importance, the opponents of changes raise a general question concerning the legitimacy of the new "private" system of consumer rights enforcement and a more specific issue which relates to compliance of new mechanisms with the due process requirements. As was once noted by Dr. Jürgen Bast, "certain requirements of procedural due process are recognized in EU law as fundamental rights." Therefore, Dr. Bast concludes that "recognition of fundamental rights as an integral part of the union legal order implies that the member states have to respect these rights when they act within the scope of EU law." So when the member states are implementing the provisions of the ODR Regulation and the ADR Directive, they cannot derogate from certain due process requirements. </p>

<p>The primary sources of fundamental rights in the EU are the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf%23page=9">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [PDF] and the <a href="https://www.coe.int/t/ngo/Source/reading_guide_charter_en.pdf">EU Charter of Fundamental Rights</a>. Article 6(1) of the Convention contains the following due process requirements that need to be followed in the determination of civil rights: independent and impartial tribunal, trial within a reasonable time, access to court, right to a public hearing and right to a fair hearing. Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights establishes a broader list of due process rights: right to a fair hearing, right to a public hearing, hearing within a reasonable time, independent and impartial tribunal, access to counsel and the right to defense and representation. As was pointed out by Jonathan Cooper of Doughty Street Chambers, "Article 47 draws no distinction between civil and criminal matters. All that is required to engage the Article is the violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by EU law." </p>

<p>At the same time, the privatization and fragmentation of consumer rights enforcement is not merely a European, but an international trend. Several years before entry into force of the ADR Directive and the ODR Regulation, Professor Fabrizio Cafaggi noted that "[EU and US] are reshaping their global policies, redefining the balance between private and public enforcement." The most representative of such "redefinitions" is UNCITRAL Working Group III sessions on the <a href="http://files.elsa.org/Delegations/UNCITRAL/UNCITRAL_WG_III_27.pdf">Draft Procedural Rules for Online Dispute Resolution for Cross-border Electronic Commerce Transactions</a>. These draft rules are a collective attempt to create a comprehensive online dispute resolution mechanism for B2B (buyer to buyer) and B2C (buyer to consumer) disputes arising out of cross-border, low-value transactions conducted by means of electronic communication. The proceedings of the Working Group III show the differences that exist between various legal systems in their approaches to foundations, purposes and characteristics of the due process. These differences have fundamental roots because, as was noted by Samuel Issacharoff and Geoffrey Miller, "for countries steeped in the civil law tradition [most EU member states], the move away from centralized public enforcement is a sea change in legal structures." So, what can be viewed from the European perspective as achieving a proper balance in due process standards is at the same time considered by the US lawyers an unfriendly intrusion of consumer legislation into freedom of contract. The resulting disagreement makes the creation of the comprehensive global dispute resolution system less feasible. </p>

<p>One of the main impediments to the creation of the uniform ODR procedural rules is the obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights that prevent the parties to the convention, including the EU, from making ODR binding for the consumers before the dispute has arisen. Binding ODR will violate the right to court access contained in Article 6(1) of the Convention. However, there seems to be no disagreement between all of the involved stakeholders that a global ODR system should be developed based on general due process principles, such as fairness, transparency, effectiveness and independence of the decision making body. Those principles can be adapted to local needs, and the differences in their interpretation are inevitable, for as was asserted by the Supreme Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10296811528183203766">Mathews v. Eldridge</a>, "'due process,' unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances." </p>

<p>The creation of a "one size fits all" model for online resolution of disputes arising out of B2C transactions has proven to be a very challenging task on the level of EU, not to mention on the global scale. The analysis shows that even within the EU member states, there are different approaches towards a number of issues, such as the use of in-house arbitration procedures for ODR purposes, binding nature of the ODR entity's decision and procedural rules which member states can choose to permit certified ODR providers to apply. The ODR Regulation states that "ADR entities to which a complaint has been transmitted through the ODR platform should...apply their own procedural rules." At the same time, as was noted above, the EU is the pioneer in the field of creating a comprehensive ODR system for cross-border consumer transactions. Therefore, it is very likely that once the EU ODR system is fully implemented, a number of due process <em>acquis communautaire</em> will be imported by UNCITRAL into its draft rules.</p>

		<title>Why Collection of Arrestee DNA Violates the Fourth Amendment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header> JURIST Guest Columnist Christen Giannaros, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2015, is the twelfth author in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law/academic-programs/student-journals/journal-civil-rights-and-economic-development">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Giannaros discusses the Fourth Amendment rights violations implicit in DNA collection upon arrest...</j:header><strong>I</strong>n 2010, <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-upholds-maryland-warrantless-dna-collection.php">Alonzo King</a> was arrested on assault charges. At the station house, a police officer took a cotton swab and ran it against King's inner cheek, collecting his DNA. Police were acting pursuant to a federal statute, which allows for the collection of DNA from arrested individuals. When King's DNA was processed, police discovered that it matched the DNA found at a 2003 rape crime scene, and subsequently prosecuted him for that crime. </p>

<p>Most individuals who hear about King's eventual capture would be relieved: they feel safer, they feel better protected and they feel that justice has been served. But there is a bigger, more serious concern lurking in the background: DNA collection from arrestees violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a>. The Fourth Amendment prohibits searches and seizures executed without a warrant or probable cause. This important protection is explicitly violated each time law enforcement collects and processes an arrestee's DNA, because there is no probable cause to search the arrestee for any crimes other than the one he was arrested for.	</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this concern fell on deaf ears when the US Supreme Court, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3234257148722545343">Maryland v. King</a>, determined that arrestee DNA collection is constitutional because it helps law enforcement confirm an individual's identity. But the court relied almost entirely on a false premise in reaching this conclusion. As Justice Scalia pointed out in his dissent, an arrestee is not "identified" when his DNA sample matches an unknown DNA sample recovered from an unsolved crime scene. Rather, an arrestee is "identified" through the process of fingerprinting, measurements and photographs. The majority's decision rests on shaky grounds, and the constitutional deprivations that will follow are extremely worrisome. </p>

<p>The first flaw in the court's decision is its mischaracterization of an arrestee's expectation of privacy. The Supreme Court has <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5960557864369784818">previously held</a> that in order for an individual to contest a search, that individual must have an "expectation of privacy" in the area to be searched. The majority asserted that since arrestees are in the custody of the police, they should necessarily expect that their privacy will be intruded upon (i.e., have their DNA collected and searched), the argument goes. But this lack-of-privacy argument fails to recognize that although arrestees are in police custody, they are not similar to convicts or parolees, who have already been proven guilty of a crime and justifiably retain no expectation of privacy. (Prior Supreme Court cases have established that convicts and parolees have a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1722065942834953866">diminished expectation of privacy</a>.) Instead, arrestees are presumed innocent until proven guilty, a basic tenet of American criminal law, and thus retain an expectation of privacy.</p>

<p>As such, the collection of arrestee DNA is unjustifiably intrusive. But criminals like King are not the only ones that should be worried about the court's recent decision. Falsely accused individuals, offenders of non-violent crimes and completely innocent arrestees must have their DNA collected too. In addition to the wrongful use of a person's DNA to search for a link to unsolved crimes, what makes the collection objectionable is that the federal DNA statute is silent about what happens to the DNA sample. Currently, the DNA information from the sample gets stored as a DNA "profile" on a nationwide database for criminals. If an individual is later found innocent or not prosecuted, the government must destroy the DNA profile after the arrestee obtains a final court order stating that he may have his profile removed. The actual DNA "sample," however, is indefinitely retained by the government&#8212;meaning that law enforcement retains unbridled access to the sensitive, private information that DNA stores. I can't help but reference the Orwellian undertones evident in this limitless grant of police authority. </p>

<p>Further, because DNA contains sensitive genetic information, it can be used to perform familial searches. A familial search is a partial search in which law enforcement, who cannot match a recovered DNA sample from a crime scene to a DNA sample in the nationwide database, search the database for someone who might be related to the recovered sample. If a familial relationship between the known individual in the database and the unknown sample is shown, law enforcement can find and investigate the known individual and his family in efforts to find the true perpetrator. This has serious privacy implications. First, it subjects purely innocent individuals to harassment and investigation by law enforcement. Secondly, African Americans are more likely to be the subject of this harassment, since they <a href="http://www.crf-usa.org/brown-v-board-50th-anniversary/the-color-of-justice.html">represent about 40 percent</a> of people convicted of felonies each year. <a href="http://www.dnaforensics.com/familialsearches.aspx">One study showed</a> that 17 percent of African Americans could be identified through familial searches&#8212;a stark contrast to the 4 percent of Caucasians who could be identified through familial searches. </p>

<p>Are you still unconvinced of <spanclass="casename">King</span>'s serious consequences? Let's say you are falsely arrested for a crime you did not commit. At the station house, you are cornered into an impossible choice: either submit a DNA sample which the government can retain indefinitely (for a crime you did not commit), or refuse to submit a DNA sample and be charged with a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/14135a">class A misdemeanor</a>. You should not have to choose between having your Fourth Amendment rights violated and being charged with a crime. Despite these serious implications, the court justified using arrestee DNA for identification purposes, even though effective "identification" measures already exist: fingerprinting, photographing and body measurements. </p>

<p>The Fourth Amendment is the heart of our protections against intrusions by the government. As such, a search incident to arrest may only be executed to yield either weapons or evidence that the individual may destroy, or evidence that is relevant to the crime of arrest. In searching an arrestee for his DNA, none of these objectives are satisfied. That the government can come up with a practical need for requiring arrestee DNA collection is not a reason to eviscerate our exceptional Fourth Amendment rights. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.vub.ac.be/IERE/ssmisen.html">Stefaan Smis</a>, <a href="http://hrintegration.be/team/staff/derek-inman">Derek Inman</a> and Pacifique Muhindo of <a href="http://vub.ac.be/">Vrije Universiteit Brussel,</a> discuss the violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Democratic Republic of Congo and urge for the change in national priorities in order to stop impunity and injustice in the country...</p><strong>O</strong>ver the last two decades the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been confronted with a series of major political upheavals coupled with various internal and trans border conflicts intertwined with ethnic and regional outbreaks of violence causing massive human rights violations and the death of millions. There is no doubt that a vast number of these violations qualify as international crimes. <a href="http://ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/CD/DRC_MAPPING_REPORT_FINAL_EN.pdf">Official reports</a> [PDF] refer to war crimes committed in the framework of the internal or international armed conflicts and crimes against humanity characterized by a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population. There is also indication that the elements of the crime of genocide have been met. </p>

<p>Even though the situation in the country has to a great extent stabilized recently, with open conflicts seemingly contained, in the two Kivu provinces, the north of the Katanga province and the Ituri district, thousands of people continue to be <a href="http://irinnews.org/fr/report/99057/briefing-les-groupes-arm%8Es-dans-l-est-de-la-rdc">forcibly displaced</a> [French], civilians are regularly <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-report-finds-violations-in-dr-congo.php">massacred</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-releases-report-detailing-sexual-violence-in-the-drc.php">rape</a> continues to be reported almost daily, schools continue to be destroyed, houses are burned and property is looted. Unfortunately the crimes committed by the NDC group of Sheka Ntabo Ntaberi, as <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/hrw-urges-congo-to-bring-rebel-leaders-to-justice.php">highlighted</a> by the recent report of Human Rights Watch, are far from isolated facts. </p>

<p>The state does not yet have full control of its territory and approximately 40 national and foreign armed groups are operating in the Eastern region of the DRC, the most important being:  M23, Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda/Union Rally for Democracy (FDLR-Rud), FDLR-Soki, FDLR-Foca, Mandevu FDLR, Mai Mai Hilaire, Union for the Restoration of Democracy in Congo (URDC), Raia Mutomboki, Mai Mai Sheka (Nduma Defence of Congo-NDC), Mai Mai Kifuafua, Busumba Local Defense Forces (LDF), Defense Front of Congo (FDC), Union of Congolese Patriots for Peace (UPCP/FPC), Action Movement for Change (MAC), Popular Movement for Self-Defense (MPA), Mai Mai Morgan, Mai Mai Simba, Allied Democratic Forces (ADF-NALU), Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), National Liberation Forces (FNL), Mai Mai Yakutumba, Mai Mai Nyatura, Defence Forces Interests of the Congolese People (FDIPC), Alliance of Patriots for a Free and Sovereign Congo (APCLS), Coalition of Armed Groups in Ituri (COGAI)/PRGF, Patriotic Resistance Forces in Ituri (FRPI), Kata Katanga, National Defense Forces (FDN) and M18. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the arrest warrant that has been issued against him on January 6, 2011 for crimes against humanity, the militia leader Sheka Ntabo Ntaberi has still not been arrested. Not hampered by the pending charges, he ran for the parliamentary elections of November 2011, conducting his election campaign publicly in the Walikale territory. </p>

<p>Moreover in July 2011 he was seen in Goma where he sought health treatment. Sadly Sheka Ntabo Ntaberi is not an isolated example of a suspected war criminal whose arrest warrant does not hinder him from freely moving around in the region. It is rumored that Sheka Ntabo Ntaberi and other rebel leaders are regularly informed of military operations. They can trade natural resources obtained by exploiting regions under their control and have received arms and ammunition via former members of armed groups who have recently become army officers following the various amnesty and demobilization programs. </p>

<p>The lack of political will to prosecute international crimes, the complicity of state authorities and armed forces, the numerous foreign interests in the region, the vast array of criminal networks, the persistent ethnic tensions, the illegal and uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources and the disputed claims over land constitute a fertile environment for armed violence. </p>

<p>Considering the massive number of international crimes that have been committed during the last decades, it is remarkable that to date only a few cases have made their way through the Congolese court system. The egregious level of impunity, as it relates to the adjudication of international crimes, remains extremely high and notably absent is the reactions by the Congolese justice system and the Congolese authorities. </p>

<p>Although the DRC has signed and ratified of the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court since 2002, <a href="https://www.ictj.org/sites/default/files/ICTJ-DRC-Rome-Statute-2008-French.pdf">national implementation legislation remains elusive</a> [PDF, French]. The transitional government in power at that time never discussed a legislative bill introduced in 2005 to "Modify and Complement in application of the Statute of the International Criminal Court certain Provisions of the Penal Code, the Code of Judicial Organization and Competence, the Military Penal Code." In March 2008, Nyabirungu and Mutumbe, two members of Parliament, tabled their proposal to "Modify and Complement in application of the Statute of the International Criminal Court certain Provisions of the Penal Code, the Code of Judicial Organisation and Competence, the Military Penal Code" and this has also proven to be unsuccessful. </p>

<p>While awaiting reform of the Penal Code, military tribunals have been the sole judicial bodies permitted to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. In contrast to the ordinary Penal Code, the Military Penal Code defines these crimes and outlines appropriate punitive measures. The so-called Law-Ordinance 72/060 of 25 September 1972, which established a Military Code of Justice, was the first legislative instrument that affixed international crimes into the domestic legal order, with Articles 501-505 of Title IV providing for the adjudication of military offenses, most notably war crimes and crimes against humanity. On November 18, 2002, the DRC legislature expanded upon this, promulgating <a href="http://leganet.cd/Legislation/Droit%20Judiciaire/Loi.024.2002.18.11.2002.pdf">Law 024/2002</a> [PDF, French], which gave the military justice system the power to adjudicate war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide as long as the crimes were committed within the borders of the DRC. </p>

<p>The exclusive competence of military tribunals to address international crimes has been <a href="http://afrimap.org/english/images/report/AfriMAP-RDC-JusticeMilitaire-FR.pdf">criticized</a> [PDF, French] <a href="http://asf.be/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ASF_IJ_Mise-en-oeuvre-judiciaire-SDR_2014.pdf">by many</a> [PDF, French] for numerous reasons. Some critics pointed to the nature of military tribunals, which more often tended to obedience and adherence to military discipline rather than guaranteeing the rights of the parties involved. In response the DRC legislature promulgated <a href="http://leganet.cd/Legislation/Droit%20Judiciaire/LOI.13.011.11.04.2013.htm">Law 13/011-B</a> [French] of April 11, 2013, which attributed to the 12 provincial Courts of Appeals (Cour d'Appel) the competence to hear cases concerning war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. However the legislature neglected to adopt the required implementation legislation designed to affix provisions of the Rome Statute and to amend the DRC's (ordinary) Penal Code. With the lack of recognition of international crimes under national law, the principle of legality prevented the Courts of Appeals from hearing these cases.</p>

<p>In an effort to effectively address war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide prior to the entry into force of legislation implementing the Rome Statute proposals have also been made for the DRC to establish temporary, specialized mixed tribunals, such as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. To this end a bill was introduced in the DRC Parliament in August 2011 but for unknown reasons it never received the attention it required by the Members of Parliament and was rejected on several occasions, the last time being in April 2014. </p>

<p>Also of grave concern, to date no investigations have been opened for crimes committed before the entry into force of the International Criminal Court despite a large majority of the crimes having been committed prior to 2002. All of this indicates that the DRC authorities do not consider the effective prosecution of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide as a main priority. Until this changes, impunity in the DRC will continue and justice will not be achieved.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.smu.edu/Faculty/Full-Time-Faculty/Jenks.aspx">Chris Jenks</a> of <a href="http://law.smu.edu/">Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law</a>, evaluates the progress in adherence to human rights and international law in Central African Republic and claims that notwithstanding efforts of global community, it is hard to be optimistic ...</p><strong>A</strong>s <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-report-concludes-war-crimes-in-car-not-genocide.php">JURIST noted</a> last month, the UN published the <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/N1471229.pdf">final report</a> [PDF] of the International Commission of Inquiry (COI) on the Central African Republic (CAR). The report is significant on a number of levels. The report documents the wrongful killing of thousands and furthers the discussion on whether the crime of genocide should be expanded to include cultural genocide based on ethnic cleansing. Without understanding the nature and history of the armed conflict(s) in CAR one cannot understand the difficulties the COI faced in conducting their investigation and the resulting limitations on their report. To that end the report includes helpful annexes on the ethnic groups in CAR and their zones of influence as well as the conflict's impact on causing the displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians, both within CAR and to nearby countries.</p>

<p>The report presents a snapshot of CAR and the international community's efforts. Peacekeeping missions in CAR have surely prevented a bad situation from devolving to something much worse. Yet CAR remains at a tipping point. As one of the experts on the COI noted, it is not that genocide definitely has not occurred in CAR, it may have. And genocide may still (or continue to) occur if we do not pay attention. 2015 will provide significant indicators on which direction CAR is headed. Sadly there are a number of factors suggesting that the goal of viable domestic criminal justice accountability mechanisms in CAR ending impunity will remain elusive. </p>

<p>By determining in September 2014 to open another investigation in CAR (Situation in CAR II), the Office of the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="http://icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/SAS-CARII-Art53-1-Executive-Summary-24Sept2014-Eng.pdf">reminded</a> [PDF] the world that "political instability and armed conflict have plagued the [CAR] since 2001." To take a step back, following the killing of civilians and hundreds of acts of sexual violence within the context of an armed conflict between CAR government and rebel forces between 2002-2003, the CAR self-referred to the ICC, <a href="http://icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press and media/press releases/2007/Pages/prosecutor opens investigation in the central african republic.aspx">claiming</a> its "national justice system was unable to carry out the complex proceedings necessary to investigate and prosecute." Those <a href="http://icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200105/Pages/situation%20icc-0105.aspx">initial ICC cases</a> are ongoing; so are instability in CAR and the country's continued inability to carry out criminal proceedings. Consequently, there is the possibility of new ICC cases.</p>

<p>In 2003 François Boizizé became president of CAR after ousting the then President, Ange-Félix Patassé, in a military coup. Boizizé was later elected as president in 2005 and again in 2011. Opposition groups viewed the elections as fraudulent and organized violent protests between 2006 and 2011. In 2012 a coalition of militant political and armed groups formed along ethno-religious lines known collectively as the Séléka. In 2013, following a failed power sharing arrangement with the Boizizé government, the Séléka took control of the CAR, appointing its head, Michel Djotodia, as president and first Muslim leader in largely Christian CAR. The Séléka then continued to attack and be attacked by armed groups in regions of CAR associated with former President Boizizé and his ethnic group, including the anti-balaka, Christian and animist militias. In January 2014, Djotodia, unable to quell escalating violence in CAR, resigned. All sides to the conflict agreed on the appointment of Catherine Samba-Panza, then mayor of Bangui, the capital of CAR, to serve as interim president. The efforts of various <a href="http://binuca.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?alias=binuca.unmissions.org/binuca-eng&language=en-US">African</a>, <a href="http://www.defense.gouv.fr/operations/centrafrique/actualites/sangaris-point-de-situation-du-16-octobre">French</a> [French], <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/csdp/missions-and-operations/eufor-rca/index_en.htm">European</a> and now <a href="http://un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minusca/">UN peacekeeping</a> missions in the CAR have certainly aided security efforts but the situation in the CAR remains "volatile and unpredictable." </p>

<p><a href="http://unhcr.org/pages/49e45c156.html">According to UNHCR</a>, "since December 2013, approximately 25 per cent of CAR's population (over 440,000) has been internally displaced." And the armed conflict in CAR is having a regional impact, generating over 800,000 refugees who have fled to nearby Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Cameroon, Chad and the Republic of the Congo. </p>

<p>Against this backdrop in December 2013, the UN Security Council <a href="http://un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2127%282013%29">asked the UN Secretary General</a> (SG) to "rapidly establish an international (COI) to investigate reports of violations of international humanitarian law, international human rights law and abuses of human rights in CAR by all parties since January 1, 2013, compile information, help identify the perpetrators of such violations and abuses, point to their possible criminal responsibility and help ensure that those responsible are held accountable." </p>

<p>Early in 2014, the SG appointed three experts to the COI: Jorge Castañeda (Mexico), Fatimata M'Baye (Mauritania) and Bernard Acho Muna (Cameroon). Within two months Castañeda resigned for personal reasons. The Commission conducted the bulk of its work with just the two experts, though in August 2014 the SG appointed Philip Alston (Australia) as the third expert.</p>

<p>The Commission's task was challenging, working in a difficult and violent environment which limited the scope of its inquiry. Ultimately their investigation focused on violations and abuses that occurred in Bagui and the western portion of CAR. Traveling to, let alone investigating in, the central portion of CAR proved impossible due to the security threat. </p>

<p>The COI's report identified three parties to the armed conflict in CAR: the members of the CAR armed forces under former President Boizizé and the primary militia groups, the Séléka and the anti-balaka. The COI found all parties were involved in "serious violations of international humanitarian law and gross abuses of human rights including rape and other gender based sexual offenses and violations." </p>

<p>The COI cited estimates of between 3000-6000 killings occurring in CAR during the less than two years the report covers. The COI then said these statistics "must represent a radical under-estimate of the actual number of individuals who have lost their lives." The last annex to the report is two pictures taken at the morgue in Bangui following a 2013 attack which underscores that while the precise number killed in CAR is (and likely will forever be) elusive, we know enough killings occurred to need to focus on justice accountability mechanisms.</p>

<p>The COI also determined that "[t]he Séléka coalition and the anti-balaka are also responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Although the Commission cannot conclude that there was genocide, ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population by the anti-balaka constitutes a crime against humanity." Part IV of the report is devoted to a discussion on genocide and ethnic cleansing and provides a useful survey of how various international tribunals have approached and considered ethnic cleansing versus genocide. </p>

<p>The report makes a number of recommendations in what is styled as "The Road to Accountability." The report notes that the Special Representative of the UN SG and the Minister of Justice of CAR signed a <a href="http://amnesty.org/fr/library/asset/AFR19/011/2014/fr/0b4eaf39-aec4-492e-901a-1743852a090a/afr190112014en.html">Memorandum of Understanding</a> in August 2014, which committed the CAR government to establishing a Special Criminal Court to try "serious crimes, including among others, serious abuses of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law, including sexual violence related to the conflict and serious violations of children's rights, such as the recruitment and use of children in conflicts, which constitute a threat to the peace, stability and security" in CAR.</p>

<p>Given the longstanding dysfunction of CAR's criminal justice system, establishing and operating a credible Special Criminal Court may well prove too daunting a task. The COI quoted from a 2009 <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/135/36/PDF/G0913536.pdf?OpenElement">report</a> [PDF] by Philip Alston, then the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execution, and now a member of the COI: <blockquote>The [CAR] justice system is plagued by a lack of resources, severely limiting its capacity to address impunity. Human resources are minimal in the capital, and nearly non-existent in the rest of the country ... In Bangui, the public prosecutor's office has just two prosecutors for criminal cases ... Across the country, there are not enough buildings to house courtrooms and offices of judges and key personnel. Basic equipment is in short supply.</blockquote> </p>

<p>The report recognizes that the Special Criminal Court and the ICC could "effectively and constructively share the responsibility for attacking impunity." But the report is clear that "impunity will not be overcome unless both the Transitional authorities and the international community are prepared to pay for it."  </p>

<p>The report also commented about a perceived gap "between the commitments expressed by the UN Security Council and the needs identified by the [UN] SG, on the one hand, and the practical measures contemplated to date, on the other." For example, the UN SG reported as recently as November 2014 that "the key antagonists continue to operate in total impunity" while transitional measures are set to be completed by August 2015. Yet as the COI pointed out "[b]y that time it is highly unlikely that many prosecutions will have been undertaken, let alone completed."</p>

<p>Since the submission of the COI report several events have occurred regarding CAR, none of which suggest optimism. Just since December 2014, <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/OCHA%20CAR%20Situation%20Report%20No%2046.pdf">some 10,000 additional CAR refugees fled to the DRC</a> [PDF]. In January 2015 the UN Security Council adopted <a href="http://securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_res_2196.pdf">Resolution 2196</a> [PDF], which extended an arms embargo, asset freeze and travel ban on CAR until 2016. While sanctions, as the COI acknowledged, are "important in a variety of ways, [they] are no substitute for criminal accountability." While preambular language is not substantive, the language in Resolution 2196 speaks to the gap the report referenced. The resolution recalls that CAR "bears the primary responsibility to protect all populations within its territory from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity" and that "any sustainable solution to the crisis in the CAR should be CAR-owned..." Those statements are of course correct but CAR does not appear remotely able or willing to bear such responsibilities, and has not been so for more than a decade. And the security conditions in CAR are not set to allow a criminal justice system to effectively operate even if there were such a system. Which there is not. Indeed in early February 2015, the <a href="http://un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2015/85">UN SG asked the UN Security Council</a> for over 1,000 additional peacekeepers for the CAR mission, which would bring the total to almost 13,000 uniformed personnel.</p>

<p>The experts who prepared the COI report briefed the media on January 21, 2015. The <a href="http://un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=49863#.VNwTGcZ4hpk">experts were more blunt during the press conference</a> than in the report. In terms of the Special Criminal Court, the experts spoke of a "full international tribunal" and that they were "extremely concerned in making sure that a majority of the judges must come from the international community." The experts reminded the media that the CAR government "simply does not have the resources nor the political incentive" to finance viable justice and accountability mechanisms. </p>

<p>To be fair, UN member states contributed over $250 million to fund the UN peacekeeping mission for just the last half of 2014. 2015 will undoubtedly see that number significantly increase. And the presence of thousands of blue helmets and other peacekeepers before them in CAR may well be what prevented either a genocidal killing spree like that in Rwanda or even more wholesale ethnic cleansing like that in the former Yugoslavia.  </p>

<p>But it is hard to be optimistic about CAR. As the COI experts recently predicted, "[w]ith none of the key countries coming forward to say that they will fund [an internalized criminal tribunal], we are deeply concerned that the UN will stumble in creating a tribunal and will be unable to prosecute effectively."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists<a href="http://apps.law.asu.edu/Apps/Faculty/Faculty.aspx?individual_id=65847"> James G. Hodge Jr.</a> and <a href="http://apps.law.asu.edu/Apps/Faculty/Faculty.aspx?individual_id=67877">Kim Weidenaar</a> of <a href="http://www.law.asu.edu">the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law</a>, Arizona State University, discuss the recent news on <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/california-lawmakers-to-propose-strict-vaccination-legislation.php">California and other states' lawmakers' efforts to propose strict vaccination legislation</a>, and the current vaccine exemption issues in the US...</p> <strong>T</strong>he US public health system is bracing for yet another year of avoidable infections, associated injuries and potential deaths stemming from limited outbreaks of communicable conditions that, just years ago, were nearly wiped out. This year, over a hundred measles infections arising from a single index case at Disneyland are the public health "cause celebre." Last year it was <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/trends.html">thousands of whooping cough cases</a>. Next year, who knows? </p>

<p>What we do know is that until a root cause of these cyclical outbreaks is addressed, they will recur and threaten the lives of infants, toddlers and other vulnerable persons. At the source of these outbreaks are increasing numbers of caregivers choosing to delay or forgo safe and effective vaccinations for their children. These vaccinations are <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm093833.htm">approved</a> by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and laid out in a regularly-updated <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-schedule.pdf">schedule</a> [PDF] through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices. State and local governments require childhood vaccinations prior to admission to daycare facilities and schools. These requirements, however, may be legally bypassed through medical, religious or philosophical exemptions in many jurisdictions. </p>

<p>Public health officials denote how rising numbers of unvaccinated children breach "herd immunity" for common, infectious diseases like measles. Concentration of unvaccinated persons in specific neighborhoods or school districts only exacerbates the problem, creating opportunities for vaccine-preventable diseases to easily take hold. Still, exemptors posit multiple justifications for opting out. They fear that childhood vaccinations may cause dangerous and debilitating conditions. While it is true that there is some risk of an adverse reaction with vaccines, just as with any medication, these fears are scientifically unfounded and largely debunked. Worrying about the risk of vaccines ignores the real risk to kids and the community posed by the infectious diseases that vaccinations can largely prevent. Other justifications include that vaccinations may be: (1) contrary to their sincere religious beliefs; (2) inapposite to their philosophical beliefs and (3) easier to avoid legally than receive. Each of these points has merit. Even though childhood vaccinations are one of the great public health achievements in the last century, they are treated as mere options in many states. Getting vaccinated (or not) is a public health choice, much like selecting whether to wear a seatbelt (required in 2/3 of the states) or bike helmet (mandated in less than half the states). This was not always the case concerning vaccinations and some suggest the status quo is primed to change.    </p>

<p><strong>The Current Slate of Vaccination Exemptions</strong> </p>

<p>The history of vaccination exemptions is pocked by a series of legal and policy trends. Initially, state and local governments issued vaccination requirements to thwart outbreaks of smallpox, polio and other lethal or disabling infections, despite sometimes murky science as to the safety and efficacy of the vaccines themselves. Historically, many public health laws mandated that persons receive the vaccine or pay a fine, be subjected to isolation or quarantine or face incarceration. These early requirements had few, if any, recognized exceptions. It was not until 1905 in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/197/11/case.html">Jacobson v. Massachusetts</a> that the US Supreme Court clarified that individual liberty interests justified vaccination exemptions for persons who were medically "unfit candidates," because the vaccination may directly impair their health. Today, all states permit <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/immunizations-policy-issues-overview.aspx">medical exemptions</a>, typically limited to the period for which one's contraindication to the immunization exists. </p>

<p>As school vaccination requirements increasingly became the standard, select state legislatures and courts debated whether persons with religious objections were exempt pursuant to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/free_exercise_clause">First Amendment Free Exercise</a> principles. The US Supreme Court has never clarified whether states have to provide religious exemptions to school immunization requirements (although in dicta the Court noted in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/321/158">Prince v. Massachusetts</a> that "the right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease."). Still, forty-eight states (excluding only Mississippi and West Virginia) recognize religious exemptions via legislative or judicial routes. Atheists, agnostics or others who simply objected to vaccination achieved similar protections largely through state legislation providing "philosophical or personal belief" exemptions. Twenty states feature these exemptions for school-age children (Missouri limits its philosophical exemption to children enrolling in daycare or preschool). </p>

<p>These policy shifts occurred despite concerns of health officials who accurately prophesized that the risk of childhood infectious diseases would rise as the number of exemptors increased. The public health reality is that the lawfully-recognized choices of a relatively small percentage of caregivers to reject vaccines threaten the health of thousands of others, especially infants and others vulnerable persons unfit for vaccination. </p>

<p><strong>States Reconsider Their Policies on Vaccination Exemptions</strong></p>

<p>In hopes of increasing vaccination rates, many states seek to eliminate philosophical or personal belief exemptions (including based on religion in some places) or at least ramp up the procedures needed to obtain one. In February 2015, <a href="http://sd26.senate.ca.gov/news/2015-02-04-senators-richard-pan-and-ben-allen-introduce-legislation-end-california-s-vaccine">several California state senators </a>announced plans to repeal existing non-medical exemptions. As of January 1, 2014, <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=hsc&group=120001-121000&file=120325-120380">California</a> required caregivers seeking a non-medical exemption to first discuss the benefits and risks of immunization, as related to the dangers of communicable diseases, with health care practitioners. While this policy change reduced the number of exemptions, the <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/immunize/Documents/2014-15%20CA%20Child%20Care%20Immunization%20Assessment.pdf">rates are still high</a> [PDF] in many areas. The anticipated legislation would eliminate all personal and religious exemptions, impacting nearly <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6230a3.htm">15,000 kindergarteners</a> who received non-medical exemptions in 2012. The bill would require schools to publicize their vaccination rates (without identifying specific exemptors). For places like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/06/us/california-measles-vaccines-map.html?_r=0">a charter school in Sacramento</a>, with purportedly less than 50% of kindergarteners vaccinated, this could seriously influence parental choices whether to enroll their own children. </p>

<p>Lawmakers in Maine and Vermont plan to propose legislation that would repeal philosophical exemptions in their states. Other state legislatures have already introduced similar bills. <a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2009.pdf">Washington State House Bill 2009</a> [PDF] aims to remove the state's philosophical exemption. If passed, Washington would permit medical exemptions when certified by a health care practitioner and religious exemptions based on the caregiver's attested religious beliefs. Since religious exemptions account for less than 10% of Washington's nonmedical exemptions, abolishing the philosophical exemption alone would predictably increase vaccination rates. </p>

<p>Instead of abolishing existing exemptions, which could be politically divisive, some state legislators propose to beef up the process required to obtain exemptions. <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2119391">Modern vaccination laws</a>, stemming in part from measles outbreaks in the 1960s and 1970s, were enacted after legislatures witnessed lower incident rates of measles in states where such laws were in place and strictly enforced. As measles rates increased over the past decade, many jurisdictions responded in kind by making it harder to opt out of vaccination requirements. Though exemption rates decreased in these jurisdictions, they still face high numbers of exemptors as evidenced by current outbreaks of vaccine-preventable conditions and legislative pushes to remove exemptions. Over the past few years, states like California (as noted above), Michigan, Oregon, Vermont and Washington amended laws to require caregivers to undergo education regarding their decision to forgo vaccination or to discuss the decision with their health care provider. A bill in <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?version=latest&session=ls89&session_number=0&session_year=2015&number=sf0380">Minnesota</a> would make the exemption process more difficult by requiring caregivers to discuss the risks and benefits with a physician and obtain a signed statement from the physician. Maine legislators have proposed a similar bill.</p>

<p>Countering these legislative maneuvers is an array of opposing views. Mississippi, often ranked as one of the worst states for many health measures, has the highest percentage of vaccinated kindergarteners in the country due to its "no nonsense" vaccination policy. As noted, no one in the state can currently obtain an exemption based on religious or philosophical grounds. However, several<a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2015/pdf/history/HB/HB0130.xml"> Mississippi lawmakers</a> have proposed a bill to allow physicians to grant medical exemptions without any additional authorization required from the department of health. In addition, recently-proposed bills in Montana and New York would add philosophical exemptions to existing religious and medical exemptions. </p>

<p><strong>A Legal Shift Back To Protecting the Public's Health?</strong></p>

<p>Vaccinations are among the greatest achievements in public health history. However, their effectiveness is premised on the breadth of their use across populations. Lower vaccination rates correlate directly with higher numbers of outbreaks. Higher numbers of outbreaks correlate with more permissive immunization laws allowing easily-obtained exemptions, particularly when based on personal beliefs. To the extent that formal religions that actually preclude providing medical treatment or vaccination in this country are rare, recognizing religious-based exemptions pursuant to the First Amendment does not pose imminent risks to the public's health. Statutory recognition of personal belief exemptions, however, more seriously impacts the public's health. A 2011 study indicated that states with philosophical exemptions had non-medical exemption rates <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1209037">2.54 times </a>higher than states with only religious exemptions.  </p>

<p>Ramping up the process for obtaining philosophical exemptions, as proposed in some states, may tamp down on the number of persons electing them while still preserving respect for ones' choice, but may also disproportionality affect low-income caregivers. Increased process often implicates additional costs and time, both of which less wealthy caregivers may lack, resulting in an "upper crust reservation" for such exemptions. Many laws imposing enhanced process requirements have similar impacts, but there is no public health justification for effectively denying caregivers of lesser means the opportunity to opt out of vaccinations, unlike their wealthier neighbors. That is not only unfair, it is counter-intuitive to the public's health. To the extent there is no constitutional support for personal belief exemptions, and use of these exemptions (even in states imposing educational or other process requirements) is directly responsible for the spread of controllable infectious diseases, their repeal is worthy of consideration.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Brittney Millay, <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/">New England Law | Boston</a>, Class of 2016, discusses how recent developments in the southern US could affect same-sex couples...</j:header><strong>A</strong>fter a long and drawn out battle, a state judge in Miami-Dade County <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7651874696299675370">lifted</a> a temporary ban on same-sex marriage, making it the first county in Florida to allow gay couples to wed. Florida is the third largest state in the US, with a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/us/same-sex-weddings-begin-in-florida.html">population</a> of approximately 19.9 million people, and is "one of the country's most sought-after destinations for gay men and lesbians." Now that same-sex marriage is legal in Florida, a more conservative state, increasingly more gay people can travel to the Sunshine State for wedding ceremonies. With Florida emerging more liberal on the matter of same-sex marriage, the question is raised whether more states in the Deep South will follow in Florida's footsteps.</p>

<p>Back in August 2014, Judge Hinkle <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16119727256826488842">ruled</a> as part of a federal lawsuit that the state's ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. Judge Hinkle then gave the attorney general a substantial amount of time to file an appeal, which temporarily suspended the judge's decision. Nonetheless, the attorney general's attempts to extend the deadline failed, allowing for same-sex marriage licenses to be issued beginning at midnight on Tuesday, January 6, 2015. However, Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Sarah Zabel did not feel the need to wait until the statewide ban expired and <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2015/01/06/after-miamis-kickoff-gays-set-to-marry-across-florida">presided</a> over the state's first legal same-sex marriage on Monday afternoon. </p>

<p>As Florida becomes the thirty-sixth state to recognize same-sex marriage, it is apparent that much has changed since the 1970s when Anita Bryant launched her national campaign against gay rights. The drastic change in Florida's view on gay marriage may have been met with resistance from conservatives further north in the state, but could potentially spark change across much of the Deep South. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has been a long-time opponent of gay marriage, but made statements regarding the legalization of same-sex marriage by urging supporters and opponents alike that "we have to respect the law." He made no mention or insinuation of challenging the ruling. In fact, his comments seemed to tacitly approve same-sex marriage, or at the very least, to tolerate it. However, with this tacit approval comes the blatant disapproval of same-sex marriage in certain counties within Florida. Duval County stated that they would no longer hold ceremonial courthouse weddings, as they feel marriage should be between a man and a woman, with the Clerk of Courts stating that it would go against his beliefs to perform a ceremony that is not between a man and a woman.</p>

<p>The argument against support of same-sex marriage stems from a "not ready" viewpoint where gay marriage should not be pushed on states in the Deep South as they just are not ready for this type of change. But that argument may be lacking muster by the day, as Alabama's same-sex marriage ban was <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14084561318965877067">struck down</a> by a federal judge just weeks after Florida's acceptance of gay marriage. A federal appeals court judge also ruled <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6434777075476988811">against</a> delaying the overturning of Alabama's gay marriage bans. In a case where a same-sex couple was seeking recognition of their out-of-state same-sex marriage, US District Judge Callie V.S. Granade stated that Alabama's 2006 "<a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/entry/c/alabama">Sanctity of Marriage Amendment</a>" violated both the due process and equal protection clauses of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a>. Judge Granade explained that Alabama's prohibition undermined its goal of promoting "optimal environments for children" as it discriminated against children being raised by same-sex parents and those being raised by opposite-sex parents. After Judge Granade's ruling, Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange asked the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to extend a stay on Judge Granade's decisions so that he would be able to appeal the decision. The Eleventh Circuit denied that request, allowing for gay couples to marry after the stay expired.</p>

<p>The Attorney General of Alabama filed a motion asking the judge to put the decision on hold until the US Supreme Court has made a ruling. After the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">Windsor</a> decision, the Supreme Court continued to deny appeals to hear seven same-sex marriage cases in five states. After the Supreme Court's denial, "seventy percent of Americans now <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2015/01/06/after-miamis-kickoff-gays-set-to-marry-across-florida">live</a> in states where same-sex couples can legally wed." Finally, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/01/court-will-rule-on-same-sex-marriage/">agreed</a> to hear four new cases on same-sex marriage dealing specifically with the power of states to ban same-sex marriage and to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. As arguments against same-sex marriage continue to fail even rational basis scrutiny, it has become harder and harder for courts to uphold marriage bans. As more and more same-sex couples adopt and raise children, courts have to deal with not only the rights of same-sex couples, but the rights of their children as well. And when children are involved, the best interests of the children are at the forefront of the courts' decisions.</p>

<p>Even Mississippi has shown a slight shift in its approval of same-sex marriage. In 2004, eighty-six percent of Mississippi's population approved of the state's same-sex marriage ban. However, recent polls show that the opposition towards same-sex marriage has weakened as more same-sex couples raise children. According to the Williams Institute, approximately <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/05/southern-honeymoon">26</a> percent of same-sex couples in Mississippi are raising children and that percentage is on the rise. In November 2014, just before Thanksgiving, Judge Carlton Reeves heard a case in his Jackson, Mississippi courtroom where a same-sex couple, married in California, was fighting for both partners to have parental rights of their two children. When Mississippi's lawyers made the argument that Mississippi wasn't ready for such a change and that the issue of recognizing same-sex marriage in Mississippi should not be rushed by the courts, Judge Reeves could not help but disagree. His reasoning was that when <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12120372216939101759">Brown v. Board of Education</a> was decided in 1954, it took approximately twenty years before his first-grade class was integrated, strengthening the argument that one cannot wait around for change to happen, sometimes there needs to be a push. Judge Reeves further mentioned that "tradition" is not enough to uphold Mississippi's same-sex marriage ban and that gay and lesbian couples can no longer be treated as second-class citizens. Furthermore, a federal judge in Texas struck down a same-sex marriage ban; however, the ruling has been postponed pending a state appeal. There is also a challenge to a similar marriage ban in Louisiana that is currently pending.</p>

<p>Even with same-sex marriage gaining wide success across the US, the increasing acceptance in the Deep South demonstrates just how far we've come in the battle for equal rights. This effort can be seen in Mercedes Ricks, a 50-year-old native of Colombia and an openly LGBT elected official of Magnolia, Mississippi. Ricks understands the power that acceptance of same-sex marriage in southern states, like Florida and Mississippi, has over other southern states and believes that more southern states will follow in Florida's footsteps. A friend of Ricks stated that obtaining equality in states such as Florida, Mississippi and Alabama can have a monumental impact on acceptance everywhere. He <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/08/20/341666832/gay-rights-movement-tackles-cultural-battle-in-the-deep-south">explained</a>, "Let's go to Arkansas, let's go to Mississippi, let's go to Alabama . . . because if we can get equality there, then we've won America." </p>

<p>Other southern states have recognized same-sex marriage, including North and South Carolina as well as Virginia. However, the marriage bans in Florida and Alabama are the first to be deemed unconstitutional in the Deep South. Since the 2013 ruling that DOMA was unconstitutional, there has been a sweeping majority of states striking down marriage bans across the country. The question remains whether or not more states will continue to find same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional or if they will wait to hear what the Supreme Court has to say on the matter in June.</p>

<p>While Florida became the thirty-sixth state to support and allow same-sex marriage, Alabama has become the thirty-seventh and we can see the tides changing. More and more people are accepting that gay couples are entitled to the same benefits as heterosexual couples, including the right to marry. Florida's explicit disapproval of a gay marriage ban has raised awareness across much of the Deep South, forcing other judges, courts, and legislatures to acknowledge that change is coming and Florida is responsible for it. We've already taken Florida, Alabama, the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia and Alabama. We're rapidly gaining momentum toward nationwide acceptance of same-sex marriage. Once acceptance is apparent in the South, there is no question that the battle for equality will succeed, and we will owe that success to Florida. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.lclark.edu/live/profiles/271-tung-yin">Tung Yin</a> of <a href="https://law.lclark.edu">Lewis &#38; Clark Law School</a> in Portland, Oregon discusses recent terrorism trials...</p><strong>O</strong>n August 7, 1998, al Qaeda terrorists simultaneously <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/us-embassies-in-east-africa-bombed">attacked</a> the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania with massive truck bombs, killing a combined 224 people and injuring thousands more. In retrospect, this was a bloody harbinger of the terrorist group's subsequent suicide boat attack in Yemen in late 2000 against the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/18/world/meast/uss-cole-bombing-fast-facts/">USS Cole</a> and then the <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/9-11-attacks">9/11 </a>attacks in New York and Washington, DC. The federal government indicted a total of 21 persons including al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden for carrying out the attacks. Earlier this month, one of those 21, Adel Abdel Bary, was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29282510">sentenced</a> to a term of 25 years imprisonment. </p>

<p>Last year Bary admitted that he had issued public statements on behalf of al Qaeda claiming responsibility for the embassy bombings as well as threats of future attacks and pleaded guilty to threatening to kill, injure, intimidate and damage and destroy property by means of an explosive; conspiracy to make the threat and conspiring to kill US nationals in violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2332a">18 USC § 2332(a),(b)</a>. Bary joins six co-conspirators (Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, Wadih El-Hage, Mohammed Sadeek Odeh, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed and Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani) as convicted inmates. The others are all serving life sentences. Of the remaining 14 defendants named in the indictment, eight&#8212;including bin Laden&#8212;have been killed in military strikes after 9/11 and two others died in US or British custody while awaiting trial. One of Bary's co-defendants <a href="http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202715872081/Trial-of-Alleged-Osama-Bin-Laden-Conspirator-Begins?slreturn=20150118160638">Khalid al-Fawwaz</a> is in the middle of his trial as of this writing. The last three defendants, including current al Qaeda leader <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11489337">Ayman al-Zawahiri,</a> are still at large.</p>

<p>Going back to the early days after the 9/11 attacks, members of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/georgewbush">Bush</a> Administration hotly debated whether to treat al Qaeda members as criminal defendants or as military targets. Attorney General John Ashcroft argued that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Justice Department</a> was more than capable of trying international terrorists and delivering tough sentences following convictions. Others, including Vice President <a href="http://whitehouse.georgewbush.org/administration/dick.asp">Dick Cheney</a>, pushed for the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">defense department</a> to deal with the 9/11 perpetrators on the grounds that only military justice could preserve the secrecy of classified information in order to prevent terrorist defendants from grandstanding and to provide a secure setting. The result initially was a seemingly schizophrenic approach, where seemingly similarly situated suspects were handled in different forums without any discernible reasons. The sentences for Bary, Ghailani and others are obviously harsh, though appropriate, punishments given the horrifying nature of the crimes against American and foreign lives and property. They also provide strong evidence to counter the contention that Article III courts face severe, if not insurmountable, obstacles in trying international terrorists and that such suspects should simply be sent to <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/national/usstatesterritoriesandpossessions/guantanamobaynavalbasecuba/index.html">Guantanamo Bay</a>. In this regard Attorney General Ashcroft was correct that federal courts could try terrorists successfully and fairly.</p>

<p>The measure of success is judged not just by convictions and sentences but also the ability of the trial courts to recognize and address violations of defendants' rights. For example, during pre-trial litigation, Ghailani's lawyers persuaded the district judge to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/25/ahmed-khalfan-ghailani">suppress</a> the testimony of a witness whom the government learned of only through coercive interrogation of Ghailani. In so ruling the district judge applied the general doctrinal rules regarding <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree">fruit of the poisonous tree</a>&#8212;the discovery of the witness's existence resulted from compelled self-incrimination, and thus could be admitted only if the constitutional violation had been attenuated, which the judge ruled had not occurred. By contrast had the matter proceeded in a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/pubs/pdfs/Part%20III%20-%20MCREs%20%28FINAL%29.pdf">military commission</a>, the court might have been able to admit the witness's testimony under the more lenient rules in effect. </p>

<p>This was a significant ruling, because the witness, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-06/witness-in-ghailani-embassy-bombing-trial-barred-by-u-s-judge-in-new-york">Hussein Abebe</a>, was, according to the prosecutors, the only person who could tie Ghailani to the explosives used in Tanzania. It is impossible to quantify with certainty the impact on the government's case of losing Abebe's testimony, Ghailani was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/nyregion/18ghailani.html">acquitted</a> of all but one of the over 280 charges against him. (Had Ghailani successfully appealed his conviction on the one count, collateral estoppel stemming from the acquittals might have further harmed the prospects on retrial.)</p>

<p>On the other hand we should hesitate before proclaiming the absolute superiority of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III courts</a>. It is true that with the group of embassy defendants who have actually been prosecuted, all but one were incapacitated fairly soon after the terrorist incidents. The nation did wait 17 years to impose punishment on Bary, but nearly all of that time is due to the fact that he was arrested and prosecuted in the UK in 1998 for terrorism-related offenses, serving his sentence before being extradited to the US in 2012. Five of the other six convicted defendants were arrested and extradited to the US in short order. The one exception was Ghailani, who remained loose until 2004. It is with the remaining defendants that we see the primary weakness of civilian courts: trying the defendant requires physical custody of that person. </p>

<p>Of the eight defendants who were killed in combat settings, only one was killed before 2006; five, including bin Laden, survived until at least 2009, or eleven years after the embassy bombings. Continued efforts to apprehend those suspects to bring them to stand trial might have succeeded eventually&#8212;or maybe not. Before 9/11 location did not play a major role in determining whether suspects could be captured and sent to the US. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/upclose/elhage.html">El-Hage</a> was arrested in the US, <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a092098salim">Salim</a> was arrested in Germany, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/eafricabombing/stories/suspects082898.htm">al-'Owhali</a> was arrested in Kenya, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/19/world/pakistan-arrests-two-new-suspects-in-embassy-blasts.html">Odeh</a> was arrested in Pakistan and <a href="https://www.law.kuleuven.be/iir/nl/activiteiten/documentatie/OldActivities/DeathPenalty/Mohamed.pdf">Mohamed</a> was arrested in South Africa. </p>

<p>Following the American-led invasions of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/afghanistan/us-war-afghanistan/p20018">Afghanistan</a> in late 2001 and <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/0,28757,1967340,00.html">Iraq</a> in 2003, various regions in the Middle East and Southeast Asia became havens for fleeing terrorists. Thus, although Pakistan was formally allied with the US against al Qaeda, the central government had lost control over the northwest part of the country, which may be one of the reasons that Osama bin Laden was able to remain in his hideaway in Abbottabad for years before being killed in a secret mission carried out by Navy SEALs. (A more sinister possibility, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/09/19/the-journalist-and-the-spies">argued</a> by a <em>New York Times</em> reporter, is that the Pakistani intelligence service was secretly aiding bin Laden.) Similarly, Ali, Msalam and Swedan were all killed in Pakistan by US drone strikes in 2009 and 2010, while <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/pictures-video/the-original-22-terrorists-where-are-they-now-pictures-20110930">Fadhil</a> was reportedly killed in Afghanistan sometime after 9/11. Even if some of those suspects could have been captured alive instead of targeted for military strikes, it would have been with delays at least at long as that between 1998 and their ultimate demises eleven or more years later. As Blackstone quipped, "justice delayed is justice denied."</p>

<p>The successful convictions of Bary, Ghailani and others thus demonstrate that there can be a definite place for federal court prosecutions of terrorism suspects, but it is equally important to keep in mind that had justice been left entirely to the civilian system, more than half of the embassy bombing defendants would likely still be free, possibly planning or executing further terrorist atrocities. The example of Bary <em>et al.</em> suggest that <a href="http://www.npr.org/tags/132084506/attorney-general-eric-holder">Attorney General Eric Holder's</a> short-lived proposal to prosecute 9/11 mastermind <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-cia">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> (KSM) in federal court in New York was not hopelessly naïve (though perhaps doomed by his insistence that it take place in New York City, which would have triggered immense security costs and caused untold disruptions, which in turn led prominent New York politicians to oppose the plan). But KSM was captured as a result of a covert, joint operation between paramilitary CIA and Pakistani intelligence operatives.</p>

<p>In short, the dual-track approach that the US has operated under since 9/11, with both federal court prosecutions and use of military force, has proven to be more effective than either approach alone.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.virginia.edu/lawweb/faculty.nsf/fhpbi/1165630">Brandon L. Garrett</a>, of the University of Virginia School of Law, discusses Governor Tom Wolf's death penalty moratorium ...</p><strong>I</strong>s declaring a "time out" to the death penalty in Pennsylvania an abuse of the governor's power "ignoring duly enacted law," as prosecutors have claimed, or is it a much needed opportunity to step back?  </p>

<p>Even a years-long moratorium would be a blink of the eye compared to what <a href="http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3771">Nick Yarris</a> endured before he was exonerated by DNA tests in 2004, after 21 years on Pennsylvania's death row. Now Yarris is part of the reason why Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/pennsylvania-governor-announces-death-penalty-moratorium.php">announced</a> a death penalty "time out" in Pennsylvania, which has the fifth <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row-inmates-state-and-size-death-row-year">largest</a> death row in the nation. In reaching his decision Wolf concluded: "Pennsylvania's system is riddled with flaws, making it error prone, expensive, and anything but infallible."</p>

<p>Yarris' case shows just how much can go wrong in a high-stakes murder investigation. His case was not initially treated as part of a death penalty "system." He was arrested by local police after being pulled over.  The incident turned south when he got into an altercation with the officer. In lockup he read in the newspaper about a serious rape and murder investigation and made a misguided offer to assist the local police. Detectives proceeded to interrogate Yarris and without recording the initial conversation, they later asserted without any notes or documentation, that he had offered two key details about the murder that had never been made public. He supposedly volunteered that the victim had been raped and that her Chrysler Cordoba had a brown "landau" (or fake convertible) roof.  </p>

<p>The police also located eyewitnesses. They did not initially identify Yarris at lineups and described someone who looked different. Yet at trial they said they thought they saw Yarris at the shopping mall where the victim was abducted on the day of the crime. The potential malleability and unreliability of eyewitness memory is set out in detail in a landmark new National Academy of Sciences <a href="https://public.psych.iastate.edu/glwells/NAS_Eyewitness_ID_Report.pdf">report</a> [PDF] (by a committee which I should note I participated in). The police also tried to bolster their case by tracking down a jailhouse informant who claimed Yarris had bragged about the shaky eyewitness evidence in the case (and the inconclusive forensics), making the weakness of the prosecution's case all seem like a sinister plan. I describe this troubling testimony in my book, "Convicting the Innocent."  </p>

<p>It was not an even fight at trial. Yarris had a lone defense lawyer (today two lawyers, plus investigative and expert resources are recommended for death penalty trials). The lawyer was privately retained&#8212;for just $1,500&#8212;and the trial judge refused the defense much needed experts to explain, for example, why someone like Yarris might falsely confess or why he posed no danger justifying a death sentence.  </p>

<p>Yet the prosecution's house of cards fell apart decades later when a DNA test was finally obtained. Yarris' civil rights case later settled in the millions.</p>

<p>The problems that sent Yarris to death row persist in Pennsylvania to this day. There is still no statewide requirement that entire interrogations be electronically recorded to prevent contamination by law enforcement. (This despite how failure to record may lead to prosecution losses more often than wrongful convictions). There are no state guidelines on interrogating the mentally ill or intellectually disabled. There are no state requirements that best practices for lineups, like those recommended by the National Academy of Sciences, be adopted.  Indeed the Pennsylvania Supreme Court just <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-17-2012mo%20-%201018240882265233.pdf?cb=1">ruled</a> [PDF] that expert testimony on such false confessions is not admissible (although approving experts on eyewitness memory).</p>

<p>An <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/aba.html">American Bar Association</a> <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/moratorium/assessmentproject/pennsylvania/finalreport.authcheckdam.pdf">report</a> [PDF] in 2007 found still additional systemic problems in Pennsylvania. It takes special expertise and resources to handle a death penalty case. But in Pennsylvania there is no statewide authority to ensure adequate death penalty lawyers are appointed. Each county handles indigent defense on its own, with predictable failures to provide a sound defense.  In addition racial disparity has not been studied; the governor noted data is simply not being collected. The governor should be applauded for allowing a bipartisan Task Force and Advisory Committee (chaired by Senators <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/Senate_bio.cfm?id=991">Daylin Leach</a> and <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/senate_bio.cfm?id=173">Stewart Greenleaf</a>) to carefully study the problem without looming execution dates interrupting their work.</p>

<p>There is no rush. It took more than 20 years to uncover Yarris' innocence. Although many complain of protracted litigation delays in capital cases, that same litigation has exonerated those facing the nightmare of a wrongful execution. As more states have stepped back from the death penalty and others have become deadlocked in litigation over secret drug protocols and botched executions, it is refreshing to see calmer heads prevail in Pennsylvania.  </p>

<p>Until criminal investigations and capital litigation are fixed on the ground, we cannot place upon them the exorbitant weight of a death sentence. And until that day comes, in Pennsylvania and in each of the other remaining death penalty states, we need to give the death penalty a time out.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.tamu.edu/Faculty/FacultyProfiles/MaryMargaret%22Meg%22Penrose.aspx">Mary Margaret Penrose</a>, of Texas A&M University School of Law, discusses the disarrayed nature of same-sex marriage law in the US today ... </p><strong>M</strong>olly Ivins, the renowned Texas satirist, once remarked, "The thing about democracy, beloveds, is that it is not neat, orderly or quiet. It requires a certain relish for confusion." Texas and Alabama, it appears from recent judicial events, are breathing full life into this quote. </p>

<p>On April 28, 2015, when the US Supreme Court hears oral argument in <a href="/feature/2015/02/overview-of-the-petitions-for-writ-of-certiorari-and-the-courts-grant.php">four pending same-sex marriage cases</a> from the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a>, the question of whether same-sex marriage can be banned by individual states, or recognition withheld, is likely one step closer to national resolution. Barring some unforeseen occurrence, the Supreme Court's opinion in these cases should be announced in June. Until then, however, Texas and Alabama are demonstrating a "certain relish for confusion." </p>

<p>While many see this issue as a matter of states' rights, and increasingly a matter of religious liberty for those opposing same-sex marriages, the constitutional validity of a state's laws have been subject to federal judicial scrutiny for at least two centuries. As Chief Justice Marshall reminded in the landmark decision <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9834052745083343188">Marbury v. Madison</a>, "It is emphatically the province and the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is." While federal judicial review may not be a popular position, it is undoubtedly a sound constitutional principle.</p>

<p>So, while democracy necessarily includes elections and legislative actions, our constitutional democracy has long relied upon federal courts to ensure that any law, state or federal, that is properly challenged and found contrary to the federal Constitution is declared void. The desire of a state to avoid such proclamations is not new. Rather, this is an age old battle that dates back to March 20, 1816 when the Supreme Court decided <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2949122041407056724">Martin v. Hunter's Lessee</a>, a case underscoring the US Supreme Court as the final arbiter of the constitutionality of state laws conflicting with the federal Constitution. <span class="casename">Martin's</span> viability remains as sound today as it was when in was delivered nearly two hundred years ago, and resistance to <span class="casename">Martin's</span> mandate is as vigorous today, particularly in Texas and Alabama, as it was in 1816. </p>

<p>The Texas same-sex marriage ban passed overwhelmingly in 2005 has moved from a point of legal uncertainty to a place of legal chaos. Texas remains one of 13 states that continue to ban same-sex marriage, but recent events keep propelling Texas and her marriage ban into the national spotlight.</p>

<p>In late February, two Texas state judges&#8212;apparently not satisfied with the pace of justice before the federal courts and the Texas Supreme Court&#8212;ruled the Texas marriage ban unconstitutionally violates <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">equal protection</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">substantive due process</a>. Never mind that one was a probate judge who, unlike our Alabama counterparts, usually plays no role in assessing the constitutionality of laws or issuance of marriage licenses and another was a state district judge who ruled so quickly, including suspending the requisite 72-hour waiting period for Texas marriages, that Texas now has one (possibly) legally married same-sex couple.</p>

<p>The Texas Attorney General, representing many ordinary Texans, immediately filed with the Texas Supreme Court a <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/filings/MotionEmergencyRelief_FS.pdf">motion to stay</a> [PDF] the state district judge's ruling to preclude the issuance of any other same-sex marriage licenses and to void the lone Lone Star Marriage. So now it appears the Texas Supreme Court has yet one more case challenging, reexamining and eagerly seeking some local resolution to the question of whether Texas citizens retain the right to vote that same-sex couples may not marry or import their same-sex marriage to Texas or whether that power is delimited by the US Constitution. This question, also pending before the federal <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> in New Orleans, was brought about by Texas judges, both state and federal, ruling that the Texas same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. </p>

<p>In January, Texas faced legal uncertainty regarding its same-sex marriage laws, but with the addition of another two Texas state judges ruling that the democratically passed same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional, this legal uncertainty has advanced into a state of legal chaos. The Texas Attorney General <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/filings/15-0139_Mandamus_FS.pdf">sought mandamus</a> [PDF] from the Texas Supreme Court "to avoid the legal chaos that would follow if the [state] trial court's ruling is mistakenly interpreted as authorization for the creation of or recognition of same-sex marriages in Travis County or throughout the State. The actions of the plaintiffs, as well as events in Utah, Michigan and Alabama demonstrate the gravity, reach and imminence of this harm absent mandamus relief."</p>

<p>Texas officials have not limited their defense of the same-sex marriage to the courts. US Senator Ted Cruz supports a federal bill being presented to the 114th Congress, the <a href="http://www.cruz.senate.gov/files/documents/Bills/20150210_State_Marriage_Defense_Act.pdf">State Marriage Defense Act of 2015</a>, that would amend the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text">US Code</a> to permanently define the terms "marriage" and "spouse" for all federal purposes as determined by state law.</p>

<p>While this seems appealing to those supporting states' rights, the difficulty lies in the fact that all state laws are measured and bound by the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/supremacy_clause">Supremacy Clause</a> of the US Constitution. As Justice Marshall noted in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9272959520166823796">McCulloch v. Maryland</a>, the great principle that "the Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof are supreme; that they control the Constitution and laws of the respective States, and cannot be controlled by them" is nearly axiomatic. In other words, if the state definition of "marriage" or "spouse" is found to be unconstitutional, then a federal statute certainly cannot make federal laws and benefits dependent on an unconstitutional state law. </p>

<p>The opponents of same-sex marriage seem as busy and creative as the proponents of same-sex marriage. So while the Texas Attorney General speaks of the chaotic state of Texas law, one wonders why the opponents of same-sex marriage are engaging just as actively and aggressively as those who believe that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right and should be made available now for all. One marriage may be symbolic or it may represent a serious chink in the armor.</p>

<p>Texas is not alone in fighting aggressively and understandably to defend its state prerogative to define marriage. Alabama has been a judicial battlefield with the federal courts and the Alabama Supreme Court waging separate fights to control the state's probate officials responsible for issuing marriage licenses, from the <a href="http://media.al.com/news_mobile_impact/other/Searcy%20ruling.pdf">federal court decision</a> [PDF] striking down Alabama's same-sex marriage ban as unconstitutional, to the Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court's <a href="http://media.al.com/news_impact/other/Read%20Chief%20Justice%20Moore%20letter.pdf">letter admonishment to probate officials</a> [PDF] to refrain from issuing same-sex marriage licenses or face state discipline, to the federal judge <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/255598034/1-14-cv-00424-55-Order">ordering probate officials</a> to issue same-sex marriage licenses, to finally the Alabama Supreme Court re-entering the fray by issuing a <a href="https://acis.alabama.gov/displaydocs.cfm?no=642402&event=4AN12324A">lengthy judicial opinion</a> this week upholding (despite a pending federal appeal) Alabama's same-sex marriage laws.</p>

<p>Legal chaos reigns in Alabama. </p>

<p>The issue of same-sex marriage is undoubtedly divisive, with some drawing analogies to the interracial marriage bans of a bygone era while others raise support from Biblical passages and the truism that marriage remains the quintessential state right. In truth, both sides raise arguments they believe are filled with logic and legal support, and both sides zealously condemn the other as intolerant, bigoted or perverted. This social divide has become the civil rights issue of the current generation, and its resolution is best secured for both sides before the US Supreme Court. </p>

<p>Since the early days of the republic, Marshall's establishment of federal judicial review to decide constitutional issues remains the guiding star in our constitutional democracy. From <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673">Roe v. Wade</a> to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2298973060085224552">Bush v. Gore</a> and every controversial challenge both before and since, our country has consistently put its faith in the judicial department and the US Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is not right because it always reaches the correct decision. Rather, the Supreme Court is right, constitutionally speaking, because on matters it decides, the Supreme Court has the last word.<br />
	<br />
While opponents and proponents of this culture war continue to rhetorically argue, vilify and predict what will ultimately become of the issue of same-sex marriage, I find solace in the fact that we should all soon know. April 28th is mere weeks away, and to those who cannot, or will not, wait, my sense is that these individuals and groups, regardless of which side of the debate they represent, are only adding to the legal chaos that surrounds this extremely complex issue. Much like Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a mere two weeks ago in his dissent from the Supreme Court's <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14a840_gol1.pdf">recent refusal to issue a stay</a> [PDF] in Alabama while states, including Alabama and Texas, await the final, anticipated ruling from the Supreme Court later this summer:</p>

<blockquote>When courts declare state laws unconstitutional and enjoin state officials from enforcing them, our ordinary practice is to suspend those injunctions from taking effect pending appellate review. . . .

<p>In this case, the court refuses even to grant a temporary stay when it will resolve the issue at hand in several months. </p>

<p>I respectfully dissent from the denial of this application. I would have shown the people of Alabama the respect they deserve and preserved the status quo while the court resolves this important constitutional question. </blockquote></p>

<p>While Thomas was speaking to his colleagues on the US Supreme Court, his words ring true to all litigants and legislators seeking to preempt resolution by the Supreme Court. Texas and Alabama are both in a state of legal chaos. This chaotic state is not due to the fact that the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the issue. Rather, Texas is in a state of legal chaos because those seeking relief from the Supreme Court's ruling refuse to wait for the Court to rule. Alabama, in contrast, is in a state of legal chaos because its own Supreme Court has decided to implicitly overcome the refusal of the US Supreme Court to stay same-sex marriage in Alabama by issuing a ruling that these marriages, ruled unconstitutional in the federal courts and currently awaiting federal appellate resolution, are constitutional&#8212;at least in the eyes of the Alabama State Supreme Court. </p>

<p>None of these legal opinions, in either Texas or Alabama, will control this issue much longer. Instead, these legal opinions only serve to divide us and create confusion, if not chaos, over states' rights and the Supremacy Clause. In Texas, the litigants are demonstrating activism by seeking alternate judicial avenues to circumvent a pending Supreme Court opinion. In Alabama, the courts are engaging in activism by creating dueling judicial opinions that, ultimately, the Alabama Supreme Court justices appreciate must yield to the US Supreme Court's final decision. </p>

<p>Only the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, that <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1678795/gay-marriage-order.pdf">granted a stay</a> [PDF] in the recently-issued Nebraska federal court opinion finding same-sex marriage unconstitutional, appears to understand the role of the judiciary in resolving volatile and passionate constitutional issues. Much like Justice Thomas's plea in his recent dissent from the Alabama stay request, the Eighth Circuit understands the value of pausing and maintaining the status quo while we await the proper Supreme Court resolution of this tricky issue.</p>

<p>Thomas is constitutionally correct that all litigants should respect the status quo until such time as the Supreme Court rules on this important constitutional question. I would argue his opinion extends to judicial officers as well. The Alabama Supreme Court has not solved any issue in Alabama, just as the lone couple married in Texas has not advanced any rights beyond their own. The issue is pending, currently pending, before the US Supreme Court. We should all take a deep breath and wait. Let the briefs be filed. Let the arguments take place. Let the justices decide, in <span class="casename">Marbury</span> terms, "what the law is."</p>

<p>But, as Texans tend to exhibit an independent streak, and Alabama proves itself indefatigable, we must once again return to the wisdom of Molly Ivins: democracy might not be neat, orderly or quiet. I guess we need to relish the confusion&#8212;at least until late April or early June.</p>

		<title>Changing Venue in the Marathon Bomber Case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.illinois.edu/faculty/profile/andrewleipold">Andrew D. Leipold</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois College of Law</a>, discusses the First Circuit's decision not to change venue in the Boston Marathon bombing trial...</p><strong>T</strong>he claim that a local jury can't be unbiased in a case of this profile is intuitively appealing. Although Boston is a big city, the <a href="http://www.baa.org/">marathon</a> is a distinctive point of pride for its citizens and while the death toll from the bombing was blessedly low, the high number of injuries, the violent manhunt that followed and the injection of fear into a community holiday could easily have scarred a lot of potential jurors.Those who doubt the impartiality of a Boston jury found a voice in Judge Torruella's vehement dissent in the First Circuit's most recent refusal to issue the writ of mandamus. The <a href="http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/14-2362P-01A.pdf">dissent</a> [PDF] claims that the majority decision pave[s] the way for a trial that is fair neither in fact nor in appearance and damages the creditability of the American judicial system.</p>

<p>But if people were surprised by the <a href="http://www.wbur.org/2015/03/03/tsarnaev-jury-boston-judge-otoole">decision</a> they shouldn't have been; it is very hard to get a change of venue based on a claim of prejudicial pretrial publicity. Some of the reasons are obvious: moving a big trial to a new place is terribly disruptive for the witnesses and victims who want or need to attend and judges have great faith in their own ability to pick, manage and instruct jurors to ensure impartiality. But there are other reasons why these motions are hard to win, some practical, some legal.</p>

<p>Information both true and false about the marathon bombing is undeniably more plentiful and easier to get than it would have been a decade ago. But that is different than concluding that prospective jurors collectively know more about pending criminal cases than they used to, or that they have learned more about the prejudicial evidence.  Indeed the opposite may be true. The fragmentation of news sources means that we no longer all watch the same television shows, read the same papers or listening to the same radio stations. The Pew Research Center has <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2013/10/11/how-americans-get-tv-news-at-home/">found</a> that local television watching has declined in recent years and while ten years ago more than half of the people surveyed (54%) said they read a daily newspaper, by 2012, it was <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/number-of-americans-who-read-print-newspapers-continues-decline/">38%</a>. </p>

<p>There are more sources of news besides the traditional ones including Twitter and other social media outlets. But we might wonder about the noise-to-news ratio, as well as the depth and credibility of those sources. Stated differently just because people can learn about a pending trial more easily than in the past, doesn't mean that they are interested in doing so, or that they are more likely to come to the jury box with fixed views even if the total amount of information is increasing.</p>

<p>To conclude that in all of Boston a court can't find twelve reasonable people who have no relevant clue as to what is happening in the Tsarnaev case is to imagine a breathtaking level of engagement and long term memory among its citizens. Within the last two years we all have been subject to a media barrage by people seeking elected office, yet only slightly more than <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/162362/americans-down-congress-own-representative.aspx">one-third</a> of us can name our own representative, and a discouraging <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/opinion/sunday/bruni-america-the-clueless.html?_r=1">30%</a> of us can't name the sitting Vice President. Even assuming that the marathon bombing is more salient than the Vice President, it seems doubtful that two years after the fact everyone in the jury pool has been exposed to and remembers enough information about the evidence&#8212;as opposed to the bombing and manhunt itself&#8212;that the deck is presumptively stacked against the accused. </p>

<p>It is not hard to test this hypothesis.The next time you are in a group of otherwise engaged adults, ask how many know the details about some local crime, event or sports team. Even if everyone is aware of the issue and even if it has been exhaustively covered by the media chances are that there will be one or two who don't know enough details to have an informed opinion, or at least have an open mind that could be changed with more information. If you can find one in your small group, a court can find 12 in a judicial district and stripped of the legal jargon that's really all it takes to deny a motion for change of venue.</p>

<p>This one isn't like the last one. Both the First Circuit decision and the most recent Supreme Court <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2009/2009_08_1394">opinion</a> on change of venue (involving a criminal trial in Houston for the former CEO of Enron), employed a similar method of analysis, at least in part. They harkened back to the Supreme Court cases where prejudicial pretrial publicity was found, compared the facts of those early decisions to the case before them and decided that the current situation doesn't look nearly as bad as the old ones did. Thus no reason to move the trial.<br />
 <br />
Those early cases did indeed shock the conscience. Massive <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/384/333/case.html">pretrial</a> publicity in small <a href="<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4629335940321174192>communities</a>, which had limited sources of information, reports of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=917537952834384805>incriminating</a> evidence that might not be admissible at trial and prospective jurors who had an unhealthy degree of information and opinion about the defendant's guilt. The problem for modern defendants is that when these early cases establish the anchor for the doctrine, the question of prejudicial publicity becomes a relative question&#8212;how close are the facts before us like these early cases&#8212;rather than an absolute question: are we convinced that the jurors in this case can be fair to this defendant having been exposed to this type of publicity?</p>

<p>This judicial technique is not at all new and not necessarily bad. Criminal procedure wonks have seen the definition of custody for Miranda purposes evolve over the years, as the Supreme Court compares different restraints on liberty to the interrogation settings that caused concern at the time of Miranda itself (and often finds the current claims falling short of the original anchor). More generally common law decision-making and adherence to precedent require courts to constantly looking back to see if today's decision looks out of line with earlier opinions. But in doing these comparisons it is important to get some sense whether those early decisions are easy cases, heartland cases or close calls. If the early pretrial publicity cases provide our anchor and are clear cases of biased juries, it is perhaps easy to overlook the possibility that current cases can be quite different from those early ones, yet still present a high risk of a biased jury pool.</p>

<p>It's not about you it's about me. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> of the US Constitution and the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> say that the trial should be held in, and the jurors drawn from, the place where the crime was committed. The framers' focus was on protecting the accused from being dragged off to a remote court to stand trial, and that's mostly what the venue requirement does. But there is more to it than that. Even when the defendant doesn't want the venue protection, and even when he makes a plausible claim that the trial is more likely to be fair if it is held somewhere else, courts resist transfers and (usually) properly so.</p>

<p>The venue requirement also protects the ability of all citizens of a district to punish, through their representatives, the wrongs that were done against them. Although federal cases are brought in the name of all the people of the US, no one doubts who bore the brunt of the marathon bombings. Courts seem to recognize the significance of giving the people most affected by the crime a chance to attend the trial, to have the prosecutor from their state argue on their behalf and to send their neighbors to serve as jurors.  </p>

<p>This not to say that Mr. Tsarnaev's trial should or should not have been moved&#8212;to have an informed opinion on that requires more information about the precise type and level of publicity, and the precise steps taken to screen the jury, than most of us have. Judge O' Toole was in the best position to calibrate the facts, and if Mr. Tsarnaev is convicted, the First Circuit will have another chance to weigh in. But in general, finding an unbiased jury is not as difficult as some believe, and a court's refusal to change venue should almost never be a surprise. </p>

		<title>Anti-Sharia Laws: A Solution in Search of a Problem</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.jmls.edu/directory/profile.php?lastfirstname=Schwinn_Steven">Steven Schwinn</a>, of The John Marshall Law School, discusses the growing problem in states to ban the use of foreign and international law...</p><strong>T</strong>here is a growing trend in the states to ban the use of foreign and international law, including Sharia law, in state courts. At least seven states <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/alabama-voters-approve-prohibition-against-foreign-law.php">have enacted</a> measures to prohibit their courts from considering foreign and international law and many others are considering such a ban. But despite the lofty rhetoric of supporters, these bans can do nothing that state law does not already do. The bans do not protect against the undue influence of foreign or international law upon our own domestic law and they do not protect against any real threat to individual rights. At their best, they are a solution in search of a problem. At their worst, however, they alienate politically unpopular groups and gratuitously condemn their beliefs.</p>

<p>The trend started in <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-considers-oklahoma-sharia-law-ban.php">Oklahoma </a> when, in 2010, Oklahoma voters approved the "Save Our State" constitutional amendment. The amendment banned the use of international law and foreign law in Oklahoma courts; it singled out Sharia law for particular disapprobation. It provided that "[t]he courts shall not look to the legal precepts of other nations or cultures. Specifically, the courts shall not consider international law or Sharia law." </p>

<p>The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit roundly struck the amendment in <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/10/10-6273.pdf">Awad v. Ziriax</a> [PDF]. The court ruled that the ban on Sharia violated the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> because the ban discriminated among religions without a compelling interest&#8212;or without any interest, for that matter. Indeed, the court noted that defenders of the amendment could not identify a single instance when an Oklahoma court applied Sharia law or other foreign law, much less an instance when such application resulted in a concrete problem for the state. But even if the state could identify an interest, the court said that the amendment was so crude that it could not "closely fit" any interest, anyway. The plaintiff's case illustrated why: Awad claimed, among other things, that the ban on Sharia would prevent Oklahoma courts from probating his will, which contained references to Sharia law. Before the amendment, state courts would have probated Awad's will, including its references to Sharia, so long as it did not violate public policy. But after the amendment, the courts could not have considered Sharia law at all, even as part of Awad's will. It is hard to see how that result serves any purpose.</p>

<p>If Awad's will does not persuade you, though, here is another example. Suppose a man and a woman were married in a country that recognizes marriages based on religious law. Suppose further that the marriage is unobjectionable as a matter of public policy. (For example, the marriage does not involve more than two people.) Now suppose that the couple moved to Oklahoma and tried to get the Oklahoma courts to recognize their marriage (for any number of different reasons that a marriage might be relevant under Oklahoma law). "Save Our State" would prohibit the courts from considering the foreign law under which the couple was married and by extension the marriage itself. Again: it is hard to see how that result serves any purpose.</p>

<p>So advocates changed their strategy. They moved away from explicit bans on Sharia and introduced model legislation called American Laws for American Courts, or <a href="http://publicpolicyalliance.org/legislation/american-laws-for-american-courts/">ALAC</a>. ALAC sharpens the "Save Our State" model by limiting the ban to "foreign law" (and not specifically mentioning Sharia). It also limits the ban to those instances "when the application of a foreign law will result in the violation of a right guaranteed by the constitution of this state or of the United States ..." And it exempts corporations and religious organizations. ALAC affects the ban in a roundabout kind of way: it says that any court ruling that relies in whole or in part on any law that would grant the parties anything less than full state and US constitutional rights is a violation of public policy.</p>

<p>But this is exactly why ALAC is a belt over state&#45;law suspenders. State law already bans the use of extraterritorial law, including the law of other nations and the law of other states, when that law violates state public policy. In particular, the traditional rule of comity includes a public policy exception, which says that state courts do not grant comity when doing so would violate public policy. And of course it goes without saying that state courts cannot violate state or federal constitutional rights, whether they rely on domestic, foreign or international law. In other words, ALAC incorporated the qualifiers and exceptions that were necessary to navigate the legal and practical problems in "Save Our State." But those necessary qualifiers and exceptions ate up any substance that was in the ban in the first place. The whole experience of ALAC&#8212;its long and cumbersome qualifiers, its reaction to the court's ruling in <span class="casename">Awad</span>  and its reaction to the practical problems created by a broadside ban on foreign law&#45;is why a ban on foreign law is at best unnecessary.</p>

<p>ALAC also pulls no weight in the important debates over the use of foreign and international law in US constitutional construction. Serious and thoughtful judges, scholars and lawyers disagree about the relevance of foreign and international law in interpreting and constructing the US Constitution. But ALAC contributes nothing to this debate, either directly or indirectly. (Indeed, when courts have used foreign or international law in US constitutional construction, they have used it to protect and enhance individual rights, not to limit them. That is ALAC's goal (or at least its stated goal), too.) In matters of constitutional construction, ALAC is at best irrelevant.</p>

<p>But in truth ALAC is worse than unnecessary and irrelevant; it is harmful and divisive. That is because it contains the same gratuitous anti-Islam intention as "Save Our State." According to the American Public Policy Alliance, which spearheads ALAC, ALAC is designed as a bulwark against Sharia law in American courts, even if ALAC itself does not specifically mention Sharia. Yet for all the blustering, advocates for ALAC have yet to identify a single instance when a court has applied foreign law, including Sharia law, in a way that created problems. They have not even coherently explained how such problems might arise, especially in light of the existing public policy exception to the general comity rule. </p>

<p>"Save Our States," ALAC and other attempts to restrict the use of foreign law in domestic courts are solutions in search of a problem. At their best, they do what the law already allows and requires. At their worst, they reveal an ugly underside of law and politics that seems calculated only to alienate and disempower certain disfavored peoples and to condemn certain disfavored faiths.</p>

		<title>Crazy in Alabama: But Not for the Reasons Everyone Thinks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.fiu.edu/faculty/directory/howard-m-wasserman/">Howard M. Wasserman</a> of <a href="https://law.fiu.edu/">Florida International University College of Law</a> discusses the intricacies of Alabama judiciary and their effect on same-sex marriage recognition describing the reasons behind Alabama judges' stance on same-sex marriage issue...</p><strong>A</strong>labama has an unfortunate history when it comes to civil rights&#8212;George Wallace in the doorway, fire hoses and police dogs and massive resistance to integration. It thus is easy to view the past several weeks of confusion and controversy over same-sex marriage licenses through that historical lens, making Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore into Wallace's heir in bigoted disregard of the US Constitution and defiance of the federal judiciary.</p>

<p>It would be easy to do that, but it would be wrong.</p>

<p>The reality of this strange dispute is far more anodyne. It is about the nuances of civil procedure, federal jurisdiction and federal remedies, the realities of judicial enforcement of rights and the scope of judicial decrees in a hierarchical system. Whatever one thinks about marriage equality and the constitutional validity of bans on same-sex marriage, the judicial process actually has worked in Alabama roughly as intended and not in a way that, long-term, will deny anyone equal rights.</p>

<p>To understand this, we must understand precisely what has occurred in Alabama.</p>

<p>In late January, Judge Callie Granade of the US District Court for the Southern District of Alabama twice declared that Alabama's constitutional and statutory bans on same-sex marriage violated the <a href="https://law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a>&#8212;in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18174245257700790599">Searcey v. Strange</a>, a second-parent adoption involving a female couple married in California, and in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8778863713867994173">Strawser v. Strange</a>, an action by several same-sex couples in Mobile seeking a marriage license. The sole named defendant in both actions was Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, who was ordered not to enforce the state's same-sex marriage bans. </p>

<p>In Alabama however, responsibility for issuing marriage licenses rests with probate judges, who are members of the judicial branch performing administrative tasks, not with the attorney general (the only person subject to any federal injunction) or any other executive-branch official. Moreover the attorney general lacks any supervisory authority with respect to judicial-branch officials, given state separation of powers concerns. Alabama thus presented a bizarre situation&#8212;the only state official subject to a federal injunction lacked the power to issue or order anyone else to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but the state officials empowered to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples were not required to do so by a federal injunction. Granade stayed her order for 14 days (until February 9) to work the situation out. <a href="http://buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/fight-takes-shape-over-whether-alabama-same-sex-couples-can#.kiMRzqEgd">The Alabama Probate Judges Association advised</a> its members that they should not issue licenses to same-sex couples, because such licenses were prohibited by state law and no probate judge was subject to the federal order. Notorious Moore went one step further, asserting his authority as the chief administrative officer of the state courts to advise against and <a href="http://documents.buzzfeed.com/020815-mooreorder-marriage.pdf">prohibit</a> [PDF] probate judges from issuing licenses. He also took to the media to explain why same-sex marriage violated the laws of Alabama and God and why federal district judges lack the power to say otherwise.</p>

<p>On Monday February 9, the district court stay expired when both the US Court of Appeals for Eleventh Circuit and the US Supreme Court (over dissent from Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia) <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/alabama-begins-issuing-same-sex-marriage-licenses-after-supreme-court-refuses-to-extend-stay.php">refused</a> to extend it. Thus same-sex marriage did come to Alabama, albeit haltingly. Within the first two days, probate judges in only 16 of the state's 67 counties were issuing licenses. Meanwhile the <span class="casename">Strawser</span> plaintiffs added Probate Judge Don Davis of Mobile as a defendant, and on Thursday February 12, Granade <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/feb-12-strawser-order-granting-injunction.pdf">extended her injunction</a> [PDF] to Davis.</p>

<p>Following the injunction, probate judges in more (but not all) counties came around and began issuing licenses. Importantly however, none was compelled to do so by a federal order. In fact, Davis was formally obligated to issue licenses only to the plaintiffs in <span class="casename">Strawser</span>, but no one else&#8212;an injunction binds a named defendant to provide relief only as to the named plaintiffs. Of course, had he denied any other couple a license, that couple could intervene in <span class="casename">Strawser</span> or file a new lawsuit against Davis; either way, they would end up before Granade, who would then extend her injunction to require a license for these new plaintiffs. Similarly any couple denied a license by any other probate judge could file their own federal lawsuit against that probate judge and seek an injunction compelling issuance of the license. Moreover plaintiff couples who obtained injunctions could <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1988">collect attorney's fees</a> as "prevailing part[ies]" in a constitutional action.</p>

<p>All of this was uncertain, inefficient and even ugly, with different marriage rules in different parts of the state. But this is how judicial decision-making works. Even when dealing with important social issues such as marriage equality and <a href="https://law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection</a>, a court really resolves only a discrete dispute between discrete, identified parties, producing an order that controls their rights, obligations and behavior as to one another. Granade could only order Davis to issue a license to the named plaintiffs; any other couples must obtain their own injunctions and any other probate judge only must act once she herself is enjoined. The declaration of the state marriage ban's constitutional invalidity in the opinion accompanying Granade's order primarily served as an explanation and justification for her order. The opinion affects the rest of the world only through its precedential force and the extent that it persuades or binds the next court to address a similar question by different parties. Decisions of federal district courts are not binding authority on any other court&#8212;state courts, other federal district courts or even courts within one federal district; at best, they persuade another court to adopt the same understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment and to order the defendant before that court to issue licenses to those plaintiffs.</p>

<p>But this also means it was not 1963 and we were not seeing Massive Resistance <em>Redux</em>. Probate judges who failed to issue licenses were not flouting the law or defying federal authority in not abiding by the single persuasive precedent of Granade's decisions. Nor was Moore in advising and ordering probate judges that they were not obligated or bound by that precedent. It remained possible (if unlikely) that the next district judge might rule differently; public officials certainly could wait for that decision and a controlling federal court order before acting in a certain way. Once a federal order came, of course, the named probate judge became bound; had she continued to refuse to issue licenses, she then would have been defying a federal order. But that never seemed a real danger. Several probate judges indicated prior to February 9 that while they would not issue licenses on the strength of Granade's decisions in <span class="casename">Searcey</span> and <span class="casename">Strawser</span>, they would comply with any eventual federal order directly obligating them to issue licenses. In other words, they were expressly disavowing any intent to defy valid, applicable federal court orders; they merely were awaiting those orders.</p>

<p>In the short term, this may produce the sort of Swiss cheese we witnessed in those first days and weeks in Alabama. But that is the reality of a geographically divided and hierarchical federal judiciary. The decisions of the lowest courts, which hear and decide cases first and quickly, have less sweeping effect than the decisions of higher courts, which may not come about for some time. In the longer term, with the US Supreme Court poised to resolve the marriage-equality question by the end of this term (arguments are slated for April 28), the Swiss cheese should not last overly long.</p>

<p>This equilibrium might have held till June, until a new procedural wrinkle entered the mix. In early March, the Supreme Court of Alabama, acting on the request of two private organizations, issued a writ of mandamus, prohibiting all probate judges not presently under a federal injunction from issuing licenses to same-sex couples. The stated purpose of the mandamus was to avoid the confusion and uncertainty of licenses being available in some parts of the state through some probate judges and not others, and to provide formal guidance to all judges; the mandamus ensured that, absent a federal order, no marriage licenses would be available to same-sex couples anywhere in the state. In a <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/march-3-alabama-supreme-court-mandamus-opinion.pdf">134-page per curiam opinion</a> [PDF], six justices held that the same-sex marriage ban was constitutionally valid and must be enforced, rejecting concerns about the organizations' standing and the court's own jurisdiction, contrary precedent from multiple lower federal courts and repeated signals from the US Supreme Court. This decision prompted a procedural counter-move, as the <span class="casename">Strawser</span> plaintiffs <a href="http://lyldenlawnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Alabama-marriiage-new-class-action-3-6-15.pdf">moved to amend</a> [PDF] their complaint to certify the case as a class action on behalf of all same-sex couples seeking licenses against a defendant class of all probate judges; this action would produce a federal injunction requiring all probate judges to issue licenses to all same-sex couples who request them.</p>

<p>Contrary to some media descriptions, this exchange of moves did not set-up any sort of state-federal stalemate and showdown. The state court was clear that any probate judge subject to a federal injunction could show cause to be released from the mandamus, namely that she was under a federal injunction to issue licenses. At the time, that only meant Davis. But a class injunction would bind all probate judges who all could then show the same cause to be released from the mandamus and to resume (or begin) issuing licenses to same-sex couples. The result is that the mandamus will impose no legal or practical bar to plaintiffs seeking licenses or to the overall establishment of marriage equality in Alabama. Although couples must take extra procedural steps to obtain that broader injunction, they will be able to get marriage licenses, as well as attorney's fees incurred in taking those extra procedural steps.</p>

<p>Back to Moore and recalcitrant state officials. We perhaps can criticize their behavior here. Moore is an inveterate grandstander and it is difficult not to believe that this at least partly underlies his actions and those of his fellow justices. This all seems a waste of time, effort and taxpayer dollars to force the plaintiffs to bring or amend these additional federal lawsuits, a "quixotic" (in the words of the New York Times) attempt to stop the inevitable. A cynic might argue that making same-sex couples go through all the procedural steps humiliates a despised group and was designed to do so.</p>

<p>But whatever Moore's motivations and whatever the wisdom of his court's legal analysis are, state officials are under no obligation to follow persuasive authority simply to save time for civil rights plaintiffs. There has been no "defiance" here, only an insistence on procedural regularity. Talking about Wallace and massive resistance is not only unhelpful, but also inaccurate.</p>

David Ball</a> of <a href="http://law.scu.edu/">Santa Clara Law</a>, discusses the legal framework behind the Nebraska and Oklahoma law suit against Colorado to invalidate Colorado's marijuana law...</p><strong>I</strong>n December 2014, Oklahoma and Nebraska took the unusual step of <a href="http://ok.gov/oag/documents/NE%20%20OK%20v%20%20CO%20-%20Original%20Action.pdf">filing a complaint</a> [PDF] in the US Supreme Court asking for a declaratory judgment that <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/sheriffs-challenge-colorado-marijuana-law.php">Amendment 64</a>, which legalized adult use of marijuana, was unconstitutional and unenforceable because it is preempted by the <a href="http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/">Controlled Substances Act</a> (CSA). States very rarely sue each other, but when they do, the issues usually involve things like "<a href="http://jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3480973?sid=21105630468411&uid=2&uid=4#page_scan_tab_contents">the location of interstate boundaries and the allocation of interstate waters</a>." (Just this past February, the US Supreme Court issued an opinion in an interstate water dispute, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/126orig_olq2.pdf">Kansas v. Nebraska <em>et. al.</em></a> [PDF]). There are many interesting questions raised by the Oklahoma and Nebraska suit&#8212;such as whether Oklahoma and Nebraska have <a href="https://verdict.justia.com/2014/12/31/nebraska-oklahoma-take-colorado-supreme-court-legalized-marijuana">standing</a>&#8212;that I will not cover in this article. I will focus instead on whether Colorado's marijuana regulations are preempted by the CSA&#8212;or alternatively whether the relief sought by Oklahoma and Nebraska (to enjoin all application and implementation of its marijuana regulations) would violate the anti-commandeering principle. I will be using the framework laid out by Professor Robert Mikos in his article "<a href="http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/jhclp/vol16/iss1/2/">Preemption Under the Controlled Substances Act</a>" as modified slightly by my student <a href="https://druglawandpolicy.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/but-what-does-it-all-mean-man-the-difference-between-decriminalization-legalization-regulation-and-why-it-matters/">Reed Wagner</a>. (Reed is one of the many students doing great work on the class <a href="https://druglawandpolicy.wordpress.com/">blog</a> for my Drug Policy Practicum class).  </p>

<p>Because federal law is the <a href="https://law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">supreme law of the land</a>, any time federal and state laws contradict, federal laws preempt state ones. There are three basic types of preemption: field, direct and obstacle. Congress can make these findings expressly in the language of a statute, for example explicitly declaring itself to have occupied the field. This would prohibit any state legislative action and make the federal government the sole source of statutory authority. The CSA declined express preemption in § 903, <a href="http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/903.htm">stating</a> "No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which that provision operates". (Absent an express pronouncement, Congress can regulate so extensively that it will be deemed to have occupied the field, again making it the sole source of statutory authority.)  </p>

<p>Direct preemption involves a command to do something that would be inconsistent with federal law. Mikos suggests a clarification of this doctrine: that direct preemption be used to describe any state law that requires someone to violate federal law. Because pot smoking, growing and distribution is not mandatory under any extant state law, under the Mikos framework, direct preemption is not an issue. That leaves the final category, obstacle preemption. Obstacle preemption occurs when a state does something that conflicts not with the letter of the law, but with Congressional objectives. It is hard to determine Congressional objectives, of course, since they are frequently subject to interpretation, but we might try to discern what the policy goals of the CSA were and whether the Colorado regulations advance or hinder these goals. This is where the action is in the current suit.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with preemption is the prohibition against the federal government commandeering the states, based in federalist principles and expressed in the 1997 opinion <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/521/898/">Printz v. United States</a>. If the federal government wants to enforce the CSA, it has to do so itself. It cannot make the states enforce it, nor can it force the states make marijuana illegal.  </p>

<p>As Reed Wagner points out though, moving away from prohibition can take a multitude of forms, each of which has different implications for preemption. He identifies three different kinds of regulation: total decriminalization, state participation and state regulation. At one end of the spectrum is total decriminalization, the simplest form of which would be to remove all references to marijuana and/or cannabis from the state penal code. This is arguably the policy  <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/high-times-are-headed-for-dc--and-a-whole-lot-of-cannabis-chaos/2015/02/15/f6d49ade-b137-11e4-886b-c22184f27c35_story.html">Washington, DC</a> is left with after Congressional interference and what is being proposed in <a href="http://chron.com/news/article/Texas-lawmaker-files-bill-to-legalize-marijuana-6111922.php#photo-6902320">Texas</a>. A total deregulation regime would have no regulations, no market, no state legislation at all. The extent of state policy would be simply to remove statutory language concerning marijuana&#8212;not creating new statutes, regulations, or enforcement mechanisms. At the other extreme is state participation in the market&#8212;<a href="http://tdpf.org.uk/blog/uruguay-announces-final-regulations-new-legally-regulated-cannabis-trade">the Uruguay plan</a>&#8212;where the state is itself a grower, a seller or both. In between is some form of state regulation, which is the Colorado model and hence of most interest for the present discussion. In a state regulation regime, the state is not itself a market participant, but it does license, inspect and tax market participants, which in some sense sanctions some third party participants and excludes others.</p>

<p>These general categories map nicely onto Mikos's framework. It is clear that a totally decriminalized market would pose no preemption problems&#8212;or, perhaps more accurately, that the anti-commandeering principle would trump any potential problems. If a state chooses not to make something illegal, the federal government cannot force it to change its mind or its statutes.  </p>

<p>It is equally clear that state provision would be directly preempted. The state would be actively flaunting the CSA itself by growing and selling marijuana. (Though I note that there is a <a href="http://usatoday.com/story/news/2015/03/05/sheriffs-from-three-states-sue-colorado-over-marijuana/24385401/">new suit</a> filed by sheriffs in Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska claiming that they are directly preempted because they have to choose between enforcing federal and state law.)</p>

<p>Colorado however has a market with state regulations, which maps onto obstacle preemption. The state is not providing marijuana itself, but it is also doing something between the clear-cut cases of state participation (direct preemption) and state decriminalization (which cannot be commandeered otherwise). This is where we get to difficult questions about what the CSA's underlying policies are and whether Colorado's market helps or hinders those goals.  </p>

<p>One view sympathetic to Colorado would be that the goal of the CSA is to regulate the substances and control who has access to them. This was the losing argument that California made in defense of its medical marijuana system in <a href="https://law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1454.ZS.html/">Gonzalez v. Raich</a>. However since <span class="casename">Raich</span>, Deputy Attorney General James <a href="http://justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/3052013829132756857467.pdf">Cole's memo</a> [PDF] of August 2013 implicitly endorsed California's position. The Cole memo stated eight enforcement priorities of the federal government: preventing marijuana distribution to minors, the enrichment of criminal cartels, diversion to other states, the distribution of other drugs, violence associated with drug distribution, drugged driving, growing on public land and use on federal property. The guidance was that enforcement efforts should focus on programs that failed to prevent one or more of the eight priorities (though this was just non-binding guidance, as evidenced by <a href="http://allgov.com/usa/ca/news/california-and-the-nation/four-house-members-plead-with-us-attorney-to-stop-medical-marijuana-crackdown-131203?news=851807">US Attorney Melinda Haag's continuing battles</a> against one California dispensary). The Cole memo is not necessarily relevant evidence to discern the meaning of the CSA, but it does represent the current administration's conceptions of a good policy consistent with federal enforcement priorities (albeit in a medical context). Colorado's recreational policy certainly meets seven of these criteria. The remaining issue is diversion, which is what Nebraska and Oklahoma allege in paragraphs 55-64 (and elsewhere) in their complaint.</p>

<p>In addition to disputing the facts, Nebraska and Oklahoma also have a different view of the goals of the CSA. In their view, among the goals of the CSA are to "<em>prohibit entirely</em> the possession or use of marijuana, as one of the controlled substances listed in Schedule I, anywhere in the US, except as a part of a strictly controlled research project." (Paragraph 44 (emphasis in original).) Any possession of marijuana outside such a project runs counter to the goals of the CSA and is prohibited. It is unclear whether this claim about the CSA's goal requires proof that, absent a legal market, marijuana is actually unavailable to people&#8212;perhaps the CSA's goal is mere wishful thinking. When it comes to availability, the facts are on Colorado's side, with adults already having <a href="http://economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/01/daily-chart-11">access to medical marijuana</a> in 21 states (and recreational marijuana in four) and teens <a href="http://cbsnews.com/news/teens-pot-easier-to-buy-than-beer/">reporting</a> that pot is easier to buy than beer.  </p>

<p>One irony of the position of Nebraska and Oklahoma is that a totally decriminalized&#8212;but completely unregulated&#8212;market would certainly be immune to federal commandeering and result in much, much more diversion to their states. Unless the plaintiffs think they can roll back any loosening of prohibition, a win for them might leave them pining for the days of Colorado's regulated market.</p>

<p>In the end, it is unclear where this suit is going. Several Oklahoma conservatives signed a <a href="http://scribd.com/doc/251886898/Ritze-letter-to-AG-Pruitt#scribd">letter</a> opposing the Oklahoma attorney general's suit because they feared the anti-federalist precedent it might set. It is also unclear what the state of the law is. The complaint quotes <span class="casename">Gonzalez v. Raich's</span> expansive notion of the <a href="https://law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause">Commerce Clause</a> (in paragraph 9), but the <a href="http://supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf">Obamacare opinion</a> [PDF] of 2011 narrowed the Commerce power considerably. Is the passage of the CSA even constitutional under current commerce power jurisprudence?</p>

<p>On a more basic level there are questions of equity and federalism, and it is difficult to figure out who the wronged party is here. Is Colorado imposing its marijuana policies on Oklahoma and Nebraska, or are Oklahoma and Nebraska imposing their policies on Colorado? Part of the problem is that there is no "there" there&#8212;drug crimes are exclusively creatures of statute, and what's legal and illegal in terms of substances has always varied across time and place (just consider the fact that <a href="http://theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/why-we-took-cocaine-out-of-soda/272694/">cocaine in soda</a> came about as the result of a local nineteenth century alcohol prohibition, for example). This makes it different from something like pollution traveling from one state to another&#8212;one state could not argues that, say, <a href="http://epa.gov/region1/airquality/nox.html">Nitrogen Oxides are not pollutants</a>. But that is exactly the case here. One state's scourge is another state's economic benefit, and the facts are based on differences of opinion, not conditions in the world. (Though a former student of mine has argued that <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2540640">this suit fits into traditional nuisance theory</a>.)</p>

<p>The ultimate solution might not lie in either a court decision or a new set of statutes. The ultimate solution might be for the US to start enforcing the CSA itself. After all, it is illegal to transport marijuana across state lines, and avoiding diversion is one of the eight criteria in the Cole memo. But if the US wants to do that, it needs to do it itself. That would be the most direct solution, and one that would not run afoul of the commandeering principle. If the federal government fails to enforce its laws, that should be where the finger is pointed. This is why one of the states that borders Colorado&#8212;Wyoming, home of some very stringent anti-marijuana laws&#8212;refused to join the suit, with the governor <a href="http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/mead-supports-suing-feds-not-colorado-over-legalization-of-marijuana/article_96b25ff9-029e-5717-badb-01b205fc5acf.html">suggesting</a> he would prefer to sue the federal government directly.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=http://law2.wlu.edu/faculty/profiledetail.asp?id=24>Timothy Jost</a> of Washington and Lee University School of Law discusses how interpreting the ACA in <span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> affect Medicaid and CHIP recipients ... </p><strong>A</strong>n important issue flagged in the March 4 Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-health-care-subsidies.php">oral argument</a> in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/king-v-burwell/">King v. Burwell</a> has until now been largely ignored. For those who have not been following the case, <span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> challenges the availability of federal premium tax credits for individuals who purchase insurance through federally facilitated marketplaces under the <a href="http://medicaid.gov/affordablecareact/affordable-care-act.html">Affordable Care Act</a>. More than 8.4 million Americans have enrolled in health plans through the federally facilitated marketplaces, which serve two thirds of the states under the ACA. Eighty-seven percent of these enrollees receive premium tax credits. These tax credits reduce premiums an average of 72 percent for those who qualify for the tax credits, reducing their average net cost of insurance to about $101 a month.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs in <span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> argue that the ACA limits premium tax credits to "Exchanges established by the State," which they argue means state-operated marketplaces and not the federally facilitated marketplaces (called exchanges in the statute). Their claim is based on the fact that this phrase appears twice in the formula for calculating premium tax credits in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/36B">§ 36B</a> of the Internal Revenue Code, added by &#167 1401 of the ACA. They contend, therefore, that the IRS rule authorizing the federally facilitated marketplaces to issue premium tax credits is invalid.</p>

<p>There is no evidence in the extensive record of congressional committee hearings or debates that this is what Congress intended. The members of Congress who in fact drafted the legislation have <a href="http://theusconstitution.org/sites/default/files/briefs/King_v_Sebelius_CAC_Amicus_Final.pdf">represented</a> [PDF] to the Supreme Court that this claim is false. Moreover, the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/BriefsV5/14-114_amicus_affirm_va.authcheckdam.pdf">states</a> [PDF] did not understand that premium tax credits would be limited to state-operated exchanges when they were deliberating as to whether to operate their own exchange or elect to let the federal government do it. <a href="http://business-law-review.law.miami.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jost-Engstrand-Anomalies-in-the-ACA.pdf">More than fifty other provisions</a> [PDF] of the ACA do not make sense if the statute is read as the plaintiffs would read it. And six of the nine federal judges who to date have considered this claim have rejected it, <a href="http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/documents/halbig_opinion.pdf">finding</a> [PDF] <a href="http://premiumtaxcredits.wikispaces.com/file/view/5030191-0--17488.pdf">either</a> [PDF] that the statute clearly authorizes the federally facilitated exchange to grant premium tax credits or that the statute is <a href="http://premiumtaxcredits.wikispaces.com/file/view/141158.P.pdf">ambiguous</a> [PDF], and thus the courts should defer to the IRS rule. The <a href="http://premiumtaxcredits.wikispaces.com/file/view/14-5018-1503850.pdf">judgment</a> [PDF] of the two DC appellate court judges who found for the plaintiffs was subsequently <a href="http://premiumtaxcredits.wikispaces.com/file/view/DCC+en+banc+order.pdf">vacated</a> [PDF] by the full DC Circuit. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the issue is now before the Supreme Court and at least two of the justices, Scalia and Alito, seemed sympathetic to the plaintiffs' claims at oral argument.</p>

<p>One issue that has received little attention, however, is that the phrase "Exchange established by the State" in fact appears ten times in the ACA. The Competitive Enterprise Institute, which brought the <span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> case, focused on two of the places where the phrase appears in Title I, the private insurance reform title of the ACA.  But most of the sections where the phrase appears are in Title II, the Medicaid and CHIP Title.</p>

<p>Section 2201 of the Affordable Care Act (codified at <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1396w-3">42 USC § 1396w-3</a>) provides that as a condition of having a state Medicaid program and receiving any federal financial assistance under Medicaid, a state must, as of January 1, 2014 have in place procedures for enrolling in Medicaid and CHIP eligible individuals who are identified through an "Exchange established by the State." Section 2201 further requires that states have procedures in place for establishing a secure interface between their Medicaid and CHIP Programs and an "Exchange established by the State" and for linking their websites to the website of an "Exchange established by the State." The phrase "Exchange established by the State" appears four times in &#167 2201.</p>

<p>If the plaintiff's argument as to the premium tax credits is accepted, then the statute says, in plain language, no exchange established by the state, no state Medicaid program, no federal Medicaid funding. And when the section says no Medicaid funding, it is not just referring to funding for the Medicaid expansion population, it covers the entire state Medicaid program: old people in nursing homes, kids in facilities for the mentally or physically disabled, seniors who receive help with their Medicare premiums or cost sharing, over half of the persons with AIDS in the United States. </p>

<p>Similarly, § 2101 (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1397ee">codified at 42 USC § 1397ee(d)(3)(C)</a>) provides that, as a condition of approval of a state CHIP program, HHS must, not later than April 1, 2015, review the benefits offered and cost sharing imposed under the CHIP program and the benefits offered by qualified health plans through an "Exchange established by the State" and certify that they are least comparable. As of April 1, 2015, the CHIP Plans in 34 states must close down If the CEI's interpretation of the ACA is correct.</p>

<p><span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> has been criticized because of the breathtaking damage it would inflict on the American health care system if successful. <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2015/feb/king-v-burwell-what-shutdown-could-mean-consumers">Millions of people</a> will lose premium tax credits; <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2015/feb/king-v-burwell-what-shutdown-could-mean-insurers">millions more</a> will lose coverage in the nongroup market outside of the exchanges; <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2015/feb/king-v-burwell-what-shutdown-could-mean-providers">hospitals will</a> lose billions of dollars. But obviously the ambitions of the right-wing organization that had brought his litigation have been much too modest. Had the proponents read Title II of the ACA as well as Title I, they could have shut down the programs that have for 50 years provided health care to America's poor in 37 states. </p>

<p>The plaintiffs in this litigation claim that Congress intended to withhold premium tax credits from states that failed to operate their own exchanges because Congress wanted to force the states to operate their own exchanges. There is no evidence to support this theory&#8212;indeed I believe that no member of the 111th Congress has ever represented to a court that he or she believed this to be true at the time the statute was adopted. But it is simply inconceivable, and no one has yet argued, that Congress intended to deny Medicaid and CHIP funding to every state that decided not to operate its own exchange. Such a threat to the states would clearly raise constitutional questions, both as to whether the states were on notice of the threat and whether it was constitutionally coercive. But if you take seriously the plaintiff's argument as to Title I, it must also apply to Title II. The government's <a href="http://premiumtaxcredits.wikispaces.com/file/view/14-114+Respondents%27+Brief.pdf">brief</a> [PDF] makes this point, which was also affirmed by Solicitor General Verrilli at <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-114_lkhn.pdf">oral argument</a>.</p>

<p>So how can we avoid shutting down the Medicaid and CHIP programs, and destroying the individual insurance markets in two thirds of the states? It is simple. The court should read carefully all of the provisions of the law relevant to the federal exchange and premium tax credits so as to achieve a "harmonious whole," the way the court has often <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-1152.ZS.html">said</a> statutes should be read. It should begin with the definition of exchange found in §1563 (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300gg-91">42 USC § 300gg-91(d)(21)</a>). Under that definition, an Exchange, including a federally facilitated exchange is a 1311 (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/18031">42 USC § 18031</a>) exchange. States are asked by § 1311 to establish exchanges. If they do not do so, § 1321 (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/18041">42 USC § 18041(c)</a>) directs the Department of Health and Human Services to establish "such Exchange", the 1311 exchange, the required state exchange. Section 1413 (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/18083">42 USC § 18083(a)</a>) requires HHS to ensure that a system is available in each state for issuing premium tax credits.  Section 1312 (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/18032">42 USC § 18032(f)(1)</a>) defines "qualified individuals" as those who reside in the state that established the exchange, but federal exchanges must be able to enroll qualified individuals or they are completely pointless.</p>

<p>The court must either decide that the word "by" in &#167 1401 is the only word that matters in the ACA, and ignore over 50 provisions that support the contention that the federal marketplace can be, given the way the term is used in the statute as a term of art, an exchange established by the state. But it must realize that this will not only deprive millions of Americans of access to private health insurance, but also close down the Medicaid and CHIP programs in two thirds of the states. Alternatively, it can take the route that Justice Kennedy seems to have been contemplating&#8212;use the doctrine of constitutional avoidance to rule against the plaintiffs since otherwise the threat to the states would raise constitutional coercion and notice requirements. As yet another alternative, it can simply affirm the Fourth Circuit's decision to defer to the IRS's interpretation of the statute under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14437597860792759765">Chevron</a>. But if it rules for the plaintiffs based on a blinkered reading of one word, it must realize that the damage it will inflict may affect millions of Americans on Medicaid or CHIP whose fate has so far been largely ignored.</p>

		<title>University of Oklahoma Expels the First Amendment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.fiu.edu/faculty/directory/howard-m-wasserman/">Howard M. Wasserman</a>, of Florida International University College of Law, discusses the First Amendment and the University of Oklahoma's decision to expel fraternity members that used racially insensitive language ... </p><strong>T</strong>he <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>, Justice Holmes wrote in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18301429360145771597">US v. Schwimmer</a>, protects "not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate." Someone forgot to tell that to University of Oklahoma President David Boren.</p>

<p>Boren this week <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/03/10/oklahoma_fraternity_members_expelled_for_leading_n_r_chant_in_video.html">expelled two student members</a> of Oklahoma's SAE fraternity who were captured on video leading a racist chant among fraternity members. Boren insisted that the two students had "created a hostile learning environment for others" through their speech because the "threatening racist chant" was heard not only by those on the bus, but the entire university community when the video was distributed through social media. Boren also pledged to impose appropriate disciplinary action on any other chanting students who could be identified from the video.</p>

<p>There is no question that the speech is reprehensible and deserving of condemnation. The SAE national fraternity revoked the OU chapter's charter, disassociating itself from these individuals and all the members of the now-closed chapter have moved out of the house.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Boren and his political grandstanding, it is highly unlikely that his further actions in expelling the students will withstand judicial scrutiny should they sue. (This perhaps is a large if; prudence may compel the students to hide quietly for a time and try to move on with their lives). As reprehensible as the chant was, nothing about it exceeded the bounds of First Amendment protection.</p>

<p>The utterance of racist messages and epithets is constitutionally protected, so long as the racist speech does not fall within some other recognized category of unprotected expression, such as incitement, fighting words or "true threats." But this chant cannot be understood as falling into any of those categories. It was not fighting words&#8212;words which by their very nature invite a violent response (or, as <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-983_bq7d.pdf">Justice Kagan recently put it</a> [PDF], words "that would cause a reasonable person to punch you in the face"). But the category of fighting words has been narrowed, requiring targeted expression at a particular person during an up-close face-to-face encounter. It is not fighting words to burn a flag, even when veterans or other patriotic Americans are watching, nor is it fighting words to march in Nazi uniforms before a gathering of survivors of the Shoah. It certainly is not fighting words to lead a group chant talking about people who are not present at the time.</p>

<p>Nor could the chant constitute a "true threat." The Supreme Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2729037874515332053">Virginia v. Black</a> defined that as occurring "where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals." A speaker must "direct[] a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death." Boren hinted at this category in labeling the chant "threatening." Again, however, "threatening" has a particular First Amendment meaning that is not captured here, where the chant was not directed to any particular individuals and not done in a way that would put anyone in fear of bodily harm. Although the chant included the line "[y]ou can hang him from a tree," that reference directed at the world, without more, cannot constitute a threat.</p>

<p>Boren also dropped the phrase "hostile learning environment for others" as a further justification for the expulsion. His likely point is that for the university to allow such speech would violate <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/cor/coord/titlevi.php">Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, which prohibits recipients of federal funds (including universities) from discriminating on the basis of race or allowing a racially discriminatory environment to exist. But the Civil Rights Act cannot trump the First Amendment. Government can punish speech, even to avoid its own statutory liability, only if the speech falls into one of those unprotected categories. "Hostile environment" is not a recognized unprotected category. In fact, lower courts have invalidated every public university speech code ever challenged, including ones focused specifically on limiting speech that creates a hostile educational environment. The need to avoid a hostile environment is not recognized as a basis for limiting otherwise-protected, even if hateful, expression.</p>

<p>The expulsion here thus looks like simple naked viewpoint discrimination. The university punished the students for their speech because it objected to the content of that speech, specifically the racist viewpoint reflected in the chant. Had the students chanted that African-Americans were welcome in SAE or had they never mentioned race at all, they obviously would not have been punished. When government punishes speech because of its content, it must satisfy strict scrutiny, showing that its actions were the least restrictive means to serve a compelling government interest. And viewpoint discrimination is an extreme form of content discrimination that virtually never survives strict scrutiny. Even conceding that Oklahoma has a compelling interest in creating a non-hostile environment for students of color, it is not clear that punishing students who express a contrary viewpoint is the least restrictive means to achieve that end. In particular, the Court just a few years ago emphasized in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2853347803518998660">US v. Alvarez</a> the availability of government counter-speech as a less restrictive alternative to punishing speakers for the content of their speech. Boren and the University of Oklahoma certainly could makes their distaste for SAE's speech and their commitment to racial equality clear, even while allowing students to say otherwise from the margins. In fact, the university might be the ideal place for counter-speech; the school performs an inculcatory function for a student body with which it can regularly and systematically communicate and it has regular opportunities to join with other students and student organizations to make clear that, regardless of what a few SAE members might say, African-Americans and others are welcome on campus. </p>

<p>The university's only conceivable argument is that it enjoys broader power to regulate its students' speech than the government has to regulate citizens' speech. The Supreme Court's decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15235797139493194004">Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Sch. Dist.</a> establishes that schools can regulate speech that is likely to cause a "substantial disruption." But this argument faces several hurdles. First, <span class="casename">Tinker</span> generally does not apply to universities, only to secondary schools. Courts proceed on the belief (<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2015/02/university_speech_codes_students_are_children_who_must_be_protected.single.html">erroneous, in the view of Professor Eric Posner</a>) that college students are adults who enjoy more freedom of speech within the school setting than their high school counterparts. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3830023126010937654">Healy v. James</a>, the Supreme Court cited <span class="casename">Tinker</span>, but then insisted that "First Amendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the community at large." Again, this explains why every challenged university speech code has been invalidated, even if some of the speech prohibited under the code would be seen as disruptive under <span class="casename">Tinker</span>.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Boren, Oklahoma lies in the Tenth Circuit, one circuit that does apply <span class="case name">Tinker</span> to university speech, despite the language in <span class="casename">Healy</span>. But even applying <span class="casename">Tinker</span>, the university's actions remain problematic. This speech occurred off-campus, on a bus used by a group of students to attend an off-campus, non-university-sponsored event and the speech was intended to remain among the group on that bus. Even assuming a university's power to control racist speech in the classroom, in the dorm room, and even on the quad, it should not extend beyond university grounds or beyond university programs. Moreover, any substantial disruption is not a product of the chant itself; the students did not direct their speech at the broader university community, did not intend for the broader community to hear it and did not publish or distribute its speech among that community. The wider community only heard the speech because someone other than the speakers put it out there, presumably without the students' knowledge or permission. <span class="casename">Tinker</span> cannot be so broad as to give a school control over any and all speech by its students so long as that speech reaches campus, regardless of how or by whom.</p>

<p>In announcing the expulsion, Boren praised what he called the "'Real Sooners," who believe in mutual respect for all." He remains free, and should be encouraged, to rally with those "Real Sooners" in support of equality and mutual respect. But the First Amendment means he cannot get there by eliminating those who offer a different message.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Saroj Nair, LLM Student at <a href="http://www.law.hku.hk/">the University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law</a>, discusses Iran's international obligation with regards to its nuclear efforts and argues that Iran complies with its obligation under binding treaties and the Joint Plan of Action...</j:header><strong>A</strong>nother <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/iaea-iran-violated-joint-plan-of-action.php">condemnation</a> for Iran! Or is it? The Institute for Science and International Security used a UN International Atomic Energy Agency ("IAEA") <a href="http://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/gov-2014-58.pdf">report</a> [PDF] to <a href="http://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/ISIS_Analysis_IAEA_Report_7Nov2014-Final.pdf">accuse</a> [PDF] the beleaguered state of violating certain obligations under the Joint Plan of Action ("JPOA"). The <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/statements/docs/2013/131124_03_en.pdf">JPOA</a> [PDF] was agreed between the E3+3 (also known as the P5+1: the US, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China plus Germany) and Iran on November 24, 2013, in the pursuance of a "mutually agreeable long-term comprehensive solution that would ensure that Iran's nuclear program would be exclusively peaceful."  </p>

<p>Under the JPOA, Iran had committed to halting uranium enrichment to 20 percent (the key source of worry for the E3+3, in as much as 20 percent enriched uranium can be easily converted into the levels of enrichment required for weapons-grade uranium) and restricting enrichment to 5 percent (for use as fuel). Iran also reaffirmed (not for the first time) that it would not seek or develop nuclear weapons. Iran also consented to the IAEA enhanced monitoring pursuant to the JPOA. In return the E3+3 was supposed to ease back on certain financial and economic sanctions imposed against Iran during the implementation of each step of the enrichment program. The E3+3 and Iran, all parties to the JPOA, were responsible for implementation and completion of the JPOA terms. The IAEA was responsible for verification of nuclear-related measures, in addition to its monitoring activities under its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement ("CSA") and its Joint Statement on a Framework for Cooperation Agreement with Iran. </p>

<p>In November 2014 the JPOA was extended until June 30, 2015 in order to allow the E3+3 and Iran to agree on the comprehensive long-term plan provided by the JPOA and end the decade-long impasse between Iran and the West. In the meantime, the E3+3 issued statements <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/kerry-eve-netanyahu-speech-nuclear-negotiators-deserve-benefit-doubt">assuring</a> the international community that both JPOA parties had <a href="http://thewire.com/global/2014/07/iran-complying-with-nuclear-wind-down/374763/">implemented</a> their respective commitments without any violations or impediments. </p>

<p>It is therefore surprising that Iran is alleged to fail to comply with the JPOA. ISIS referred to the IAEA report of November 2014 and claimed that Iran was feeding uranium hexafluoride gas ("UF6") into the IR-5 centrifuge at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz, in violation of its commitment to freeze its centrifuge activities at the plant during the period of the JPOA. The IAEA report points out that Iran did not suspend all of its enrichment-related activities, violating IAEA Board of Governors resolutions and UN Security Council resolutions. In relation to activities on the plant, it points out that Iran has been "intermittently feeding natural UF6 into the IR-5 and IR-6 centrifuges." The institute relies on this information to claim Iran violated its obligations under the JPOA. </p>

<p>In addition, the latest IAEA <a href="https://iaea.org/sites/default/files/gov2015-15.pdf">report</a> [PDF] of February 19, 2015 points out that two measures (relating to initiation of high explosives and neutron transport calculations) of the Cooperation Agreement third step remain outstanding despite several reminders made to Iran. Importantly, these obligations arise out of the cooperation agreement and not the JPOA. Therefore, Iran is not violating the JPOA. </p>

<p>The IAEA also urges Iran to cooperate to assure the peaceful nature of its nuclear program, especially with respect to undeclared nuclear material and activities, as it is still unable to "conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is being used for peaceful activities." </p>

<p>This article considers two issues: whether Iran violated the JPOA terms and whether the IAEA has a mandate to monitor and verify if Iran uses its nuclear material solely for peaceful purposes.</p>

<p>I believe Iran does not violate JPOA terms. To analyze if an act violates the JPOA, it is necessary to look at the JPOA terms. Iran is claimed to feed natural UF6 into the advanced IR-5 centrifuge. Under the JPOA terms, Iran has agreed that "it will continue its safeguarded R&#38;D practices including its current enrichment R&#38;D practices, which are not designed for accumulation of the enriched uranium." The IAEA report of November 11, 2014 mentions in paragraphs 25 and 26 that Iran has been feeding natural UF6 into the IR-5 centrifuge and IR-6 centrifuge as single machines, in the R&#38;D area of the Natanz plant. However, no low-enriched uranium has been withdrawn as the product and the tails have been recombined at the end of the process. Since Iran has not been enriching uranium in the advanced centrifuge (and therefore no question of accumulation arises), the act of feeding the centrifuge with natural UF6 cannot be construed as a violation of the JPOA terms.</p>

<p>In addition, the alleged activity is being carried out in the R&#38;D area of the Natanz plant. According to the JPOA, Iran is entitled to continue "its safeguarded R&#38;D practices including its current enrichment R&#38;D practices," which implies that Iran could enrich uranium (up to 5 percent) for R&#38;D purposes as long as it does not use such practices to accumulate enriched uranium. Furthermore, Iran has agreed in the JPOA not to make further advances of its activities at the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant, and it must be appreciated that no such undertaking has been provided for the Natanz plant R&#38;D facility. </p>

<p>Moreover, the Natanz plant is a declared facility under Safeguards verification with IAEA. Since the Natanz plant facility is subject to IAEA monitoring, the IAEA provided no evidence to substantiate that the above activity could be linked to a military diversion or to divert nuclear material for creating weapons grade uranium. It is relevant that the IAEA itself has concluded that the plant facility has operated as Iran declared in the relevant design information questionnaire. Interestingly, the IAEA report of February 19, 2015 does not mention feeding the IR-5. Thus, Iran is complying with the <a href="http://armscontrol.org/issue-briefs/2014-12-23/Understanding-the-Extension-of-the-Iran-Nuclear-Talks-and-the-Joint-Plan-of-Action">conditions of the JPOA extension</a>. Having said that, the right to R&#38;D activities is available to Iran under the JPOA.</p>

<p>The JPOA contains words like "voluntary" and "would undertake," which seem to refer to the legally non-binding character of the JPOA. Notwithstanding the arguments referring to the JPOA, the right to use nuclear energy is available to Iran under a legally binding international treaty. Iran is a Non-Nuclear-Weapon State under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and thus has the inalienable right under Article IV(1) to "develop research, produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination," subject to Iran not manufacturing nuclear weapons, and entering into a safeguards agreement with the IAEA. Iran has signed a CSA with the IAEA and so far, the IAEA has not provided any credible evidence to prove that Iran has manufactured a nuclear weapon. Therefore, Iran has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. <br />
 <br />
Since the language of Article IV(1) uses the terms "develop research," "produce" and "use," it can be argued that the process of "producing" nuclear energy could include the process of enrichment of uranium, as it is one of the processes involved in producing nuclear energy. Most of the 500 commercial nuclear reactors in the world <a href="http://world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Conversion-Enrichment-and-Fabrication/Uranium-Enrichment/">use uranium enriched in isotope U-235</a> for producing fuel. Natural uranium consists of two isotopes, U-235 (0.7 percent) and U-238 (99.3 percent). The process of isolating the 0.7 percent U-235 to about 5 percent U-235 (relative to U-238) is referred to as enrichment. Most commercial nuclear reactors are light water reactors and require 5-percent enriched U-235 for its fuel. Therefore, in view of Article IV(1), the word "produce" can be arguably interpreted, in its ordinary meaning, according to the general principles of treaty interpretation, to include uranium enrichment.</p>

<p>Therefore, Iran has not violated the terms of the JPOA by feeding the IR-5 centrifuge in the Natanz PFEP R&#38;D facility with natural UF6. </p>

<p>The other issue seems to be the IAEA observations that they are not sure whether Iran uses nuclear material solely for peaceful activities. The question is whether the IAEA has the mandate to make this determination regarding "all" nuclear material in Iran. I believe there is no legal mandate for the IAEA to determine whether all the nuclear material in Iran is being used for peaceful purposes. Under the CSA, the IAEA has the authority to verify declared materials and facilities for the exclusive purpose of verifying the non-diversion of fissile materials for military purposes. Under the JPOA, the IAEA has the authority to conduct enhanced monitoring activities at declared facilities. Finally, under the cooperation agreement, the IAEA has the authority to investigate declared sites in the <a href="https://iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-iran-sign-joint-statement-framework-cooperation">Annex</a> to the cooperation agreement.</p>

<p>It is submitted that the JPOA and the cooperation agreement increase the scope of the IAEA's verification mandate but still does not provide the authority to the IAEA to make a determination about all nuclear material in Iran. Besides, considering Iran did not ratify Additional Protocol, the IAEA does not seem to have a legal mandate to go beyond verifying the accuracy of the declared material and facilities, and therefore, their observations about not being able to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is being used for peaceful purposes have no legal basis. </p>

<p>It is worth noting the IAEA submitted no evidence to justify its suspicions of Iran's diversion of enriched uranium towards creating weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, it must be appreciated that the IAEA and the parties to the JPOA have not alleged any violation by Iran under the JPOA. This being the case, it is puzzling that the allegation of non-compliance with the JPOA is floating around, courtesy of the <a href="http://isisnucleariran.org/assets/pdf/Note_IR-5_Feeding_Iran_Nuclear_JPA_20Nov2014-Final.pdf">institute</a> [PDF], and not the IAEA as indicated in <a href="http://thetower.org/1217-iaea-report-found-iran-in-violation-of-last-years-joint-plan-of-action/">various</a> <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/us-think-tank-says-iran-may-violated-nuclear-103724668.html">articles</a>. </p>

<p>In conclusion, the JPOA actually recognizes the right of Iran to enrich uranium for use in peaceful purposes, and therefore, Iran has not violated the JPOA terms by feeding UF6 to an IR-5 centrifuge in the R&D facility at Natanz. There is absolutely no evidence to the contrary (as to purpose), and as a consequence, the allegation by the Institute, riding on the IAEA report, seems to be unwarranted. In fact, in view of the CIA whistleblower <a href="http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-20/cia-s-nuclear-bomb-sting-said-to-spur-review-in-iran-arms-case">revelations</a> in a recent case in US court, the veracity of evidence provided by intelligence agencies, including those of the US, regarding alleged clandestine nuclear activities in Iran during the period leading to the imposition of sanctions by the UN Security Council has been <a href="http://rt.com/news/234271-cia-nuclear-evidence-iran-iaea/">tainted</a> beyond doubt.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.unl.edu/eric-berger/">Eric Berger</a>, of the <a href="http://law.unl.edu/">University of Nebraska College of Law</a>, considers whether the US Supreme Court is ready to finally invalidate bans on same-sex marriages on the national scale and tries to predict what issues the US Supreme Court would address in such decision ...</p><strong>T</strong>he US Supreme Court appears ready to invalidate the remaining state prohibitions on same-sex marriage later this term. It is often dangerous to read too much into the court's <a href="http://scotusblog.com/2014/10/todays-orders-same-sex-marriage-petitins-denied/">tea leaves</a>, but even justices who would defer to the states on such matters <a href="http://supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14a840_gol1.pdf">seem to acknowledge the writing on the wall</a> [PDF]. Of course surprises can happen, but the common wisdom is that the court <a href="http://feature/2015/02/overview-of-the-petitions-for-writ-of-certiorari-and-the-courts-grant.php">this term</a> will sweep away the remaining state same-sex marriage bans, as it should.</p>

<p>Assuming the court rules as expected, how should it write the opinion? In striking down other laws burdening same-sex couples and/or gay and lesbian persons more generally, the court has placed substantial weight on its perceptions that the laws at issue were motivated by animus. By relying on such findings, the court in cases like <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17758055891258118781">Romer v. Evans</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">US v. Windsor</a> found an equal protection violation without having to hold that gay and lesbian persons were members of a suspect class deserving heightened protection.    </p>

<p>One can understand why the court declined to hold sexual orientation a suspect classification. Such a doctrinal move in <span class="casename">Romer</span> would have called into question the constitutionality of numerous laws, including the military's Don't Ask Don't Tell policy, and the court generally tries to <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2114357">avoid stepping on the toes</a> of special governmental institutions, like the armed forces. Furthermore, the application of heightened scrutiny, especially by the time of <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, would all but have decided the marriage question. <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2014/D09-04/C:14-2526:J:Posner:aut:T:fnO">States have found it hard enough</a> to articulate a legitimate governmental interest served by same-sex marriage bans; it is virtually impossible to articulate an <em>important</em> one. But though Justice Scalia complained in <span class="casename">Windsor</span> that the court's decision would <a href="http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2014/08/will-scalias-words-cement-same-sex-marriage-into-the-law/">inevitably</a> spell the demise of state same-sex marriage prohibitions, the court did not want to decide the marriage issue yet, and (so?) it resolved the cases on other grounds.  </p>

<p>Now however, it appears that the court <em>will</em> decide the marriage question, so the consequences of heightened scrutiny will likely seem less problematic to the justices. The court, therefore, should use the marriage case to announce that sexual orientation is a suspect classification triggering intermediate scrutiny. Applying such an analysis, the court should hold that same-sex marriage prohibitions deny equal protection of the laws, because they are not substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental interest. (The court incidentally could also hold that the marriage bans violate the <a href="https://law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process Clause</a> of the <a href="https://law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> by impinging on the fundamental right to marry. I think equal protection is the better and more likely doctrinal vehicle, though the court could <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1392122">borrow</a> due process principles to help support an equal protection holding, or vice versa.) </p>

<p>I suggest heightened scrutiny with some trepidation. The tiers of scrutiny are an imperfect doctrinal mechanism for fleshing out equal protection (or anything else), and the court sometimes <a href="http://bu.edu/bulawreview/files/2014/05/ARAIZA.pdf">bypasses the tiers</a> [PDF] in important cases. The court for several decades now has also usually <a href="http://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/vol124_yoshino.pdf">refused to identify new suspect classes</a> [PDF].   </p>

<p>However for all the tiers' flaws, heightened scrutiny remains the best way to resolve this issue. For one, gay and lesbian persons deserve the legal protections afforded by intermediate scrutiny. Winning the battle over marriage equality will be a big step for the gay and lesbian community, but it will not be the final battle. The court could help protect that community from further discrimination by announcing to the nation that classifications based on sexual orientation are inherently suspect.  </p>

<p>Precedent forms less of an obstacle to this approach than one might think. Scholars disagree about whether <span class="casename">Romer</span> held that laws targeting gays and lesbians receive only rational basis review or alternatively, found that the Colorado amendment failed rational basis and therefore would have failed any level of scrutiny. Either way the common wisdom is that the court did not apply deferential rationality review but rather "rational basis with bite." In invaliding section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a>, <span class="casename">Windsor</span> abstained from articulating a tier of scrutiny but also seemed to apply searching review. Heightened scrutiny is not what the court says in these cases, but it may be what it does.  </p>

<p>This reading of the case law mirrors a progression in other areas in which the court has seemed to apply heightened scrutiny before officially announcing it. In the sex discrimination context, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9505211932515131375">Reed v. Reed</a> purported to apply rationality review in striking down the challenged law. Commentators however have argued that <span class="casename">Reed</span> implied that sex-based laws are inherently suspect, and the court in subsequent cases explicitly applied heightened scrutiny to laws classifying on the basis of sex.    </p>

<p>More to the point, sexual orientation satisfies the court's traditional inquiry for recognizing a suspect class. First, gay and lesbian people historically have been subjected to terrible discrimination in this country. Second, sexual orientation bears no relationship to a person's ability to contribute meaningfully to society. Third, <a href="http://apa.org/about/offices/ogc/amicus/windsor-us.pdf">psychological research</a> [PDF] strongly indicates that sexual orientation is immutable or at the very least highly resistant to change. Fourth, while gay and lesbian persons have certainly made substantial gains in recent years, they still constitute a minority group enjoying only limited political power. This fourth point is admittedly contestable, but the other three factors weigh strongly in favor of heightened scrutiny, and the court typically considers these factors collectively rather than as elements that must be independently satisfied.  </p>

<p>The court should also contemplate the dangers of rooting its decision in findings of animus. It is certainly true that some opponents of same-sex marriage harbor animus for same-sex couples. But other people oppose same-sex marriage not out of malevolence but due to a variety of sentiments, such as tradition, religion and fear of change. These rationales, in my mind, do not justify the marriage bans, but it is a mistake to label them all "animus." These stated justifications may sometimes be subterfuge for spite, but sometimes they are not. I know people who wish their gay and lesbian friends well but still feel uncomfortable supporting marriage equality. I think their conclusion is wrong, but that does not mean it is hateful.  </p>

<p>To be sure, the word "<a href="http://merriam-webster.com/dictionary/animus">animus</a>" is susceptible to <a href="http://columbialawreview.org/windsor-animus_pollvogt/">many definitions</a> and may merely reflect unconscious bias. But even though Justice Kennedy in <span class="casename">Romer</span> and <span class="casename">Windsor</span> likely intended the word to diagnose not "<a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-28/opinion/ct-oped-0628-zorn-20130628_1_marriage-act-doma-gay-marriage">unhinged members of a wild-eyed lynch mob</a>" but merely the outdated prejudices of a less enlightened era, the word still often connotes a <a href="http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/48/2/Topic/48-2_Smith.pdf">sinister intention</a> [PDF] that causes <a href="https://commonwealmagazine.org/worth-worrying-about">needless offense</a>. Phrased somewhat differently, even if the opinions properly read <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2424743">did not accuse</a> the laws' supporters of bigotry, plenty of readers understood them to do exactly that.  </p>

<p>A judicial finding of "animus" indeed is an unstable foundation upon which to rest such an important constitutional development. As just noted, the meaning of the term is highly malleable. Justices also disagree sharply about what kinds of evidence indicate animus. Further complicating matters, if a legislature had <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2014/10/unconstitutional-animus-araiza-responds.html">multiple motives</a> for passing a law&#8212;some malicious, others not&#8212;should the presence of <em>some</em> animus doom the statute? </p>

<p>A marriage decision rooted in findings of animus may also create unnecessary legal complications.  In <span class="casename">Romer</span> and <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, the court plausibly&#8212;though controversially&#8212;identified animus in the legislative history of the challenged provisions. The marriage cases by contrast invite the court to throw out numerous same-sex marriage bans across the nation, including those not currently before the court. Courts in theory could examine the specific facts behind each state's marriage laws in a series of challenges over the next few years. This approach, however, would be inefficient, and it would leave in place marriage bans not found to rest on animus or not yet subjected to this inquiry. Such an outcome would quite obviously be unsatisfactory to same-sex couples awaiting marriage rights, as it would require further delay and extended litigation <em>after</em> a victory in the US Supreme Court. Under this approach, federal courts also would likely make recurrent pronouncements that various marriage bans <em>do</em> reflect animus. Such repeated pokes in the eyes of marriage opponents would only make it more difficult for the country to move on.  </p>

<p>The more likely approach would be for the court to find that marriage bans reflect animus <em>per se</em>. This approach would avoid the legal chaos of numerous state-specific inquiries, but it would invalidate some state laws, including constitutional amendments, for improper motive without actually bothering to examine the specifics of the laws at issue. It also would needlessly cast aspersions on millions of Americans who may vaguely favor the status quo without ill will in their hearts. Many of these people will likely eventually join the fast-growing <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics">majority of Americans who favor same-sex marriage</a>, but in the meantime tarring them with "<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=12-307">the brush of bigotry</a>" will not likely help change their views.</p>

<p>Even if the court considered the word "animus" convenient shorthand for the very real societal harm the bans inflict, the majority should recognize that such language is more likely to fan partisan flames than build consensus. The court presumably has avoided the marriage issue so far in part because it feared that its decision might prompt a <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/from-the-closet-to-the-altar-9780199922109?cc=us&lang=en&">backlash</a>. Given the fast-growing support for marriage equality today, a major backlash seems less likely today than it did even a few years ago (though some resistance is, of course, inevitable). Nevertheless, the court should be sensitive to these concerns and should not needlessly alienate those Americans who may be on their way but have not yet come fully around on this issue. If the court wants to play a didactic function in our society, it would be wiser to celebrate a broad constitutional commitment to equality than to denigrate those Americans who, correctly or not, see themselves as guardians of ancient traditions.   <br />
   <br />
These points should not be overstated. Few Americans read US Supreme Court opinions closely, and any court decision on this issue, however framed, will instantaneously have its healthy share of fans and foes. But the media and other sources do share judicial reasoning with the public, and the court's <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2436503">rhetoric</a> can affect the country's reaction. Marriage equality is legally and symbolically important for same-sex couples and their children, and it is also a vital step towards a more just, fair and compassionate nation. In taking that necessary step, the court should choose its words carefully.   </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.columbia.edu/fac/Tseliso_Thipanyane">Tseliso Thipanyane</a>, of the Columbia University Law School and the Safer South Africa Foundation, discusses human trafficking and slavery issues in Africa and the causes ... </p><strong>M</strong>ore than two hundred years since the abolition of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade on March 25, 1807, a trade that saw millions of African people taken away from their homes and families to work under brutal conditions far away from their homes and loved ones; millions of African people continue to be enslaved in their own countries, in the African continent and in many parts of the world as modern slaves to enrich the new slave masters. The majority of these victims are women and children.</p>

<p>The pursuit of wealth and associated power and influence and the huge profits made from slavery and that sustained the trade for decades in the sixteenth to nineteenth century continue to spur human trafficking in the twenty-first century. Huge illegal profits are made out of modern slavery. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that over <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/news/WCMS_250243/lang--en/index.htm">US$150 billion</a> in illicit profits is made by the private economy annually by those who trade human beings today and that around $99 billion of this amount is attributed to commercial sexual exploitation. Over 21 million people are victims of forced labour and 4.5 million of these are victims of forced sexual exploitation according to the ILO. The <a href="http://www.globalslaveryindex.org/">2014 Global Slavery Index</a> of the Walk Free Foundation on the other estimates that 35.8 million people are currently held in modern slavery. </p>

<p>Several African countries, such as Mauritania, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Sudan are some of the world's leading countries where modern slavery is rife. African countries made 15 of the top twenty countries in the world engaged in modern day slavery according to the 2014 Global Slavery Index report. Mauritania tops the list with the highest estimated number of enslaved people per capita, 150,000 in a population of 3.8 million, while Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo are in the list of top ten countries with the largest estimated numbers of enslave persons, a list that includes India, China, Pakistan and Russia. </p>

<p>In response to slavery, one of the most egregious forms of human rights violations indeed, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> provides that "no one shall be held in slavery or servitude" and that "slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms." This was followed by the adoption of various instruments in an attempt to rally the global community against slavery and its impact. These include the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/TrafficInPersons.aspx">UN Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others</a> (1949), the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/treaties/CTOC/">UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons</a> (2000) and various International Labour Organizations' instruments such as the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C029">Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No.29)</a>. There is also the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unodc.org%2Fdocuments%2Fhuman-trafficking%2FUnited_Nations_Global_Plan_of_Action_to_Combat_Trafficking_in_Persons.pdf&ei=WrINVeufPMbAggT96oPYCw&usg=AFQjCNG5KKTT1aAbsb4TWJZfhKerSeM-GQ&bvm=bv.89060397,d.eXY">2010 UN Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons</a> [PDF], a <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/479/41/PDF/N0947941.pdf?OpenElement">General Assembly resolution</a> (A/RES/64/293), calling for global, regional and sub-regional efforts and cooperation in the prevention of trafficking, protection of victims of trafficking and the prosecution of crimes of trafficking.  The UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) established in 1997, is the lead UN agency to address human trafficking and is also the guardian of related international instruments in this regard.</p>

<p>In the African context, the <a href="http://www.achpr.org/instruments/achpr/">1981 African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights</a> prohibits slavery and human trafficking. The Charter is beefed up by the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/africa/afchild.htm">African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the African Child</a> and <a href="http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol/">Protocol of the Rights of Women</a>, which makes specific provisions on the protection of women and children against slavery. The <a href="http://www.au.int/en/sites/default/files/Ouagadougou Action Plan - E.pdf">Ouagadougou Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, Especially Women and Children</a> [PDF], adopted by the African Union in November 2006, reaffirms international instruments on human trafficking and encourages African states to adopt legislative, administrative and institutional measures to combat trafficking in human beings. These measures include the formulation and implementation of national action plans and regional actions plans by African states to provide for comprehensive and coordinated interventions.</p>

<p>There are also <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Trafficking/Dakar_summary_structures_en.pdf">sub-regional efforts</a> [PDF] to combat human trafficking such as the ECOWAS (Economic Organization of West African States) Initial Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons (2002-2003), the joint ECOWAS/ECCAS Regional Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children (2006-2009) and the SADC (Southern African Development Community) Regional Plan of Action on Trafficking in Persons (2009-2019).</p>

<p>At the country level, Nigeria is said to be the leading nation in the fight against human trafficking in the African continent. It was the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmercury.ethz.ch%2Fserviceengine%2FFiles%2FISN%2F44808%2Fipublicationdocument_singledocument%2Fbcea63bf-a73a-452e-8d4c-96c68b30545a%2Fen%2F2006_WP_Review%2Bof%2Blegislation%2Band%2Bpolicies%2Bin%2BNigeria%2B.pdf&ei=UIUNVa68BO2wsASAyICQBg&usg=AFQjCNEA7AADAj5eaIS_jiiUg_WHBMEURg&sig2=WOVfjblLqL30u5BSPAPW2A&bvm=bv.88528373,d.cWc">first African country</a> [PDF] to enact an anti-trafficking legislation in 2003 and to establish a dedicated anti-trafficking agency, the National Agency for Prohibition of Traffic in Persons and Other Related Matters (NAPTIP). It also has the highest number of successful prosecutions in this regard. <br />
 <br />
South Africa, one of Africa's leading countries, which is also a country of origin, transit and destination in relation to internal and external trafficking due to its wealth and economic position, has introduced several measures to combat human trafficking in response to its international treaty obligations and increasing number of people in modern slavery. In this regard, the<a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2013-007.pdf"> Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act No. 7</a> [PDF], was passed in 2013. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2007-032.pdf">Sexual Offences and Related Matters Act 32 of 2007</a> [PDF], also provides several offences pertaining to the trafficking of persons for sexual purposes and the sexual exploitation of children specifically. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding international, regional and national measures to combat human trafficking, the levels of human trafficking remain high in many African countries. A country like South Africa, despite its strong human rights based constitution and constitutional bodies like the South African Human Rights Commission and the Commission for Gender Equality (which can play important preventive and protection roles), was estimated to have had 106,000 enslaved people according to the 2014 Global Slavery Index whilst Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo had estimated 834,200 and 762,900 victims of modern slavery respectively. </p>

<p>Thousands of African women from West Africa are annually trafficked to Western Europe for forced commercial sex work according to the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2012/October/nigeria-launches-anti-human-trafficking-campaign-appoints-goodwill-ambassadors.html">UNDOC</a>. Nigeria is said to be the largest single source of trafficked women in Europe and the Middle East, with an estimated 10,000 Nigerian sex workers in Italy, many of them victims of trafficking. </p>

<p>The late adoption of laws in most Sub-Saharan African countries to combat human trafficking, the weaknesses of these laws and their inadequate implementation constitute a major challenge in the African continent. South Africa's law on trafficking was only introduced in parliament in 2010 and took three years before it was enacted in 2003 and has yet to come into operation.  </p>

<p>The ineffectiveness of criminal justice systems and related institutions in combating human trafficking has also resulted in very few successful prosecutions and conviction of traffickers. The 2014 Global Report on Trafficking in Persons of the UN Offices on Drugs and Crime indicates that "only 4 in 10 countries reported having 10 or more yearly convictions, with nearly 15 percent having no convictions at all." The Sub-Saharan African region only had 574 human trafficking prosecutions and 341 convictions in 2013 according to the <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/226844.pdf">US 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report</a> [PDF].      <br />
   <br />
The high levels of poverty, unemployment, corruption and armed conflicts coupled with low levels of education and awareness and lack of effective and good governance, contribute to the prevailing challenges of human trafficking in the African continent and undermine efforts taken to combat this phenomenon. The numerous conflicts in the continent, the new scramble for its mineral resources and the ever increasing illicit trade in drugs constitute a major threat for children and women trafficked into these areas as child soldiers and sex slaves. Many victims of trafficking also tend to move from poor areas to affluent ones and many are lured by promises of a better life.</p>

<p>Concerted and extensive efforts are required to effectively fight human trafficking in Africa and in Sub-Saharan Africa in particular. The global nature of the phenomenon also requires greater global efforts and collaboration. Ending human trafficking and modern slavery and addressing the plight and misery of its victims, especially women and children, is a collective responsibility. African cannot endure another form of slavery after the devastating impacts of the <a href="http://www.au.int/en/content/international-day-remembrance-victims-slavery-and-transatlantic-slave-trade-message-african-">transatlantic slavery</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnists B. Shaw Drake and Mai El-Sadany, <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu">Georgetown University Law Center</a>, Class of 2015, discuss the military's violations of the due process of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay since 9/11...</j:header><strong>O</strong>n March 18th President Obama said if he could relive his first day in office he would have closed Guantanamo Bay. As disastrous as the detention center has been for America's international reputation, the Military Commission system has been an equal debacle of justice.</p>

<p>"But the problem is I cannot trust him because he was working at the black site with the CIA and we know him from there." Such were the words of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ramzi">Ramzi bin Al-Shibh</a>, 42-year old accused 9/11 co-conspirator, who, one quiet Monday morning, addressed Judge James L. Pohl of the 9/11 military commission at Guantanamo Bay and uncovered the identity and background of the new interpreter who had recently been assigned to work with his defense team. Revealing what some defense counsel referred to as a "silent, yet deadly grenade." The gravity of bin Al-Shibh's statement left a heavy air in the courtroom, off-roading the trajectory of the process once again after months of hiatus. </p>

<p>Initially prepared to argue procedural issues of severance, defense teams quickly scrambled to request that proceedings be halted, utterly shocked at yet another surreal reminder of the men they were representing, the venue in which they were appearing and the process in which they were partaking. By week's end, defense, prosecution, judge and NGO observers all packed up, uncertain of how the deteriorating status of due process would be resolved and unclear as to when they would return to the island next.</p>

<p>At best, the CIA interpreter is an example of governmental incompetence in adjudicating a fair trial. At worst, it is another instance of an outside agency attempting to infiltrate the defense teams. Regardless, the 9/11 trial has been plagued by numerous examples of due process <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/military-judge-halts-911-trial-following-accusations-of-fbi-spying.php">violations</a> that allude to an increasingly-undeniable realization that the military commission may not be the most appropriate venue for a fair trial. </p>

<p>In 2013, defense attorneys <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/gitmo_smoke_detector_was_a_microphone_but_official_says_lawyer-client_talks/">were shocked </a>to find out that the smoke detectors in their attorney-client meeting rooms were actually CIA listening devices connected to a nearby room where an agent sat listening to privileged conversations. Air Force Capt. Michael Schwartz described feeling nauseated when he stood up on his chair, read the company name of the smoke detector and ran a Google search only to reveal the disguised listening device manufacturer. Adding an even more surreal element to the proceedings, it was also later revealed that the CIA maintained outside control over the top-secret courtroom's public audio feed and that defense desk microphones continued to pick up confidential conversations when they appeared to be turned off. As recently as April 2014, a member of the Al-Shibh defense team was approached at his Virginia home and convinced to sign a nondisclosure agreement with the FBI, raising potential concerns regarding a conflict of interest. While the extent and nature of the FBI investigation has yet to be revealed, it is clear that an outside agency successfully gathered information from within the defense team, calling into question the ability of the attorneys' to continue their representation and further highlighting the slew of problems associated with a military commission. </p>

<p>The glaring question of motive behind these actions is purely a matter of speculation.   Agency officials have used national security concerns to justify the monitoring of the defense teams charged with representing the most notorious terrorist suspects in US judicial history. What is not speculation however is that the military commission was first established to conceal the extent of US torture programs and other classified information.  </p>

<p>With the much-anticipated release of the Senate's Committee <a href="http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/study2014/sscistudy2.pdf">Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program</a> [PDF], more commonly referred to as the "Torture Report," the case for a military commission becomes less compelling. Revealing thousands of pages of detail on the "enhanced interrogation techniques" employed by the US government on detainees between 2001 and 2006, the report sheds light on the confinement conditions and treatment that may have produced some of the evidence that is currently being amassed against the "9/11 five." More importantly, the report changes the dynamics inside the Guantanamo courtroom. For years, the word "torture" could never have been spoken inside the courtroom; when the court finally reconvened during the week of February 9, 2015 for the first time since the report's release, lawyers could finally refer to the torture their clients had been subjected to. Defense attorney Walter Ruiz, representing defendant Mustafa al-Hawsawi, explained why his client had spent the last few years with an extra pillow on his chair. He spoke of the "sodomy" and rectal examinations that al-Hawsawi had undergone and the fact that his client continues to undergo chronic rectal bleeding even today due to the complicity of the very doctors who were designated to treat him. "I couldn't have told you that before the Senate intelligence report was released," Ruiz <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/02/25/388715070/torture-report-reshapes-conversation-in-guantanamo-courtroom">says</a>.</p>

<p>Now thanks to the report, defense counsel will be able to cite to a number of conditions and circumstances that are documented by the US government without fear of violating classification guidelines; such conditions will very likely be instrumental in making arguments for what the law refers to as "mitigating circumstances," paving the way for lesser sentences. The report also counsels towards increasing observability by the public and unlocking key aspects of discovery that will become instrumental as the case finally proceeds on the merits.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R41163.pdf">Military Commission Act of 2009</a> [PDF] establishes the 9/11 military commission in its current incarnation. Those subjected to a military commission "do not benefit from the numerous protections granted in federal court." Of particular note, military commissions allow for the use of hearsay and other evidence not accepted in federal court. There is no right to a speedy trial; a panel of military personnel, not a civilian jury, determines guilt or innocence. Perhaps of greatest concern is the fact that Executive branch agencies oversee all sides of the proceeding. Defense counsel are appointed military defense attorneys, the prosecution is lead and comprised of high-ranking military officers.  </p>

<p>With the world's eye on Guantanamo Bay and international condemnation of the US for torturing its detainees, the need for fairness and legitimacy in the trial of the "9/11 five" has never been greater. If the US is to retain respect for its underlying values, it must reexamine its current attempts to bring justice to those allegedly responsible for the 9/11 attacks.  </p>

<p>At one point in the short history of the 9/11 military commission, there may have been a slight tilt in favor of trying the "9/11 five" in a military court instead of a federal one, a notion once furthered by executive agencies seeking to maintain control over the release of information. Today, with a Torture Report that has increasingly overcome classification limitations and an increasingly worrisome laundry list of incidents chipping away at notions of due process, this is clearly no longer the case. </p>

<p>The circumstances at hand mandate that the Executive and Congress take a moment to reflect on the successes and failures of the military commission thus far and that they ask the difficult question of whether hosting a military trial is truly as beneficial as initially envisioned. While the "9/11 five" can no longer be physically brought into the US in light of congressional directives, it remains an important exercise to brainstorm how best to bring an invigorated sense of due process to the current proceedings, whether that be a change in venue, returning the trial to federal court, or amending the code of military justice.</p>

<p>What makes the US unique in its commitment to justice is that it is willing to hold itself accountable. This spirit remains singular in the international community today and is manifested in the willingness of the government to release information that may incriminate it. This spirit is also undeniably present in the American willingness to try the alleged co-conspirators in the very events that changed the trajectory of the nation, upset its citizenry's long enjoyed sense of safety and claimed the lives of over 2,800 innocent people. There is no better means by which to continue this unique American spirit than to afford even these men, the notions of American justice, the standards of American due process and the fairness of an American courtroom. The age-old federal court system, an institution that has weathered both classified materials and political questions, is more than capable of handling the case of the "9/11-five." </p>

<p>The top-secret military commission courtroom, situated on the banks of Guantanamo Bay, is housed in a part of the base called Camp Justice. Surrounded by sniper netting and razor wire, the irony of the camp's name is lost on very few. From the gallery of the Guantanamo war court, one observes six tables to the left, one for each of the original "9/11 six", now five.  This court was built for this trial, the law was tailored to convict these men, and the government's action thus far have focused on the concealment of torture, rather than the atrocities on trial in this case. American ideals are superior to those of terrorists because they embody justice, rights and fairness. Justice for 9/11 should not be a justice tailored to the circumstances; it should be the same justice that Americans seek in the courtroom every single day.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://niu.edu/law/calendar/faculty_news/morse_tan.shtml">Morse Tan</a> of <a href="http://niu.edu/law/index.shtml">Northern Illinois University College of Law</a> discusses North Korea and Syria nuclear programs and argues that the noticeable links between the two pose a significant threat to global security...</p><strong>M</strong>ore links North Korea and Syria than what many realize. Besides a similar population of approximately 20 to 25 million people, they <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/09/10/the-massive-mural-that-captures-syrias-surprising-alliance-with-north-korea">both</a> have run police states, <a href="http://www.nknews.org/2014/09/north-korea-and-syria-a-revamp-in-relations">both</a> espouse an "ideology fusing nationalism and socialism" and have concentrated rulership in only one family. They have assisted each other in the past&#8212;from economic agreements to weapons exchanges. <a href="http://globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/north-korea/130906/syria-north-korea-alliance-chemical-weapons">Both</a> countries consider the US as a major enemy. North Korea has expressed their <a href="http://38north.org/2013/09/gtoloraya091313/">support</a> of Syria's President, President Assad. These <a href="http://nknews.org/2014/09/north-korea-and-syria-a-revamp-in-relations">linkages </a>may not be for the better.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://voanews.com/content/ties-among-north-korea-syria-iran-a-major-security-threat/1639769.html">connection</a> between North Korea and Syria poses an international security risk. Syria had originally signed the <a href="http://un.org/disarmament/WMD/Nuclear/NPT.shtml">Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</a> where they agreed to only <a href="http://spiegel.de/international/world/evidence-points-to-syria-still-working-on-a-nuclear-weapon-a-1012209.html">use nuclear powers</a> for peaceful purposes. The US has even created the <a href="http://state.gov/t/isn/inksna/">Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act </a>(INKSNA), which gives sanctions to any individual, government or private entity who participates in proliferation activities. North Korea has engaged in nuclear proliferation activities to both Syria and Iran. </p>

<p>North Korea <a href="https://armscontrol.org/factsheets/northkoreaprofile">stockpiles biological weapons</a>, not to mention its chemical weapons, increasingly longer range missiles and nuclear weapons. North Korea has 2,500-5,000 tons of chemical weapons, according to the South Korean Ministry of National Defense. North Korea profits through exporting weapons to various states such as Syria. </p>

<p>The military proliferation to Syria is not a novelty; it has taken place over decades. In 1973 North Korea assisted Syria in Syria's surprise attack on Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Since that earlier encounter, North Korea has helped Syria in various ways, including by sending them materials and advisers. For example, the former defense minister of North Korea, Kim Kyok-sik, <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/syria-north-korea-real-axis-evil-8994">bolstered Syria</a>, including through joint military training exercises. In 2009, a Syrian ship was interdicted in Greece carrying materials pertaining to chemical weapons, including "<a href="http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/syria-north-korea-real-axis-evil-8994">20,000 pieces of protective clothing for atomic, biological and chemical warfare</a>." The North Korean military has been working with Syrian troops during the present civil war. Furthermore, reports indicate that "<a href="http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/syria-north-korea-real-axis-evil-8994">not only</a> had North Korea transferred to Syria the technology for producing chemical warheads, but that North Korea has been continuously providing Syrian chemical weapons facilities with 'after-sales services'". Syria's chemical weapons derive from North Korea's technology. North Korea instructed Syria in the creation of an edifice for processing plutonium. As Syria fired its <a href="http://thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/14/the-syria-north-korea-scud-missile-link.html">missiles</a> against rebels, North Korea tested its missiles across the Pacific Ocean that same week.</p>

<p>Both North Korea and Syria have their own respective nuclear program. North Korea's nuclear program <a href="http://nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/20/world/asia/northkorea-timeline.html?_r=0#/#time238_10529">started</a> during the early 1990s. After ratifying the NPT, North Korea became the first country in the history of this treaty to attempt withdrawal from it. In 2002 North Korea admitted to a nuclear program involving uranium. North Korea has tested several nuclear devices. North Korea has enough fissile materials for approximately six-twelve nuclear devices. </p>

<p>Courtesy of North Korea, Syria has a nuclear program as well. Syria has a nuclear Research and Development program that the US warily watches. Syria has made attempts to create a nuclear program that supersede "<a href="http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=jss">Israel's conventional force superiority</a>." [PDF] The Israeli air force destroyed Syria's nuclear facility in a tactical strike.	</p>

<p>North Korea also arms terrorist groups, such as Hezbollah. North Korea enabled Hezbollah to build underground structures and bunkers effectively used against Israel in the 2007 war. North Korea supplied components of missiles made by Iran and exported to Hezbollah via Syria. Indeed, Syria and North Korea signed a mutual-defense treaty with Iran.  </p>

<p>North Korea has also supplied a terrorist group known as the Tamil Tigers. The Tamil Tigers have used missiles imported from North Korea. More specifically:</p>

<blockquote>In the <a href="http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=jss">video</a>, LTTE Sea Tigers can be seen using a variant of the 107mm Katyusha rocket, fired from a lightweight tripod, in pairs. This is believed to be a variant of the Chinese Type 63 107mm launcher. The Chinese produce a single tube version called a Type 85 fired from a man-portable tripod, but the North Koreans produce a double version. This is quite a rare weapon.</blockquote>

<p>North Korea also shipped various artillery shells and mortars to the Tamil Tigers in 2007. <br />
	<br />
North Korea and Syria have proved lethal to each other as well:</p>

<blockquote>Not only have North Koreans reportedly been killed in Syria due to Syrian-North Korean joint proliferation, but Syrians also have died in North Korea. In April 2004 according to a report in the <em>World Tribune</em>, "<a href="http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/syria-north-korea-real-axis-evil-8994">a dozen Syrian technicians</a>" were killed in an explosion at the train station in Ryongchon, near the Chinese border. While some speculated that the blast involved an assassination attempt against then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, whose train had passed through the station only hours before, the consensus reached was that the explosion involved "<a href="http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/syria-north-korea-real-axis-evil-8994">a train car full of missiles and components</a>" to be shipped to Syria and that the accompanying technicians were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.</blockquote>

<p>The military link between Syria and North Korea increases security risks and complications. North Korea's proliferation of weapons and military expertise to countries such as Syria and Iran, among others, decreases stability and further jeopardizes peaceful prospects internationally, whether in the Middle East or the Pacific. Indeed as North Korea has been developing ICBM's (Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles) that it calls the KN-06, no place in the world will be out of range from the threat of North Korean weapons of mass destruction. More and more, the danger is not just "over there": it is here as well.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/professor/john-b-quigley/">John B. Quigley</a>, of <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu">The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law</a>, discusses the possible implications of prosecuting ISIL under international law...</p><strong>T</strong>he Human Rights Council of the UN addressed the question of rights violations by <a href="/feature/2014/11/introduction-isis.php">ISIL</a> in Iraq in <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/SpecialSessions/Session22/Documents/A.HRC.RES.S-22.1_en.docx">Resolution S/22-1</a> of September 1, 2014, titled "The human rights situation in Iraq in the light of abuses committed by the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and associated groups." In this resolution, the Human Rights Council asked the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to organize an inquiry mission to Iraq to investigate possible commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity. In a preamble clause, Resolution S/22-1 mentioned specifically then-recent acts against the Christian and Yazidi populations in northern Iraq. The High Commissioner has released <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session28/Documents/A_HRC_28_18_AUV.doc">the inquiry mission's report</a>, dated March 13, 2015. It is titled "Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights situation in Iraq in the light of abuses committed by the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and associated groups."</p>

<p>The report finds credible evidence for violations by ISIL as crimes against humanity and war crimes. It adds genocide to that list, specifically as it relates to acts of ISIL against the Yazidi population. The report asks the Human Rights Council to "call on the Security Council to consider referring the situation in Iraq to the International Criminal Court." That court has subject-matter jurisdiction to try individuals for crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes. The Security Council has the power to refer such crimes to the court, under Article 13 of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/InternationalCriminalCourt.aspx">Rome Statute</a> of the International Criminal Court.</p>

<p>Resolution S/22-1 did not specifically mention possible abuses by those fighting against ISIL. To its credit, the report took the actions of "other parties" into consideration and found credible evidence of violations by the Iraqi Government and government-affiliated militias. Were the Security Council to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court, the reference would likely be for violations committed by individuals involved on any side.</p>

<p>A Security Council referral would be the most feasible route to jurisdiction in the International Criminal Court. In principle, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor.aspx">Office of the Prosecutor</a> (led by Fatou Bensouda) could open a preliminary examination <em>proprio motu</em> under Article 15 of the Rome Statute, but Bensouda would find scant basis for jurisdiction in the court for ISIL-committed offenses in Iraq. Iraq is not a party to the Rome Statute, so she would find no Article 12(2)(a) territorial jurisdiction. She might be able to identify ISIL personnel of nationalities of states that are party to the Rome Statute. Such persons might fall under the court's jurisdiction under Article 12(2)(b), which gives jurisdiction over nationals of a state that is party to the Rome Statute. But even if Bensouda did identify such ISIL personnel as having committed offenses within the court's subject-matter jurisdiction, they would likely be lower-level figures rather than ISIL policy-level figures. The practice of the prosecutor to date is to indict higher-level figures. The prosecutor might or might not find senior ISIL figures who have nationality in a state that is party to the Rome Statute.</p>

<p>Any state that is party to the Rome Statute could refer the ISIL situation to the prosecutor under Article 14 of the Rome Statute. A state party referral would lead to the opening of a preliminary examination by the prosecutor, but the prosecutor would need to find the same indicia of territorial or personal jurisdiction as if she proceeded <em>proprio motu</em>. Thus, a Security Council referral remains the most feasible route to jurisdiction in the International Criminal Court.</p>

<p>As a matter of substantive law, the report is on target in finding indications of commission of war crimes, of crimes against humanity and of genocide. The prosecutor, of course, would have to attribute particular offenses to particular individuals, an exercise in which the report does not engage.</p>

<p>The indicia for the three internationally-defined offenses may well be met with respect to acts by ISIL personnel. As for war crimes, the situation would seem to be an armed conflict not of an international character, as the report says, despite the fact that ISIL has aspirations beyond the territory of Iraq and is engaging in armed conflict outside Iraq. For crimes against humanity, the acts of ISIL personnel seem to be directed against various civilian populations and bear a systematic character. For genocide, the analysis might be more difficult. An intent to destroy a particular population group, in whole or in part, would need to be shown. The report focuses on the Yazidis as such a group. The Yazidis would seem to be an identifiable group for purposes of the genocide definition. </p>

<p>With genocide, motive is not relevant. If an accused ISIL figure has an intent to destroy a group in whole or in part, she or he gains no exoneration by arguing that the reason for the action related to religious beliefs or that the action was motivated by a desire to rid the area of values imported from the West. The prosecutor would not need to prove that an accused person bore animosity to the victims based on their group affiliation. The accused might well act out of a motivation she or he considers valid, but all that is required for a genocide conviction is that enumerated acts were committed with intent to destroy the group in whole or in part.</p>

<p>Glosses on the genocide convention found in the <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/010802_Krstic_summary_en.pdf">Krstic case</a> [PDF] in the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and in the 2007 judgment of the International Court of Justice in <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/13687.pdf">Bosnia's case against Serbia</a> [PDF] give some indication of what the prosecutor could and could not use in prosecuting ISIL figures. A group must be identified, and the intent must be to destroy a substantial part of that group. In the absence of express statements, intent can be inferred from actions, but in that case the actions must clearly bespeak an intent to destroy a substantial part of the group.</p>

<p>The <span class="casename">Krstic</span> trial court judgment and the ICJ Bosnia judgment limit "destruction" in genocide to physical destruction of persons. Thus, if the prosecutor were to follow the approach of the ICTY and the ICJ, the much-publicized destruction of cultural and historical artifacts and structures by ISIL would not be considered genocide. It might, however, be considered relevant to whether the killing of group members was intended to destroy the group as such. </p>

<p>Were proceedings to be commenced on the basis of genocide, the focus would be on individual suspects and their actions and intent under the definition of genocide. The question would not be whether genocide was committed, in some abstract sense, against the Yazidis, but whether a particular individual committed acts against them as are listed in the Genocide Convention with the intent to destroy the Yazidis in whole or in part.</p>

<p>If ISIL figures were indicted, gaining custody could be a serious obstacle. If they were to fall into the custody of the Iraqi Government, it could surrender them, or the Iraqi Government could choose to try them in an Iraqi court. Such prosecution could preempt the International Criminal Court, since under Article 17 of the Rome Statute the court finds a case inadmissible if it is being dealt with in a genuine domestic proceeding. The report in fact advises that Iraq try ISIL personnel in Iraq's domestic courts for the three international offenses. </p>

<p>The report also advises Iraq to accede to the Rome Statute and to accept ICC jurisdiction over the current situation under Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute. Accession would provide jurisdiction only prospectively. An acceptance over the current situation under Article 12(3) could apply retrospectively to cover the events of 2014. </p>

<p>The Government of Iraq may not be anxious to confer jurisdiction on the ICC. For ISIL, its personnel may well not be captured alive, and for them, if captured, going to The Hague would likely protect them from a worse fate. So as a practical matter, the potential negative consequences for government officials may be greater than those for ISIL personnel.</p>

<p>The report's proposal for an investigation by the ICC remains largely theoretical. The Security Council is not likely to refer the situation. Reading the report reminds one of the limited reach of the International Criminal Court. The aspiration of a judicial institution that can reach internationally defined offenses around the globe is not likely soon to be achieved.</p>

		<title>The Rules Have Not Changed Regarding Armed Conflict</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.syr.edu/profile/david-crane1">David M. Crane </a> of <a href="http://law.syr.edu/">Syracuse University College of Law </a> discusses enforcing the laws of armed conflict in an age of extremes...</p>

<p><strong>S</strong>hortly after three planes went into three buildings on <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/9-11-attacks">September 11, 2001</a> the chief law enforcement officer of the US, Attorney General <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/gonzales-bio.html">Albert Gonzalez</a> declared that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/geneva_conventions">Geneva conventions </a>were quite out dated. This amazing and naïve statement followed a similar declaration by then President <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/georgewbush">George W. Bush</a> that the "rules have changed" related to fighting terrorists. These statements set off a series of policy missteps that led to <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/national/usstatesterritoriesandpossessions/guantanamobaynavalbasecuba/index.html">Guantanamo</a>, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iraq/abu_ghraib/index.html">Abu Ghraib</a>, <a href="http://time.com/3645123/afghanistan-bagram-airfield/">Bagram AFB</a>, secret prisons in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-hidden-history-of-the-cias-prison-in-poland/2014/01/23/b77f6ea2-7c6f-11e3-95c6-0a7aa80874bc_story.html">Eastern Europe </a>and North Africa and the perceived loss of the moral high-ground by the US related to conflict in the 21st century. </p>

<p>No longer that "bright and shining city on the hill" the US continues to limp into the new century not as a leader regarding the international rule of law, but only as a participant in a series of kaleidoscopic events that seem to challenge the very foundation of the rule of law, particularly the laws of armed conflict. At no time is the rule of law more needed than now in this apparent "age of extremes". Do the rules really need to be changed?   </p>

<p>A recent trial shows those rules do not need to be changed, just followed. Four Polish soldiers were <a href="paperchase/2015/03/poland-court-clears-soldiers-of-afghanistan-war-crimes.php">found</a> not to have committed war crimes in an incident in 2007 where civilians were killed. Poland had been part of the <a href="http://www.nato.int/">NATO</a> led <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_69366.htm">coalition</a> in Afghanistan for 12 years. A military court found that they did not intentionally target civilians, a war crime if proven. The military judges did find them negligent in following orders, a dereliction of duty type offense in the US military. The press seemed to take this as some type of failed judgement. I consider it an affirmation that the laws of armed conflict are alive, vibrant and being used in the way contemplated by the drafters and followed for over 60 years by nations involved in conflict situations. </p>

<p>The laws of armed conflict state that no civilians can be intentionally targeted. The law recognizes that in the heat of combat there are collateral effects to the battle to include civilian deaths excusable in law. Additionally the laws of armed conflict require that all signatories to the Geneva Conventions, when faced with allegations of a war crime investigate, prosecute (under their domestic system of justice) or hand the alleged perpetrators over to a party to the conventions willing to prosecute for the war crime.  </p>

<p>The Poles appear to have followed not only the spirit but the letter of the law. They investigated the civilian deaths and <a href="paperchase/2007/11/poland-charges-6-soldiers-with.php">charged</a> the four soldiers with war crimes under Polish domestic law. The outcome was decided in a fair and open trial. The fact that it was not proven that they intentionally targeted those civilians was up to the trier of fact in that domestic prosecution. Hence the outcome as reported.</p>

<p>This shows that the rules are working and they do not have to be changed. The NATO coalition followed the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/LOAC-Deskbook-2012.pdf">laws of armed conflict</a>. The coalition does investigate and hand over perpetrators to member domestic systems for resolution. Though not perfect, the record does show that coalition forces do hold accountable members of their armed forces who violate the laws of armed conflict in trials and courts-martial. </p>

<p>A further review of the record shows that in combat the coalition followed the law despite the fact that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/world/asia/10afghanistan.html?_r=0">Taliban</a> and various terrorist groups ignored the law in almost all instances to include the intentional killing of civilians. This is another important tenant of the laws of armed conflict that despite the fact that the other side ignores the law signatories are bound to follow the laws of armed conflict. </p>

<p>It is not intended for this opinion to gloss over and ignore other acts committed by the coalition, particularly the US, as it related to torture and other inhumane acts. These too violate the rule of law at many levels. As noted before, the statements made by the Bush administration led the US down a very slippery slope to where they were operating at the same level as the Taliban and others operating in the extreme related to torture. </p>

<p>In this apparent age of extremes we should continue to fight extremism using the rule of law, such as the laws of armed conflict and a system of laws that are practical and flexible enough to ensure that the battlefield is governed by rules that protect and regulate a given condition&#8212;war and conflict. The laws of armed conflict minimize the horror and allow for a return to possible stability at its conclusion. As stated by Albert Einstein decades ago: As long as there are sovereign nations possessing great power, war is inevitable.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.du.edu/index.php/profile/sam-kamin">Sam Kamin</a> of <a href="https://www.law.du.edu/index.php">University of Denver Sturm College of Law</a> evaluates the success of the marijuana suits brought by private businesses in recent months and argues that possible RICO suits will face obstacles due to the difficulty of showing actual damages from marijuana businesses...</p><strong>C</strong>olorado has been the subject of multiple lawsuits in recent months, all of them challenging the state's first-in-the-nation tax and regulatory system for adult-use marijuana. Most of these suits are grounded in the argument that Colorado's regulatory system is <a href="https://law.cornell.edu/wex/preemption">preempted</a> by the <a href="https://law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/chapter-13">Controlled Substances Act</a> (CSA). As I have argued <a href="http://www.uclalawreview.org/?p=6342">elsewhere</a> and as David Ball has <a href="/forum/2015/03/david-ball-marijuana-law.php">argued</a> on this website, this argument is without merit. It is clear that Colorado has the power to repeal its marijuana prohibitions; the federal government may not require the states to enforce the Controlled Substances Act, to pass parallel legislation, to enforce their existing prohibitions or to maintain those prohibitions on the books. Given that the state could legalize <em>all</em> marijuana conduct, it seems clear that it may, as it has done, choose to authorize only a limited, regulated marijuana market. The greater power should certainly include the lesser.</p>

<p>This is what intrigued many about <a href="http://www.safestreetsalliance.org.php54-2.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/assets/media/New_Vision_Complaint.pdf">the two</a> [PDF] private lawsuits that were filed on February 19, 2015. While one of these suits alleged, at least in passing, that Colorado's regulatory regime was preempted by federal law, the gravamen of these complaints is the allegation that businesses authorized under state law to manufacture and distribute marijuana nonetheless constitute continuing criminal enterprises under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-96">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization</a> (RICO) Act. Plaintiffs in the Colorado suits&#8212;a rural land owner and an hotelier&#8212;alleged that they had suffered financial losses as a result of the opening of these "illegal" businesses moving into adjacent properties. These suits seek treble damages, attorney fees and an injunction against the operation of two licensed marijuana businesses. Included in the complaints were a laundry list of defendants, from state and local regulatory agencies to those involved in the construction and financing of the marijuana businesses.</p>

<p>Originally passed in 1970 to provide federal prosecutors with an additional tool with which to fight the mob, RICO provides significant criminal penalties for any person who runs an organization that affects interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity. In addition RICO provides for a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1964">civil cause of action</a> for any plaintiff who can demonstrate that she has been harmed by the operation of such a RICO enterprise. However in order to make out a civil RICO cause of action a RICO plaintiff must plead and prove that she has suffered an injury to her "business or property" as the result of an enterprise being run through a pattern of racketeering activity.  </p>

<p>The latter part of the allegation is relatively uncontroversial when pled against a marijuana business; even when authorized by state law, the sale and manufacture of marijuana is always illegal under federal law. Thus a business that engages in marijuana trafficking qualifies as a RICO enterprise&#8212;it is by definition a business run through a pattern of racketeering activity. While a recently introduced <a href="http://thecannabist.co/2015/03/10/us-senate-bill-federal-medical-marijuana-restrictions/31407/">Senate Bill</a> would exempt from the CSA conduct that complies with state <em>medical</em> marijuana laws, all such conduct is currently criminal under federal law and constitutes the sort of racketeering activity at which the statute is admittedly aimed. <br />
   <br />
It is there however that plaintiffs' cases become increasingly more difficult for them to prove. For plaintiffs will have to demonstrate that they have suffered a business or property loss and that their loss is directly attributable to the defendants' on-going criminal conduct. A number of impediments stand in the way of making such showings:</p>

<p><em>First</em>, the allegations regarding the losses suffered by the Colorado plaintiffs are almost entirely conjectural. Most obviously they challenge the operation of marijuana businesses that have not yet opened. That certainly makes plaintiffs' capacity to prove actual monetary damages difficult and might lead a court to dismiss their cases as not yet ripe for adjudication. The US Supreme Court expressed concern in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/04-433.pdf">Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp.</a> [PDF] about "intricate, uncertain inquiries [regarding damages] ... overrunning RICO litigation." The calculation of the Colorado plaintiffs' losses, if any, would be far more speculative and complicated than that required in <span class="casename">Anza</span>; here, the losses are almost entirely future-looking.</p>

<p><em>Relatedly</em>, the loss attributable to the defendants' conduct must be to a tangible business or property interest and not mere displeasure or aesthetic insult. At least one of the Colorado suits is rife with allegations that imply the harms are more psychic than economic: "[t]he ongoing construction has already marred the mountain views from the [plaintiffs'] property, thus making it less suitable for hiking and horseback riding. The building's purpose&#8212;the manufacture of illegal drugs&#8212;exacerbates this injury, for when the [plaintiffs] and their children visit the property they are reminded of the racketeering enterprise next door every time they look to the west." Such injuries are simply insufficient <em>as a matter of law</em> to make out a RICO claim. RICO requires in every case a demonstration of a loss of tangible financial interest.  </p>

<p><em>Perhaps</em> the largest obstacle though is the requirement that the loss must be directly attributable to the defendants' <em>criminal</em> conduct. So for example, if the same harm would have occurred if the defendants' had engaged in wholly lawful conduct, plaintiffs will not be heard to complain simply because the defendants were also engaged in criminal conduct which did not in fact cause them harm. Thus, even if the ranch-owner plaintiff were able to show that her property suffered a diminution in value as a result of the defendants' grow operation moving into the adjacent property, she would nonetheless have to demonstrate that the losses were caused not by the development of that property itself but by the criminal acts of the defendants themselves. In other words, if the same damage would occur from defendants growing tomatoes rather than cannabis, plaintiffs cannot resort to RICO to challenge the defendants' actions.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the RICO claims that have been brought to date are unlikely even to survive a motion to dismiss in their current form. This is not to say however that other differently situated plaintiffs would be equally unlikely to prevail.  So for example, if a plaintiff were to come forward who could plead and prove empirically that her business lost value because an illegal business moved in next door, she <em>might</em> be able to recover for her losses in a RICO action. Even this would not be a slam dunk case, however; for example, if her theory was that crime had gone up in the neighborhood as a result of the opening of a marijuana dispensary, a court might find that that third party criminal conduct, rather than the operation of the marijuana business itself was the proximate cause of the financial loss. For example in <a href="https://law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-969.ZO.html">Hemi v. City of New York</a> the US Supreme Court held that it is insufficient for a plaintiff to allege merely that she was one of those indirectly harmed by a RICO enterprise; rather: "Our precedents make clear that in the RICO context, the focus is on the directness of the relationship between the conduct and the harm." In other words, it is quite difficult to even imagine a scenario that would be an easy win for a RICO plaintiff against a marijuana business.</p>

<p>Whether state marijuana laws are preempted by the Controlled Substances Act is a legal question; a reviewing court will investigate Congressional intent to determine whether it intended to preempt a particular state marijuana regulation. While it is true that the result may be different for different states' marijuana laws, each state's regulations will either be preempted or they will not and only a single decision will be necessary to resolve the matter. By contrast, civil RICO claims against marijuana businesses will necessarily have to be adjudicated on their facts on a case-by-case basis. Absent some judicial pronouncement that RICO is simply unavailable to challenge licensed marijuana businesses (a serious possibility given the difficulty of proving proximate cause and damages in any one case), RICO suits will have to be defended case by case, defendant by defendant.  </p>

<p>Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the Colorado RICO suits therefore is not the likelihood of their success, but rather their nuisance value to those who seek to undo marijuana law reform in the states. These suits could exert a high cost not just on those operating marijuana businesses, but also on those who might facilitate such businesses. In this regard, it is probably no accident that the Colorado suits were brought not just against those opening marijuana businesses, but also against those who financed, insured, built and funded the businesses. Even if none of these claims is ultimately successful, the possibility of suit and the attendant negative publicity and expense might well be sufficient to discourage businesses from providing the services that the industry needs to survive. It is no surprise then, that when the bank alleged to have financed the medical dispensary named in the hotelier's suit was dismissed from the case, it made clear that it had not knowingly financed a marijuana project and that "<a href="http://summitdaily.com/news/15213213-113/holiday-inn-drops-bank-of-the-west-from-frisco-marijuana">it is against the bank's policy to offer accounts and financial services to marijuana businesses</a>." RICO suits, therefore, primarily represent a drag on the regulatory system an increasing number of states are putting into place.</p>

		<title>Lujan Eliminates Plaintiffs&#039; Standing In New Marijuana Cases</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Roxane Peyser of the <a href="http://www.peyserlaw.com">Law Office of Roxane Peyser</a> in Lyons, Colorado discusses the issues in question concerning challenges to Colorado's legalization of marijuana...</p><strong>T</strong>he requirement that a plaintiff have standing is derived from <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III of the Constitution</a>, limiting federal courts to adjudicate actual cases and controversies. Since <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3476651820874552239&q=Assn.+of+Data+Processing+Serv.+Orgs.+v.+Camp&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Association of Data Processing Service Organizations v. Camp</a> was decided in 1970, the test that plaintiffs must satisfy in order to show standing is &#8220;injury in fact, economic or otherwise.&#8221; The &#8220;injury in fact&#8221; test has particular importance in citizen lawsuits that seek to remedy government action or inaction. In citizen suits following <span class="casename">Data Processing</span>, federal courts have regularly relied on the requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate &#8220;actual&#8221; injury&#8212;not one that is merely speculative.</p>

                <p>The &#8220;injury in fact&#8221; prerequisite articulated by <span class="casename">Data Processing</span> was further refined in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10150124802357408838&q=Lujan+v.+Defenders+of+Wildlife&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife</a>, which denied standing to citizens who claimed injury as a result of the EPA&#8217;s failure to enforce environmental regulations, although a statutory provision expressly allowed regulatory beneficiaries to file suit. Since <span class="casename">Lujan</span> was decided in 1992, a plaintiff in a citizen suit must generally satisfy three requirements in order to show standing: (1) injury in fact; (2) injury causally linked to the defendant&#8217;s actions; and (3) relief that must be able to provide compensation for the plaintiff&#8217;s alleged injury. Referring to citizen suits as &#8220;generalized grievance cases,&#8221; Justice Scalia held that &#8220;an injury amounting only to the alleged violation of a right to have the Government act in accordance with law [i]s not judicially cognizable.&#8221;</p>

                <p>On February 19, a set of anti-marijuana lawsuits was filed in the US District Court of Colorado. Unlike the lawsuit Nebraska and Oklahoma filed jointly in December 2014 against Colorado, these suits were filed by private citizens, representing a different approach to attacking the legality of recreational marijuana in the State of Colorado.</p>

                <p>In one suit, the plaintiffs, Safe Streets Alliance and New Vision Hotels Two, LLC name as defendants multiple private parties, among them a marijuana retailer, its sole owner, the property management company that leased commercial property to the retailer and its officers, the accountant for the dispensary and other parties having any private business relationships with the dispensary. The second suit was brought by Safe Streets Alliance and Phyllis and Michael Reilly, and names both private parties similar to those entities in the New Vision case, in addition to state officials, including Governor John Hickenlooper, the Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Revenue, the Director of the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division, the Pueblo County Commission and the Pueblo County Liquor and Marijuana Licensing Board.</p>

                <p>Both cases pin their claims on violations of the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-96">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act</a> (RICO). Specifically, both cases use identical language claiming that the respective plaintiffs &#8220;file this suit to vindicate the federal laws prohibiting the cultivation and sale of recreational marijuana and their rights under [RICO].&#8221;</p>

                <p>Although the <span class="casename">New Vision</span> suit does not specifically name government officials as defendants, both suits are essentially citizen suits&#8212;i.e., lawsuits filed by members of the public to challenge the legality of some governmental action or inaction.</p>

                <p>In <span class="casename">New Vision</span>, plaintiffs allege that they have suffered damage to their hotel business as a result of a &#8220;planned&#8221; recreational marijuana operation expected to open less than 75 yards from the entrance of their hotel. All of their alleged injuries are highly speculative: &#8220;many parents and coaches will avoid booking with a hotel that is within a short walking distance and direct sight of a recreational marijuana store and grow facility&#8221;; &#8220;additional teams are likely to decide not to return after they learn of defendants&#8217; nearby recreational marijuana operations&#8221;; &#8220;prospective New Vision guests also worry that Defendants&#8217; recreational marijuana operations will attract crime.&#8221; [Emphasis provided.] Their alleged damages are further undercut by the fact that revenues from the sale of cannabis in Colorado&#8212;including from canna-tourism&#8212;have generated tens of millions of dollars to the benefit of the state&#8217;s economy.</p>

                <p>Their sole proffer of current damages is the alleged statements of booking agents for two high school ski teams who have stayed at the hotel in the past, and allegedly said &#8220;that their teams will not return due to defendants&#8217; marijuana operations.&#8221; Since plaintiffs are unable to prove that they have suffered any actual injury as a result of a marijuana business that has not yet even opened, their lawsuit is subject to dismissal on this ground alone.</p>

                <p>Similar to the <span class="casename">New Vision</span> plaintiffs, the Reilly&#8217;s action is also subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim. The <span class="casename">Reilly</span> plaintiffs own approximately 105 acres of land adjacent to a recreational marijuana grow operation. The Reillys do not live on the land but &#8220;often visit on weekends&#8221; with their children and friends. They allege injuries as a result of the construction of the marijuana operation on the adjacent property that &#8220;has already marred the mountain views from the Reilly&#8217;s property.&#8221; </p>

                <p>The Reillys also contend that their property is located in a residential development that is subject to restrictive covenants. While they concede that the marijuana operation is properly zoned and located outside the boundaries subject to those covenants, they continue to argue that &#8220;if it were within those boundaries [of the residential development], it would violate numerous covenants.&#8221;  Finally, the remainder of their alleged damages stems from what they contend is the fact that &#8220;marijuana plants are highly odorous &#8230; and their offensive smell travels long distances.&#8221; </p>

                <p>Aside from the fact that their allegation concerning the foul odor of marijuana plants is subjective and that they are arguably hyper-sensitive plaintiffs in this regard&#8212;thus defeating claims for both public and private nuisance&#8212;they impliedly acknowledge that an industrial manufacturing plant could be properly zoned for the same location. Accordingly, the <span class="casename">Reilly</span> lawsuit asserts vague and speculative damages, and not actual harm, inviting dismissal for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.</p>

                <p>What is actually at the core of these lawsuits, however, is the plaintiffs&#8217; efforts in both actions to compel state official enforcement of federal laws&#8212;specifically, the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/801">Controlled Substances Act of 1970</a>.</p>

                <p>In their lawsuits, both sets of plaintiffs argue at the outset that the CSA makes dealing in marijuana a felony. Both lawsuits contend that, &#8220;Despite the express federal prohibition on marijuana, Colorado and many of its local jurisdictions have enacted laws, ordinances and regulations designed to promote growth of a billion dollar commercial marijuana industry.&#8221;</p>

                <p>Essentially, the plaintiffs in both cases are arguing for official enforcement of the CSA, using alleged RICO claims as the vehicle to carry them to success. Both sets of plaintiffs are facing significant challenges with respect to their RICO claims. RICO laws have historically targeted white-collar conspirators and organized crime. The purpose of RICO is basically deterrence and punishment. RICO laws are very complex and an expanded discussion of it is well beyond the scope of this piece. It is sufficient to say that for purposes of these lawsuits, the State of Colorado officials, as well as the private entity defendants, are not likely to be found by a federal court as &#8220;criminal organizations&#8221; within the meaning of RICO.</p>

                <p>The plaintiffs&#8217; inability to show any injury in fact, combined with the failure of their RICO claims leaves them in the position of regulatory beneficiaries: members of the public who seek to have courts adjudicate the legality of official action. </p>

                <p>In these recent cases, plaintiffs begin their argument by making a federal preemption argument. While the Supremacy Clause, contained in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Article VI of the Constitution</a>, establishes the US Constitution, federal statutes and treaties as &#8220;the supreme law of the land,&#8221; it is not without limitations. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">The Tenth Amendment</a>, which is part of the Bill of Rights, states that the federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the Constitution. All remaining powers are reserved for the states or the people. </p>

                <p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9243582117703452379&q=new+york+v.+united+states&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">New York v. United States</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10894716839911389166&q=printz+v.+united+states&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Printz v. United States</a> both recognized the tempering effect of the Tenth Amendment on the Supremacy Clause, when it articulated the anti-commandeering doctrine, which prohibits the federal government from commandeering state governments. Writing for the majority in <span class="casename">New York</span>, Justice O&#8217;Connor held that, &#8220;As an initial matter, Congress may not simply &#8216;commandee[r] the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.&#8221;</p>

                <p>The anti-commandeering doctrine was further developed five years after <span class="casename">New York</span>, when the <span class="casename">Printz</span> court expanded the doctrine&#8217;s reach. Said the court, &#8220;We held in <span class="casename">New York</span> that Congress cannot compel the States to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program. Today we hold that Congress cannot circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the States&#8217; officers directly. The Federal Government may neither issue directives requiring the States to address particular problems, nor command the States&#8217; officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program. It matters not whether policymaking is involved, and no case-by-case weighing of the burdens or benefits is necessary; such commands are fundamentally incompatible with our constitutional system of dual sovereignty.&#8221;</p>

                <p>The presumption against federal preemption when it involves the exercise of historic police powers of the states is a well-established <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3957024248604849506&q=Rice+v.+Santa+Fe+Elevator+Corp.&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">principle in American jurisprudence</a>. State medical marijuana laws have generally been permitted this presumption, since they are enacted pursuant to traditional state police powers in defining criminal conduct and regulating drugs and medical practices.</p>

                <p>In fact, the CSA on which the Colorado plaintiffs rely explicitly contains a statutory preemption provision that articulates Congress&#8217;s intent with respect to the relationship between state and federal law. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/903">Section 903</a> states: &#8220;No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which that provision operates, including criminal penalties, to the exclusion of any State law on the same subject matter which would otherwise be within the authority of the State, unless there is a positive conflict between that provision of this subchapter and that State law so that the two cannot consistently stand together.&#8221;</p>

                <p>What this means is that the federal government is free to expend its own resources to implement and enforce its own laws, but it may not compel States to use its resources to enforce federal law.</p>

                <p>Circling back to whether the Colorado plaintiffs have standing to &#8220;vindicate the federal laws prohibiting the cultivation and sale of recreational marijuana,&#8221; clarification can be found in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7080789915693710984&q=heckler+vs.+chaney&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Heckler v. Chaney</a>, where Justice Rehnquist found that &#8220;when an agency refuses to act it generally does not exercise its coercive power over an individual&#8217;s liberty or property rights,&#8221; and therefore there is no aggrieved individual with standing to sue. </p>

                <p>Since the Colorado plaintiffs are in actuality seeking state official enforcement of federal law, pre-trial motions will, in all probability, dispose of these twin lawsuits.</p>

		<title>The Arab League Joint Military Force: Countering Extremism and Political Instability</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.avemarialaw.edu/faculty/profile/Kevin.Govern">Kevin Govern</a>, of Ave Maria School of Law, considers the ramifications of the recent Arab League agreement to form a joint force in the context of historic efforts on joint defense and economic cooperation ... </p><strong>J</strong>URIST recently noted the 22-member League of Arab States (a/k/a Arab League) formation of a voluntary but unified military force to oppose growing threats to its members, especially the intensifying instability in <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/arab-leaders-agree-to-use-unified-military-force-amid-crisis.php">Yemen</a>.  This effort is consistent not only with the Arab League's <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/arab-league-approves-resolution-to-combat-islamic-state-group.php">September 2014</a> resolution to combat extremist groups like the Islamic State (IS), but reflective of 65 years of varied cooperation under the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/arabjoin.asp">Treaty of Joint Defense and Economic Cooperation</a>.</p>

<p>During the waning days of World War II, six nations formed the nascent Arab League in Cairo on March 22, 1945; Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan (Jordan after 1946), Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Syria.  In May 1945, Yemen joined the group, joined as a member on May 5, 1945. Amongst its first security actions, Arab League members Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon invaded Israel during the 1948 War of Independence / Palestine War, and, less formally, Arab volunteers forming the Arab Liberation army joined Arab League forces.  While armistice agreements were concluded with Israel, conditions for sustainable peace never resulted especially in light of 400,000 Palestinian Arabs fled from Israel to refugee camps in Arab League nations Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. </p>

<p>By 1950, the six original Arab League nations concluded the Treaty of Joint Defense and Economic Cooperation, ostensibly to "consolidate relations" between member states, "maintain their independence and their mutual heritage," and "to cooperate for the realization of mutual defense and the maintenance of security and peace" as well as "consolidate stability and security."  Article 6 of that treaty, then as now, provides for a Joint Defense Counsel, assisted by the Permanent Military Commission under Article 5, to draw up plans of joint defense and their implementation, and by two-thirds majority vote, to bind Contracting States regarding joint defense decisions. </p>

<p>This alliance would be tested some six years later when Israeli forces launched air and ground assaults into Egypt's Sinai peninsula after Egypt's first President of the Republic, Gamal Abdal Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal. Not only did this become an Arab League security matter, but also a proxy conflict with an Anglo-French reinforcement of Israeli gains and Soviet support of Arab demands.  </p>

<p>The predecessor to the currently proposed Arab League Military Forces was the Joint Arab Command (a/k/a United or Unified Arab Command), under the guise of the Treaty of Joint Defense and Economic Cooperation, established by the then-thirteen member states of the Arab League during their January 1964 summit in Cairo. </p>

<p>That 1964 summit would also set conditions for future conflict, rather than conflict resolution. That summit gave rise to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) , which would sustain an insurgency in Lebanon, reaching an intense level of conflict in the 1982 War in South Lebanon, and acts of terror and violence in Israel and beyond, until Israel and the PLO agreed to <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-10/news/mn-33546_1_mutual-recognition">mutual recognition in 1993</a> in an historic bid for peace.   </p>

<p>Two conflicts shortly thereafter would show the Joint Arab Command as ineffective in joint defense. Notwithstanding King Hussein of Jordan's years of secret meetings with Israeli leaders, and assurances that Israel had no intentions of attacking Jordan, in November 1966, Israel undertook Operation Shredder incursion into the Jordanian-occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>By mutual defense pact, Jordan and Egypt placed the Joint Arab Command under command of the Egyptian military's chief of staff in May 1967 as both Arab League nations built up forces along their borders with Israel.  The June 1967 Six-Day War was marked by simultaneous Israeli attacks against Egypt and Syria, and resultant Israeli gains in the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights and the West Bank.  </p>

<p>During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Arab League member Egypt attacked across the Suez Canal, and Syria maneuvered from the north, in efforts to reclaim territory lost to Israel during the 1967 war.  The final 1974 cease-fire resulted in Israel withdrawing back across the Suez Canal and a portion of the East Bank, and relinquishing some territory to Syria.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the 1967 Six Day War, eight leaders of the Arab League set the conditions for continued strife with Israel with the September 1967 Khartoum Resolution's Three No's:  "no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it."  The 1978 Camp David Peace Accords between Egypt and Israel resulted in an abiding peace between the two nations but also Egypt's suspension from the Arab League until its readmission in 1989 and the Arab League headquarters moving to Cairo.</p>

<p>The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) has <a href="http://www.cfr.org/middle-east-and-north-africa/arab-league/p25967">lauded</a> the Arab League's common security consensus over the Saudi-sponsored Arab Peace Initiative in 2002, yet lamented the League's failure to coordinate its policy over both the 1990-1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq War.</p>

<p>In more recent years, the Arab League did not intervene in most of the Arab revolts throughout the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, but called for the UN Security Council to impose a no fly zone over Libya to protect civilians from air attack.  Notable recent Arab League changes bode well for stronger, more cohesive efforts with the appointment of the renowned Egyptian diplomat and foreign rights lawyer Nabil Elaraby, and member nations Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates joining as part of the coalition to enforce  <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en//2011/sc10200.doc.htm">UN Security Council Resolution 1973.</a>   </p>

<p>The CFR has also noted that since those actions, the Arab League's efforts towards security included <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2011/11/177044.htm">suspending</a> Syrian membership, attempting to broker an <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/11/201111381935847935.html">agreement</a> with the Assad regime and, for the first time in its history, assembled a team of observers to monitor the implementation of its plan and officially calling for Assad to step down in January 2012 and requested a resolution from the UN Security Council to support this proposal.</p>

<p>Most recently, in March 2015, 14 of the Arab League's 22 nations assessed the success of ongoing Saudi-led allied air strikes against Shi'a Houthi rebels in Yemen.  Those operations are part of a  <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-air-strikes-hit-yemeni-capital-sanaa-to-disarm-shia-houthis-amid-ground-invasion-10140771.html">10-nation military coalition </a>against the coup by Arab League members Morocco, Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE, joined with nonmember Pakistan. The Houthis are seeking to reinstate the ousted past Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/26/how-does-yemens-revolution-end/">replaced</a> in a February 2012 referendum that formally ushered in Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, previously Yemen's vice president, into the role of transitional president.</p>

<p>Reports <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/arab-league-leaders-discuss-unified-military-force-while-saudiled-air-strikes-in-yemen-target-houthi-militia-dubbed-irans-puppet-10140918.html">quote</a> US President Barack Obama has reaffirmed his support for the military action taken in Yemen, and Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi saying he "backs calls for a unified Arab force" to confront security threats in the Middle East and North Africa.  Yemen's President-in-exile Abd-Radu Mansour Hadi has said that the Houthis are "Iran's Puppet" that has "destroyed Yemen with political immaturity."  </p>

<p>In the words of William Shakespeare from his play <a href="http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/facsimile/bookplay/Bran_F1/Tmp/"><em>The Tempest</em></a>, "What's past is prologue." Considering the historic cohesion, or lack thereof, of past Arab League mutual defense efforts, this future Joint Military Force will do well to study past efforts when it faces this new proxy war between a military force led by Saudi Arabia and Egypt, against the Houthi militia, whose <a href="https://search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?p=Houthi+Iran+China+Russia&ei=UTF-8&hspart=mozilla&hsimp=yhs-002">allies</a> number Iran, Russia and China, as well as future challenges to mutual defense and the maintenance of security and peace. It should also develop capabilities not only for space, sea, land and air, but the<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ViN-BwAAQBAJ&pg=PT16&lpg=PT16&dq=cyberwarfare+fifth+dimension+Ohlin+Govern&source=bl&ots=-44Xo7zqTl&sig=-s8AVofC-N1EIkKAUo9tCZk-st4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZeYbVcH6HMqyggSKv4TADA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=cyberwarfare%20fifth%20dimension%20Ohlin%20Govern&f=false"> fifth dimension of warfare</a>, cyber warfare, since present and future adversaries are likely to pose threats in each of those domains.</p>

		<title>The DOJ Opposition to the Proposed Sentencing Guideline Amendments: Fighting the Wrong Battles in Fraud Cases</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.gwu.edu/Faculty/profile.aspx?id=3629">Randall D. Eliason</a> of the George Washington University Law School discusses DOJ's recent opposition to relaxed sentencing guidelines ... </p><strong>O</strong>n March 12, 2015, the US Sentencing Commission held a <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/amendment-process/public-hearings-and-meetings/20150312/agenda-march-12-2015-public-hearing">public hearing</a> on its annual <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/amendment-process/reader-friendly-amendments/2015014-RFP-Amendments.pdf">proposed amendments to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines</a>. A number of the proposals concern the guideline for economic crimes and fraud cases, <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2014/2014-chapter-2-c#2b11">&#167; 2B1.1</a>. The amendments would reduce the recommended sentence in many such cases, particularly those involving large dollar amounts. </p>

<p>At the hearing the US Department of Justice opposed most of these amendments. DOJ argued that any move to reduce the sentences in fraud cases would be bad policy and would ignore the "overwhelming societal consensus" in favor of harsh punishment for these crimes. (The DOJ's written testimony is available <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/amendment-process/public-hearings-and-meetings/20150312/DOJ.pdf">here</a> [PDF].) But given the current realities of federal sentencing, DOJ is fighting the wrong battles.</p>

<p><strong>The Proposed Amendments</strong></p>

<p>There are five key proposed amendments affecting fraud and economic crimes:</p>

<p><u>Inflation Adjustment</u>: The sentencing guidelines operate by calculating an offense level, ranging from 1 to 43, for every criminal conviction. That offense level, along with the defendant's criminal history, is used in the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2014/2014-chapter-5#5asentab">sentencing table</a> to find the recommended sentencing range. The greater the offense level, the greater the sentence.  </p>

<p>In a fraud case the single biggest driver of the offense level is the loss caused by the defendant's conduct. That amount is plugged into the "fraud table" within &#167; 2B1.1(b)(1) and the corresponding number of offense level points is added; if the loss exceeds $5,000.00 two points are added, if it exceeds $10,000.00 four points, and so on. At the top of the fraud table, for losses exceeding $400 million, thirty points are added to the offense level.</p>

<p>Since the fraud table was last revised in 2001 the dollar amounts defining the different levels have not been adjusted for inflation, which has resulted in "bracket creep." A crime that caused $100,000.00 in damage in 2001 would cause more than $130,000.00 in damage today, due to the effect of inflation. That would place it higher in the fraud table and result in a greater sentence for the same crime. The Commission proposes adjusting the amounts in the table to bring them back into line with what they represented in 2001, which would <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/prison-and-sentencing-impact-assessments/2014_2015_Proposed_Impact.pdf">reduce the average sentence under &#167; 2B1.1 by more than 20 percent</a>.  <br />
 <br />
<u>Victims Table</u>: The "victims table" in &#167; 2B1.1(b)(2) provides a two level enhancement if the offense affected ten or more victims, four levels if it affected fifty or more victims, and six levels if it affected 250 or more. This focus on the number of victims may lead to inappropriate results in some cases. For example, suppose one defendant defrauds 500,000 people of only $5.00 each while another defrauds five victims of $500,000.00 each and wipes out their life savings.  The total loss is identical and each would receive the same increase from the fraud table. But the first would receive an additional six levels based on the number of victims while the second, who caused far greater harm to his individual victims, would not. Six additional levels may lead to a doubling or more of the recommended sentence, but probably few would argue that the first defendant deserves twice the jail time of the second.</p>

<p>The Commission proposes adding a new enhancement for cases in which a defendant causes substantial financial hardship to one or more victims, while at the same time halving the increases based solely on the number of victims. The overall effect would be to shift the emphasis away from the number of victims and toward the seriousness of the harm the defendant caused.</p>

<p><u>Sophisticated Means</u>: The fraud guideline contains a two level enhancement for offenses that involved multiple jurisdictions, overseas bank accounts, shell corporations, or other types of "sophisticated means." &#167; 2B1.1(b)(10). The Commission proposes modifying this provision to specify that it will apply only when the sophisticated means employed were truly unusual relative to other similar cases and only when the defendant personally engaged in or caused the conduct constituting sophisticated means. </p>

<p><u>Intended Loss</u>: The loss caused by the defendant's behavior that is plugged into the fraud table is the greater of either the actual or the intended loss. There has been some dispute in the courts over whether "intended loss" means all losses that are reasonably foreseeable based on the nature of the defendant's conduct (objective standard) or only the losses that the defendant actually and purposely sought to inflict (subjective standard). The Commission proposes an amendment that focuses on the subjective standard.  </p>

<p><u>Fraud on the Market</u>: "Fraud on the market" cases are those that involve the fraudulent increase or decrease in the price of a publicly traded security. Courts have found the loss in such cases difficult to calculate, due to the many different market forces that may be at work. The Commission proposes that in such cases the sentence enhancements be based on the (easier to calculate) gain to the defendant, rather than on the loss to the victims.  </p>

<p><strong>DOJ's Opposition: Fighting the Wrong Battles</strong></p>

<p>At the March 12 hearing DOJ opposed the inflation adjustment; opposed the amendments concerning sophisticated means, intended loss, and fraud on the market; and supported the new enhancement based on causing victims substantial hardship. In other words, DOJ opposed virtually any amendment that could lead to lower sentences while supporting changes that could lead to higher ones. While this may seem predictable, I think it's a mistake.</p>

<p>DOJ was a lonely voice at the hearing and is definitely swimming against the tide by opposing the amendments. There is a widespread and growing belief that the sentences called for in major fraud cases have become excessive. More broadly, there is an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/02/19/the-bipartisan-push-for-criminal-justice-gets-a-koch-funded-boost/">emerging bipartisan movement</a> in the country favoring criminal justice reform, including measures to reduce skyrocketing sentences (particularly for non-violent offenders) and our enormous prison population.</p>

<p>Law professor Frank Bowman provided some compelling <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/amendment-process/public-hearings-and-meetings/20150312/Bowman.pdf">hearing testimony</a> [PDF] tracing the history of the fraud guideline and demonstrating how various forces, both intentional and unintentional, have combined over the years to escalate the sentences in such cases dramatically. As he pointed out, given the large dollar values involved in some recent Wall Street frauds, it's relatively easy for a white-collar defendant to zoom to the top of the sentencing table and end up with a recommended sentence of 30 years or even life in prison&#8212;on a par with sentences recommended for homicide, treason, or a major armed bank robbery.</p>

<p>DOJ's resistance to virtually any amendment that might lead to lower sentences in economic crime cases appears short-sighted and runs the risk of looking reflexive. The Sentencing Commission has <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/amendment-process/public-hearings-and-meetings/20150109/Remarks.pdf">researched these questions</a> [PDF] for several years, gathering input from all stakeholders. The proposals seem reasonable and justified, and in fact are <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/amendment-process/public-hearings-and-meetings/20150312/Caruso.pdf">more modest</a> [PDF] than many had hoped. </p>

<p>It's hard to see what criminal justice purpose is being served by the escalating sentences in fraud cases. The prospect of prison does have a powerful and important deterrent effect that is unique to criminal law. But for a typical business executive it's hard to believe there's much additional marginal deterrent value in a possible twenty or twenty-five year sentence as opposed to, say, a fifteen year one.</p>

<p>But the more important fact is that legal developments have rendered DOJ's position in favor of higher guidelines sentences increasingly beside the point. It's been ten years since the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11853896925646326770">US v. Booker</a> that the mandatory sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional and the guidelines must be advisory only. Later in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13748235959954807517">Kimbrough v. US</a> the Court made it clear that a judge is free to depart from the recommended sentence if the judge disagrees with a policy decision underlying the guidelines.  </p>

<p>In this legal environment, DOJ's push for higher guidelines looks like a struggle to keep the barn door closed when the horse left for greener pastures long ago. In the post- <span class="casename">Booker</span>/<span class="casename">Kimbrough</span> world, if judges believe a sentence called for by the guidelines is out of whack they will simply reduce it.  For example, in the <a href="http://rdeliason.com/2015/01/05/five-key-questions-that-will-determine-bob-mcdonnells-sentence/">recent public corruption case</a> involving former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell, the judge called the recommended guidelines sentence of six to eight years in prison "ridiculous" and proceeded to sentence McDonnell to only two years.  </p>

<p>There's evidence that the same thing is already happening in fraud cases. According to the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/federal-sentencing-statistics/state-district-circuit/2013/nys13.pdf">Sentencing Commission's data</a> [PDF], (see Table 10), judges sentence below the recommended guidelines range in about 21 percent of fraud cases (not counting those cases where the government itself requests a reduced sentence). But in the Southern District of New York, home to Wall Street and many of the big-dollar fraud cases, judges depart below the guidelines in a whopping 45.6 percent of such cases. It does no good for DOJ to continue to push for extremely high guidelines numbers only to have judges ignore the guidelines and impose the lower sentences that they feel are just and reasonable.  </p>

<p>DOJ's approach is worse than futile, it's counter-productive. The more that judges come to regard the guidelines as calling for inappropriate sentences, the more comfortable they may become not following them. This could lead to more widespread departures from the guidelines not merely in fraud cases but in cases across the board, accelerating a deterioration in the force and influence of the guidelines that so far has been held relatively in check since <span class="casename">Booker</span>.</p>

<p>DOJ would be better served by deferring to the Commission's expertise and to the growing consensus concerning excessive sentences in fraud cases. In truly extraordinary cases the government is always free to ask the judge to exceed the recommended guidelines sentence and depart upward. Such an approach could achieve DOJ's goal of enhanced punishment in cases where it may truly be called for while still promoting greater overall respect for the guidelines in the average case.</p>

<p>Following the post-Enron hysteria of more than a decade ago, the pendulum appears to have swung too far in the direction of extreme sentences for fraud cases. We will have to await the final version, but it appears the new guideline amendments will represent a move back in a sensible direction. DOJ should embrace this development, not oppose it. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.lclark.edu/live/profiles/271-tung-yin">Tung Yin</a>, of <a href="https://law.lclark.edu"> Lewis and Clark Law School</a>, discusses the effectiveness of TSA screening policies and how those policies affect our privacy rights...</p><strong>I</strong>n the fall of 2001, I went on the market to become a law professor, and I was fortunate enough to do a fair amount of flying for interviews. This was in the tense days following the 9/11 attacks before there was a Transportation and Security Agency (TSA), but when there was seemingly racial and ethnic profiling being used for secondary screening purposes. The millimeter wave and backscatter X-ray detectors were yet to be developed, so security screening consisted of sending passengers through the magnetometers and then subjecting a subset of persons to a manual inspection of their carry-on bags. In addition, there would be an additional secondary screening at the airport gate before boarding the flight. On one of my flights, there was a group of five men dressed in business suits who were speaking jovially to one another. All five were "randomly" selected for secondary screening.<br />
 <br />
All five appeared to be of Middle Eastern descent.</p>

<p><strong>The TSA Behavioral Detection Programs</strong></p>

<p>If the recent suit<a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/tsa_spot_foia_request.pdf"> ACLU v. TSA</a> [PDF] is to be believed, not much has changed in 14 years. TSA currently uses "behavioral detection" programs to select airline passengers for secondary inspections and questioning. An apparently leaked TSA <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/tsa-flags-yawns-on-terrorist-checklist-stinky-folks-can-also-expect-delays">document</a> reveals that "[e]xcessive yawning, repetitive grooming gestures and excessive body odor" are among the behaviors that can trigger additional scrutiny, on the theory that they indicate a desire "to appear disinterested in the screening process."</p>

<p>However, numerous stories in the mass media have alleged that these profiling programs have disproportionately targeted racial minorities, particularly those of Middle Eastern descent. In addition, government auditors have criticized the detection programs as being useless and scientifically invalid. In its <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) request, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was seeking:</p>

<blockquote>the release of records concerning the scientific basis for the TSA's behavior detection programs; policies, procedures, and guidance pertaining to the programs and their implementation; training and course materials for employees involved in behavior detection activities; records concerning the analysis or assessment of behavior detection programs and their implementation; data regarding referrals for additional screening and subsequent arrests; records related to the SPOT database; records concerning investigations of, or disciplinary actions related to, the work of behavior detection officers; and records related to allegations of racial, ethnic, religious, or national origin profiling related to behavior detection activities.</blockquote>

<p>There is obvious appeal to some kind of seemingly rational and non-discriminatory process to whittle down the number of people who are subjected to more extensive scrutiny, particularly whenever the targets of such scrutiny happen to be <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2013297/The-year-old-boy-targeted-pat-TSA-TWICE.html">young children</a> or <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/elderly-women-sue-tsa-screeners-alleged-strip-searches-article-1.2024549">elderly women</a>. Various law enforcement agencies have used profiles over the years in an attempt to detect <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17010248136028194244">human smugglers</a> at the border,<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14250362095289782263"> car thieves</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7743119714434200274">sex abusers</a> among others. Perhaps the best known profile is that of the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4880964185926264392">drug courier</a>, in which factors such as a traveler's paying for an airplane ticket in cash, flying to a "source city" where narcotics are smuggled into the country, carrying little or no luggage and using an unusual travel itinerary give rise to a suspicion that the person is a drug smuggler. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1799203374017461902">United States v. Sokolow</a>, the Supreme Court gave at least tacit acceptance to the use of profiling as an investigative tool insofar as the relevant profile factors are considered individually (as opposed to their merely being profile factors).</p>

<p>Of course, even seemingly race neutral profiles can be administered in discriminatory ways. Sixth Circuit Judge Damon Keith has <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15723850840737030731">argued</a> as much about the Drug Enforcement Agency's use of the drug courier profile. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/us/racial-profiling-at-boston-airport-officials-say.html?_r=2">New York Times</a>, among other media outlets, has reported that the TSA has been "targeting not only Middle Easterners but also blacks, Hispanics and other minorities."</p>

<p>The ACLU's FOIA lawsuit seeks information relevant to two potential challenges to the TSA's behavior detection programs: first, whether they are targeting minorities disproportionately, and second, whether they are effective at all even if used in non-discriminatory ways. Much has been written about the problems with racial profiling such as Randall Kennedy's <em>Race, Crime, and the Law</em>, so I will focus on the second issue, other than to note that information responsive to the ACLU's FOIA request may yield evidence to overcome the typical "Catch-22" that confronts plaintiffs raising <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8588485846461271912">selective enforcement claims</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Does Profiling Work?</strong></p>

<p>The ACLU and other critics contend that the TSA has not identified a single airplane-bound terrorist through its behavioral detection program, which suggests that the program is both ineffective and burdensome. But this is quite a difficult standard to meet, considering that terrorism is (fortunately) an extremely low-incidence event. Since 9/11, there have been two attempted acts of terrorism against US-bound flights, both of which were stopped by alert passengers. Neither of those flights originated within the US, so the failure to detect either "shoe bomber" <a href="http://fas.org/irp/news/2002/01/reidindictment.pdf">Richard Reid</a> [PDF] (who departed from Paris) or "underwear bomber" <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/Abdulmutallab_Indictment.pdf">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a> [PDF] (who departed from Amsterdam) cannot be blamed on TSA. Of course, it may be the case that terrorism against US flights is sufficiently difficult now given the post-9/11 precautions (e.g., hardened cockpit doors, millimeter wave scanners for passengers, computer tomography X-ray scanners for luggage, etc.) that behavioral profiling is not needed. But that is a different contention from arguing that profiling is ineffective.</p>

<p>Consider that on September 11, 2001, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Aviation Agency were using a computerized system known as CAPPS I (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System) to identify airlines passengers whose bags should undergo additional screening for explosives. The focus was on explosives because of terrorist incidents such as the inflight bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988.</p>

<p>On that day, CAPPS I picked 10 of the nineteen 9/11 hijackers for <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch1.htm">additional screening</a>: Wail al-Shehri, Satam al-Suqami and Waleed al-Shehri (Flight 11); Hani Hanjour, Khalid al-Mihdhar, Majed Moqed, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Salem al-Hazmi (Flight 77); and Ahmad al-Haznawi (Flight 93). On the other hand, CAPPS I picked none of the hijackers on Flight 175. Thus, CAPPS I was slightly greater than 50 percent accurate at identifying the 9/11 hijackers. Moreover, CAPPS I identified suspicious persons on three of the four hijacked planes, providing at least an opportunity to have unraveled 75 percent of the hijacking teams.</p>

<p>CAPPS I was relatively simplistic, checking passenger names against FBI and other watch lists (including the no-fly list) to generate a terrorism risk score. The Bush Administration's proposed successor program, CAPPS II, was spiked by the TSA, and Congress blocked another proposed successor, Secure Flight. To be sure, none of these programs relied on behavioral detection by TSA (or equivalent) agents. Moreover, the watch lists themselves could be infected by biases in terms of who selected whom to add. In other words, if investigators believe that terrorists come only from Middle Eastern countries, then the only people on the watch list used by CAPPS I would be persons from Middle Eastern countries. That might result in the detection of potential terrorists from Middle Eastern countries, but it would miss individuals from other parts of the world.</p>

<p>This suggests that the ACLU's FOIA request, if granted, may lead to the discovery of whether TSA has any blind spots in its behavioral detection programs that are leading to the allegedly discriminatory impact on minority travelers. It may also lead to the discovery of the underlying bases for the detection programs, which in turn might support civil rights lawsuits against them as unreasonable searches in violation of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If not behavioral profiling, then what?</strong></p>

<p>We might look ahead at how TSA might respond if it is ordered to reply to the FOIA request and the resulting information confirms the ACLU's criticism that the behavioral detection programs are ineffective. One possibility is that TSA would simply stop subjecting anyone to secondary screening (although such a decision might put more pressure on the federal government to increase surveillance measures in an effort to acquire actionable intelligence).</p>

<p>Another possibility, however, is that TSA will cease using any formal profiling program but will instead rely more on individual TSA agents' intuition and awareness. Is there reason to believe that individual gut feelings will be any better at detecting potential terrorists than a behavioral detection program? Consider the following two pre-9/11 incidents: </p>

<p>On December 14, 1999, Port Angeles, Washington-based US Customs Agent Diana Dean stopped a visitor who had taken his car on the ferry from Vancouver, British Columbia, for additional customs screening because he was acting "<a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020702&slug=12ressam02">hinky</a>." As a result, she asked him to complete a Customs Declaration Form, on which he gave a name that matched his Canadian driver's license but not his passport. A subsequent search by another customs agent found that the car was packed with explosives. The driver, later identified as Ahmed Ressam, pleaded guilty to conspiring to attack the Los Angeles International Airport with a car bomb.</p>

<p>On August 4, 2001, Orlando-based Immigration and Naturalization Service inspector Jose Mel&eacute;ndez-P&eacute;rez <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing7/witness_melendez.htm">interviewed </a>Saudi Arabian citizen Mohammed al Qahtani because al Qahtani's immigration forms were completed incorrectly. Mel&eacute;ndez-P&eacute;rez felt that al Qahtani's demeanor was evasive and that his responses were problematic in that he had limited assets, no return ticket and no place to stay. Mel&eacute;ndez-P&eacute;rez recommended denying al Qahtani entry, and the man was sent back to Saudi Arabia. He was later captured in Tora Bora, Afghanistan, and suspected of being the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/27/politics/27TERR.html?ex=1390539600&en=b8103e74d803a2df&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">missing twentieth hijacker</a>. (Three of the four hijacking teams consisted of two pilots and three "muscle," while Flight 93 had two pilots and two muscle.)</p>

<p>Both Dean and Mel&eacute;ndez-P&eacute;rez received accolades for their actions (post-9/11 in <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2010/10/jose_melendez-perez_zapped_sep.html">Mel&eacute;ndez-P&eacute;rez's case</a>). Yet, Dean has <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4864792/#.VSk7JfnF8xS">stated </a>that she acted on "gut instincts." As Mel&eacute;ndez-P&eacute;rez has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/01/26/911.commission/index.html?_s=PM:US">explained</a>, "The bottom line is: He gave me the creeps." Shifting toward an approach of individual gut instincts and perceptions of "the creeps," even if successful in those two instances, seems more likely to exacerbate the problems posed by formal profiling programs than to alleviate them.</p>

<p><strong>Why is it so hard to balance terrorist detection with privacy rights?</strong></p>

<p>US airlines <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2015/03/11/airlines-passengers-forecast-a4a/24715335/">have estimated</a> that there will be 2.2 million passengers every day in March and April 2015. Since 9/11, there have been fewer than five terrorism attempts against planes: the shoe bomber, the underwear bomber, the<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/30/world/al-qaeda-documents/"> London liquid explosives plot</a> and a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/world/01terror.html">cargo plane plot</a>. The degree of sensitivity required to detect such astronomically rare events, in the absence of actionable intelligence, without imposing upon a significant number of other persons measurable hardship is most likely beyond our present capabilities, absent some sort of super advanced real-time scanning operation like the one depicted in the science fiction movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wY0bk31ylA">Total Recall</a> [Video].This isn't to say that the ACLU's FOIA lawsuit is therefore without purpose. Estimates of the frequency of false positives may be useful for policy discussions about whether that frequency is low enough to justify the particular detection program, or too high to be considered reasonable. But successful pursuit of the FOIA lawsuit is only the beginning, not the end, of the discussion of appropriate screening procedures.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://apps.law.asu.edu/Apps/Faculty/Faculty.aspx?individual_id=65847">James G. Hodge Jr.</a> and Gregory Measer of the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law, Arizona State University, discuss the potential impact of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana and other states on protecting and promoting the public's health ...</p><strong>F</strong>ierce debates and extensive media coverage have centered on potential for discrimination arising from <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/indiana-arkansas-governors-sign-amended-religious-freedom-bills.php">Indiana's recent passage</a> of its Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Although Congress and <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/state-rfra-statutes.aspx">twenty other states</a> have previously passed similar legislation (and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/04/02/indiana-religious-freedom-law-deal-gay-discrimination/70819106/">other states</a> are currently considering reforms), Indiana's version may take respect for religious beliefs to new heights. Critics suggest, for example, that Indiana's law could allow religiously-minded private sector businesses and others to refuse wedding or other services to same sex couples. </p>

<p>Large and small businesses, as well as organizations including the Indianapolis-based<a href="http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/12563363/ncaa-concerned-indiana-new-law-religious-objections"> National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)</a>, have openly objected to potential religious stigmatization based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Refusing to repeal RFRA outright, Indiana Governor Mike Pence and the State legislature have recently amended the Act to clarify that it does not allow unwarranted discrimination.</p>

<p><em>So what exactly does Indiana's RFRA allow?</em> Arguments over the prospect of direct discriminatory acts center on the rights of others in the face of religiously-grounded bigotry. Yet, additional issues relate to the potential public health impacts of RFRA in Indiana and elsewhere. Bestowing individuals with stronger "free exercise" rights than the US Supreme Court was willing to recognize nearly two decades ago in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10098593029363815472">Employment Division v. Smith</a> is laudable. However, to what extent may greater recognition of religious freedoms impinge diverse public health programs or efforts for which persons or communities may disagree on religious grounds? </p>

<p>Think about religious or moral objections to public health interventions to vaccinate children or adults; screen persons for various conditions; or distribute safe, hypodermic needles to prevent spread of HIV or other infectious diseases. Assessing the potential for RFRA to negatively impact these and other public health initiatives raises four essential questions: (1) who is a "person" under RFRA? (2) what is meant by one's "exercise of religion?" (3) when may government "substantially burden" this exercise? and (4) could specific laws authorizing or supporting public health programs be negated?      </p>

<p><strong>Indiana's Expansive Respect for Religious Freedoms </strong></p>

<p>Understanding the scope of RFRA in Indiana and other jurisdictions begins with an assessment of whom it applies. The concept of "person" extends well beyond individuals to include partnerships, corporations and associations that operate primarily for religious purposes or exercise certain practices compelled or limited by their religious beliefs. </p>

<p>This definition reflects in part the extension of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000cc-5">federal RFRA</a> protections to closely-held, for profit corporations by the US Supreme Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5322529599500468186">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores</a> (2014). To the extent that corporations and other business entities are comprised of individuals, reasoned the Court, they can exercise religious beliefs much like natural persons. "Exercise of religion" includes any exercise "whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system or religious belief." Direct infringements on one's exercise of religion (e.g., government restrictions on when and where one can worship) are easy to discern. </p>

<p>Less direct infringements can be more difficult to judge. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17195459629740799700">American Life League, Inc. v. Reno </a>(1995), Virginia-based abortion opponents challenged the constitutionality of the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/248">Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act</a> (FACE). They argued that their religious opposition to abortion "requires them to obstruct physically, through peaceful picketing, access to clinics offering abortion services." The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed, but still "saved FACE" by holding that the Act served a compelling governmental interest via the least restrictive available means. Similarly, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10712434386243353037">Planned Parenthood v. Walton</a> (1996), the plaintiffs argued unsuccessfully that FACE burdens their "religious mission of helping abortion bound women." </p>

<p>These claims illustrate the potential breadth of what constitutes "substantial burdens" of the exercise of religion. Since neither the federal nor Indiana RFRAs define this concept, courts are left to assess the extent that an exercise of religion, whether reasonable or not, is burdened. In <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> the court found that DHHS' employer contraceptive mandate presented a substantial burden because the corporation was required to "engage in conduct that seriously violates [its] religious belief," namely paying for reproductive services.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://casetext.com/case/us-v-jefferson-28"> US v. Jefferson</a> (2001) a federal court in Indiana broadly defined substantial burden as "one that forces adherents of a religion to refrain from religiously motivated conduct, inhibits or constrains conduct or expression that manifests a central tenet of a person's religious beliefs or compels conduct or expression that is contrary to those beliefs." Under this standard, minor infringements of an exercise of religion are not ripe for suit under RFRA. Furthermore, government can always overcome a showing of substantial burden by demonstrating that its law or program furthers a compelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means. </p>

<p><strong>Potential Impacts on the Public's Health </strong></p>

<p>Balanced against the need to demonstrate substantial burdens of religious exercises, Indiana's RFRA provides a relatively safe harbor for many public health initiatives. It is not enough legally for someone to suggest that a specific public health program conflicts with or is contrary to their religious beliefs.  </p>

<p>Plenty of people do not agree with how government spends revenues on public health programs to protect maternal and reproductive health, prevent obesity, screen newborns or control guns. Some seek to opt out of specific programs (e.g., sex education courses in public schools) based on religious objections. Their personal disagreements alone do not threaten the viability of these communal efforts pursuant to RFRA. According to the Act,"[g]ranting government funding ... to the extent permissible with the Establishment Clause" is not a RFRA violation. </p>

<p>In other cases, however, respect for individuals' religious beliefs could theoretically impact public health objectives. For example, expanding the array of objections to school vaccination requirements based on loosely-held religious beliefs pursuant to RFRA may further diminish herd immunity leading to increased outbreaks of measles, whooping cough and other childhood diseases. </p>

<p><strong>Needle Exchange Programs and HIV Prevention</strong></p>

<p>A fascinating case related to RFRA and the public's health entails Indiana Governor Pence's recent <a href="http://www.in.gov/gov/files/Executive_Order_15-05.pdf">declaration</a> [PDF] of a public health emergency on March 26, 2015 in response to a localized outbreak of HIV infections in rural Scott County. The declaration authorizes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/us/indiana-declares-health-emergency-after-hiv-outbreak.html?_r=1">temporary local implementation</a> of a needle exchange program (NEP) to counter the spread of HIV among over 85 individuals, largely intravenous drug users (IDUs) hooked on the prescription drug, Opana. </p>

<p>NEPs have long been outlawed in Indiana and multiple other states despite their known efficacy in limiting the spread of HIV among IDUs directly and their sexual partners indirectly. Some believe, largely without public health justification, that distributing free hypodermic needles to IDUs propels illicit drug habits.  </p>

<p>Coupled with the US rise of HIV, NEPs were once objected to on <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1405677/pdf/amjph00211-0144.pdf">religious grounds</a> [PDF]. Handing out free needles to sinful, law-breaking drug users and their HIV-infected partners was viewed as contrary to moral and religious principles. Experiments to test the efficacy of needle exchanges in New York City in 1989, for example, were initially opposed by some religious leaders. Reverend Calvin O. Butts of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem <a href="http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1212&context=twlj">declared </a> [PDF] he was "not in favor of cooperating with evil," a position he later recanted in 1991.</p>

<p>These and other views fell silent as the utility of NEPs in preventing new cases of HIV was demonstrated. In 2009, a multi-denominational panel of religious leaders convened in Washington, DC to urge federal leaders to fund NEPs. Journalist <a href="http://religiondispatches.org/needle-exchange-gets-religion/">Sara Friedman</a> observed: "In the last decade or so, since religion has taken on the HIV/AIDS pandemic ... the concept of sin has given way to human weakness, and punishment to compassion." </p>

<p>Despite reluctance among Catholic leaders to expressly endorse NEPs, they and other religious groups, have increasingly recognized that supplying clean syringes to IDUs prevents HIV transmission. <a href="https://www.chausa.org/docs/default-source/health-progress/needle-exchange---the-moral-framework-for-a-global-problem-pdf.pdf?sfvrsn=0">The Catholic Diocese of Albany (NY)</a> [PDF] reportedly operates its own program, Temple Israel in NYC <a href="http://www.boomhealth.org/about/funders">donates </a> to BoomHealth which conducts <a href="http://www.boomhealth.org/solutions/syringe-access">syringe exchanges</a> and multiple churches financially support the <a href="http://thefreeclinic.org/donate/our-supporters/">Free Medical Clinic of Greater Cleveland</a>, which runs a NEP. </p>

<p>Still, the federal government and many states, including Indiana, ban the use of government funds for NEPs. Only by declaring a public health emergency was Indiana's governor able to <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/news/chi-indiana-hiv-outbreak-20150330-story.html">waive </a> existing criminal drug paraphernalia <a href="http://lawatlas.org/query?dataset=syringe-policies-laws-regulating-non-retail-distribution-of-drug-paraphernalia">laws </a> that disallow implementation of such exchanges for the duration of the emergency. This unique status begs the question: if Indiana's existing legal ban of NEPs is lifted temporarily to further the public's health, could it be reversed due to religious objections grounded in RFRA? The answer seems to be "no" for legal and political reasons.</p>

<p>First, by the very same emergency authority through which Governor Pence waived existing laws prohibiting NEPs, he could also waive conflicting provisions of RFRA (at least for the duration of the emergency). Of course, the Governor's waiver of RFRA may be politically difficult given how hard he has worked to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/mike-pence-ensuring-religious-freedom-in-indiana-1427757799">defend </a> it. </p>

<p>Second, as noted above, RFRA expressly disallows religious-based objections to approved government expenditures otherwise consistent with the Establishment Clause. Yet, this limitation only thwarts objections to uses of government funding, but not to government's direct administration of specific programs that impinge on religious exercises.</p>

<p>Third, despite objections in the early days of the HIV epidemic, few solid, religious arguments remain to denounce the utility of NEPs. Under RFRA's current statutory construction and court interpretations, however, a person need only show that one's religious objection is grounded in some faith-based principles no matter how unreasonable others may find them.</p>

<p>Fourth, even if a Hoosier is religiously opposed to exchanging needles for the benefit of IDUs, demonstrating that direct government administration of NEPs "substantially burdens" these beliefs is a hard sell. How is one remotely burdened by the fact that safe needles are provided to IDUs in their communities? Perhaps these same persons feel burdened by the presence of abortion clinics in their community? That is too bad. As noted above, access to private abortion services is constitutionally-guaranteed. Yet, access to safe needles is not. </p>

<p>Religious objections to NEPs do not interfere with others' constitutional interests, but courts may still acknowledge a substantial burden emanating from government's allowance of needle exchanges. This may be especially true if the NEP interferes with one's religiously-grounded efforts to help IDUs break their "sinful" drug habits. A church, for example, may conduct regular drug prevention programs for IDUs only to see the local public health clinic distribute free needles that allegedly facilitate their drug use. Modern scientific findings on addiction behaviors may circumvent prior views vilifying IDUs, but some religious persons may still believe otherwise.  </p>

<p>Finally, presume for the moment that the limited, free distribution of needles substantially burdens someone's exercise of religion. Under RFRA, government still wins if it (a) can show the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest (like preventing future cases of HIV in a declared public health emergency) and (b) is pursuing the "least restrictive" means of furthering that compelling interest. </p>

<p>Whenever government has to demonstrate its chosen path is the least restrictive alternative via strict scrutiny, results are unpredictable. There are invariably other paths government take that may be less restrictive on individual freedoms, including religious freedoms. For over 30 years NEPs have been considered "off the menu" of public health interventions as federal and many states' governments refuse to fund them. Interestingly, following the temporary allowance of NEPs by Governor Pence, Indiana's House public health committee introduced a <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/news/chi-indiana-hiv-outbreak-20150330-story.html">bill </a> to allow routine use of NEPs to combat the spread of Hepatitis C. Passage of the bill is uncertain at best.  </p>

<p>It may be hard to fathom that during Indiana's declared public health emergency, government may avoid use of NEPs to counter the spread of HIV based on religious objections despite sound public health science. Still it has happened before concerning needle exchanges, and could theoretically happen again.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Cliff H. Mason II, <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University School of Law</a>, Class of 2016, discusses whether a racist chant performed by fraternity members of the Oklahoma University is protected under the First Amendment, or the university president has the capacity to act ... </j:header></p>

<p>"<strong>Y</strong>ou can hang them from a tree, but they'll never sign with me, there will never be a N----R in SAE." This infamous chant, performed by members of the Oklahoma University (OU) chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity (SAE), emboldened the nation to further discuss tense race relations in America. Overlooked in these conversations of race are the implications of speech rights on college campuses. In response to the relentless tidal wave of negative publicity sustained by OU, President David Boren denounced the chapter by immediately disbanding the fraternity and expelling two members intricately involved. Were the speech rights of those fraternity members infringed or was Boren justified while acting in his capacity as university president?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">The Free Speech clause</a> of the First Amendment to the US Constitution provides great latitude for expression. No provision exists to restrict racist, unpatriotic nor misogynist speech. These forms and several others are surely distasteful to many. But that distaste does not suffice for government imposed prohibition as the US Supreme Court has consistently protected free expression. Boren authored a concise but scathing repudiation of the fraternity after a video surfaced depicting SAE members exercising a particularly heinous form of racist speech. In the words of Boren:</p>

<blockquote>You are disgraceful. You have violated all that we stand for. You should not have the privilege of calling yourselves "Sooners." Real Sooners are not racist. Real Sooners are not bigots.</blockquote>

<p>Boren went on to sever ties with the fraternity and directed the closing of their house. This decision may have run afoul of established free speech rights. Boren sparked an important debate between protecting fundamental rights versus the imposition of government censorship.  </p>

<p>Evidenced in the court's 1989 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2084618710761560217">Texas v. Johnson</a> decision, merely "taking offense to certain ideas or expression does not justify prohibition." In <span class="casename">Johnson</span>, the court reasoned that although government officials and military veterans may take considerable offense to the destruction of the American flag, citizens are free to do so in an act of political speech. Essential to the foundation of American independence is the ability for citizens to "petition their government for redress of grievances." Expression of political speech is inherent in the public display of government disapproval. Thus, the court was apt to overturn the conviction of Gregory Lee Johnson for publicly burning the American flag in Dallas during the Republican National Convention and to condemn the Texas authorities for denying his rights to political speech.</p>

<p>Prior to <span class="casename">Johnson</span>, in 1968 the court similarly preserved speech rights on public school campuses. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15235797139493194004">Tinker v. Des Moines</a> marked a shift in the ideology of protections afforded school children. There, the court recognized the importance of retaining speech rights while on campus. Christopher Eckhardt along with John and Mary Beth Tinker wore black armbands to school in opposition to the Vietnam War. An act of silent protest generally ignored and unnoticed until the district suspended them indefinitely. The court reasoned that it was inconceivable "to argue that [s]tudents shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate." This decision opened the door for political and symbolic speech to appear on public school campuses without fear of retribution. According to <span class="casename">Tinker</span>, schools may only restrict student speech when it "<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15235797139493194004">materially and substantially </a> interferes with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school."</p>

<p>Nonetheless ideals derived in <span class="casename">Tinker</span> have contemporary applicability. Institutions of higher education have a "compelling interest in regulating speech that interferes with or disrupts the work and discipline of the school." The test in <span class="casename">Tinker</span> is clear. Speech causing a "material and substantial disruption" is devoid of constitutional protection. Wearing black armbands is clearly not disrupting the learning process. In Norman, Oklahoma, the cynically proud chanting of SAE members boasting of their racially discriminatory recruiting practices may not receive equal constitutional protection that the children in <span class="casename">Tinker</span> once enjoyed. Recall the speech in Oklahoma: "They'll never sign with me, there will never be a N----R in SAE." </p>

<p>Can we infer from <span class="casename">Tinker</span> that schools are limited in their ability to restrict speech? Yes, the burden for speech restriction on the campus of public schools was effectively heightened. Even so, schools remain in authority to restrict speech at their institutions. High school senior Matthew Fraser was suspended in 1986 after delivering a speech laden with unmistakable sexual innuendo to the student body. Ruling against Fraser, the court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=225428161324034725">Bethel School District v. Fraser</a> decided his suspension met constitutional muster. Tempering false expectations of broad speech rights, the court explained that, "the constitutional rights of students in public schools are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings." </p>

<p>To be clear, the Constitution never intended for students to have <span class="casename">Johnson</span> like speech protection rights. There is no correlation of the protected political speech in <span class="casename">Tinker</span> or <span class="casename">Johnson</span> and the inflammatory racist speech of the SAE fraternity members at OU. The notion that Americans possess an unbridled right to speak freely does not dovetail with reality. Our constitution, though concise and vague, has been routinely interpreted as providing limited rights to speech and allows reasonable government regulation. Thus, the actions of President David Boren were prudent under the circumstances. </p>

<p>His position as chief education administrator on the OU campus necessitated the swift and targeted admonition of the hateful speech in question. Had Boren remained silent on the matter, his administration would be viewed as complicit and ultimately as an apathetic instigating force. Consensus denunciation of the extremely vindictive, discriminatory practice being celebrated by the SAE members made Boren's decision uncomplicated. As the recording spread nationwide in a matter of hours, it was obvious that OU faced dangerous ramifications with inaction. Disbanding this fraternity was essential to OU preserving its educational environment. Comfort knowing that biological composition will not result in discrimination has served as a pillar of public education since the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12120372216939101759">Brown v. Board of Education</a> decision. </p>

<p>Once Boren learned that his institution was a nexus of race-based discrimination, the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment</a> required his intervention. President Eisenhower first demonstrated that race-based discrimination on school campuses suffices for government intervention, when he sent federal soldiers to personally escort the <a href="http://www.littlerock9.com/history.html">Little Rock Nine</a> students past barricades of protesters. </p>

<p>Members of SAE were entitled to espouse hateful ideology. Our government will never be in a position to police thoughts or beliefs. But once that ideology transformed into public speech and disseminated to the university community at-large, OU administrators were obligated to act in a fashion that upheld the sanctity of academic integrity. Any scandals involving discrimination perpetrated by institutionally sanctioned social groups would have amounted to institutional promulgation of hate. That association is unacceptable. </p>

<p>Free Speech proponents condemning the Boren's decision largely misapply <span class="casename">Tinker</span>. This misapplication stems from a conscience choice to ignore the imminent fallout amongst racial minorities at OU that were victimized by the speech. If the SAE speech in question were not egregious it would have avoided national front-page deference. Any insinuations that deny the intensity of focus the SAE chant received are disingenuous. </p>

<p>Just eight years ago Chief Justice Roberts, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10117776825257150184">Morse v. Frederick</a> adopted a red line principle of speech restriction for school officials. In keeping with decisions rendered in <span class="casename">Tinker</span>, <span class="casename">Bethel</span> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2391207692241045857">Hazelwood</a>, the court held that, "schools may take steps to safeguard those entrusted to the care [of students]." As previously acknowledged, the Constitution protects our right to hurtful, degrading, even embarrassing speech. However, this free speech liberty is not limitless. As the chant ignited a national firestorm, there can be no question whether that rhetoric would adversely impact OU students' ability to learn in a functional educational environment. Boren was not only within his constitutional authority to dismiss those students, but he was obligated to.</p>

		<title>Polish Soldiers Acquitted of War Crimes for Nangar Khel Incident</title>

<p><strong>I</strong>n a recent ruling, a Warsaw military court <a href="paperchase/2015/03/poland-court-clears-soldiers-of-afghanistan-war-crimes.php">acquitted</a> four Polish soldiers of war crimes over the killing of six civilians in Afghanistan in 2007. The soldiers were nonetheless found guilty of the lesser offense of failing to carry out a military order. This group of soldiers was part of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/19/us-poland-military-afghanistan-iduskbn0mf1tl20150319">28,000 Polish military personnel</a> who took part in the international mission in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2014. This article will explore the soldiers' original charges of war crimes and will analyze whether their alleged actions constituted war crimes under international humanitarian law. It should be noted that the soldiers were originally charged with violations of various provisions of the <a href="http://www.legislationline.org/documents/section/criminal-codes/country/10">Polish Criminal Code</a>, including crimes against peace, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Because these provisions of Polish law reference international law, the below analysis of the soldiers' liability under international humanitarian law is both relevant and appropriate.</p>

<p>On August 16, 2007, a Polish squad, including the four above-mentioned soldiers, fired mortar shells into a wedding party in the Nangar Khel village in eastern Afghanistan, killing eight civilians. Among the victims were the groom, as well as several children and women. The attack on the Nangar Khel village was likely in response to the injuries suffered by two other Polish soldiers earlier that same day when their vehicle hit a Taliban mine located near the village. According to some witnesses, the Polish captain and commander of the relevant unit told his men to "f--- over a couple of villages." It is possible that Polish officers who ordered the attack believed that the Taliban forces involved in the prior attack on Polish soldiers earlier on the same day were present at Nangar Khel. Two soldiers&#8212;a commander and a lieutenant both of whom later served as witnesses for the prosecution&#8212;refused to follow the order and requested the base to stop the attack on the wedding party. The Polish attack on Nangar Khel took place nonetheless.</p>

<p>In 2009, the Warsaw Military District Court <a href="paperchase/2009/02/poland-trial-begins-for-soldiers.php">charged</a> four officers and three privates with war crimes over this incident. The defendants all pleaded innocent, blaming the attack on faulty weaponry as well as portraying the attack as a response to enemy fire. All seven defendants were <a href="http://www.warsawvoice.pl/WVpage/pages/articlePrint.php/31282/news">acquitted</a> in 2011 for lack of evidence of deliberate killing. A military supreme court trial was reopened for the four officers in 2012, resulting in the present-day acquittal of all four officers on war crime charges. The five-judge Military District Court in Warsaw <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/03/25/poli-m25.html">declared</a> that "there was a lack of convincing proof that the war crime was committed." Court spokesman Tomasz Krajewski also <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/19/us-poland-military-afghanistan-iduskbn0mf1tl20150319">stated</a>, "The court did not establish that the soldiers' actions were deliberate. The shooting of the village was not on purpose; neither was the killing of the civilians."</p>

<p>Did the soldiers' actions amount to war crimes? The answer to this question depends on which version of the facts one believes and on which body of law one applies to the conflict in Afghanistan. The Polish officers, as well as the Polish Minister of Defense, had claimed that the killings took place as part of a mission to eliminate specific Taliban targets in response to enemy fire. The prosecution insisted that the attack on Nangar Khel was a deliberate act targeting a civilian population not performed in direct response to a Taliban attack against the Polish soldiers. The question of whether the soldiers' acts amounted to war crimes depends in the first place on which version of the facts amounts to the actual truth.</p>

<p>Second, the question of whether Polish soldiers committed war crimes turns on applicable law. Most scholars agree that the armed conflict in Afghanistan is a <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1745&context=fss_papers">non-international</a> armed conflict to which relevant principles of international humanitarian law apply. International humanitarian law (also known as the law of armed conflict) aims to mitigate human suffering caused by war by limiting the amount of violence used in a war and by restricting it toward those who are directly participating in the war. Two main principles of international humanitarian law directly relevant for the purposes of this case are the principle of distinction and the principle of proportionality. The <a href="https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule1">principle of distinction</a> requires that belligerents distinguish between military objectives and civilian persons and objectives and that only the former be attacked. This principle has been established as both a norm of customary law applicable to non-international armed conflict as well as treaty provisions. <a href="https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/d67c3971bcff1c10c125641e0052b545">Article 13(2) of Additional Protocol II</a> of the Geneva Conventions states that "(t)he civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the subject of attack..." It is undisputed that if the Polish soldiers had fired on the village of Nangar Khel deliberately, and not in response to an attack by the Taliban from that geographic area, then these acts would have violated the principle of distinction. </p>

<p>However, because the conflict in Afghanistan is of a non-international character, some uncertainty remains as to whether such violations of the principle of distinction amount to war crimes within the paradigm of a non-international armed conflict. On the one hand, Additional Protocol II, applicable to non-international armed conflict, lacks specific provisions found in Additional Protocol I, applicable to international armed conflict, which render the violation of the principle of distinction a war crime. On the other hand, however, the <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/galic/4">Galic</a> case of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia held that an attack against civilians can constitute a war crime, even in non-international armed conflict, by virtue of customary law. Thus, the issue of whether Polish soldiers committed war crimes by violating the principle of distinction turns on the accuracy of the differing factual accounts of the incident as well as on one's interpretation of international humanitarian law.</p>

<p>In addition to the principle of distinction, the <a href="http://www.academia.edu/430205/The_Principle_of_Proportionality_Under_International_Humanitarian_Law_and_Operation_Cast_Lead">principle of proportionality</a> constitutes another fundamental principle of international humanitarian law. This principle dictates that the military advantage gained by a particular operation must outweigh the civilian damage caused by that operation. It follows that every time a large number of civilians may be injured as collateral damage as compared to the importance and advantage of the contemplated military operation, the attack should not take place because it would cause excessive civilian damage. Most scholars, as well as case law of recent international criminal tribunals, <a href="http://www.elac.ox.ac.uk/downloads/proportionality_policybrief_%20dec_2010.pdf">agree</a> that the principle of proportionality applies to non-international armed conflict via international customary law. The question of whether the Polish soldiers violated the principle of proportionality and thereby committed a war crime turns as well on the accuracy of differing factual accounts presented in this case. If the Polish soldiers had fired on Nangar Khel village as retaliation for a past attack and not in response to a direct attack by the Taliban forces, then the Polish soldiers would have violated the principle of proportionality by attacking a civilian village with indiscriminate fire which would clearly be expected to cause excessive civilian damage without achieving an advantageous military goal. If the Polish soldiers attacked Nangar Khel in response to enemy fire with the presumption that Taliban forces and targets were to be found in the village, then their attack could potentially be justified under the principle of proportionality despite the fact that the attack would cause some civilian casualties.  </p>

<p>The Warsaw Military District Court found that there was <a href="http://www.warsawvoice.pl/WVpage/pages/articlePrint.php/31282/news">no evidence of deliberate acts</a> against civilians by the Polish soldiers, thereby at least partially accepting the soldiers' version of the incident. The Court's ruling, and this case in general, are significant for several reasons. First, this trial was the first-ever war crimes trial in modern-day Polish history. Second, while the willingness of Polish authorities to hold such a trial against its own soldiers is remarkable, the outcome of the case sheds doubt on the issue of individual criminal responsibility for soldiers involved in armed conflict on behalf of their governments. It may be that in the future that almost every violation of international humanitarian law during armed conflict committed by active forces of a warring state will be shielded by the argument that there is not enough evidence to prove the wrongdoers' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>

<p>Third, it is reasonable to conclude that future prosecutions of this type will always be tainted by politics and self-interest. In this particular case, Polish authorities had undertaken remarkable efforts to make amends for the incident, including paying compensation to the victims of shelling at Nangar Khel and transporting the injured to Poland for further treatment. However, the individual soldiers involved in the incident were all acquitted of war crimes charges despite the strong possibility that they violated the principles of distinction and proportionality. Even if their acquittal was proper, the Nangar Khel incident has set an unfortunate precedent in the history of Polish armed forces and may have troubling implications for future war crimes prosecutions in other countries.  </p>

		<title>California&amp;apos;s Water Restriction and Its Beneficial Incentives</title>

<j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Griffen Thorne, Student at <a href="http://www.luc.edu/law/">Loyola University Chicago School of Law</a>, discusses water use restrictions in the State of California ... </j:header></p>

<p><br />
On April 1, 2015, California Governor Jerry Brown issued <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/docs/4.1.15_Executive_Order.pdf">Executive Order B-29-15</a> [PDF] ("EO"), which mandates gargantuan water-use restrictions throughout the State and which will remain in effect through February 28, 2016. The EO is a response to the severe and unrelenting drought that threatens California's livelihood. Though many hope the mandate will help reverse California's dire water shortage, it may just place a drop in the bucket. However, the legal framework it establishes could produce lasting effects in the state by incentivizing water reductions and innovation.</p>

<p>California uses a vast amount of water; in fact, the US Geological Survey recognized that <a href="http://ca.water.usgs.gov/water_use/">California uses more water than any other state</a>. Californians use an average of 181 gallons each per day, though levels of personal use <a href="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/commentary/where-we-are/in-a-season-of-drought-where-does-the-water-go.html">vary greatly</a> throughout the state. Residential use is <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/sc<br />
ience/ci_25090363/california-drought-water-use-varies-widely-around-state">extremely high</a>, with 50 percent of residential use going to landscaping. Nevertheless, despite the seemingly high level of residential use, residential water use in the state is rather low overall and not even close to the main contributor to the drought. According to a June 2014 brief by the <a href="http://pacinst.org">Pacific Institute</a>, agricultural water use accounts for about <a href="http://pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2014/06/ca-water-ag-efficiency.pdf">80 percent of the state's use</a> [PDF], though a Reuters fact sheet notes that the agricultural industry contends the number is lower, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/13/us-water-agriculture-factbox-idUSTRE52C08M20090313">between 40 and 60 percent</a>.</p>

<p>In either event, the amount of agricultural water use is far larger than personal use. There have been a flurry of articles since the EO was issued condemning California almond farming, all of which claim that <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense<br />
/2014/05/_10_percent_of_california_s_water_goes_to_almond_farming.html">almond farming accounts for 10 percent of the state's water use</a>. However, massive reductions farmers' water use could have drastic economic consequences. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/13/us-water-agriculture-factbox-idUSTRE52C08M20090313">California supplies over half the country's fruit, nuts and vegetables and exports massive quantities overseas</a>. Farming is an essential part of California's economy, and the state must therefore consider any economic impact water-use restrictions could have on the industry.</p>

<p>The backdrop of California's water usage informs a discussion of the drought. California's drought has wreaked havoc on the state for nearly four years, depleting the state's <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/08<br />
/140819-groundwater-california-drought-aquifers-hidden-crisis/">traditional water sources</a>. An op-ed by NASA scientist Jay Famiglietti&#8212;which predated Brown's mandate by about two weeks&#8212;painted a glum picture, claiming that the state "has only about one year of water supply left in its reservoirs," and that since 2011, the state has lost about 12 million acre-feet of water <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-famiglietti-drought-california-20150313-story.html">annually</a>.</p>

<p>In a response to surface water allocation, the agricultural industry has been forced to find other methods of obtaining water and has turned to pumping groundwater, which only exacerbates the state's problems. Famiglietti notes that in some areas of the Central Valley where groundwater pumping is commonplace, land has been sinking by "one foot or more per year." By now, anyone familiar with the issue has seen myriad images of almost-empty lakes and rivers or <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/california-drought/california-drought-crisis-takes-toll-lake-oroville-n185001">cracked and parched land</a>.</p>

<p>As a remedy, Famiglietti <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-famiglietti-drought-california-20150313-story.html">suggested</a> immediate and mandatory water rationing, formation of regional water agencies and task forces and the passage of new water laws. At the time of the article's publication, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-famiglietti-drought-california-20150313-story.html">he noted</a> that 94 percent of Californians surveyed believed the drought was serious, and one third surveyed believed water rationing was necessary. It is hard to imagine that those numbers have decreased.</p>

<p>Faced with these problems, Brown issued the EO, which began by addressing the state's depleted water supply. The EO was invoked pursuant to Brown's <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&group=08001-09000&file=8555-8561">authority</a> during a statewide emergency, and invoked the governor's power to suspend other laws&#8212;including portions of the California Public Resources Code&#8212;in order to <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&group=0<br />
8001-09000&file=8565-8574">comply</a> with the EO's substantive requirements.</p>

<p>The EO's chief provision is its mandate that the State Water Resources Control Board (the "Water Board") reduce potable urban water usage by 25 percent through February 28, 2016 and its mandate that the California Public Utilities Commission ("PUC") follow the same restrictions for investor-owned utilities that provide water. Essentially, these agencies will be responsible for promulgating regulations for achieving the EO's mandated reduction, and then local utilities will be tasked with figuring out how to implement<a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com/2<br />
015/04/06/governor-brown-announces-new-mandate-in-face-of-drought/"> those regulations</a>. From the face of the EO, however, it is impossible to tell what kind of reductions will occur or how burdensome they will be on Californians.</p>

<p>But other provisions of EO are apparent with respect to their burden on Californians. Interestingly&#8212;and possibly in response to the high water usage for landscaping purposes&#8212;the EO vests authority in the Department of Water Resources and local agencies to replace 50 million square feet of lawns with ornamental turf. It also forces the Water Board to impose restrictions on commercial water use in places like golf courses and cemeteries, and prohibits the use of "potable water of ornamental turf on public street medians." These provisions are guaranteed to elicit backlash, though they are by no means novel. During an earlier California drought, Santa Barbara citizens began painting their brown lawns green in <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-07/news/mn-92_1_santa-barbara">response</a> to water-use restrictions for lawns.</p>

<p>The EO's enforcement mechanisms are equally controversial. The EO mandates the Water Board to require urban suppliers to engage in monthly reporting and bring enforcement actions against illegal diverters or people who engage in "wasteful or unreasonable uses of water." It also mandates new regulations for water-efficiency standards and creating drought management plans for large agricultural water suppliers. Depending on how state agencies and local utilities choose to restrict water use, this could mean residents might face penalties for overuse.</p>

<p>Not all of the EO's means operate harshly. For one, it mandates investment in new water technologies, requiring the Department of Water Resources and California Energy Commission to create a Water Energy Technology program (ironically called "WET"), to achieve not only greater water savings, but also energy savings and greenhouse-gas reductions. The EO suggests use of, among other things, water-use monitoring software, irrigation technology and even desalination efforts.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the city of Santa Barbara had already built a water-desalination plant during an earlier drought, but it was never used, partly because the drought ended in heavy rainfall shortly before the plant became operational, and partly because of other environmental concerns with the wastewater product of <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/04/05/397659871/will-turning-seawater-into-drinking-water-help-drought-hit-california">desalination</a>. The city is currently working on reopening the plant in response to the drought. Efforts like this may prove successful, and pursuant to the EO's investment mandate, could spur similar investment across the state.</p>

<p>In short, the EO contains many controversial mandates that have been and will be scrutinized from every angle. As some commentators have noted, the heaviest burden&#8212;and what will determine whether the EO will be successful&#8212;lies in the hands of <a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com/2015/04/06/governor-brown-announces-new-mandate-in-face-of-drought/">local utilities</a>. Local utilities can use 25-percent-reduction mandate to justify personal reduction of 25 percent. Alternatively they can implement a tiered system that will impose on larger urban users a water use reduction requirement greater than the reduction requirement with respect to citizens. Finally they can do anything in between these two options. With so much discretion and such little time in which to operate, there can be an undesirable outcome.</p>

<p>Another critique of the EO is that it does not impose direct water-use restrictions on agriculture. As <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/soapbox/article17332904.html">one commentator noted</a>, <blockquote>"the order mostly applies to residential and urban water use that accounts for 15 percent of the state's total water budget. By contrast, agriculture consumes a hefty 80 percent of water used by people; yet Brown's mandates place little burden&#8212;and no new restrictions on agriculture."</blockquote> The Board has <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/soapbox/article17332904.html">agreed</a> that it will impose restrictions on agriculture, but as of now it is impossible to tell what those restrictions will be and whether they will be significant. And as mentioned above, restrictions on agricultural water could create many problems. Restrictions could cause farmers to seek out more groundwater. Or, they could threatened California's agricultural economy.</p>

<p>Other criticisms have gone beyond the EO. There have been many arguments over boycotting various forms of California agriculture, especially <a href="http://www.alternet.org/environment/you-boycott-all-california-almonds-read">almonds</a>. Some have even suggested dropping almonds and meat in favor of farming <a href="https://medium.com/@lesliejz/don-t-stop-showering-california-lay-off-the-burgers-and-nuts-and-pick-up-some-crickets-eb63bddf0277">crickets for food</a>. Others have vocally opposed even seemingly beneficial environmental efforts like <a href="http://www.npr.org/2<br />
015/04/05/397659871/will-turning-seawater-into-drinking-water-help-drought-hit-california">desalination</a>. These criticisms demonstrate that people are looking for solutions beyond the EO. And, hopefully, the framework established by the EO will be a push in the right direction.</p>

<p>At least from the face of the EO, it appears that it could provide that push. It incentivizes investment in new, energy-efficient technology, in a step towards ensuring that future generations of Californians will have better access to water. It puts California's interests first by prioritizing water-infrastructure projects, a process that could even create jobs in California should the state decide to craft new infrastructure. It mandates emergency drought barriers to prevent saltwater entry into freshwater rivers, which could prevent or mitigate harm. It provides beneficial monetary incentives as well, including funding for lawn-replacement programs in "underserved communities" and a system wherein Californians can receive rebates for replacing inefficient appliances with <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18910">efficient appliances</a>. Therefore, it provides tangible incentives for personal reductions of water use.</p>

<p>The EO will almost certainly face legal challenges, even though it is only effective for less than one year. Though in that time, Californians are likely to face reductions, if the mandate is even partially successful, future Californians will see a benefit.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.umassd.edu/law/faculty/jeremiahho/">Jeremiah A. Ho</a> of <a href="http://www.umassd.edu/law/">the University of Massachusetts School of Law</a>, discusses <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/indiana-arkansas-governors-sign-amended-religious-freedom-bills.php">the amended Indiana "religious freedom" bills </a>and marriage equality issues in the US... </p>

<p><strong>D</strong>espite a gaining momentum for extending marriage rights to same-sex couples nationwide, tension still exists in the evolutionary struggle for LGBTQ anti-discrimination across the country. It may well be too optimistic to believe that the movement's remaining goals would be obtained much more easily once we have met a critical escalation favoring marriage equality&#8212;from <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">US v. Windsor </a>to most of the ensuring marriage cases. As the recent events in Indiana and Arkansas have shown, we, at the national level, are still in a ruminating period over the equal rights of sexual minorities. And even after a potentially favorable result for marriage equality from this US Supreme Court's term, we will still be grappling with opposition at some degree. </p>

<p>In the recent events in Indiana, proponents of Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) argued that it needed passage because an individual's right to exercise religious beliefs was being curtailed by constitutional guarantees of equality and non-discrimination. These RFRA proponents would advocate that the right to exercise religious beliefs that also encompass views against homosexuality is being curtailed in some way because the behavior that demonstrates such religious views could also amount to acts of discrimination. In this way, proponents of such laws would say that their rights to religious freedom are not protected as strongly and in some ways are even being eroded by the progress in sexual minority rights.  </p>

<p>Although laws such as the federal and state RFRAs exist with the intent to protect religious freedom, the Indiana RFRA was specifically criticized by opponents for several ways in which it differed from the other RFRAs at the state and federal levels. As it was originally passed, Indiana's law explicitly permitted the use of religion as a potential basis for discriminating against people of certain groups. First, Indiana's law specifically recognized that a for-profit business has the right to free exercise of religion in the same way that individuals and religious organizations do. And in addition, the Indiana law allowed a for-profit business to assert this right as a defense if someone claims discrimination in a private lawsuit. Opponents argued that these features in the law would essentially allow discrimination against sexual minorities from accessing services and goods under the guise of religious belief.    </p>

<p>The religious freedom argument is a meaningful one. What happened in Indiana cannot be seen as an isolated event, but must be placed within the context of the LGBTQ movement and the successes post-<span class="casename">Windsor</span> and post <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5322529599500468186">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a>. Whether the concern for religious freedom is genuine enough to prompt reactionary laws that wholeheartedly would condone discriminatory practices or whether religious freedom was rather hijacked as a way to defend discrimination, the observation remains that the subordination of LGBTQ rights is antithetical to equality principles.            </p>

<p>The federal RFRA, signed into law by former President Clinton in 1993, had its impetus in a 1990 US Supreme Court case (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10098593029363815472">Employment Division v. Smith</a>) that changed the understanding of what kind of governmental interest that the government needed to show in a lawsuit where someone would challenge a law that substantially burdened the exercise of religion under the<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment"> First Amendment</a>. In <span class="casename">Employment Division</span>, the Supreme Court ruled that the government did not need to show a compelling governmental interest to justify why the law could burden free exercise of rights if the burden was just an incidental effect of applying a generally applicable law not directed specifically toward religious practices. This ruling would have the effect of lowering the previous standard in violations of First Amendment religious freedom. As a reaction to the ruling, Congress enacted the federal RFRA to restore the compelling government interest standard even if religion is substantially burdened by a neutral, generally applicable law. The states began to enact their own RFRAs after 1997 when the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8746804851760570747">City of Boerne v. Flores</a> that Congress overstepped its bounds when it had originally imposed the federal RFRA on the states. Some states subsequently enacted their own RFRAs to preserve the requirement of compelling governmental interest.  </p>

<p>On the whole, the directed use of religious liberty against equality for sexual minorities is what I see as the next challenge facing the LGBT movement after marriage equality. If marriage equality reaches an eventual success in the law, the movement's next phase will be to leverage for broader anti-discrimination protections for sexual minorities that are on-par with the high-level protections afforded other traits under the Constitution. Whether that will be accomplished through enacting federal anti-discrimination legislation specifically protecting sexual orientation or amending current federal anti-discrimination remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Presently in order for the law to give such high protections to sexual orientation and gender identity, the clearest path to accomplish this goal is through the marriage equality cases&#8212;that is if courts that are willing to side with same-sex couples also find that sexual orientation is worthy of heightened constitutional protection. In doing so, these marriage cases need to render sexual orientation as a trait that is immutable. But only of a few cases from the majority of pro-marriage equality cases post-<span class="casename">Windsor</span> have also given sexual orientation this heightened protection. Most of the pro-marriage equality cases post-<span class="casename">Windsor</span> have left this issue untouched.   </p>

<p>When these cases have given sexual orientation heightened protection, they have claimed that sexual orientation is an immutable trait by redefining immutability from something that is rooted in biology to a broader definition that encompasses both biological and constructivist views. These courts have considered sexual orientation as something immutable because sexual identity is so fundamental to a person's identity that the law ought not to force someone to change it. In other words, whether one's sexual identity has been both biologically affixed and/or informed by a person's choice, these courts recognize that sexual identity is so basic to a person's humanity and dignity that the law should not interfere with it.  </p>

<p>What this means is that to protect sexual orientation on the highest level from discrimination, the law must preserve individual autonomy for people to be who they are and not condone discriminatory acts that would diminish this autonomy. For instance, a law that banned the employment of homosexual individuals from governmental employment would have the effect of abridging someone's autonomy based on a particular sexual orientation. A gay person who gets a governmental job would have to hide his or her sexual orientation out fear of being fired, which diminishes personal autonomy.  </p>

<p>The exercise of religious liberties is another form of individual autonomy. In the history behind RFRAs and in the recent <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> decision, we have seen high regard for religious liberties under the law. I think that once we are beyond the same-sex marriage debate, there will be a more prominent clash between the Constitution's evolving regard for individual autonomy in the realm of sexual identity (and more broadly, identity politics) and the Constitution's established regard for autonomy in free exercise of religion. Amongst others, there are two large ways in which this will be handled&#8212;one, in the kinds of vicious squabbling we see from incidents such as the Indiana RFRA, and secondly, in the broader constitutional debates that take place in the judiciary that allow the tension between these two autonomies to play itself out.                        </p>

<p>In essence, the movements supporting and opposing LGBTQ rights have distilled the debate into a dialogue between autonomy versus anti-discrimination&#8212;or respectively constitutional liberty and equality. Through events such as those over the Indiana RFRA, it is becoming clearer and clearer that a need exists for a federal anti-discrimination law or policy that protects sexual minorities. Although <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21/subchapter-VI">Title VII</a> covers sex and gender discrimination, it does not specifically cover sexual orientation discrimination. Additionally, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_Non-Discrimination_Act">Employment Non-Discrimination Act</a>, which was designed to protect sexual minorities against employment discrimination based on orientation, has not been enacted, despite Senate passage. The victories in marriage equality cases have succeeded in extending the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples in ways that are equally distributed to opposite-sex couples. Yet very few of these recent federal cases have been clear that in addition to having this fundamental right, sexual minorities should also be protected from discrimination at the highest levels under the Constitution. Having the right to marry someone of the same sex and having the highest protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation are two different legal concepts that are sometimes related and sometimes not. Thus, having an anti-discrimination law that clearly protects sexual orientation and identity on the same levels that the Constitution protects traits such as race or gender would be very helpful in clarifying the issue of sexual orientation discrimination.  </p>

<p>One of the consolidated marriage equality cases (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13439559698908929552">Obergefell v. Hodges</a>) that will be heard by the US Supreme Court this spring did address the heightened protections for sexual orientation head-on in the lower courts. It will be interesting to see whether the Supreme Court will address it when it decides the marriage equality cases in June. Certainly, in light of Indiana's RFRA, momentum exists to resolve this issue.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://camlaw.rutgers.edu/directory/1021/">Kimberly Mutcherson</a> of Rutgers School of Law-Camden, discusses the controversy over whether there should or must be a constitutional right allowing the terminally-ill to engage in physician assisted deaths ...</p><strong>"D</strong>espite decades of agitation, public education, lobbying and sporadic media attention, the right for a terminally-ill person to die by her own hand with the assistance of a physician remains elusive in the vast majority of the US. In 1997 <a href="/thisday/2013/01/supreme-court-upheld-oregon-assisted-suicide-law.php">Oregon</a> became the first state in the country to enact legislation making it legal for adults to consent to ending their own lives with the assistance of a physician. Since that time, only four other states, <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/18/113/05289">Vermont</a>, <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=70.245&full=true">Washington</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/14/us/new-mexico-judge-affirms-right-to-aid-in-dying.html?_r=1">New Mexico</a> and <a href="https://www.compassionandchoices.org/userfiles/Montana-Supreme-Court-Opinion.pdf">Montana</a> [PDF], have followed Oregon's lead by statute or case law. In the rest of the country, a right for terminally-ill patients to receive assistance in dying is not legally protected and providing such assistance can lead to criminal prosecution. </p>

<p>Public interest in the issue of choices-in-dying waxes and wanes, but hit a recent high when <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/07/opinion/maynard-assisted-suicide-cancer-dignity/index.html">Brittany Maynard</a>, a 29 year old woman dying from brain cancer, announced that she was moving from her home in California to Oregon so that she could avail herself of what for her were the benefits of the <a href="http://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Pages/ors.aspx">Oregon Death with Dignity Act</a>. In the months between deciding that she wanted the option of taking her own life and the day that she ingested the medication that killed her, Maynard engaged in a media blitz with the assistance of <a href="https://www.compassionandchoices.org/">Compassion & Choices</a>, an organization committed to securing the right to aid in dying for all. Maynard's message spread around the country and sparked renewed interest in the controversial question of whether a state should or, as a matter of constitution law, must allow terminally-ill people to end their lives when it is their choice to do so.</p>

<p>Despite passionate advocates, laws that grant physicians and patients the latitude to arrange for a patient to self-ingest life ending medications are unpopular in state legislatures. Maynard's home state of California has been considering such a bill in the wake of her death. That bill, the <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB128">End of Life Option Act</a>, is presently winding its way through the <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml;jsessionid=74766d148308052b902207d57c81">California Senate</a>. If enacted, the act would allow physicians to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally-ill patient. The bill's safeguards are many, starting with the requirements that the qualified individual has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and that she is an adult who is competent to make a decision about ending her life. Terminal illness means the individual must be six months away from death&#8212;a diagnosis that a consulting physician must confirm. Thus the right to assistance in dying would not extend to individuals based solely on age or a condition of disability. The ability to get a prescription under the bill also requires competence meaning that "the individual has the ability to make and communicate an informed decision to health care providers. ..." Individuals with a diagnosis of depression or another psychiatric or psychological disorder that interfered with the ability to make an informed decision would not be eligible for a prescription. </p>

<p>Under the act, no person could be forced to participate in an assisted suicide arrangement, and a request for a prescription could not be made under the authority of a power of attorney, health care proxy or by a conservator. To receive the prescription, the qualified individual would need to make two oral requests at least 15 days apart as well as a written request to the attending physician. The written request must be signed by two witnesses, only one of whom can be related to the qualified individual by blood, marriage or adoption or be entitled to recover a portion of the qualified individual's estate. Similarly, only one of those two crucial witnesses can be an owner, operator or employee at a health facility where the qualified individual resides or is receiving her medical treatment. On multiple occasions the physician providing the medicine is required to determine that all of the bill's requirements are met. This includes attempting to ensure the voluntariness of the qualified individual's request by asking, outside of the presence of others, whether the individual is being coerced into requesting the medication and offering the individual multiple opportunities to change her mind about receiving the medication. </p>

<p>Other parts of the bill invalidate contractual provisions or portions of a will that would affect a request for aid in dying medication. Insurance companies are forbidden from taking actions that could encourage individuals to seek their own deaths by requesting aid-in-dying medication. Altering or forging a request or concealing or destroying a rescission of a request is a felony as is coercing or exerting undue influence on an individual to request assistance in dying.</p>

<p>Just as the qualifying individual's participation must be voluntary, so must the physician's participation be voluntary. Therefore, no one is bound to prescribe medication to a patient who wants to end her own life. Similarly healthcare employers may prohibit their employees from participating in aid-in-dying activities while on the premises of their employer or when conducting the employer's business. Finally, the bill requires that the state public health officer review a sample of records on an annual basis and create reporting requirements for physicians, so as to set forth a basis for providing an annual compliance report to the public. </p>

<p>Given the safeguards built into these bills, advocates could plausibly argue that the web of procedure is sufficiently daunting so as to make it unduly burdensome for a terminally-ill patient to avail herself of the bill's protections. Lengthy and daunting process notwithstanding, opponents of such bills argue that the safeguards are insufficient. There are profound religion based concerns about assistance in dying such as those expressed by the<a href="http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/assisted-suicide/to-live-each-day/upload/bishops-statement-physician-assisted-suicide-to-live-each-day.pdf"> US Conference of Catholic Bishops</a>[PDF]. Beyond religious concerns about the sanctity of life, many disability right activists fear that the language supporting <a href="http://dredf.org/public-policy/assisted-suicide/assisted-suicide-and-disability/"> right to die bills</a> denigrates and devalues the very productive lives of those living with disabilities. They worry that such laws will expand to focus on people living with disabilities whose quality of life is so often undervalued. From this perspective, creating opportunities for suffering people to end their suffering is not about autonomy and dignity but about "disability discrimination, a profit-oriented health care system and a legal system that does not guarantee the equal protection of the law." And the concerns about physician assisted death do not end with a worry about slippery slopes for no matter how extensive the safeguards in a law, it can never be guaranteed that a person is not subtly coerced into believing that her family and friends would be better off if she would hasten her own dying. We might be especially concerned that this would be the case for elderly patients faced with end of life decisions and terminal illness.</p>

<p>While the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/27/us/is-the-affordable-care-act-working.html#/">Affordable Care Act</a> has made the healthcare landscape much less uneven and unfair than it was in the past, it is not clear that healthcare reform has contributed to an expansion of access to high-quality end-of-life care for those who want it. The costs associated with hospice can be significant from round-the-clock home health aides, to expensive equipment, to lost productivity for family members. Our healthcare reimbursement system does not always make adequate provision to support this expensive and resource intensive care that a dying person might require. Further, there is no consistent oversight of home hospice workers, both for their own benefit or the benefit of their patients, so the quality of care can be sporadic, assuming that a family can even afford such care. In a setting in which the government cannot or does not support those who want to live as well as possible until the time that they die, it is no surprise that people are suspicious of state efforts to make that dying quicker and more convenient.<br />
 <br />
In 1997 in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-110.ZS.html">Washington v. Glucksberg</a>, the US Supreme Court held that Washington state's prohibition on assisted suicide did not violate the<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process"> Due Process Clause</a> of the US Constitution and that the Constitution did not contain a fundamental right to die. The court pointed out that states had a long history of refusing to find that any individual ever had an interest in dying sufficient enough to overcome the state's interests in preserving life. As the medical apparatus that can extend life grows ever more effective, there will continue to be those individuals for whom it is not enough to say "no" to more treatment, but who seek to be more proactive in bringing about their own end on their own terms. No doubt, the autonomy and dignity concerns inherent in a discussion of assisted suicide are worthy of respect. Though laws that allow for assistance in dying are a controversial and complex mechanism that must be vigorously monitored, they are one of many tools that some dying patients want as they contemplate both how and when they will move beyond their dying bodies.</p>

		<title>Aaron Hernandez, OJ Simpson and the Evolution of Justice for the NFL?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.cuhk.edu.hk/people/gordon-gregory.php">Gregory S. Gordon</a>, of <a href="http://www.law.cuhk.edu.hk">the Chinese University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law</a>, discusses the similarities and differences between the Aaron Hernandez and OJ Simpson trials and the potential implications for future criminal cases ... </p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n April 15, 2015, former NFL star Aaron Hernandez <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16204501431515507205">was found guilty</a> of first-degree murder for the slaying of Odin Lloyd. The conviction has been widely covered in the press. Those media pieces have focused on a variety of themes, including Hernandez's unsavory connections to Bristol, Connecticut, his kid-gloves treatment by the Florida Gators football program, his unclear motive for killing Lloyd and his slim chances on appeal. But, much to my surprise, none of the coverage to date has drawn a parallel between the Hernandez proceeding and a similar one that was taking place exactly 20 years ago at this time&#8212;the high-profile murder trial of OJ Simpson. Thinking about the two trials, a number of questions arise. Besides the superficial football player connection, are there deeper parallels between them? Has anything changed in 20 years? And what, if anything, do the two trials, as well as the intervening 20 years, tell us about the relationship between the American criminal justice system and those who play for the NFL? </p>

<p>In the first place, there are numerous striking parallels between the two defendants and their cases. Both men were charged with first-degree murder&#8212;Simpson for stabbing his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman and Hernandez for shooting Lloyd numerous times at point-blank range. Each man came from a rough neighborhood and then played for elite college football programs that won the national championship with significant contributions from them (Hernandez for the University of Florida in the 2008-09 season and Simpson for the University of Southern California in the 1967-68 season). Both were local sports heroes in the region where the murders occurred. Owing to their athletic prowess and resultant celebrity, both had gotten away with violent, anti-social behavior for years before the murder charges (Hernandez having assaulted and shot both strangers and friends&#8212;which will lead to subsequent legal proceedings &#8212; and Simpson having beaten up his wife). At the time of the murders in question, both were living in mansions, located not far from the crime scenes, which became the object of extensive searches that yielded important clues. And both could dig into deep pockets to engage teams of super-lawyers.  </p>

<p>In each case, those lawyers dissected every piece of evidence and investigative technique and put them under the microscope. Both cases revealed police missteps along the way and involved evidence that was seemingly disposed of by or at the direction of the defendants. No murder weapon was found in either case. And the respective prosecution teams had to rely on large quantities of forensic and circumstantial evidence. But both legal teams were successful at excluding potentially crucial incriminating evidence&#8212;Odin Lloyd's pre-murder texts to his sister referencing Hernandez, for example, and Nicole Brown's diary detailing Simpson's pattern of domestic violence. And, in relation to each proceeding, an army of television legal analysts waxed gloomy about the prosecution's prospects.  </p>

<p>But that is perhaps where the important parallels end. Each murder trial yielded an entirely different result. Simpson, although several years removed from his NFL glory years, was acquitted, while Hernandez, who had recently played in a Super Bowl, was convicted. It is tempting to think that the contrasting denouements are due strictly to certain granular fact variations in each case. And that, along with OJ's "race card" and jury composition, is what accounts for one man's liberty (though temporary, as it turned out) and the other's lifetime incarceration. But the different outcomes may relate to another phenomenon, not as immediately apparent&#8212;the public's changing perception of the NFL.</p>

<p>Granted, that changed perception may not be immediately apparent. Last year, Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice was caught on video dragging his unconscious fiancée out of an elevator after knocking her out with a vicious punch. The Ravens immediately came to his defense, aggravated assault charges were dismissed in exchange for pre-trial diversion and Rice was only suspended for two games by the NFL. Although a subsequent video showing the actual punch got Rice fired and banned from the NFL, he has since been reinstated. Then the public learned that in supposedly disciplining his four-year-old son, running back Adrian Peterson viciously beat him with a tree branch all over his body, including his genitals. He was allowed to plead no contest to misdemeanor charges with no prison time and has been reinstated after a suspension. And last month, retired player Darren Sharper, who had been convicted of raping nine women and sentenced to various prison terms in three states, was allowed to plead guilty to similar charges in Louisiana and wrap his other sentences into a global 20-year concurrent prison sentence. A paltry punishment for a multi-jurisdictional serial rapist!  </p>

<p>So what, then, does the Aaron Hernandez conviction tell us? That is not entirely clear. On one hand, in light of the Rice, Peterson and Sharper cases, it may just be an anomaly. On the other hand, perhaps it augurs a very subtle but important shift. The bloom seems to be coming off the NFL flower. Concussions have taken their toll with many retired players slowly losing their faculties (via dementia, Alzheimer's, depression and chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and some committing suicide. Citing fear of head injuries, San Francisco 49er Chris Borland recently retired from the League after a sterling rookie season. And the League has been sued by former players and, just this week, has settled out of court for approximately $1 billion. </p>

<p>In the meantime, apart from the Rice, Peterson and Sharper cases, NFL player run-ins with the law keep mounting. Also in the past year, Ray McDonald, as a San Francisco 49er, was arrested for felony domestic violence and accused of sexual assault (but never charged) and Greg Hardy, while with the Carolina Panthers, was found guilty in a lower court bench trial of misdemeanor assault (and suspended from the NFL - both players are now with new teams).    In raw numbers, from 2010 to 2014, the NFL had the highest number of players arrested of all the major American sports. In 2013, the year Hernandez was arrested for Lloyd's murder, NFL off-season arrest rates spiked 75% in comparison to the previous year, and from 2008 through<a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/nfl/arrests-database/"> 2013</a>, they went up 61%. Some now jokingly refer to US professional football as the National Felons League. Perhaps America's love affair with the sport is starting to sour.</p>

<p>So is it possible the Hernandez conviction represents a tipping point instead of an aberration? We cannot yet know how posterity will view its significance within the overarching narrative of the NFL and the American criminal justice system. But a first-degree murder trial, with its high stakes and drama, potentially offers telling insights into the public's perception of the killer's milieu. In 1995, citizens seemed to hold the NFL in higher regard and that might have contributed to OJ Simpson's acquittal. In 2015, a less rosy view might have factored into Aaron Hernandez's conviction. The tide may very well have shifted. As Hernandez and his henchmen were driving Lloyd to his doom, he texted his sister that he was with "NFL." Given the larger context of his murder within the relationship between American professional football and criminal justice, his unwitting use of that metonym might ultimately prove prophetic. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.ubalt.edu/faculty/profiles/bessler.cfm">John D. Bessler</a>, of the <a href="http://law.ubalt.edu/">University of Baltimore School of Law</a>, discusses new changes in the evolution of capital punishment...</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>ncreasingly, US death penalty states are no longer content to have just one method of execution on the books. Instead, with a persistent shortage of lethal injection drugs, fueled in part by the  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/americas-lethal-injection-drug-crisis-starts-in-europe-2014-2">European Union's ban on their export</a>, American states are putting in place "back-up" methods of execution.</p>

<p>In 2014, a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/us/tennessee-executions/">Tennessee law</a> took effect permitting the use of the electric chair if lethal injection drugs are unavailable. On March 23, 2015, Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/utah-firing-squad-116347.html">signed a bill</a> authorizing the use of firing squads if lethal injection drugs can't be procured. And on April 17, 2015, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/oklahoma-passes-nitrogen-gas-execution-bill.php">signed into law</a> a bill allowing for the use of nitrogen gas if the US Supreme Court rules the state's lethal injection protocol unconstitutional. </p>

<p>In the last decade American executions were put on hold for a short time in the lead up to the US Supreme Court's decision in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-5439.ZS.html">Baze v. Rees</a>, an Eighth Amendment challenge to Kentucky's three-drug lethal injection protocol. Executions are now <a href="http://www.annistonstar.com/news/alabama-executions-on-hold-until-u-s-supreme-court-decision/article_85399f3a-ce67-11e4-93fe-27ec61134f53.html">on hold</a> again in some states while the Supreme Court considers <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/glossip-v-gross/">Glossip v. Gross</a>&#8212;a challenge to Oklahoma's three-drug lethal injection protocol.</p>

<p>The US Constitution's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> contains just sixteen words: "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. "At the heart of challenges to capital punishment&#8212;and to methods of execution in particular&#8212;has been the meaning of the Eighth Amendment's last six words, popularly known as the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.</p>

<p>In a prior book, <em>Cruel and Unusual:The American Death Penalty and the Founders' Eighth Amendment</em>, I detailed the Eighth Amendment's history. What I found: the Founding Fathers were not all that gung-ho about capital punishment. In fact they rejected England's <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/candp/punishment/g06/g06cs1.htm">"Bloody Code"</a>, embraced Enlightenment-era writings and were fascinated by the potential of the penitentiary system to eliminate harsh punishments.  </p>

<p>Thus far legal challenges to methods of executions have not fared well before the nation's highest court. In <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/utah/supreme-court/1959/8930-0.html">Wilkerson v. Utah</a>, the US Supreme Court approved the use of public firing squads. In <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=136&invol=436">In re Kemmler</a>, the Supreme Court gave its approval to electrocution, a then-novel method. And in another ruling decades later, in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/329/459">Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber</a>, the Court found yet another electrocution constitutional even though an earlier attempt had been botched that failed to kill the same inmate in the electric chair.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's 2008 ruling in <span class="casename">Baze</span>&#8212;upholding the constitutionality of Kentucky's lethal injection protocol&#8212;was only the most recent rejection of an Eighth Amendment challenge to a mode of execution. In that case the Court found no constitutional violation as regards the administration of a deadly cocktail of drugs: sodium thiopental, an anesthetic to cause unconsciousness; pancuronium bromide, a muscle relaxant to paralyze the inmate's diaphragm and lungs; and potassium chloride, to induce a cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>Now the State of Oklahoma&#8212;with its own lethal injection protocol under scrutiny following the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/13/botched-oklahoma-execution-clayton-lockett-bloody-mess">botched execution of Clayton Lockett</a>&#8212;has authorized nitrogen gas as a new method of execution. Designed to asphyxiate condemned inmates by forcing them to breathe pure nitrogen through a gas mask, death by nitrogen is just the newest in a long line of execution methods stretching back to the Dark Ages. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/17/us/oklahoma-executions/">According to </a> Representative Mike Christian, one of the Oklahoma bill's authors, the new method&#8212;put in place in case the state's lethal-injection protocol is struck down&#8212;is designed to ensure "a humane, quick and painless death." "The person will become unconscious within eight to ten seconds," Representative Christian explains, saying that death will ensue "a few minutes later."</p>

<p>But what sentiments like these ignore is that whatever the method of execution--hanging, firing squad, electric chair, lethal gas or lethal injection--the end result is exactly the same: the inmate's death. In their desperate search for a Plan B to lethal injections, states like Tennessee, Utah and Oklahoma are only changing the means to kill an inmate, not altering the ultimate outcome. Ironically, in cases like <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2001/2001_01_309">Hope v. Pelzer</a> and <a href="https://casetext.com/case/jackson-v-bishop">Jackson v. Bishop</a>, non-lethal corporal punishments have already been found to be "cruel and unusual punishments." </p>

<p>In the founding era, American lawmakers were greatly influenced by a now-obscure Italian philosopher, Cesare Beccaria of Milan.  At age twenty-six, Beccaria published <em>Dei delitti e delle pene</em>, translated into English in 1767 as <a href="http://www.constitution.org/cb/crim_pun.htm">On Crimes and Punishments</a>. That book called for proportionality between crimes and punishments and argued for the abolition of torture and capital punishment. Among its core principles, ones embraced by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Americans: the certainty of punishment is more important than its severity and any punishment that goes beyond "absolutely necessity" is "cruel" and "tyrannical."</p>

<p>History reveals that American revolutionaries like Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and Dr. Benjamin Rush were looking for ways to make punishments less cruel&#8212;and the society's laws less sanguinary. Jefferson and Madison sought to drastically curtail the number of capital offenses in Virginia and Dr. Benjamin Rush&#8212;a signer of the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html">Declaration of Independence</a>&#8212;sought to eliminate the death penalty entirely, calling death "an improper punishment for any crime." William Bradford&#8212;one of Madison's closest friends and Pennsylvania's and then the country's attorney general&#8212;wrote a whole report titled <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/844385?uid=3739864&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21106648829513"><em>An Enquiry How Far the Punishment of Death Is Necessary in Pennsylvania</em></a> (1793).</p>

<p>For America's founders, the necessity for a punishment was key. Indeed, James Madison&#8212;in his own words&#8212;was attracted to "penitentiary discipline" as a substitute for what he called "the cruel inflictions so disgraceful to penal codes." In responding to a letter from a Kentucky physician, Madison wrote: "I should not regret a fair and full trial of the entire abolition of capital punishment by any State willing to make it." Toward the end of his life, Jefferson&#8212;a longtime reader of <em>On Crimes and Punishments</em>, having copied more than two dozen passages from it into his commonplace book&#8212;penned these words in the 1820s: "Beccaria and other writers on crimes and punishments had satisfied the reasonable world of the unrightfulness and inefficacy of the punishment of crimes by death."</p>

<p>A return to a core principle that any punishment that goes beyond "absolute necessity" is "cruel" and "tyrannical"&#8212;a notion embraced by Beccaria, Montesquieu and America's founders themselves&#8212;leads to the inexorable conclusion that the death penalty is no longer necessary. In 21st-century America, in our own age and time, the reality is this: life-without-parole (LWOP) sentences and maximum-security prisons are now readily available as a substitute for state-sanctioned executions.  </p>

<p>By authorizing death by nitrogen gas, the State of Oklahoma&#8212;like other states trying to cling to the use of executions&#8212;has only doubled-down on a barbaric and antiquated, not to mention increasingly rare, practice. The number of murderers serving LWOP sentences now far eclipses the number of American death row inmates, and today's death penalty has a lot more to do with geography, race and the quality of one's counsel than with the nature of the crime. No California death row inmate has been executed <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/5821">in years</a>, with a federal judge in that state having declared the death penalty unconstitutional, though it's a different story, of course, in places like Texas.</p>

<p>A recent study found that death sentences are heavily concentrated in a tiny fraction of the country's counties. According to Robert J. Smith, a DePaul University law professor, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/6121">one percent of US counties</a> account for roughly forty-four percent of all of the country's death sentences. The Death Penalty Information Center's 2013 report, <a href="http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/TwoPercentReport.pdf">The 2% Death Penalty</a>, similarly found that more than half of all US executions are coming out of just two percent of the nation's counties. That is hardly "Equal Justice Under Law."</p>

<p>In fact, capital punishment has long been administered in a racially discriminatory and arbitrary manner. The race of the victim still often determines who lives and who dies, and death sentences&#8212;the product of death-qualified juries, in which death penalty opponents are systematically excluded from service&#8212;are being imposed in as arbitrary a manner as they were before death penalty laws were struck down in <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1971/1971_69_5003/">Furman v. Georgia</a>. With the rise and increasing use of LWOP sentences, the sporadic use of executions by a handful of mostly southern locales should no longer be tolerated by the US Supreme Court.</p>

<p>No matter the method of killing&#8212;no matter the number of methods of execution&#8212;the death penalty's madness, with its ever-present potential to claim the lives of the wrongfully convicted, seems as clear as ever. Executions are not needed to ensure the public's safety; the incarceration of violent offenders in Supermax prisons can achieve that objective.  </p>

<p>As for the Eighth Amendment itself, it is regularly read by the US Supreme Court to protect prisoners from harm, including non-lethal harms. The Eighth Amendment, in fact, can never be read in a principled manner until the death penalty goes the way of the pillory and the whipping post and is declared unconstitutional. </p>

<p>Until that day comes, hopefully sooner rather than later, the US Supreme Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence will continue to have a split personality, just like the character in Robert Louis Stevenson's novella, <em>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em>.</p>

		<title>Bankruptcy Courts Are No Longer Courts of Equity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Harrison Thorne of <a href="http://www.law.ucla.edu">UCLA School of Law </a>discusses the role of bankruptcy courts in equity... </j:header><strong>B</strong>ankruptcy law, embodied in Title 11 of the United States Code (also known as "the Bankruptcy Code"), strives to balance the rights of creditors to receive payment for what they are owed with the rights of debtors to receive a fresh start. While bankruptcy laws have changed over time, the role of the bankruptcy court is to promote justice while following the letter of the law.</p>

<p>The Bankruptcy Code contains many specific provisions detailing the process, procedure and rules for parties to a bankruptcy case. One provision, 11 USC &#167; 522, allows a debtor to exempt certain property from the bankruptcy estate. When a debtor exempts property, the debtor may keep the property even though the property would otherwise be liquidated and distributed to creditors under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In essence, this provision allows a debtor to keep certain possessions during and after he files bankruptcy, subject to exceptions. </p>

<p>Suppose John has more debt than he can pay and files bankruptcy under Chapter 7. Upon filing of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, a trustee is appointed to administer the bankruptcy estate and to liquidate the debtor's non-exempt assets. The trustee discovers that John owns a home worth $500,000 and accordingly attempts to sell John's home to distribute the sale proceeds to John's creditors. </p>

<p>Under &#167; 522(d)(1), John may exempt $20,200 of his home's value from the bankruptcy estate. Suppose John's home is encumbered by a secured note in favor of a bank in the amount of $485,000. The value of the note ($485,000) plus the value of the exemption ($20,200) means that John's home (worth $500,000) will not yield any surplus that the trustee could provide to John's creditors, as the home is "encumbered" in the amount of $505,200. If the trustee sold John's home, he would have to pay the secured lienholder and return the exempt value to John, which would leave nothing for the trustee to distribute to creditors. Thus, the trustee would not sell John's home but rather would abandon the estate's interest in it, allowing John to retain his home after the bankruptcy case closes. </p>

<p>As John's example demonstrates, many debtors invoke exemption in their bankruptcy cases and retain property that would otherwise be liquidated or distributed to creditors. However, many debtors engage in bad faith or misconduct in hopes of saving their homes. For example, a debtor may intentionally undervalue his home or overstate the allowed exemption in his bankruptcy schedules to entice the trustee to abandon the estate's interest in their home. </p>

<p>Bad faith raises serious issues for bankruptcy judges. On one hand, the bankruptcy code allows a debtor to exempt value in his home. On the other hand, bankruptcy judges are reluctant to allow debtors to exempt value and save his home if the debtor made a fraudulent representation or intentionally misled the court or trustee. Accordingly, judges have invoked their equitably authority pursuant to &#167; 105 to deal with this problem. Section 105 states that <blockquote>"no provision of [the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/105">bankruptcy code</a>] . . . shall be construed to preclude the court from, sua sponte, taking any action or making any determination necessary or appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules, or to prevent an abuse of process".</blockquote></p>

<p>In essence, when a court prohibits exemption under its &#167; 105 authority, the court is reasoning that although the debtor has the codified right to exemption, the court will not allow exemption because to do so would constitute an abuse of process. However, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9275570847605707999">Law v. Siegel</a>, the Supreme Court held that &#167; 105 could no longer be used in this manner.</p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Law v. Siegel</span>, a debtor filed bankruptcy under Chapter 7. The debtor's only significant asset was his home, which had a value of $363,348. The debtor asserted that his home was subject to a lien in favor of Washington Mutual Bank in the amount of $147,156.52 and another lien in favor of Lin's Mortgage & Associates in the amount of $159,929.04. The debtor also claimed that $75,000 of the home's value was covered under <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=ccp&group=00001-01000&file=704.710-704.850">California's homestead exemption</a>. The debtor asserted that the trustee should abandon the estate's interest in his home as there was no equity and a sale would yield nothing to be distributed to his creditors. </p>

<p>The trustee did not believe the debtor and subsequently initiated an adversary proceeding alleging that the lien in favor of Lin's Mortgage & Associates was fraudulent. The trustee investigated the lien and expended more than $500,000 in attorney's fees overcoming the debtor's fraudulent misrepresentations. The trustee was correct that Lin's Mortgage & Associates' lien was fraudulent. Accordingly, the Bankruptcy Court determined that the trustee could surcharge the entirety of the debtor's $75,000 exemption&#8212;effectively preventing the exemption. Upon review, the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's holding. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine whether disallowing the debtor's exemption was permissible.</p>

<p>Writing for the court, Justice Scalia noted that while bankruptcy courts possess power under &#167; 105 to sanction abusive litigation practices, it may not use its power to contravene specific statutory provisions. In other words, where the Bankruptcy Code permits something&#8212;such as exemption&#8212;a court may not prohibit it based on a finding of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith. Accordingly, when the Bankruptcy Court authorized the trustee to surcharge the debtor's exemption, it contravened &#167; 522, which entitles debtors to exempt value in his home from the bankruptcy estate. Thus, the court reversed the Bankruptcy Court's decision and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the court's ruling.</p>

<p><span class="casename">Siegel</span>'s prohibition on contravening a specific provision in the bankruptcy code makes sense from a statutory construction point of view. When a statute gives a debtor the right to take some action, then any judicial ruling contravening the debtor's right is in conflict with the law. However, <span class="casename">Siegel</span> makes less sense from a policy perspective. Bankruptcy courts are guided by the Bankruptcy Code. However, bankruptcy courts' main role is to promote justice and reach equitable results. Indeed, bankruptcy courts are courts of equity that arose to prevent unfair practices, including debtors' prisons and harsh treatments preventing debtors from obtaining a fresh start. While the Supreme Court conceded in <span class="casename">Siegel</span> that in some circumstances a bankruptcy court may be authorized to dispense with futile procedural niceties in order to reach more expeditiously an end result required by the [Bankruptcy] Code," the court noted that "equitable consideration [may not] permit a bankruptcy court to contravene express provisions of the [bankruptcy] code."</p>

<p>To square the canons of statutory construction with the equitable policy of bankruptcy law in general, Congress must specifically enumerate remedies that a bankruptcy court may issue upon a finding of fraud, misrepresentation and other acts of bad faith. For example, if there were a provision specifically allowing a bankruptcy court to deny exemption to a debtor upon a finding of fraudulent misrepresentation, courts would be able to prevent a windfall to a debtor. Indeed, the bankruptcy court in the <span class="casename">Siegel</span> proceeding below would have been able to reach the same result without being overturned above. </p>

		<title>Everyone Benefits From Religious Liberty Protections</title>

                <p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.alliancealert.org/2010/03/01/about-jordan-lorence/">Jordan Lorence</a> of <a href="http://www.alliancedefendingfreedom.org">Alliance Defending Freedom </a>discusses the benefits of religious freedom to liberty protections ... </p>

                <p><strong>L</strong>istening carefully to objections to state religious freedom laws, two assumptions emerge that are demonstratively false. Those who assert them should weigh their implications carefully and reconsider their opposition to these laws.</p>

                <p>The first wrong assumption is that those who oppose religious freedom laws never have conscientious objections to coercive governmental requirements like conservatives do, because they assume government never misuses its power in a way that would create a conflict of conscience for them. The second wrong assumption is that only conservative religious business owners refuse to serve selected customers&#8212;that liberal business owners always serve everyone and never have a conscientious conflict with what a customer asks the owner to do.</p>

                <p>These religious liberty laws respond to the reality that government asserts itself through coercion of people. Most of the time, citizens have little disagreement with the government forcing people to do certain things or refrain from other behaviors. For example, we all benefit when the police pull over speeders, drunk drivers or those running red lights. But the government can sometimes use its power to compel people to do things that violate their beliefs. Right now, those who oppose the legislation to protect religious liberty in North Carolina and other states fail to remember these laws protect everyone's individual beliefs and that one day the government could order them to do something that violates their beliefs and they will be glad that the religious freedom law offers them a defense to protect them from government coercion.</p>

                <p>And yes, those who consider themselves liberal need protection from government actions forcing them to violate their beliefs too. For example, in the 1960's many who opposed the Vietnam War did so because of their pacifist religious beliefs that fighting in a war dishonors God's creation of human beings in His image. The pacifists therefore had a massive conflict of conscience with military draft laws. Congress could have forced the pacifists to serve in the military, but instead Congress passed laws exempting the pacifists from the draft. Congress viewed protecting the pacifists' right of conscience as so important that it was willing to exempt them, even though it meant that others would have to go to fight in their stead.</p>

                <p>Also during this time, a Memphis <a href="http://openjurist.org/465/f2d/797/spence-v-h-bailey">high school (Tennessee) required all students to take a ROTC course</a> in order to graduate. One student, a religious pacifist, objected to taking the ROTC class. Rather than granting him an exemption, school officials said he could not graduate. He filed a <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12508319961364315152">lawsuit</a>, and the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that the high school had to allow him to graduate without taking the class. The court ruled in his favor by using the same four-part religious liberty test that is expected to be part of North Carolina's proposed religious freedom law.</p>

                <p>In October 2011 Eastern Michigan University (EMU) <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2227986688944699949">argued</a> in court that it had no legal obligation to accommodate the religious convictions of its graduate students. It claimed it could force them to perform any assignment the school deemed necessary and could expel the students if they declined on conscience grounds not to perform the assignment.</p>

                <p>Judge Jeffrey Sutton, one of three judges on a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that heard the case, pointed out that he has had law clerks who object on religious grounds to the death penalty and have asked him to excuse them from working on any death penalty cases. Sutton accommodates them, even though it means that the other law clerks shoulder a disproportionate load of work in capital cases. During oral argument, Sutton asked EMU's attorney if he thought that he should force the law clerks to work on death penalty cases. Of course, the answer is fairly obvious. Sutton is doing the right thing by accommodating the beliefs of his law clerks who oppose the death penalty.</p>

                <p>Similarly, in March 2015 the American Pharmacists Association <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/APhAResolution.pdf">passed</a> [PDF] a resolution urging its members not to sell to the government the drugs needed for lethal injections to execute convicted murderers. The association said that selling drugs used for executions is "fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as providers of health care." One could imagine a pharmacy board in a state with the death penalty ordering all pharmacists in the state to stock and sell the drugs used in lethal injections or the government would revoke their licenses to dispense drugs. If those pharmacists live in the 20 states with religious freedom laws, they can invoke it as a defense in opposition to the government's retaliation against them for refusing to sell those drugs.</p>

                <p>Sometimes, a customer can create a conflict of conscience for a supporter of same sex marriage, who must, because of his beliefs, deny service to that customer. Antonio Darden runs a hair salon in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Susana Martinez, the Republican governor of New Mexico, used to go to Darden to get her hair styled and dyed. Darden struggled with his beliefs and then finally announced publicly that he could no longer style and dye Martinez's hair because she believes marriage is the union of one man and one woman. Darden, a supporter of same-sex marriage, could not in good conscience style the hair of a woman who opposed his views, so he told the governor to find another stylist.</p>

                <p>Martinez did not sue Darden for discrimination, though she suffered the inconvenience of finding a new hairdresser and changing hair color because Darden would not give her the secret formula for her dye, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/29/antonio-darden-susana-martinez-hairdresser-new-mexico_n_1310219.html">the Huffington Post reported</a>. It also said that wait staff at Santa Fe restaurants were emboldened by Darden's stand on principle and were now prepared to deny service to the governor because of her beliefs on marriage.</p>

                <p>Martinez was right not to sue Darden for what he did. He has a right not to be compelled by the government to violate his beliefs when plenty of other hairdressers will do the governor's hair, despite the inconvenience it has caused her. And all North Carolina's proposed religious freedom law will do, like the similar laws in other states, is to ensure that those who wish to force people of faith to violate their beliefs in the course of doing business don't have the freedom to do so without a compelling reason. None of these laws give an automatic victory to anyone who invokes religion as the basis for their actions; they allow them to make a defense that the court weighs. These laws do not pick winners or losers in advance; they require the government and the religious adherent to work through a four-part test, or filtering system, to separate the good cases from the bad cases, to determine when the government must accommodate the person's religious beliefs, and when the government's interest is so important that it does not have to grant the religious person an exemption from the general requirement.</p>

                <p>Without federal and state religious freedom <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">restoration acts</a>, or similar legal protections, the pacifists in the 1960's likely would have been drafted to fight in Vietnam, the Memphis student may have been forced to attend ROTC training, and Eastern Michigan University probably would have been allowed to violate the faith convictions of its graduate students. But that is far less likely to happen in North Carolina if it joins the 20 other states and the federal government in adopting a religious freedom law.</p>

                <p>The debates over state religious freedom laws has devolved into partisan and ideological warfare. But those who oppose these laws should reconsider viewing "religious liberty" as a stronghold of their opponents that they must destroy in an ideological battle. Religious liberty is not an enclave of one's political enemies. Religious liberty protects every one of us. Because one day, sooner or later, many of us may face government requirements that violate our conscience, and we should all want legal protection on the books that protects our freedom to opt out.</p>

                <p>As societies change and grow, conscientious objections will inevitably conflict with governmental requirements. Religious liberty laws protect us all. We denigrate and destroy them at our peril.</p>

		<title>The Aftermath Of A Leak: What&amp;apos;s Next in the HSBC Suisse Tax Evasion Saga?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsfaculty/profiles.aspx?id=9880">Shu-Yi Oei</a> of <a href="http://www.law.tulane.edu/">Tulane University Law School</a> discusses tax evasion investigations and possible criminal charges against HSBC's Swiss private banking unit...</p><strong>B</strong>eginning around 2006, <a href="http://www.icij.org/project/swiss-leaks/whistleblower-thief-hero-introducing-source-data-shook-hsbc">Herv&#233; Falciani</a>, a computer systems engineer at HSBC's Swiss private banking unit, HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) ("HSBC Suisse"), obtained and extracted a large quantity of client data from HSBC Suisse. Falciani was detained in Geneva in December 2008 before being released and fleeing to France, where the data eventually ended up in the possession of French authorities. Rather than extraditing Falciani, as requested by the Swiss, France instead began to investigate the data. In March 2015, the French Financial Prosecutor's Office recommended that HSBC Suisse face criminal charges for facilitating and encouraging tax evasion. HSBC Suisse has been given a month to respond to the recommendation, after which French Magistrates will decide whether there will be charges and a trial. In April 2015, it was subsequently reported that French Magistrates had also placed HSBC's parent company, HSBC Holdings PLC, under investigation. The exact nature of that investigation is unknown, but it will likely examine the conduct of managers at HSBC Holdings and their responsibility for the actions of HSBC Suisse.</p>

<p>The implications of the Falciani leak are still reverberating and there are many unknown details, including the exact nature and scope of the charges and other legal consequences in both France and other countries. Also unknown at this point is what will happen to Falciani, who was <a href="https://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?lang=en&msg-id=55629">indicted</a> in Switzerland on December 11, 2014, and may be tried there in absentia. What is clear, however, is that the Falciani leak has triggered collateral consequences on an international scale. France has shared the data with the tax authorities of other countries, including reportedly the United States, and some of these countries are investigating HSBC Suisse. The aftermath of the initial leak has been a series of international controversies extending well beyond simply tax evasion.</p>

<p>This commentary makes two broad observations. First, the leak has called into question legal and regulatory decisions made by countries prior to the release of the data as well as decisions made after the data's release that may have failed to take into account the new information. Second, given the increasing public awareness of the leaked data, countries will make future decisions regarding HSBC Suisse, HSBC Holdings and the leaked clients based on the steps other countries decide to take. A decision by one country to aggressively prosecute HSBC Suisse may pressure other countries to follow suit.</p>

<p><strong>Reevaluation of Prior Actions in Light of New Data</strong> </p>

<p>First, as the data has become more widely available and publicly known the prosecutorial and other decisions (including non-tax decisions) made by various countries with respect to the HSBC entities have been called into question. </p>

<p>Here the US case is instructive, though similar dynamics are likely to occur in other countries. In 2012, the US Department of Justice entered into a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/legacy/2012/12/11/dpa-executed.pdf">deferred prosecution agreement</a> (DPA) [PDF] with HSBC Bank USA, NA and HSBC Holdings. That DPA pertained to violations of <a href="http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/bsa/">the Bank Secrecy Act</a>, <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ieepa.pdf">the International Emergency Economic Powers Act</a> [PDF] and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50a/usc_sup_05_50_10_sq1_20_sq1.html">the Trading With the Enemy Act</a>, as well as willful failure to have an effective anti-money-laundering program, willful failure to conduct diligence on foreign correspondent account holders and engagement in prohibited transactions on behalf of customers in countries subject to Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions. </p>

<p>The Department of Justice agreed to defer prosecution of HSBC Bank USA and HSBC Holdings on these charges. In exchange, HSBC Bank USA and HSBC Holdings agreed to undertake heightened anti-money-laundering and compliance obligations, to retain an independent compliance monitor and to restructure leadership and operations. HSBC Bank USA and HSBC Holdings also agreed to forfeit $1.256 billion and to pay another $665 million in civil penalties to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve. </p>

<p>The use of deferred prosecution agreements for banks and corporations has been the subject of significant debate, and critique and scrutiny of the 2012 DPA has been especially heightened in light of the Falciani leak. The overarching question has been whether the United States had access to the Falciani data at the time it entered into the DPA. It has been reported that the United States came into possession of the data in 2010. Loretta Lynch, recently confirmed as Attorney General, <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Lynch%20Follow%20Up%20Responses%202-18-15.pdf">testified</a> [PDF] before the Senate Judiciary Committee that her office had not been provided with the Falciani documents and that she did not recall having reviewed the documents or being aware of them at the time the DPA was executed. </p>

<p>These responses have raised a number of questions: Did the United States in fact have the data? If the answer is no, should the DPA be revisited in light of the new data? If the United States did have the data, but the Department of Justice was not aware of or did not have access to it, why or why not? If the United States did have the data and the Department of Justice in fact knew about it, were the terms of the DPA too lenient, and if so why? </p>

<p>Admittedly, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/legacy/2012/12/11/dpa-attachment-a.pdf">2012 DPA</a> [PDF] did not address tax evasion and did not bind the Department of Justice Tax Division or the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division with respect to the tax evasion accusations. Rather it concerned only bank secrecy, money laundering and sanctions violations. Nonetheless, there are indications that the United States may now be feeling pressure to revisit the DPA's terms. </p>

<p>Such pressure may be stronger following the April 1, 2015, quarterly court-ordered <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/01/business/dealbook/document-filing-on-hsbc-compliance.html">report</a> filed by the US government, suggesting that, in some respects, HSBC Bank USA's and HSBC Holdings' progress towards developing an effective anti-money-laundering and sanctions-compliance program and crime detection mechanisms has been too slow, largely due to corporate culture and compliance technology deficiencies. Moreover, the Department of Justice may be considering bringing tax evasion charges against HSBC. The extent, nature and existence of any such charges remain to be seen, but clearly the data leak has caused reevaluation of a key agreement entered into before the data became more public and has given rise to public scrutiny and criticism. This dynamic will likely continue both in the United States and abroad.</p>

<p><strong>Tensions and Interactions between Countries</strong> </p>

<p>A second observation is that a country's response to the leaked data is in part a political calculation shaped by the actions of other countries and by public opinion. As noted, France has shared the data with a number of countries, some of which are investigating HSBC Suisse and the listed clients, although to varying degrees. In addition, public knowledge about the data is increasing. The data has come into the hands of journalists, including the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which has undertaken an extensive investigative report on the data leak and its contents. The increased availability and public knowledge of the leaked data, together with press reports tracking the responses of various governments, has magnified scrutiny of government responses and decisions with respect to HSBC Suisse and the listed clients. </p>

<p>If HSBC Suisse or HSBC Holdings are charged in France, and particularly if they are found guilty, other countries, such as the United Kingdom, may feel pressure to hold HSBC Suisse or HSBC Holdings accountable as well. Similarly, a move by the United States to prosecute HSBC Suisse or HSBC Holdings might influence the prosecutorial choices of other countries.</p>

<p>A parallel story can be told with respect to the individual HSBC Suisse clients. The leak implicated almost 60,000 files and over 100,000 clients and accounts. These clients included politicians, political donors, business leaders, actors and athletes from countries such as Switzerland, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. While not every client is necessarily a tax evader, at least some were engaging in tax evasion. Just recently, Arlette Ricci, granddaughter of fashion designer Nina Ricci, was convicted of tax fraud in France as a result of the leaked data and was sentenced to a year in prison, with a two-year suspended sentence. Ricci was fined $1.1 million and two of her properties were subject to confiscation. Other French nationals are expected to face criminal charges and trials for tax evasion. </p>

<p>The way in which one country reacts to the prosecutorial and investigative decisions of other countries in light of press-facilitated sunshine has the potential to be very instructive. It will be interesting to observe whether these dynamics result in more aggressive investigation and prosecution of the bank entities and the listed clients as a result of inter-country peer pressure, or whether the propensity to investigate and prosecute is reduced by other factors. It is worth noting in this regard that these investigations and prosecutions have taken quite a while to unfold. France obtained the data in 2008 and shared it with other countries in 2010, but it was not until this year that the French prosecutor recommended charges against HSBC Suisse and formally placed HSBC Holdings under investigation. This time lapse raises questions regarding what other factors may be causing delay.</p>

<p>Despite a number of unknowns, the Falciani leak has illuminated important investigative and prosecutorial tensions and dynamics between and within countries. Years later, the fallout is only now beginning to rain down on the HSBC entities, their clients and the tax authorities and other investigators in various countries. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://alanellis.com">Alan Ellis</a> and <a href="http://allenbaughlaw.com/mark-h-allenbaugh/">Mark H. Allenbaugh,</a> discuss the US Sentencing Commission votes for fundamental fixes to the US Sentencing Guidelines ... </p><strong>O</strong>n April 9, 2015, the US Sentencing Commission voted to fundamentally fix some portions of the US Sentencing Guidelines that have been in need of addressing for quite some time. On April 30, 2015, the Commission submitted to Congress amendments to the federal sentencing guidelines pursuant to its authority under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/994">28 U.S.C. &#167;994(p)</a>. These amendments will go into effect on November 1, 2015, barring congressional action.<br />
                <br />
                As several of the Commissioners observed during the April 9th hearing, the Commission's votes constitute a modest but important reversal of the brute-force approach driven by "loss" used to measure the harm caused by the offense conduct and a return to more refined measurements of a defendant's actual culpability. For many defendants, this will have the effect of lowering the advisory sentencing guidelines range.<br />
                <br />
                This article reviews some of the changes, which in most cases reflect a welcomed emphasis on a defendant's actual culpability.    </p>

                <div style="text-align: center;"><u>Jointly Undertaken Criminal Activity</u></div>
                Conspiracy cases often involve complex questions of fact regarding the liability of one conspirator for another. For purposes of trial, conspirator A can be held liable for the overt acts of conspirator B even if A had no actual knowledge of B's acts, as long as B's acts were in furtherance of the conspiracy. But the same does not necessarily hold for purposes of sentencing, and this has led to considerable confusion in the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17779565498436028561">courts</a>.

                <p>At the trial level, courts are concerned with liability, while at sentencing the issue turns to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3741968745073658384">culpability</a>.  Or as the Commission long <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2011/2011-1b13">has noted</a>, "[t]he principles and limits of sentencing accountability...are not always the same as the principles and limits of criminal liability." This has nevertheless led to considerable confusion inasmuch as courts often equate trial liability with sentencing accountability. For example, in a fraud conspiracy involving A and B that resulted in $15 million in investor losses, while A and B may criminally liable for the conspiracy, the guidelines recognize that A may not be as accountable&#8212;in other words, less culpable&#8212;as B especially where A's role was comparatively small. The same, of course, holds true for drug conspiracies.   <br />
                    <br />
                    The Commission now has clarified conspirator A can only be held accountable for the acts of conspirator B where (1) B's acts were within the scope of criminal activity that A agreed to jointly undertake, (2) B's acts were in furtherance of that criminal activity and (3) B's acts were reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity. The first criterion, which now has been added to the guidelines, clarifies that within conspiracies, each co-conspirator should only be held accountable for conduct that he actually agreed to jointly undertake with the other conspirators.  </p>

                <p>This clarification hopefully will reverse the trend of automatically holding one conspirator accountable for the conduct of all other conspirators regardless of the conspirator&#8217;s actual role in the offense. After all, holding a conspirator accountable only for the foreseeable conduct he agreed to undertake, which was in furtherance of the conspiracy, is a far better and fairer measure of a defendant&#8217;s culpability than otherwise.</p>

                <div style="text-align: center;"><u>Mitigating Role</u></div>
                With respect to measuring culpability, section 3B1.2 of the guidelines provides for a downward adjustment of between two and four levels where an offender is found to be a minor or minimal participant in a conspiracy. The question has been whether that determination turns only on the conduct of co-conspirators in the case at hand, or whether a court is also to look at other cases involving those who have committed similar crimes.

                <p>The Commission has now voted that courts are only to look at the relative culpability of co-conspirators in the case before them, rather than engage in a review of similarly situated defendants in other cases. This move likely will reduce unnecessary litigation on the issue and hopefully increase application of this downward adjustment, which currently is only awarded an abysmally 6.9% of the time.</p>

                <div style="text-align: center;"><u>Economic Offenses</u></div>
                Finally, the Commission issued several amendments to USSG &#167;2B1.1 that affect sentencing for economic offenses. These amendments continue the Commission's emphasis on fine-tuning the measurement of an offender's culpability and counter some historically over-simplistic measurements of offense harm.

                <p>1. Inflationary Adjustment<br />
                    The Commission voted to revise economic tables to account for inflation. For example, the fraud-loss table at <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2012/2012-2b11">USSG &#167;2B1.1(b)(1)</a> and tax loss table at USSG &#167;2T4.1 now have had their respective limits increased, which can serve to mitigate punishment. Under the current iteration of the guidelines, a loss amount of $500,000 will result in an offense level increase of +14. However, come November 1, 2015, the same loss amount will only result in an increase of +12. Below is the final table for USSG &#167;2B1.1(b)(1).<img alt="graph1.1.jpg" src="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/05/graph1.1.jpg" width="557" height="328" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

                <p>But what the Commission giveth, it also taketh away.  In addition to adjusting the loss tables for inflation, which has a mitigating effect, the fine tables also have been adjusted, which has a significant punitive effect. Indeed, the fine ranges now are approximately doubled. Practitioners, therefore, should be aware of this new, onerous modification, and note the built-in ex post facto limitation stated within the table itself. The revised fine table for individuals with the "special instruction" is below:<img alt="graph2.1.jpg" src="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/05/graph2.1.jpg" width="605" height="487" class="mt-image-none" style="" /><br />
                    <br />
                    2. Intended Loss<br />
                    For economic crimes, the guidelines look primarily to the amount of "loss" to determine offense seriousness. For example, in a typical Ponzi scheme, loss generally is equivalent to the total amount of money all investors lost, i.e., "actual loss." However, loss also can include so-called "intended loss." Returning to the Ponzi scheme example, intended loss thus would be equivalent to the money the offender intended investors to lose, e.g., where the offender was arrested before he could cash an investor;s check. If the intended loss is greater than the actual loss, then the guidelines direct a sentencing judge to use the amount of intended loss.  </p>

                <p>The concern has been how to measure intended loss. Is it a subjective or objective measure? Consistent with its focus on the actual culpability of the offender reviewed in the sections above, the Commission now has clarified that intended loss is to be measured by the defendant's subjective intent. </p>

                <p>3. Victims Table<br />
                    Here, the Commission has expanded the enhancement by adding an either/or element of "substantial financial hardship." While the government must now prove in certain cases that victims of the offense suffered substantial financial hardship, this alone can lead to an enhancement in some cases, even if the number of victims is below the threshold, for example, if the offense involved less than ten victims. Currently, there is no such enhancement. Under the proposed amendment, if the offense involved less than ten victims but resulted in substantial financial hardship to one or more, there is a two level increase.</p>

                <p>A four-level enhancement is mandated where the offense resulted in substantial hardship to five or more victims. If the offense resulted in substantial hardship to 25 or more victims, the increase is six levels. The revised victim table is below:<img alt="graph3.1.jpg" src="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/05/graph3.1.jpg" width="635" height="262" class="mt-image-none" style="" /><br />
                    <br />
                    4. Sophisticated Means<br />
                    Here again the Commission has revised the guidelines to focus on the defendant's culpability, as opposed to the nature of the offense. Where the "sophisticated means" enhancement at USSG &#167;2B1.1(b)(10)(C) traditionally has looked to the nature of the offense itself in terms of sophisticated, the guidelines will now direct courts to determine whether "the defendant intentionally engaged in or caused the conduct constituting sophisticated means." This amendment hopefully will have the effect of reducing what oftentimes is the automatic application of the enhancement based solely on the nature of the offense itself, regardless of the defendant's intent.</p>

                <p>5. Fraud on the Market<br />
                    In 2012, Commission adopted a controversial "modified rescissory method" ("MRM") for determining loss in securities fraud cases, and indicated that there was a "rebuttable presumption" that this method should be used by courts in such cases. To say the least, it did not meet with a receptive audience and in fact proved quite unwieldy and inaccurate. Accordingly, the Commission wisely voted to remove the rebuttable presumption in favor of that method and stated that courts now may use "any method that is appropriate and practicable under the circumstances."</p>

                <p>Still, the Commission left in the modified rescissory method identifying it as but one method "the court may consider" when calculating loss in securities fraud cases. This prompted Commission Vice-Chair Judge Charles Breyer to object during the hearing that the method was not completely stricken from the guidelines. Judge Breyer rightly indicated that there is no evidence courts can use MRM effectively and instead should use the civil standard for determining losses in securities fraud class actions unanimously adopted by the US Supreme Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2334242929684275483">Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo</a>.</p>

                <p>In all events, that the Commission corrected this unwise presumption in favor of an otherwise unworkable method was quite welcome and will avoid needless litigation over the propriety of MRM in future cases.</p>

                <div style="text-align: center;"><u>CONCLUSION</u></div>
                As reviewed above, the Commission's proposed changes to the guidelines reflect an emphasis on actual culpability and a move away from brute and unrefined measures of offense seriousness that all too often result in unreasonably long sentences. As Judge Pryor&#8212;one of the voting Commissioners&#8212;also recognized, the guidelines in its current form were drafted under a mandatory era, and therefore are "unsustainable" in a now-advisory system. The Commission's amendments, while modest, nevertheless address some fundamental flaws in the sentencing guidelines, which the Commission emphasized it will continue to evaluate and calibrate to ensure that federal sentencing is not only just and fair, but effective.

                <p>The United States, with only 5% of the world's population, incarcerates 25% of the world's prisoners. That the oldest democracy in the world continues to incarcerate more of its citizens per capita and in greater number than any other nation on earth&#8212;and in which the federal government incarcerates more individuals than any single state&#8212;is a sad and shocking statistic. With the federal Bureau of Prisons housing inmates at over 30% of its rated capacity, we simply cannot afford to continue our fixation on incarceration, especially for low level non-violent, first-time offenders. The Commission's modest changes nevertheless constitute a major recognition of this problem and its commitment to smarter sentencing.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Raymond J. Toney discusses the proposed changes to the boards of correction of military records...</p><strong>S</strong>enators Boxer, Wyden and Markey have introduced much-needed legislation, the &#8220;<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-114s1130is/pdf/BILLS-114s1130is.pdf">Legal Justice For Servicemembers Act</a>,&#8221; [PDF] to overhaul protections for military whistleblowers, including victims of sexual harassment and assault, who frequently suffer reprisals for exposing fraud, waste and abuse within the armed forces. Common forms of reprisal include career-ending reprimands and performance evaluations. The bill also seeks to reform the key mechanism through which victims of reprisal may seek redress, the boards for the correction of military records (BCMRs), which I address here. I will address the proposed changes to whistleblower protections in a subsequent article. </p>

                <p>The title of &#8220;records correction boards&#8221; fails to convey the scope and seriousness of the boards&#8217; enterprise. Congress <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/1552">created</a> the BCMR system in 1947 to rid itself of the burden of private members&#8217; bills addressing military injustices and erroneous records. The boards are, as the Army has stated, the "Supreme Court" for military personnel law disputes. Each military department has a BCMR, as well as the Department of Homeland Security, which adjudicates claims from members of the Coast Guard. </p>

                <p>The BCMRs are <a href="http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA342333">described</a> as "unique adjudicative mechanisms unlike traditional civil, criminal, or administrative courts." They are poorly understood and infrequently discussed, yet their importance to service members and veterans is inestimable. The BCMRs have decided tens of thousands of applications from military personnel and veterans alleging errors and injustices in their military records. Applications range from simple matters such as incorrect service dates or rates of pay to highly complex ones entailing the failure to diagnose and treat physical and psychiatric conditions, allegations of discrimination in all its varieties and the military&#8217;s failure to obey statutes and regulations, as well as claims of reprisal. </p>

                <p>The BCMRs are also the primary source of potential redress for service members who have pursued other avenues of relief such as complaints to commanders, the inspectors general, military equal opportunity organizations and a variety of subordinate military boards. At stake in many instances are careers, reputations, promotions, retirements and large sums of money. For most applicants, the BCMRs are the final resort, as few pursue judicial review of adverse decisions.  </p>

                <p>The exceptional importance of the BCMRs is not matched to the procedures they employ to adjudicate applications. In response to constituent complaints about the BCMRs, Congress directed the Department of Defense in 1996 to report on their procedures. The report raised several red flags concerning board procedures and made corresponding recommendations for change, which were largely ignored. Beginning in 2009, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the BCMRs further exposed a system devoid of procedural fairness and one that is structurally rigged against applicants. While the BCMRs are statutory boards, Congress apparently has never held an oversight hearing concerning their operation. </p>

                <p>Key findings from the 1996 DoD Report and FOIA requests (on file with the author) include: (1) BCMR members serve voluntarily on a part-time basis in addition to their full-time employment with the given military department; (2) BCMR members receive little meaningful training prior to or during their board service; (3) BCMR members are not required to, and typically do not, review actual application materials; (4) BCMR staff prepare recommended decisions which voting members almost invariably accept; (5) on average Army and Navy BCMR members spend less than five minutes on each application and (6) personal appearance hearings are a rarity. </p>

                <p>Most disturbing, however, are the measures taken by the staff of the Army, Navy, and Coast Guard BCMRs to keep applicants and their submissions away from actual voting members. Only the Air Force requires its members to review applications in advance of decisional meetings. As the Navy has noted: <blockquote>Generally the Board members do not prepare in any way for the applications that they will be called upon to decide during their regularly scheduled meetings. Simply put they do not see or have any knowledge of the cases they will decide before they meet.</blockquote></p>

                <p>That approach, shared by the Army and Coast Guard BCMRs, results in the complete dependence by BCMR members on the staff who prepare and present applications. Without personally reviewing all applications, BCMR members cannot know if staff members have accurately and fairly presented the facts and law of a case, and they often do not. In the case of the Navy BCMR, staff also can serve as voting board members, and often do. </p>

                <p>An information sheet obtained from the Army BCMR through FOIA purports to prepare new members for their first board meeting, explaining:<blockquote>There are usually about 90 cases divided into three stacks by potential decision - Grant, Partial Grant, and Deny. Many Board members choose to review the grant cases first as [a] method for getting warmed up...Cases range in sizes from 5-10 pages up to a wrapped bundle with several folders of 30-40 pages each. In the beginning, take a few minutes to review the case. As you become familiar with cases you will know exactly where you need to begin reviewing. </blockquote></p>

                <p>The Board members then are instructed to initial their vote on each case. &#8220;It is the Chair&#8217;s responsibility to review each case for the two board member&#8217;s vote initials, initial the Chair&#8217;s final vote and sign each case to complete the process.&#8221; This strongly indicates that the three board members do not convene in a traditional sense, discuss each case, vote on the case just discussed, and then move to the next. Rather, each member goes through the stack of cases initialing his or her decisions. According to the Army: <blockquote>If you come across a decision on a case that you may not agree with, you can do two things. The first is to bring up the case and summarize the point of disagreement orally to the other two Board members, or tell the Chair of the Board that you believe the case needs further review and discussion and either it hand it to the Chairman or put it aside where it won&#8217;t be mixed in with the other cases.</blockquote> Board member discussion of a case thus is called for only where a member disagrees with a recommended decision of the staff. </p>

                <p>Many applications to the BCMRs raise issues of credibility, which in other adjudicative contexts are resolved through witness testimony. While Congress authorizes the BCMRs to hold personal appearance hearings, and applicants frequently request them, the BCMRs rarely do, even where highly material facts are disputed. The Navy BCMR has not held a hearing in over <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/Faculty/Fidell_Boards_of_Correction_13.pdf">twenty years</a> [PDF].  The Army held one hearing in a span of four years, while deciding over 36,000 applications during the same period. </p>

                <p>Once decided, the BCMRs consign their decisions to a dysfunctional <a href="http://boards.law.af.mil/">website </a>(circa 1995 in design and construction)  that only the most patient researchers will find beneficial. Such cavalier treatment of past decisions is consistent with the BCMRs&#8217; belief that they are not bound by precedent, though federal courts <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1732246145658988934&q=Wilhelmus+v.+Geren,+796+F.Supp.2d+157,+163+(D.D.C.+2011)+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">state otherwise</a>. The BCMRs all report that they do not consult past decisions or maintain a catalogue of past decisions for staff and member reference. As the reader can readily discern, the BCMRs are the &#8220;wild west&#8221; of legal practice. <br />
                    <br />
                    If enacted, the Legal Justice For Servicemembers Act would do much to remedy the grave problems plaguing the BCMRs. The legislation would require full-time service of BCMR members, with each panel hearing being presided over by an administrative judge. BCMR membership would be limited to a period of five years. The BCMRs would be obligated to assist applicants in obtaining relevant military records and to transmit such records to applicants. The legislation also would require meaningful training for BCMR members. </p>

                <p>The legislation also remedies the failure of the BCMRs to hold personal appearance hearings by directing the boards to &#8220;hold an evidentiary hearing on a claim that presents a genuine issue of material fact, if requested by an applicant.&#8221; Concerning the BCMRs&#8217; treatment of its own decisions, the legislation would require the boards to characterize their decisions as precedential or non-precedential and would permit applicant&#8217;s to cite and rely on specific precedential decisions. </p>

                <p>BCMR decisions are subject to judicial review, albeit under an &#8220;unusually deferential&#8221; standard of review. The legislation would remove the basis for that standard by limiting the discretion available to the military secretaries in deciding whether or not to implement a BCMR decision, and by mandating review under the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act. <br />
                    <br />
                    To be sure, the BCMRs and their staffs are not to be wholly blamed for the disgraceful state of BCMR affairs. They do not control their budgets and levels of staffing. The number of applications received by the BCMRs, especially the Army and Navy, is daunting and has grown steadily. It is unsurprising that efficiencies are sought. While the Legal Justice For Servicemembers Act is no panacea for the multitude of ills plaguing the BCMR process, it is a bold step in the right direction. Congress should hold hearings on the BCMRs at its earliest convenience and give the bill its fullest consideration. </p>

		<title>The Bitter Battle Over Guns Continues</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST guest columnist <a href="http://law.umkc.edu/directory/faculty-directory/name/allen-rostron/">Allen Rostron</a> of the <a href="http://law.umkc.edu/">University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law </a>discusses Vermont's recent gun law in light of America's contentious gun politics...</p>

<p><br />
<strong>V</strong>ermont and Kansas are among the states where new laws relating to firearms will go into effect this summer. Vermont is taking limited <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/vermont-governor-signs-new-gun-restrictions-into-law.php">steps</a> to increase legal controls on guns, while Kansas is moving in the opposite direction. Reasonable people can certainly disagree about the merits of these new laws and what effects they will have. But the contrast between the two states' efforts is a reminder of how bitterly divided the nation remains when it comes to regulatory issues surrounding guns. Even modest measures aimed at keeping guns out of the wrong hands meet strong resistance.</p>

<p>Lawmakers in Vermont began the year by proposing <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2016/s.0141">legislation</a> that would essentially have made background checks a universal requirement for the purchase of a firearm. <a [pdf] href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-ut/legacy/2013/06/03/guncard.pdf">Federal laws</a> already require a person to undergo a background check if purchasing a gun from a licensed firearm dealer. If the seller is not a licensed dealer, however, no background check is required by federal law, whether the seller is a close friend or neighbor or a random stranger on the street. About a half dozen states, such as <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/firearms">California</a> and New York, have gone beyond the federal minimum and required a background check to be done prior to any transfer of a firearm (usually with limited exceptions, such as for transfers between immediate family members). About a dozen other <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/29/new-gun-background-check-law-to-take-effect/?page=all">states</a> have opted for universal background checks for handguns, but not rifles and shotguns.</p>

<p>Making the background check system as comprehensive and effective as possible should be an objective on which virtually everyone could agree. Indeed poll results indicate that over ninety percent of American voters favor universal background checks. After the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/newtown-school-shooting/">Newtown school</a> shootings Congress nevertheless declined to expand the federal background check requirements to cover gun shows and internet sales. And in Vermont one of the nation's most liberal states, the push to expand background checks failed after <a href="http://governor.vermont.gov/">Governor Peter Shumlin</a> refused to support it and gun rights advocates denounced it as a "first step toward completely criminalizing private transfers."</p>

<p>Other proposals fared better in Vermont and so several <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2016/Docs/BILLS/S-0141/S-0141%20As%20Introduced.pdf">new measures</a> [PDF] will take effect there starting on July 1. Again these are common-sense measures that ought to be uncontroversial. For example the Vermont legislature took steps to make sure that when a court determines that a person with mental health problems must be hospitalized or otherwise committed for treatment, that information is promptly reported to the national background check system. This is not imposing any new sort of restraint, but instead it is merely an effort to ensure proper enforcement of restrictions on gun possession already in place under federal and state law.</p>

<p>The Vermont legislature also called for information to be gathered about the possibility of the state establishing its own version of the <a href="http://www.theconnectprogram.org/firearms-safety-coalitions-role-nh-suicide-prevention">New Hampshire Gun Shop Project</a>. A gun dealer in New Hampshire initiated that novel project after he learned that in just one week, three people had purchased guns from his store and used them to commit suicide. He teamed up with health professionals and firearm safety and firearm rights advocates to develop a program that would offer training and posters, fliers and other materials to help gun seller and firing ranges reduce the risk of selling or renting a firearm to a suicidal person. Although the program is not mandatory, about half the gun stores in New Hampshire opted to participate.</p>

<p>Vermont also expanded the list of criminal offenses that will disqualify a person from being entitled to possess a firearm.  Federal law already prohibits possession of guns by those with felony records, as well as those convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence. Vermont chose to expand the prohibition to include those convicted of other offenses that are serious but not necessarily a felony, such as stalking, sexual assault, sexual exploitation of a child, manslaughter, maiming, kidnapping, drug dealing and human trafficking.  </p>

<p>Again this seems like it would be a relatively uncontroversial measure. Americans enjoy a right to possess and use firearms, but responsibilities come with rights. Laws should be crafted in ways that maximize the likelihood of guns being used for positive purposes and minimize the risk of them being used for improper purposes. Those who commit serious crimes should pay the price and taking away their legal entitlement to have a gun is a sensible way to both discourage lawbreaking and keep guns out of the hands of those most likely to misuse them.</p>

<p>While Vermont's newly-enacted measures seem moderate and reasonable, they nevertheless met strong opposition. Gun rights organizations <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20150323/vermont-gun-control-bill-advancing-to-senate-floor-for-a-vote">denounced</a> them as "a solution in search of a problem" and claimed the new laws "would do nothing to address violent crime and would only impact responsible, law-abiding gun owners." Again reasonable minds can disagree about the effectiveness of the measures, but it seems we could all agree that gun violence and crime is a problem worthy of legislative attention. And it is truly baffling why anyone would characterize a law as impacting only law-abiding gun owners when the law specifically targets people convicted of serious crimes like kidnapping and human trafficking.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Kansas is a prime example of a state moving in the opposite direction and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-usa-kansas-guns-idUSKBN0MT2LM20150402">relaxing</a> guns regulations that previously existed. Kansas currently allows the carrying of concealed handguns by those who obtain a license to do so. Among other conditions Kansas required license applicants to complete an eight-hour handgun safety and training course. This requirement ensured that license holders had at least some minimum level of understanding of how to safely carry, use and store a weapon, as well as basic knowledge about Kansas laws including the standards for use of deadly force.</p>

<p>Nearly 90,000 Kansans have received concealed carry <a href="http://ag.ks.gov/docs/default-source/documents/2014-concealed-carry-annual-report.pdf?sfvrsn=4">licenses</a> [PDF] since the state began granting them in 2006. But effective <a href="http://www.handgunlaw.us/states/kansas.pdf">July 1</a> [PDF], a license will no longer be required, because the Kansas <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2015_16/measures/documents/sb45_enrolled.pdf">legislature</a> [PDF] and the state's Governor <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Sam Brownback</a> have chosen to stop requiring a permit for the carrying of concealed weapons. Rather than requiring any training or screening, the state will basically now allow concealed carry by anyone who is at least 21 years of age and not prohibited from possessing a firearm by any state or federal law. Openly carrying guns also will remain legal in Kansas, with no permit or license required.</p>

<p>Kansas thus joins a small group of states with the so-called "constitutional carry" approach to the issue of carrying guns in public. "Constitutional carry" advocates contend that people should not be required to get government approval to carry a gun in public, whether it is carried openly or concealed. Despite the movement's name, it seems clear that the "constitutional carry" approach is not mandated by current constitutional law. In its landmark decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2739870581644084946">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>, the US Supreme Court noted that the right to keep and bear arms is not absolute, unlimited freedom. The court specifically cited bans on carrying concealed weapons as a type of gun control law that early American judges generally regarded as not being a violation of the right to keep and bear arms. If prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons are consistent with the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a>, then licensing schemes requiring training and a permit to carry a concealed gun surely must be valid as well.</p>

<p>Six years ago, I expressed hope that the Obama administration and the nation as a whole might be able to approach the gun issue in ways that would overcome old divisions and bitter strife and move forward with constructive policy efforts. Those hopes have clearly not been fulfilled. Congress remains stubbornly deadlocked. State legislatures continue to tinker with their gun laws, but even the most reasonable and mild measures draw overwrought opposition. Sadly, it has become difficult to envision an end to this policy stalemate.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST guest columnist <a href="http://newhouse.syr.edu/faculty-staff/roy-gutterman">Roy S. Gutterman </a> of the <a href="http://law.syr.edu/">Syracuse University College of Law</a> discusses recent changes to Malaysian sedition law...</p><strong>S</strong>edition, laws criminalizing criticism of a monarchy or government, is not as anachronistic as knights in shining armor or a moat around the castle. In fact, in many countries around the world, sedition laws are not only still on the books but are also actively enforced.</p>

<p>Malaysia, the Southeast Asian peninsular constitutional monarchy, recently <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/malaysian-lawmakers-announce-stricter-sedition-law.php">tightened</a> its sedition act extending criminal sentences from three to seven years and denying bail for accusations and empowering the government to censor online media.</p>

<p>The law is a remnant of Malaysia's British Colonial rule, which ended in 1957, dates back to 1948, and applies fines and incarceration for criticism of the king, nine regional sultans and the government in general. The law criminalizes speech that "brings contempt against the government." It also criminalizes inflammatory speech based on religion and race in the multi-ethnic country with a population of 30 million people.</p>

<p>The parliament's April <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-10/malaysian-parliament-passes-tough-sedition-act-amendments/6384164">amendments</a> to the laws drew condemnation from both press rights and  <a href="http://www.humanrights.gov/dyn/2015/04/malaysias-sedition-act-amendments/">human rights groups</a>. The Committee to Protect Journalist's senior Southeast Asia representative Shawn Crispin said, "The strengthening of Malaysia's already draconian Sedition Act shows how desperate Prime Minister Najib Razak has become to silence media criticism of his government." The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called the laws "very disappointing."</p>

<p>An outsider's view of another country's sedition laws, particularly from the far-off perspective of a Western free speech advocate, can sometimes be drawn into an abstract discussion of cultural values and perspectives or a misunderstanding of those values and perspectives. But in April, Malaysian authorities also put the law into perspective when it charged cartoonist Zulkiflee Anwar Alhaque, who goes by the pen name Zunar, with sedition following a series of tweeted editorial cartoons criticizing the Malaysian judiciary. He was arrested in February and charged with nine counts in April. Over the course of his 40-year career, Zunar's cartoons have depicted corruption, electoral fraud and a range of political chicanery. Now he faces up to 43 years in prison for his tweeted cartoons. </p>

<p>A Malaysia-based civil rights lawyer, Eric Paulsen, told <em>The New York Times</em> in February that in the previous year 15 people were charged with sedition in Malaysia. The United Nations reported that since 2014, 78 people were investigated or charged under the law, "including through the arrests of individuals for merely tweeting their criticism of government policies and judicial decisions." Over the past few years, government officials, including Malaysia's Prime Minister, discussed reining in, if not abolishing Malaysia's sedition laws. Instead, in April parliament tightened it, particularly provisions dealing with the internet, which is accessible to roughly 67 percent of the Malaysian population. Freedom House describes Malaysia's press rights environment as "not free" and ranks it 142 out of 199 countries in its annual Freedom of the Press report. In its <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/freedom-press-2014#.VVUK4NpViko">2014 analysis</a>, Freedom House noted that the Malaysian government blocks some websites but "has not systematically targeted political content in the past."</p>

<p>Malaysia is not the only country in the world with sedition laws on the books. While organizations that track press freedoms worldwide do not have a comprehensive list of all the countries with these laws on the books, examples abound with journalists and dissidents being imprisoned for their critiques of government personnel and policies.  Furthermore, strict libel laws also empower government officials and others to employ both civil and criminal laws to punish their critics.  </p>

<p>A Western critique of laws in foreign lands is not always well-received or even easy to levy. In democracies, the laws are supposed to reflect the will of the people. In less-than-democratic places, the laws often reflect the interests of those in power, whether it is a monarch or an empowered political party or a ruling class.</p>

<p>In the United States after emerging from an environment rife with seditious libel under British law, the United States has also wrestled with sedition. Although the Supreme Court never tested the <a href="http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/madison/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Sedition_Act_cases.pdf">Sedition Act of 1798</a> [PDF], for more than three years, the federal government made it a crime to "write, print, utter or publish ... any false, scandalous and malicious writing or writings against the government of the United States, or either house of Congress ... or the President ... or to bring them, or either of them, into contempt or disrepute; or to bring them, or either of them, into contempt or disrepute; or to excite against them, or either or any of them, the hatred of the good people of the United States." Until the law expired in 1801, a conviction was punishable by a fine of $5,000 and five years in prison. More than a century later during the first Red Scare, the government employed the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act of 1917</a>, which had similar provisions relating to speech, particularly that done by dissidents. Though not widely applied, the Espionage Act is still on the books.  </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the United States has taken great strides to place freedom of speech and the press and the right to critique the government among our most cherished and prominent constitutional rights. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> to the Constitution protects these rights, which are an integral part of our democracy and vital to our rights and responsibilities as citizens. The First Amendment has been reinforced by the Supreme Court in cases involving incitement, libel, privacy, access to information, national security and even intellectual property.</p>

<p>The First Amendment protects even our harshest critics of government policy. And, as much as free speech and free press rights may be part of American culture, in all practicality the Supreme Court did not finally put sedition to bed until <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10183527771703896207">New York Times v. Sullivan</a> in 1964, a landmark libel case revolving around editorial content that criticized the Jim Crow South and southern government officials. The libel suit brought by L.B. Sullivan, a Montgomery, Alabama, government official, garnered a $500,000 jury award, which was affirmed by the state's high court. </p>

<p>At the United States Supreme Court, Justice William Brennan likened the lawsuit to a modern example of seditious libel: "if neither factual error nor defamatory content suffices to remove the constitutional shield from criticism of official conduct, the combination of the two elements is no less inadequate. This is the lesson to be drawn from the great controversy over the Sedition Act of 1798, which first crystallized a national awareness of the central meaning of the First Amendment."<br />
	<br />
The court's decision not only killed off seditious libel as unconstitutional but it also established a more exacting standard for defamation lawsuits by public officials&#8212;actual malice, which means public officials who sue for libel will have to prove that defamatory statements were published with either knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth. Subsequent Supreme Court cases extended this standard to a range of other potential plaintiffs known as public figures.<br />
  <br />
The rationale is not intended to remove the cause of action of defamation entirely from those involved in public affairs but to make it exceedingly more difficult for them to use the courts or the law to punish their critics. This, Justice Brennan wrote, should foster public debate, even "vehement, caustic and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials." This encourages and protects free expression and debate. As noted in <span class="casename">Times v. Sullivan</span>, President Thomas Jefferson pardoned a number of people convicted under the Sedition Act and even remitted their fines. In an 1804 <a href="http://www.thisnation.com/library/nytimes.html">letter</a>, Jefferson wrote: "I discharged every person under punishment or prosecution under the sedition law, because I considered, and now consider, that law to be a nullity, as absolute and as palpable as if Congress had ordered us to fall down and worship a golden image."</p>

<p>First Amendment rights may be among our most exported American values. While censorship is anathema to most Americans, that creates some level of both envy and misunderstanding around the world. Concepts of hate speech and group libel, both barred under the First Amendment, seem almost impossible for many audiences to grasp.   <br />
Similarly, every time a journalist such as the <em>New York Times'</em> Judith Miller or, more recently, James Risen is confronted with the choice of revealing confidential sources to the government or face jail time for contempt of court, the American government loses some of its moral high ground.  </p>

<p>Revelations of the government's domestic surveillance programs and the Department of Justice's efforts to gather phone records from the Associated Press raise additional questions about our own commitment to these values. If these are the values now being exported, it is no surprise governments around the world continue to enforce sedition laws.  </p>

		<title>Barrel Bombs and Hell Canons Fuel Conflict in Aleppo</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.barry.edu/law/future-students/faculty/staff/msummers.html">Mark A. Summers</a> of Barry University School of Law discusses the legality of choice of weapons in the Syrian war in the context of International Humanitarian Law ... </p><strong>A</strong>mnesty International (AI) recently <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/amnesty-condemns-syria-war-crimes.php">condemned</a> the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the Asad government and rebel forces in Aleppo, Syria. In a lengthy <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/embargoed_5_may_aleppo_report_death_everywhere.pdf">report</a> [PDF], AI found that more than 3,000 civilians have been killed in Aleppo in the last year alone. The death toll is more than 11,000 since 2012. A substantial number of the casualties are attributed to the Asad regime's use of a weapon called a barrel bomb. In the month before the AI report (March-April 2015), there were 85 barrel bomb attacks that killed 110 civilians. The opposition forces are alleged to have used another improvised weapon called a "<a href="http://www.reuters.com/video/2015/02/18/syrian-rebels-introduce-the-hell-cannon?videoId=340746339">hell cannon</a>," [video] which is said to have caused at least 600 civilian deaths in 2014. This commentary will attempt to ascertain whether the use of barrel bombs or hell cannons is a <em>per se</em> violation of International Humanitarian Law (IHL).</p>

<p>The barrel bomb is described in the report as an improvised weapon dropped from a helicopter that is made from oil tanks, fuel tanks or gas cylinders, filled with "explosives, fuel and metal fragments&#8212;such as ball bearings, nails and machine parts." <blockquote> "[T]he large number of civilian casualties is likely due to the fact that barrel bombs are so imprecise that the government rarely drops them near the front line, where they might hit their own forces. Instead, barrel bombs have struck apartment buildings and populated areas such as public markets, transportation hubs and mosques."</blockquote>  Especially hard hit have been hospitals in opposition-controlled areas, many of which have been forced to move underground due to the frequency with which they have been damaged by barrel bombs. The barrel bomb attacks have created an atmosphere of fear among the residents of Aleppo, which caused one of them to describe it as a "<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/05/syrias-circle-of-hell-barrel-bombs-in-aleppo/">circle of hell</a>."</p>

<p>The "hell cannon" is an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) that features a cannon barrel around 3-ft long attached to wheels. The weapon has a range of 1.5 kilometers and can fire projectiles filled with explosives and shrapnel weighing more than 40 kilograms. Like the barrel bomb, the hell cannon is so imprecise that the attacks have been described as "completely random." Also like the barrel bomb, the targets damaged or destroyed by the hell cannon have been civilian objects, such as residential neighborhoods, medical centers, schools, mosques and other cultural and historic sites in government-held areas of Aleppo. In addition, in 2014 alone the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights documented 672 civilian deaths due to "indiscriminate shelling in Aleppo city." The AI report concludes that attacks by both the government and opposition forces amounted to war crimes and/or crimes against humanity. </p>

<p>IHL regulates the means and methods of warfare. This body of law, the <em>jus in bello</em>, applies to the participants in an armed conflict, regardless of the legality of the conflict in the first instance. There are four key interrelated principles that are applied to determine whether a particular means or method of warfare is legal. Those principles are: humanity (means and methods cause the least possible suffering); necessity (means and methods designed to defeat the enemy militarily); distinction (means and methods directed toward military, not civilian, targets); and proportionality (damage caused by means and method justified by anticipated military advantage). [Arts. 51, 52(2) & 57, 1977 Prot. I to <a href="https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/f6c8b9fee14a77fdc125641e0052b079">Geneva Conventions</a>]</p>

<p>IHL's basic rules are found in international treaties&#8212;the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, <em>i.e.</em>, Hague Law and <a href="https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/INTRO/470">Protocol I (1977)</a> to the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/publications/icrc-002-0173.pdf">1949 Geneva Conventions</a> [PDF]. In addition, most of these treaty rules are regarded as customary international law that is binding on states whether or not they are parties to the conventions.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="http://www.clusterconvention.org">Cluster Munitions Convention</a> that became law on August 1, 2010. It bans, <em>inter alia</em>, the use, development, production or acquisition of cluster munitions, defined as "a conventional munition (including one released from an aircraft) that is designed to disperse or release explosive submunitions each weighing less than 20 kilograms." An explosive submunition functions "by detonating an explosive charge prior to, on or after impact." </p>

<p>Both the barrel bombs used by the Syrian government and the hell cannons used by the opposition bear similarities to cluster bombs. It is arguable, however, that barrel bombs and hell cannons do not violate the express terms of the Cluster Munitions Convention because their projectiles, while propelled by an explosive charge, are not themselves explosive. Indeed, the drafters of the Cluster Munitions Convention were especially concerned with the tendency of cluster bombs to leave behind unexploded ordnance, the remnants of which "kill or maim civilians." The non-explosive projectiles packed in barrel bombs or the shells fired by hell cannons would not appear to present this danger. Nonetheless, an argument could be made that the broader purpose of the convention&#8212;protecting civilians and civilian objects from indiscriminate attacks&#8212;would be served by reading the terms of the convention broadly to include barrel bombs and hell cannons that "detonate [their] explosive charge[s] ... prior to impact." Even if this interpretation were accepted, however, the Cluster Munitions Convention would not be binding on Syria which is not a party to it. Moreover, there is no consensus that cluster munitions are <em>per se</em> illegal under international law.</p>

<p>Certain weapons, however, are so indiscriminate that they are regarded as <em>per se</em> illegal regardless of the presence of any lawful military targets. Key to this determination is whether the weapons used offer any definite military advantage to the forces employing them. A Trial Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) <a href="http://icty.org/x/cases/martic/tjug/en/070612.pdf">considered</a> [PDF] the legality of the use of Orkan rockets which were fired by the army of the self-proclaimed Republic of the Serbian Krajina from a distance of 50 kilometers into Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. The Orkan rockets "were equipped with 288 bomblets each of which, on explosion, propels jagged bits of metal and more than 400 small steel spheres in every direction." The rockets had a lethal range of 10 meters and a lateral error factor of as much as 600 meters from the distance at which they were fired. Accordingly, the court concluded that "[i]n respect of its accuracy and striking force the use of the Orkan rocket in this case was not designed to hit military targets but to terrorize the civilians of Zagreb." Substitute "barrel bomb" or "hell cannon" for "Orkan" and this language would seem equally applicable to the weapons being used in Syria. </p>

<p>The assessment of the legality of a weapon, however, cannot be based exclusively on its infliction of damage to civilians or civilian objects. International Humanitarian Law tolerates a certain amount of "collateral damage," so long as it is proportional to the expected military advantage to be achieved by using the weapon. Any assessment of proportionality thus requires consideration of whether the weapons used were aimed at legitimate military targets.  </p>

<p>On this point, the AI report documented eight incidents involving the use of barrel bombs by the Syrian government and four incidents of the use of hell cannons or other improvised rockets by opposition groups. In five of the eight barrel bomb attacks, potential military targets were identified at distances ranging from 250 meters to 4 kilometers from the site of the strike. In the other three attacks, no legitimate military targets were identified. In all cases the only casualties were civilians and the only damage was to civilian objects. Of the four attacks attributed to hell cannons or improvised rockets, only one military target, 200 meters from the site of the attack, was identified. As with the government attacks, there were no recorded military victims or damage to military property.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/gotovina/tjug/en/110415_judgement_vol1.pdf">recent case</a> [PDF], an ICTY trial chamber found that artillery shells which fell within 200 meters from an identified military target were deliberately aimed at the target, while those that fell outside the 200 meter radius were deliberately aimed at non-military targets. While this finding was <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/gotovina/acjug/en/121116_judgement.pdf">overturned</a> [PDF] by the ICTY appellate chamber because there was insufficient evidence to support the trial chamber's adoption of the 200 meter standard, it does provide some insight into the precision of targeting and the degree of accuracy expected of modern weaponry. And, significantly, in only one of the 13 documented attacks in Aleppo was a potential military target identified which met the 200 meter standard. </p>

<p>It is clear that the weapons used by both government and opposition forces in Aleppo are so inaccurate and so randomly destructive that their use is <em>per se</em> illegal and thus constitutes either the direct or indiscriminate targeting of civilians and civilian objects which is prohibited by IHL. This conclusion is only bolstered by the evidence that both sides launched attacks against civilian areas that were not even remotely proximate to any legitimate military targets. Even if such targets had existed, the use of barrel bombs and hell cannons would still be unlawful because of the disproportionate damage these weapons inflict on civilians and civilian objects.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST guest columnist <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/law/faculty/peter_jan_honigsberg/">Peter Jan Honigsberg</a> from the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/law/">University of San Francisco School of Law </a> discusses possible release of detainees from Guantanamo Bay...</p><strong>O</strong>n April 24, JURIST reported that Shaker Aamer, a citizen of Saudi Arabia (SA) and a British resident who has been detained in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba since 2002 is <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/guantanamo-detainee-set-to-be-released-in-june.php">scheduled for release</a> in June. Aamer is the only remaining United Kingdom (UK) citizen or resident in Guantanamo. He has been cleared for release and, according to the government, is currently approved to be transferred to Saudi Arabia (SA), his country of birth. He wants to return to the UK, to rejoin his wife and family, who live in London. Accordingly there are two questions involved here: Will he be released next month and, if so, will he be transferred to the UK or SA?</p>

<p>News <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/16/shaker-aamer-guantanamo-bay-prioritise-obama-case">reports</a> indicate that <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> has met with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Obama</a> and has requested that Aamer be resettled in the UK. Obama reportedly told Cameron that he would "<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/16/shaker-aamer-guantanamo-bay-prioritise-obama-case">prioritize</a>" the case.  Nevertheless as of May 12, the Pentagon still has Aamer scheduled for release to SA.  Aamer's lawyer Clive Stafford Smith wrote in an email to me on May 14, 2014 that, "I think the Saudi thing is a red herring as nobody else in the whole place is only cleared for one country. So our position is that he is just 'cleared'." </p>

<p>The US government has accused Aamer of being a member of Al Qaeda, and having met Osama Ben Laden.  Aamer has stated numerous times that he was working in Afghanistan as a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/20/guantanamo-shaker-aamer-london">charity worker and teacher</a> when he was seized.  Although Aamer has been in Guantanamo for over 13 years, he has never been charged with a crime. </p>

<p>Shaker Aamer has been <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2086747/Last-Briton-Guantanamo-Bay-says-MI5-officer-room-tortured.html">cleared</a> for release twice: in 2007 by the Bush Administration and in 2009 by the Obama Administration. In Guantanamo Aamer has suffered repeated lengthy periods of isolation; been on hunger strikes, where he was cruelly and inhumanely force-fed; and been physically brutalized and beaten. Today he is in  <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/09/shaker-aamer-guantanamo-ptsd-release">poor health</a>. The UK claims that the Americans have misled it over the harsh <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/18/british-minister-misled-over-shaker-aamer-guantanamo-bay">mistreatment</a> of Aamer.</p>

<p>Various <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/20/guantanamo-shaker-aamer-london">theories</a> have been proposed as to why Aamer remains in Guantanamo when the other 15 detainees from the UK were released years ago. One theory is that the UK does not want Aamer to publicly repeat a story he has been maintaining for years, namely that a UK <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2086747/Last-Briton-Guantanamo-Bay-says-MI5-officer-room-tortured.html">intelligence</a> agent from MI5 was present when a US interrogator smashed his head against a wall in Bagram Air Force Base, before his transfer to Guantanamo. In 2010, the British government paid approximately <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/world/europe/17britain.html?_r=1">$16,000,000</a> to the British citizens and residents detained in Guantanamo (including Aamer, who cannot receive his funds until he is released) in order to settle a lawsuit brought by the former detainees against the MI5 and MI6 security agencies. </p>

<p>Supporters of Aamer maintain that the UK does not want to revisit accusations against these agencies and would prefer that Aamer be released to SA, where it is unlikely that he would be given the platform to speak publicly about his treatment.  Attorney Stafford Smith <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/20/guantanamo-shaker-aamer-london">believes</a> that, "The sole reason for the US to send Shaker to Saudi Arabia is to have him silenced, most likely by sentencing him to a long imprisonment after a sham trial."<br />
 <br />
Another theory is that Aamer was present when three detainees died in Guantanamo one night in 2006. The US government alleges that all three men committed <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2086747/Last-Briton-Guantanamo-Bay-says-MI5-officer-room-tortured.html">suicide</a> on the same night, hanging in their cells, with their hands behind their backs and socks stuffed down their throats. However <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2015/1/15/did_gitmo_suicides_cover_up_murder">Sergeant Joseph Hickman,</a> who was present at the base at the time, claims that the men were being interrogated that evening at a secret facility near the detention center, known as "Camp NO."  Something went terribly wrong, causing the men to die. According to Hickman, Aamer was also being questioned that night and was similarly mistreated. Some people believe that Aamer may know what caused the men to die. By transferring Aamer to SA, he would not have the opportunity to publicly discuss this incident.  </p>

<p>A third theory is that Aamer, as a charismatic personality and natural leader, has been troublesome to the military. He initiated the first hunger strike in Guantanamo in 2005 and also negotiated its end with the military authorities. Following the strike, Aamer was placed in isolation for 360 days, which is 330 days longer than permitted under US policy. According to this theory keeping him in Guantanamo is his punishment for standing up for the rights of other detainees.  </p>

<p>Although JURIST as well as other news reports assert that Aamer will be released in June, whether to GB or SA, there are no official indications that this will happen. In order for a detainee to be released several steps are required. The Obama Administration must provide a transfer packet to the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary must sign the packet and forward the approved release to Congress, with a 30-day notice. According to a statement by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, on April 23, 2015, no <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article19346010.html">proposed</a> transfer packets await his signature nor has he forwarded any approved releases to Congress. </p>

<p>Secretary Carter may have approved releases since April 23&#8212;the approvals usually are not made public until the release. However there are indications that the process has been slowing down, if not halted altogether, due to Republican accusations that the president broke the law when he <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article19346010.html">swapped</a> five high-ranking Taliban officials in Guantanamo for the release of Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl in May 2014. Bergdahl was held by the Taliban in Afghanistan for five years.  The <a href="http://www.gao.gov/">Government Accountability Office </a> also concluded that the administration broke the law by not following the requirements imposed by Congress in releasing the Taliban detainees. In response the Obama has argued that, as Commander-in-Chief, he had the authority to make the swap. </p>

<p>Partly because of the questionable legitimacy of the Bergdahl swap, the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/">House Armed Services Committee</a>  (HASC) has drafted new language, to be included in the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/ndaa-home?p=ndaa">2015 National Defense Authorization Act defense bill</a>  (NDAA), imposing additional restrictions on the administration's releasing of detainees. It is likely that the government does not want to add ammunition to the HASC bill by releasing detainees at this time. Perhaps Obama would rather wait until the administration and the committee work out a reasonable accommodation. If that is the case, it is unlikely that Aamer will be released in June, whether to GB or SA. As Stafford Smith wrote to me in May, "Word is that he will be released next month, but I will believe it when I see it."</p>

<p>On his second day in office Obama announced that he would close Guantanamo within one year. He repeated his <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/white-house/obama-will-again-promise-to-close-guantanamo-bay-in-state-of-the-union-speech-20150120">pledge</a> twice more during his administration. Six plus years later with Obama's presidency on the wane, Guantanamo is still open with 122 individuals detained. It appears less and <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/242181-house-rejects-bid-to-close-gitmo">less</a> likely that Guantanamo will close before the end of Obama's administration. </p>

<p>In the meantime Shaker Aamer and 56 other men cleared for release have no choice but to continue their indefinite and infernal wait. And at the same time, their families try to remain optimistic that someday they will again unite with their fathers, husbands and sons.</p>

		<title>The EU Confronts the Ukraine Crisis&#8212;Carefully Handling the Double-edged Sword of Self-determination?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Larry Eaker of the <a href="https://www.aup.edu/">American University of Paris</a> discusses the EU's position on the Ukraine Crisis ... </p>
"<strong>U</strong>nited in Diversity"&#8212;The Official EU Motto</p>

<p>The sweeping expansion of the EU over the past 20 years has seemed to hit its limits&#8212;at least for the immediate future. After absorbing 11 eastern European nations since 2004, including three Baltic countries from the former Soviet Union, the EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has recently <a href="http://juncker.epp.eu/my-priorities">called for</a> a five-year freeze on any further enlargement. Not only can this temporary pause in EU enlargement be comprehended in light of serious labor market disruptions, Roma circulation problems, corruption and rule of law issues and EU external borders crises&#8212;to mention just a few of the disputes stemming from this move eastward&#8212;but such a position can be more fully understood when considering that the EU is now bumping up against a very rough neighborhood to the east. As is well understood by the EU's institutions and the foreign policy officials of the <a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/">28 member states</a>, the Russian Federation has <a href="http://reconsideringrussia.org/category/nato/">made it clear </a>that further EU expansion involving former members of the Soviet Union will be met with strong opposition&#8212;including a push back by the Russian government to protect alleged interests of Russian minorities in nations to the west of her borders. The clearest example of this growing clash over expansionary interests in Eastern Europe is, of course, the on-going conflict in Ukraine. The massive <a href="http://mun-nyborg.org/Research%20Reports/RR-2015-Ukraine.pdf">demonstrations in Kiev's Maidan Square</a> [PDF] beginning in November 2013 in favor of the move towards EU membership were enough to make any rabid Europhile blush. From a legalistic point of view, it can be said that the Ukrainian people's actions to force their Victor Yanukovych-led government to sign an Association Agreement with the EU were merely reflecting their international law recognized right to what is referred to as internal self-determination&#8212;as developed in Article 1(2) of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml">UN Charter</a> and Common Article 1 of the 1966 <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">ICCPR</a> and <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx">ICESCR</a>. The subsequent overthrow of the Yanukovych government was not considered in the Kremlin, however, as the legitimate act of the peoples of Ukraine in fulfillment of their right to self-determination. On the contrary, the Russian government loudly <a href="http://www.mintpressnews.com/road-moscow-goes-kiev-coup-detat-threatens-russia/180712/">protested</a> against an illegal change in government in Ukraine; as a <em>coup d'état</em>, led by fascists supported by the EU and the US.  </p>

<p>This throwback to the Cold War period was, however, just the first Russian shot across the EU's bow. Unfortunately for the new Ukrainian government and her supporters, the Ukrainian peoples then discovered the downside to the cherished international law principle of self-determination; namely, the right of peoples to self-determine themselves right out of your existing nation-state in direct conflict to the state's right to maintain its territorial integrity. The <a href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182723.html">Crimean declaration of independence</a> and subsequent referendum vote to exit Ukraine was quickly followed by Russian annexation in March 2014. And if that was not shocking enough for EU sensitivities, rebels within the eastern Ukraine provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk then proceeded&#8212;with not very well concealed Russian support&#8212;to engage in open hostilities with the Ukrainian government in order to fully realize the establishment of their newly declared independent republics of Donetsk and Luhansk (now joined within the Novorossiya confederation). Although this so-called right of external self-determination is rather vaguely defined and greatly constrained by modern international law interpretations, as discussed in the <a href="http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1643/index.do">famous Quebec case</a> decided by the Canadian Supreme Court in 1998, it remains, nevertheless, the claimed legal foundation of secessionist movements throughout the world. Furthermore, with the ICJ in her much debated <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=4&case=141&p3=4">Kosovo case</a> opining that there exists in international law no clear prohibition to declarations of independence by the peoples within states&#8212;thus, confining the scope of the principle of territorial integrity under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter to "relations between states"&#8212;the court has, in effect, left this issue to the realm of domestic constitutional law practice. Thus, the EU is faced with a dilemma in its actions dealing with the Ukrainian crisis&#8212;how to avoid getting cut by this double-edged sword of self-determination. </p>

<p><strong>The EU's Response to Self-Determination Movements in Ukraine&#8212;Applying the International Law Framework</strong></p>

<p>The "Westphalian" international law position in favor of state sovereignty and territorial integrity can be considered well-founded in light of the instability and wars engendered by the many secessionist movements experienced worldwide since World War II. The EU has been witness, unfortunately, to continuous secessionist movements and bloody wars to the east of its borders since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. It is <a href="https://www.ictj.org/sites/default/files/ICTJ-FormerYugoslavia-Justice-Facts-2009-English.pdf">estimated</a> by the International Center for Transnational Justice that as many as 140,000 persons lost their lives in the Yugoslavian wars during the 1990's. Although the figures are impossible to verify, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/15/world/europe/15iht-chech.html?_r=0">it has been claimed</a> by the former leader of the Chechen Parliament that up to 160,000 people perished in the two Chechen conflicts. In addition, the Council of Europe reported over 30,000 displaced persons stemming from the Russian-supported South Ossetian and Abkhazian secessions from <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1338365&Site=CommDH&BackColorInternet=FEC65B&BackColorIntranet=FEC65B&BackColorLogged=FFC679#P18">Georgia </a>in 2008. Whatever the figures are, the EU has to be highly concerned over this recent history of European instability propelled by extreme nationalism. And the current situation in Ukraine, in spite of the declared cease-fire, looks very bleak. The death toll in the on-going Ukrainian conflict has now reached over 6,000, according to a recent report by the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50215#.VVlXhOv4tSU">UN Human Rights Office</a>. </p>

<p>Although not considered as a <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/international-migration/glossary/nation-state/">nation-state</a> under pubic international law, the EU does exercise powers akin to a nation-state&#8212;especially in the field of foreign affairs (or in "Eurospeak," external actions). It enjoys legal personality and shares power over foreign and security policy with its member states. According to Article 21 of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012M/TXT">Treaty on European Union</a> (TEU), the EU's external actions are to be guided by the principles of democracy, the rule of law, protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and "respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law." Accordingly, the EU itself (in addition to the individual 28 member states' <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml">UN Charter</a> commitments) is bound in pursuing such external actions to respect both the territorial integrity and self-determination principles which underpin the nation-state system and modern human rights protection framework.</p>

<p>While the right to formally recognize claimed states stemming from these recent European wars is left to the sovereign power of individual EU member states as a matter of EU law, various EU institutions do carry out a form of <em>de facto</em> recognition by the supra-national organization itself. For example, the EU Parliament in March 2012 passed a<a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2012-0115+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN"> resolution</a> urging the five EU member states to refuse to recognize Kosovo to do such. And, while the fact of recognition alone does not constitute <em>de jure</em> statehood under modern principles of international law, the admission to EU membership&#8212;as a form of collective recognition&#8212;goes a long way in solidifying an entity's ability to function within the world of international relations. The EU fully understands this "legal" attraction of EU membership for states and fledgling entities to its east and, accordingly, has adopted what is referred to as an "Europeanization" policy. This policy is structured into the EU's <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/enp/index_en.htm">European Neighborhood Policy</a> created in 2004 to "achieve the closest possible political association and the greatest possible degree of economic integration" with 16 of the EU's closest neighbors. And, more specifically for her eastern neighbors including Ukraine, the EU launched in 2009 an <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/international-affairs/eastern-partnership/index_en.htm">Eastern Partnership</a>.  Pursuant to this Eastern Partnership, the EU signed an <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/top_stories/2014/011114_ukraine_agreement_en.htm">Association Agreement with Ukraine</a> in June 2014. While not promising EU membership, such agreements set forth the roadmap for states seeking eventual EU membership to follow and, in the case of Ukraine, included a "Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area"&#8212;thus opening up markets between Ukraine and the 28 EU member states. It was this proposed EU-Ukraine Association Agreement which was so strongly contested by the Russian government, as being in direct conflict with the Russian proposed <a href="http://www.eaeunion.org/?lang=en#about">Eurasian Union</a> agreement. But the dilemma is that closer association with Ukraine presents the EU with serious problems concerning the breakup of the state and status of such breakaway regions&#8212;reminiscent of the Cyprus situation.  </p>

<p><strong>Resolving the Territorial Integrity vs. Self-Determination Dilemma in Ukraine</strong></p>

<p>Faced with this dilemma, the EU has clearly come down on the side of Ukrainian territorial integrity. In their "<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/141749.pdf">Conclusions on Ukraine</a>" [PDF] adopted by the European Council on March 20, 2014, following the Crimean annexation, the member states unanimously committed themselves to "uphold the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine" and announced their decision not to recognize the "illegal referendum" and subsequent "illegal annexation" by Russia. This statement of EU support for Ukraine has been followed up by a series of Council decisions imposing both individual asset freezes and visa restrictions on Russian companies and individuals and specific sectoral sanctions. And although the UN Security Council has not been able to adopt any condemning resolutions dealing with the Crimean annexation, it should be noted that the EU's delegation to the UN General Assembly vigorously <a href="http://eu-un.europa.eu/articles/en/article_14799_en.htm">supported</a> that UN body's resolution of March 27, 2014, condemning the referendum and calling upon states not to recognize "any alteration to the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea."</p>

<p>Beyond these condemning EU Council Conclusions on Ukraine and this UN General Assembly resolution it is important to recognize that the EU Commission participates in the Council of Europe's European Commission for Democracy through Law, or Venice Commission, which provides non-binding legal advice to 60 member states on issues concerning, <em>inter alia</em>, secession and European constitutional principles. On March 14, 2014, the Venice Commission issued its <a href="http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2014)002-e">draft opinion</a> declaring the Autonomous Republic of Crimea's decision to organize a referendum on becoming a constituent territory of the Russian Federation to be contrary to the Ukrainian constitution. In addition, the Venice Commission questioned whether the referendum scheduled for March 16th itself "could be held in compliance with international standards"&#8212;citing, in particular, concerns over the massive presence of paramilitary forces, the earlier declaration of independence by the Crimean parliament and concerns expressed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe with respect to freedom of expression in Crimea. Thus, the EU at least attempts to consider issues concerning self-determination and secessionist disputes within a legal&#8212;and not only political&#8212;framework.</p>

<p>Accordingly, one may conclude that the EU is tightly bound within a web of both international and EU law rules and procedures that will, hopefully, lead her to peacefully and equitably resolve the self-determination disputes now raging in Ukraine. Thankfully, it appears that the EU's approach to the Ukrainian crisis is, in fact, well encased within a solid system based upon the rule of law and not power politics. Who knows? This just might lead to unity in diversity.</p>

<p>What more can international law advocates ask for?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.miami.edu/faculty-administration/caroline-mala-corbin.php">Caroline Mala Corbin</a>, of <a href="http://www.law.miami.edu/">University of Miami School of Law</a>, discusses whether filing paperwork in order to obtain a religious exemption is a substantial burden on religious liberty... </p>

<p><br />
<strong>D</strong>oes filing paperwork in order to obtain a religious exemption from a law constitute a substantial burden on religious liberty? That is the question posed by a number of non-profit religious employers that have asked the US Supreme Court to block a law requiring them to do just that. Although the court has yet to grant <em>certiorari</em> in any of these cases, it has stayed the rulings of lower courts that have held that the paperwork requirement does not substantially burden religious employers. The injunctions do not necessarily indicate how the Supreme Court will rule (or even whether it will accept the cases). However if the government's simple administrative procedure for receiving a religious exemption were itself treated as an assault on religious liberty, it would be a troubling interpretation of what constitutes a "substantial burden." </p>

<p>Because we do not live in a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/lochner_era">Lochner era</a> free-for-all, employers have certain obligations towards their employees. Employers must provide their employees with a safe place to work. Employers must pay their employees a minimum wage and contribute to their social security savings. And after the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/timeline/timeline-text.html">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)</a>, employer-sponsored health insurance plans must cover basic <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/factsheets/2010/07/preventive-services-list.html">preventive care</a> without any cost-sharing. Because contraception is vital to women's health, that preventive care includes <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForWomen/FreePublications/UCM356451.pdf">FDA-approved contraception</a>. In fact, the Institute of Medicine recommended that contraception be fully covered precisely because it is so essential for women's well-being.</p>

<p>It is this last requirement&#8212;often called the contraception mandate&#8212;that has proven so contentious. Last summer the court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5322529599500468186">ruled</a> that for-profit corporations like <a href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/hobby-lobby-stores/">Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc</a>. were entitled to an exemption from the mandate under the Federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000bb-1">RFRA</a>, religious objectors need not comply with a federal law that substantially burdens their religious practice unless the government can show that the law advances a compelling interest in a narrowly tailored way. </p>

<p><span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> focused on for-profit companies because non-profit organizations were already exempt. Under Department of Health and Human Services regulations, religious non-profits need not include contraception in their health care plans. Instead once a religious non-profit declares its religious opposition, it can have its health care insurer or, if it is self-insured, a third party administrator, provide coverage instead. Indeed, the <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> court pointed to this accommodation as a reason why the contraception mandate's application to religious for-profits was not narrowly tailored. If this accommodation worked for non-profits, the court reasoned, then why not for for-profits?</p>

<p>Nonetheless, some non-profits have <a href="http://national.deseretnews.com/article/2956/religious-nonprofits-that-object-to-covering-birth-control-in-health-plans-challenge-federal-law.html">complained</a> that the religious accommodation itself violates their religious rights. They argue that filing the paperwork that grants them their exemption imposes a substantial burden on their religious practice. According to these religious non-profits, signing a two-page form or sending a letter <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/mobile/article/3rd_circuit_rules_against_religious_employers_who_object_to_contraceptive_c/">facilitates</a> the provision of contraception, thus making them complicit in sin. </p>

<p>Although multiple courts (including <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/133536p.pdf">the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [PDF], <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/14a0121p-06.pdf">the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [PDF], <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2014/D02-21/C:13-3853:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1295328:S:0">the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> and <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/B5124BF67FED385785257D900053E80B/$file/13-5368-1522271.pdf">the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [PDF]) have rejected this claim, the US Supreme Court has stayed these decisions. Mere days after writing in <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> that the accommodation for non-profits "constitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Government's aims while providing greater respect for religious liberty," the court granted an emergency injunction against that very alternative in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13a1284_ap6c.pdf">Wheaton College v. Burwell</a> [PDF]. In her <span class="casename">Wheaton</span> dissent, Justice Sotomayor lamented that "[t]hose who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word. Not so today." </p>

<p>Setting aside the court's mixed messages, the non-profits' claim should fail. At the most basic level, it misunderstands how the contraception mandate works. The religious organizations believe that their written refusal triggers the provision of contraception. As a matter of law, they are wrong. Their paperwork does not cause contraception coverage. The Affordable Care Act, passed by a democratically-elected Congress, does. It is federal law, not the completion of any form, that creates the obligation to cover contraception. In short, in the words of the <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/133536p.pdf">the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [PDF]: "By participating in the accommodation, the eligible organization has no role whatsoever in the provision of the objected-to contraceptive services." While courts might defer to a religious organization's interpretation of its own religious beliefs, courts should not defer to its interpretation of federal law. </p>

<p>Moreover, exemptions are not granted for every religious burden, only substantial burdens. Even if paperwork somehow did facilitate contraception use, it would not amount to a substantial burden on religion. The link between the employer's actions here and the employee's use of contraception is far too attenuated. Paying a salary above minimum wage facilitates contraception use by making it more affordable. Indeed, it arguably facilitates contraception use more directly than opting out of contraception coverage, yet few would seriously argue that religious non-profits should be exempt from the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-8">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> as a result. Clearly, not every act of facilitation implicates religious liberty. To hold otherwise would be to disregard Congress's decision to reserve religious exemptions for substantial burdens. </p>

<p>Even if a law substantially burdens religious exercise, religious exemptions are still not available if the law passes strict scrutiny. The <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> court recognized that the contraception mandate advanced compelling state goals. Granted, it was a tepid confirmation by Justice Kennedy's controlling concurrence, but he did acknowledge that the mandate furthers "a compelling interest in the health of female employees." In addition to its centrality to women's health&#8212;<a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contr_use.html">over 99 percent</a> of women who have ever had sex have relied on contraception&#8212;contraception is also essential to women's autonomy and equality. It is fundamental to autonomy because women cannot be autonomous agents without the power to decide what happens to their own body. It is core to equality because without the ability to control when or whether to have children, women cannot participate equally in the social, economic and political life of this country. There is also a strong argument&#8212;and one <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/decision-contraception.html">endorsed</a> by the EEOC &#8212; that a health insurance plan that covers all basic preventive care except for contraception amounts to sex discrimination in violation of Title VII. </p>

<p>As for narrow tailoring, it is difficult to imagine an alternative that is less intrusive for employers than certifying that they have religious objections and seek an exemption. One gets the impression that the employers' real objection is not that they have to provide contraception, but that their employees are able to obtain it. In fact, some non-profit employers have argued that, like churches and other houses of worship, they should be <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/16/priests-for-life-to-defy-courts-birth-control-ruli/">absolutely exempt</a>. In other words, they will only be satisfied if the contraception mandate does not reach their employees.   </p>

<p>To the extent that a religious accommodation denies employees the same access to health care&#8212;or a safe workplace minimum wage or social security benefits&#8212;guaranteed to other employees, the accommodation burdens the very people employment laws like the ACA was designed to protect. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act should serve as a shield, not a sword. It should especially not serve as a sword when wielded by employers against their employees. Employees finally have a right to health insurance that covers contraception without cost-sharing. It is they who should decide whether or not to exercise this right, not their employers&#8212;and certainly not because officially stating an objection to contraception is deemed a substantial burden on employers' religious beliefs. Allowing employers to circumvent federal employment protections on such thin grounds not only resurrects Lochner-era exploitations, but also does so in a way that allows employers to impose their religious views onto their employees, who may very well not share them.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu/faculty/directory/fulltime/malcolm_joyce">Joyce Lee Malcolm</a>  of <a href="htp://www.law.gmu.edu/">George Mason University School of Law </a> discusses Vermont's evolving gun law...</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>uch to the frustration of gun control advocates who rate Vermont as "F," the state with the highest per capita gun ownership in the country and virtually no gun restrictions, has a murder rate <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/29/weak-gun-laws-and-high-gu_n_6572384.html">so low</a> it is "off the charts." The FBI reported that in 2012 there were just eight murders in Vermont of which only two involved firearms. As a 2014 article put it, Vermont is "<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/381136/vermont-safe-and-happy-and-armed-teeth-charles-c-w-cooke">Safe and Happy and Armed to the Teeth</a>." The <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/constitution-of-the-state-of-vermont/">Vermont Constitution</a> gives residents a robust right "to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the State." Any Vermont resident or visitor to Vermont who legally owns a gun can carry it. Various state statutes reinforce this right while local governments cannot pass gun restrictions without the approval of the state legislature. This Vermont model has inspired other states&#8212;Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Wyoming and now Kansas&#8212;to repeal their previous restrictions on bearing arms to allow legal gun owners to carry a weapon without any permit or special training. Thirty-nine states also now have "shall issue," rather than discretionary, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/02/17/growth-chart-of-right-to-carry/">concealed carry</a>, ensuring all law-abiding residents who fulfill basic requirements the right to carry a concealed firearm.</p>

<p>It is Vermont's traditional lack of gun restrictions that makes passage of the new firearms statute surprising. On second thought however the new regulations are less surprising than is their minimal impact, for while Vermont's exceptionally low rate of firearms crime has not changed, its population has. Guns are a partisan political issue throughout the country and Vermont's politics have altered dramatically. Vermont used to be a solidly Republican state. For more than a hundred years from 1854 to 1963, every governor of Vermont was a Republican. Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s though, residents of Massachusetts and New York began deserting urban areas seeking a more rural life. Vermont and New Hampshire were popular destinations, with New Hampshire's low taxes attracting more conservative immigrants, Vermont more leftist ones. Vermont's present governor, <a href="http://governor.vermont.gov/">Peter Shumlin</a>, is a Democrat. The state is the only one to send a <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2006/11/8/vermonts_bernie_sanders_becomes_first_socialist">socialist</a> to the US Senate. Buoyed by newcomers Vermont's population grew from about 400,000 in 1970 to more than 620,000 in 2014. In the presidential election of 2008 <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/new-vermont-is-liberal-but-old-vermont-is-still-there/?_r=0">Vermont</a> was candidate Obama's second best state, just behind his native Hawaii. This influx of new residents has altered the state's culture bringing more liberal views on land conservation, firearms and much else. Since removal of guns from civilian hands is a favorite Democratic Party goal, the fact that Vermont has managed very well without strict gun laws does not matter. Shumlin told reporters, "The current laws that Vermont has in place around guns serve us well," but when presented with the new legislation he signed it.</p>

<p>The current effort to impose more gun controls on Vermont is part of the recent national experience. The landmark cases of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2739870581644084946">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> in 2008 and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5141154246897960488">McDonald v. City of Chicago</a> in 2010, which acknowledged the individual right to keep and bear arms, overturning the strictest gun laws in the country, did not stop the political divide on the issue. While <span class="casename">Heller</span> affirmed the right to keep and carry a firearm for self defense and other lawful purposes it left the way open for the retention of gun regulations banning possession by felons and the mentally disturbed and preserving bans on gun carriage in such "sensitive places" as schools and court houses. And although the <span class="casename">Heller</span> opinion included the individual right "to bear" as well as "keep" arms since the Washington and Chicago laws that were overturned focused on banning possession, some courts and proponents claimed there was no right to carry a gun outside of the home. Both US Supreme Court cases were decided by 5/4 majorities leaving diehard gun control advocates hopeful they might be reversed. As a result efforts by the District of Columbia and states such as Maryland and New Jersey, for example, have continued to limit gun ownership as narrowly as possible, declaring gun carriage off limits in wide areas and demanding an applicant who wanted to carry a gun demonstrate a "good reason" for carrying a weapon that satisfies the local police.</p>

<p>After the Sandy Hook school massacre in December 12, 2012 there seemed to be a renewed opportunity to pass more stringent gun regulations. While President Obama's efforts to pass regulations through Congress failed, New York State and Connecticut both succeeded in passing sweeping new requirements. Even Vermont felt the pressure. The effort to pass new firearms restrictions is a part of the effort to control civilian firearms, within the scope, despite, if necessary, of <span class="casename">Heller</span> and <span class="casename">McDonald</span>.    </p>

<p>The new Vermont law appears to toughen background checks for ownership of a gun, a sure way to limit carrying a firearm, but the result must be a disappointment to the <a href="http://www.gunsensevt.org/">gun control groups</a> intent on passing truly expansive measures. The latest state legislative session saw defeat of a spate of potential new gun regulations, including a universal background check that would include for the first time all private sales. Virtually the only way such a requirement could be enforced, opponents pointed out, was through a universal gun registry. To gun rights advocates a gun registration would allow the government to know where privately owed guns were permitting their confiscation, as it has in other countries whenever a government decided to disarm citizens. The Vermont legislature handily defeated all the various proposals with the exception of an expanded, but not universal, background requirement, but one that simply duplicates the federal background prohibitions.</p>

<p>Since 1998 Vermonters like other Americans have been subject to the FBI <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/2013-operations-report">National Instant Criminal Background Check</a> before purchasing a firearm. Vermont's new legislation restricts purchase by people who have committed a violent felony and requires state courts to report findings of mental illness, designations that already prohibit those so-named from buying a gun. The rationale given for duplicating the federal requirement is that the US Attorney's Office does not always have the resources to prosecute these cases. How this would help is uncertain. John Campbell, the bill's lead sponsor, claimed this state prohibition against violent felons having a gun would be another "tool in the arsenal of stopping drug dealers from coming into the state."  </p>

<p>The second new aspect is the requirement that state courts report a finding of mental illness that would be entered in the records used for background checks. Anyone later found cured would have his/her name removed. New York State's similar requirement has met with vigorous opposition from the mental health community who fear it would keep people from seeking their help and brand everyone doing so as a potential threat to society. This is a legitimate concern, but so is the worry about anyone obtaining firearms whose mental illness made him a danger to himself or someone else.</p>

<p>Passage of any gun law in Vermont, however useless, has given gun control advocates bragging rights and does carry the potential to insist in the future that there are loopholes that must be plugged, beginning a round of ever tighter restrictions. The test will be whether the Vermont model survives in Vermont or whether the state's more liberal residents can bring it into the shrinking column of state intent on limiting firearms.</p>

		<title>Secured Transactions Regime in Palestine: Expectations and Challenges</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Ibrahim Fares discusses the challenges surrounding the adoption of the Secured Transaction Draft Law in Palestine...</p><strong>R</strong>ecently the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a part of World Bank Group, finished the final draft of the Secured Transaction Draft Law (STL) in cooperation with the Palestinian Ministry of National Economy and other related parties. The main purpose of the STL is to promote development of the Palestinian economy and its growth by creating new tools and opportunities; stakeholders raised many questions about the feasibility of this law in the Palestinian legal system. Notably, none of the Arab countries has such law in force yet. However, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan are still discussing their draft laws. Palestine is the sole Arab country that has finished a draft law, which is now at the president's office, ready for enactment. This <a href="http://www.palestinianbasiclaw.org/basic-law/2003-amended-basic-law">article</a> aims to highlight new developments in the STL, the scope of the STL, envisaged benefits and challenges facing such a law. </p>

                <p><strong>Challenges in the Current Secured Transaction Regime</strong><br />
                    <br />
                    The legal environment in Palestine, and in the Arab countries in general, does not support a secured transactions regime. Outdated and traditional secured transactions regimes pose a great obstacle for lenders and borrowers in trying to create modern business and expanding access to finance for small and middle business. Expanding access to finance is a significant factor in improving developing economies. In Palestine, limited access to credit remains one of the greatest barriers to economic growth and development. Thus, a reformed secured transaction regime is a necessity for the Palestinian economy. In Palestine, there are many legal problems in secured transactions regimes, including inadequate legal protections for borrowers and lenders, outdated regulations, and restricted access to credit. The Palestinian legal regime remains far from the rest of the world in terms of the legal rights assured to borrowers and lenders. Lenders&#8217; policy in establishing collaterals depends on creating immovable collateral, not movable collateral. How the STL will change such policy for lenders is a crucial issue. </p>

                <p><strong>Policy of the STL</strong></p>

                <p>The policies of the STL depend on two key points: an access to finances and availability of sufficient collateral. In Palestine, constrained access to finances remains among the top limitations on private sector growth. Such situations are not just in Palestine, but also in more than half of private firms in emerging markets. The <a href="https://www.wbginvestmentclimate.org/advisory-services/regulatory-simplification/secured-transaction-and-collateral-registries/impact-and-economic-rationale.cfm">number </a>of firms that use loans to finance investments in the developing world generally is half the number of those firms operating in countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (<a href="http://unispal.un.org/pdfs/AUS2122.pdf">OECD</a>)[PDF]. Creating a good legal framework of secured transactions would help the firms to access finances. The paper polices of the STL relies on &#8220;Access to Finance&#8221; as one of the main legislative polices and as part of the philosophy of the law. The policy also focuses on improving lending terms and improving financial system stability as main features in establishing a well-designed secured transaction regime. </p>

                <p>In Palestine, credit applications are often rejected for insufficient collateral, i.e. unacceptable or unsuitable collateral. Business owners don't apply for loans because they know that they cannot meet collateral requirements of <a href="http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/978-0-8213-6490-1">banks</a>. Unavailability of collateral is frequently not the problem; rather, it is the inability to utilize valuable assets as collateral. While in the developing world 78 percent of the capital stock of a business enterprise is typically in movable assets such as machinery, equipment or receivables, only 22 percent is in immovable property. Financial institutions are reluctant to accept movable property as collateral. Banks prefer real estate as collateral. As evidence to the efficiency of the secured transaction system, in the United States, movable property makes up about 60 percent of enterprises&#8217;. Capital stock and lenders consider such assets to be excellent sources of collateral. Movables account for around 70 percent of small-business financing. The asset-based lending industry in the US has grown rapidly since the mid-1970s, and movable asset lending has increased 40-fold over 30 years, reaching a total of US $400 billion. The industry has grown by 12 percent annually over the past ten years. Legalizing movable assets as sufficient collateral by providing broad protections to lenders upon default of borrowers is one of the main polices of the STL.</p>

                <p><strong>Envisaged Benefits Upon Reform the Secured Transaction Regime </strong> </p>

                <p>In Palestine, a majority of businesses are micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The MSMEs have therefore been operating in a weak legal environment with inefficient financing opportunities, tight resources for up-scaling, a weak marketing ability and limited access to markets. Providing legal structures in which movable assets in the Palestinian market can be effectively used as collateral will significantly improve access to finances by firms that need it most. A sound legal and institutional infrastructure is critical to the maximization of economic potential of movable assets so that they can be used as <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/doing-business-2005">collateral</a>. Well-functioning secured transactions systems enable businesses to use their assets as security to generate capital, from the farmer pledging his cows as collateral for his annual operating line of credit to the seller of goods or services pledging the cash flow from customer accounts as collateral for business expansion. An economic analysis suggests that small and medium-sized businesses in countries that have stronger secured transaction laws and registries have greater access to credit, better ratings of financial system stability, lower rates of non-performing loans and a lower cost of <a href="https://www.wbginvestmentclimate.org/uploads/20080Smart%20lesson_Alejandro_423T210149_AccesstoFinanceandCollateral.pdf">credit</a>[PDF].</p>

                <p>The lender provides loans secured by the assets of the borrower. The STL has determined several types of collateral. Collateral may include accounts receivable, inventory, raw materials and work in process, machinery, vehicles, intellectual property rights or other assets where value can be determined. The secured lender may establish a revolving credit facility where the borrower provides a pool of collateral that the lender translates into operating cash or working capital. The lender agrees to grant a line of credit up to a maximum amount, which is secured by a borrowing base made up of inventory, receivables and cash. Notably, in the current situation the new types of collateral established in the STL are not used as collateral. Upon implementation, the STL lenders would be hesitant to use these collaterals, and they may take time to start accepting them.</p>

                <p>Well-designed secured transaction systems contribute to robust financial systems by promoting credit diversification, allowing non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) to provide credit (reducing the dependence on bank credit) and rely less on real estate collateral. Financial institutions (FIs) benefit from these systems by: (i) being able to diversify their portfolios by accepting movables, including more liquid assets such as receivables or investment instruments; (ii) having access to information on existing collateral interests in movable assets and their priorities; and (iii) making possible better reporting mechanisms on collateralized lending practices to the supervisory or regulatory authority, usually central banks.</p>

                <p><strong>Scope of the STL</strong> </p>

                <p>The proposed law applies to all transactions where a debt or other obligation is secured by movable collateral, regardless of the legal form of the transaction. The proposed law&#8217;s provisions for registration and prioritization of interests also apply to leases of goods and the sale of accounts receivable and secured sales contracts. The proposed law&#8217;s scope specifically excludes claims on employee pay, the sale of accounts receivable and secured sales contracts as part of the sale of a business, assignment of accounts for collection and assignment of a right to payment if the assignee must also perform. The STL includes all types of relevant interests that modern laws include. It provides for simple and quick creation of a collateral interest and provides for it to be effective between the parties without registration. It also sets out a transparency-based priority scheme that conforms to modern standards. The STL calls for notice registration and provides that it can be the optimal electronic registry that enforces registration standards without human judgment. And finally it provides for quick and effective enforcement of a collateral interest in case of default by the debtor. The STL includes all of the key features of modern secured transactions laws that support access to credit based on movable collateral. </p>

                <p>A great influence is expected on the Palestinian economy once the STL enters in force. &#8220;It is a revolution in the financial field.&#8221; an expert in the IFC, said. However, there are concerns related to addressing legal provisions of the STL by relevant parties. Judges are not familiar with some legal provisions, like using movables assets as collateral. They may not understand how a machine may secure one loan or more. Lawyers are not familiar with some legal terms like &#8220;receivable accounts.&#8221; Such terms, when translated to Arabic, are ambiguous. Lenders and borrowers are not familiar with using an electronic private registry. These parties should be aware of their rights and commitments.Therefore, the IFC is studying holding specialized courses about implementation of the law for all relevant parties. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Stoyan Panov of the <a href="https://www.ucf.uni-freiburg.de/university_college_freiburg">University College Freiburg</a> [German] briefly discusses the criminalization of crimes against humanity in Bulgaria ... </p>

<p><strong>I</strong>n early May 2015 a group of 12 MPs in Bulgaria proposed an amendment <a href="http://www.justice.government.bg/15/">bill</a> [Bulgarian] to the Criminal Code of the Republic of Bulgaria with the purpose to introduce domestic criminalization of crimes against humanity such as murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation or forcible transfer of population, torture, persecution and enforced disappearance, which would be particularly relevant for eventual prosecutions of former Communist officials pertaining to crimes committed during the Communist regime between 1944 and 1989. The bill aims at eliminating the existing contradiction between declaring that prosecution and punishment of crimes against humanity are not time-barred by a statute of limitation and the fact that codification and definition of crimes against humanity in domestic legislation have been absent.</p>

<p><strong>Proposal for Criminalization of Crimes against Humanity</strong></p>

<p>The bill introduces the definition of the crimes against humanity in Part IV of the Criminal Code under proposed Articles 418a and 418b. This is the most important aspect of the bill regarding crimes against humanity. It should be noted that currently the <a href="http://www.legislationline.org/documents/section/criminal-codes">Criminal Code</a> contains provisions for crimes against the peace, war crimes and crimes against the customs of war, genocide and apartheid, but not a separate, specific codification for crimes against humanity (see <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/mandate-and-mission">ICRC</a>). This deficiency must be corrected in order to abide by various international obligations to prevent, prosecute and punish such crimes.</p>

<p>The proposed section on crimes against humanity follows verbatim the language of <a href="http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/english/rome_statute(e).pdf">Article 7(1) of the Rome Statute</a> [PDF]. In this manner, the new Article 418b will contain the most relevant contemporary definition of crimes against humanity. The bill introduces criminalization of an act, defined as a crime against the peace or a crime against humanity in international treaties, which are in force for the Republic of Bulgaria. The domestic criminalization of crimes against humanity will fill the existing gap for effective national prosecution, thus making the fulfillment of the obligation to prosecute and punish such crimes more adequate. The alternative approach towards prosecution and punishment of crimes against humanity as ordinary crimes under domestic law may be not sufficient, because such a method would not fully reflect the seriousness, nature and uniqueness of international crimes. Additionally, procedural obstacles such as the application of statute of limitation on domestic level hinder the fulfillment of the obligation to prosecute core crimes including crimes against humanity. Legislation with express definition of what constitutes crimes against humanity ensures proper prosecution and respect for the rights of the potential defendants as reliance on international custom pertaining to crimes against humanity in civil law states such as Bulgaria has been problematic in light of the applicability of the legality principle. The codification ensures that the state will be able to uphold its customary and conventional obligation to prosecute crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>According to Article 79(2) of the Criminal Code, the statute of limitation is not applicable to crimes against peace and crimes against humanity. The bill affirms the non-applicability of the statute of limitation to such crimes as it contains a section on the non-applicability of the statute of limitation to the said crimes, which applies retroactively to discontinued or suspended trials on the grounds of the statute of limitation defense. The proposed amendment additionally introduces an explicit clause that excludes the application of the statute of limitation to a group of crimes, classified as "grave crimes against human rights" pertaining to crimes against the person, civil rights crimes and crimes against the family and youth perpetrated between September 9, 1944 and November 10, 1989 by officials of the Bulgarian Communist Party as well as third persons with delegated official or party functions. </p>

<p><strong>Reasons for the Proposed Amendment to the Criminal Code</strong></p>

<p>The proposed amendment attempts to respond to a problematic decision by the Supreme Court of Cassation of July 2002 in which the court terminated the criminal proceedings of the so-called "Communist Camps" trials, based on statute of limitation for the alleged crimes. The court took a narrow procedural interpretation instead of substantively addressing the alleged acts as crimes against humanity during the Communist regime. The confounding situation arose since the alleged crimes were not categorized as crimes against humanity because the Criminal Code did not proscribe crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>The introduction of specific clauses excluding the applicability of the statute of limitation to core crimes of international law and providing the definitions of crimes against humanity is the correct approach, because the current situation indicates partial criminalization or related legislation, but no <em>per se</em> crimes against humanity national legislation. The legal system is facing a confounding situation in which there has been an imprescriptibility of international crimes without providing actual definition of the crimes in the Criminal Code.</p>

<p>Hence, several reasons could be outlined for the proposed amendment. First, Bulgaria is a State party to the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-6&chapter=4&lang=en#EndDec">1968 UN Convention</a> on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity. Article 4 of the 1968 Convention requires Bulgaria as a State Party to "adopt, in accordance with their respective constitutional processes, any legislative or other measures necessary to ensure that statutory or other limitations shall not apply to the prosecution and punishment of the crimes [against humanity] and that, where they exist, such limitations shall be abolished." The temporal scope of the obligation under the 1968 Convention is clear: the retroactive application is affirmed in Article 1 of the 1968 Convention which stipulates that "no statutory limitations shall apply to the following crimes, irrespective of the date of their commission." Hence, the Convention applies retroactively before its entry into force for each State Party. Second, the <a href="http://www.bcnl.org/en/articles/682-constitution-of-the-republic-of-bulgaria.html">Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria</a> contains a clause in Article 31(7) which states that statutory limitation for prosecution and punishment is inapplicable to war crimes and crimes against humanity. Third, the scope of the crimes against humanity in the amendment is codified to mirror the definition of the Rome Statute. In this manner, the bill aims at closing the loopholes in the domestic legal order pertaining to crimes against humanity from substantive and procedural points in order to ascertain that Bulgaria meets its responsibility to prevent and punish crimes against humanity.</p>

<p><strong>Statute of Limitation and Crimes against Humanity</strong></p>

<p>The main criticism of the proposed legislation pertains to the non-applicability of the statute of limitation to crimes against humanity, but it is unsubstantiated. The requirements of the 1968 Convention are primarily procedural as regards the non-applicability of the statute of limitation to core crimes of international law. The purpose of the proposed amendment is not to revive stale claims and create injustice. To the contrary, the bill aims at closing the impunity gap for crimes perpetrated during the Communist regime which have not been subject to any effective prosecutions so far. In this manner, the state will oblige to its international duty to submit such cases for the purpose of prosecution.</p>

<p>The passage of time is still recent for the alleged atrocities, and reliable and complete evidence is also available. In this manner, the amendment would not violate Bulgaria's ECHR obligation either, as prosecution of crimes against humanity was decided to be non-time barred by statute of limitations in the <span class="casename">Touvier v France</span>. The court found that crimes against humanity were imprescriptible as they fell under the exception of Article 7(2) of the ECHR.</p>

<p>The issue of retroactivity is also mentioned as an eventual predicament for prosecution of the acts perpetrated in the period of 1944-1989. However, there is a strong indication that the alleged acts committed by officials of the Communist regime, especially in the concentration camps including murder and torture, in persecutorial state policies or in deportation or forcible transfer of population, may constitute crimes against humanity at the time of their commission, and the lack of criminalization could not be used as a reason to circumvent the applicability of Article 15(2) of the ICCPR and international obligation to prosecute such crimes since international law does not prevent "the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations." The non-applicability of statute of limitation for crimes against humanity is a well-established norm of international law and statutory limitations should not be abused as a bar to prosecution and punishment if a prosecutorial action is not commenced in timely manner due to imprecise domestic provisions. The principles of legal certainty, foreseeability and predictability will not be breached as the Bulgarian government envisaged as early as 1965 that prosecution was not time-barred for crimes against humanity in passing a Decree on the non-applicability of statute of limitation to crimes against the peace, crimes against humanity, war crimes, Nazi and Fascist crime. As long as the alleged criminal activity constitutes a crime against humanity, the issues of retroactivity or statutory limitations should not be applicable or problematic.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=7&ved=0CC8QFjAG&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdo.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Famauryreyes&ei=C3VuVYzQFO3gsATwxIHYCA&usg=AFQjCNH-nytdGkqIteXExQOqGuc7VXxxrg&sig2=Iar8EI4Z5_h0H-q_0fZx_w&bvm=bv.94911696,d.aWw">Amaury A. Reyes-Torres</a>, of <a href="http://www.uia.mx/english/">Iberoamerican University</a> in the Dominican Republic, discusses the constitutional questions the US Supreme Court justices are facing when deciding same sex marriage cases ... </p>

<p>The case for equal marriage is the case of Constitution, tradition and time. We witnessed during the oral arguments of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-556q1_3j4a.pdf">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> [PDF] before US Supreme Court ('SCOTUS') how interrelated these concepts can be. It came to our attention the different contentions made on how there is no single word in the Constitution about same sex marriage. Also, Chief Justice Roberts worried about how a decision by the court will affect further debates and how the pretensions of same sex couples may be changing the nature of the institution. We also heard Justice Kennedy expressing his doubts about how a decision by the court might affect as well an institution that is "millennial."</p>

<p>These questions and doubts clearly express the issue of how time affects our understanding of the law. When is it the right time to read the law in one way or another? Are we ready for a change? Is it better for political branches to decide this or that? What is the role of the court in a deep and morally dividing issue? </p>

<p>Unlike many postwar contemporary constitutions, the US Constitution is written with few words but, like any other western constitution, it speaks with a lot of voices. Constitutions are subjected to the changing conditions of a given society: the society of today is not the society of tomorrow, no matter how much or how little time has passed. Given that the document is so short in its length and that many of its clauses do not provide a definitive answer on contentious issues, it is always a good time to remember the immortal words of Chief Justice Marshall in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9272959520166823796">McCulloch v. Maryland</a>: "[W]e must never forget that it is a Constitution we are expounding." </p>

<p>I believe Justice Souter had this in mind in a particular dissent where he laid down his understanding of constitutional interpretation and its relationship with time and tradition. Sailing through the questions about when it is proper to hold a new claim under the substantive <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process</a> clause, Justice Souter believes that time has an effect on the opinion of society regarding particular topics. In his dissent in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-6.ZD1.html">District Attorney's Office for Third Judicial District v. Osborne</a> he said that</p>

<blockquote>"Changes in societal understanding of the fundamental reasonableness of government actions work out in much the same way that individuals reconsider issues of fundamental belief. We can change our own inherited views just so fast, and a person is not labeled a stick-in-the-mud for refusing to endorse a new moral claim without having some time to work through it intellectually and emotionally. Just as attachment to the familiar and the limits of experience affect the capacity of an individual to see the potential legitimacy of a moral position, the broader society needs the chance to take part in the dialectic of public and political back and forth about a new liberty claim before it makes sense to declare unsympathetic state or national laws arbitrary to the point of being unconstitutional. The time required is a matter for judgment depending on the issue involved, but the need for some time to pass before a court entertains a substantive due process claim on the subject is not merely the requirement of judicial restraint as a general approach, but a doctrinal demand to be satisfied before an allegedly lagging legal regime can be held to lie beyond the discretion of reasonable political judgment." </blockquote>

<p>As for the equal marriage case we should ask ourselves the following: is time, as a requirement for a judgment on substantive due process claim, a good argument for judicial restraint? No necessarily. Time is a key component to any reading of the Constitution, but there is no sacred formula to hold when enough time has passed or how developed is the conscience of the society on certain issues. Time is important but what happens during that time is important as well. The journey is worth as much as the destination when it comes to constitutional interpretation. </p>

<p>Of course, the public "needs the chance to take part in the dialectic of public and political back and forth about a new liberty claim before it makes sense to declare unsympathetic state or national laws arbitrary to the point of being unconstitutional," as Souter once said. However, a long period of time for the development of political ideas is no longer needed. Our sincere compromise in discussions and the manner in which we discuss the issues such as equal marriage shape our understandings on a topic without the need of a large period of time. Our views change so fast in so little time thanks to deliberation, self-reflection and how we use courts as a principled scenario to extend democratic discussions when the political branches fail. </p>

<p>The continuous development of our moral and political ideas due to deliberation shows that tradition <em>per se</em> cannot stop us from questioning the possible interpretations of constitutional provisions. By asking the proper questions we loose the ropes of history and tradition to push for a new understanding of the Constitution. As Kennedy once said: "[H]istory and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry." (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-1337.ZC1.html">County of Sacramento v. Lewis</a>).</p>

<p>The equal marriage cases are a good example of this. We can cite four momentums that in such a short time have led to a shift in the mind of the people in the discussion on equal marriage beyond "normal politics" (B. Ackerman) and tradition: 1) SCOTUS decision on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17758055891258118781">Romer v. Evans</a>, where it held that a state constitutional amendment violated the equal protection clause by discriminating against people due to their sexual orientation; 2) <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas,</a> when it overruled a precedent that upheld the constitutionality of a provision that criminalized sexual encounters between consenting adults; 2) <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">Windsor v. US</a>, where it struck down article 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-104hr3396enr/pdf/BILLS-104hr3396enr.pdf">Defense of Marriage Act</a> [PDF] (DOMA) for discriminating against same sex couples; 3) a large number of federal courts striking down bans on marriage for same sex couples, using a <span class="casename">Windsor</span> as the argument of choice; 4) the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/100614zor.pdf"><em>certiorari</em> denial</a> [PDF] by the court in a group of marriage cases post-<span class="casename">Windsor</span> that let stand decisions that held that the ban against same sex couples to get marry is unconstitutional; and 5) <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm">more recent polls</a> reveal a significant increasing support for equal marriage.</p>

<p>These momentums, since 1996, had sparked a serious discussion on the rights of same sex couples under the Constitution. This discussion has been taking place in forms different from our traditional democratic mechanisms. The rise of social networks and digital journalism breaks with the centralized control of information and opinion, and the public benefits from this new paradigm. By discussions in TV, Twitter, Facebook, journalism or Op-Ed columns and other means, these momentums had been the force that had been shaping the discourse of political actors, private individuals and organizations towards equal marriage. All of these remind us that voting is not the only process by which we deliberate in a democracy: deliberation is something bigger than this.</p>

<p>That is why there is always a parallel discussion going on that sooner or later might have an epistemic impact in our continuous deliberation: we might change our views or reaffirm them. There is continuous deliberation going on and there are compelling indicators that show where most of the public stands on equal marriage. And more importantly, people are discussing this issue taking into account that there is a Constitution that leads the way to forge a society on certain principles: like it or not, people use the Constitution and its principles as a powerful argument.</p>

<p>Due to deliberation, there is a voice that the court needs to listen to that has a serious liberty claim under the due process clause. It is time to comply with the only tradition that must be kept in democratic societies and that is to read the Constitution as the blueprint for a community that seeks equality, freedom and dignity. </p>

<p>Whatever happens, it is clear that we are in the face of another constitutional moment (B. Ackerman). And that constitutional moment, without a doubt, will have a significant impact on everyone and on those countries in which the constitutional tradition is influenced by the US constitutionalism. </p>

		<title>Why the US Should Adopt VAT</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist João Gonçalves of the <a href="http://www.fd.ulisboa.pt/en/">Universidade de Lisboa, Faculty of Law</a> discusses the advantages of VAT for an economic system... </j:header><br />
<strong>E</strong>urope may seem the worst class of students for the US to find for fiscal lessons, but as the necessity for a new revenue strengthens and a call for a tax reform, even if minor, grows louder, it is time to adopt the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/index_en.htm">Value-Added Tax</a> (VAT). Curiously enough, the US is the only country in the OECD that has not adopted the VAT&#8212;yet. Ironically, <a href="http://www.house.mi.gov/hfa/Archives/PDF/singlebusinesstax.pdf">the first form of VAT</a> [PDF] appeared in the State of Michigan in 1953. In 1954, in order to recover from the war, the French implemented the VAT in such a way that it convinced everyone else. Prior to that, all European countries had turnover taxes. This means, in very broad terms, that at that time, instead of having a 20 percent tax on consumption, the government taxed every stage of production, charging a previous VAT. In other words, it would be 20 percent plus 40 percent plus 60 percent&#8212;only to be deducted on the last stage. So if this system brings in more money, why did everyone adopt VAT? For two reasons: one is that the VAT system, where everyone asks for invoices, is an intrinsic, built-in anti-fraud system. This system ensures that the players in the chain of production are paying their taxes. If something goes wrong, the money is only lost on the last transaction&#8212;the rest has already been collected by the government. Reason number two is the fact that a turnover tax is intrinsically a non-neutral tax. Decisions of economic operators are going to be influenced by the fact that any tax that they are charged with represents a cost to them and they are going to try to minimize the costs, thus making decisions  based on tax, rather than based on any other economic reason. In its pure form, VAT is neutral. And we want neutrality because when a player starts to make tax-based decisions, such decisions render allocation of resources less effective. Yet it needs to be applied uniformly to all goods and services in an economy because it raises the prices of everything proportionally. Therefore, no product or service gains an artificial comparative advantage over another. This is why VAT exemptions or low rates are not welcome&#8212;it would dissipate the VAT advantage.</p>

<p>So is VAT the best money-making machine system? Yes, it absolutely is. In Europe, the <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/community_acquis_en.htm"><em>acquis communautaire</em></a>was not the only thing responsible for adopting VAT&#8212;the International Monetary Fund <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/fad/news/fadbroch.pdf">influenced everyone</a> [PDF], even outside of Europe, by establishing VAT as a sure way to generate revenue. In addition, it will not distort competition and therefore will not hamper economic growth. However, some could point out the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp">Laffer Curve</a> where, if you raise taxes high enough, at some point consumption and revenue are going to start decreasing. If you push the VAT rate sufficiently high, consumption will retract and revenue will come down. But every time VAT rates increase, the optimal point seems to go up also. Revenue always increases. Either there is no such thing as a Laffer Curve, or we have not reached it yet. And Europe has put this theory to the test, over and over again&#8212;Denmark went up 10 percent, Germany, Italy and Turkey went up 8 percent. If the US were to have a 20 percent VAT, it would raise 8 percent of GDP; just under &#8364;1,7 trillion in higher taxes in 2019. A tax increase of this magnitude would raise the federal tax burden between 33 and 44 percent above its historical average. Also, in the fiscal year of 2011, if the US had had a VAT tax of 20 percent, it would have had more revenue than corporate income tax and individual income taxes altogether.</p>

<p>Now let us address specifically why the US does not have the VAT? There are several reasons. First of all, because of the transitional costs&#8212;the costs of moving from one tax to another. There is a huge administrative burden from moving from one tax that only requires a check on one transaction to a tax that has to check every transaction, although its administrative costs would be derisive given VAT financial gain. Another reason is that the VAT is not a good way to redistribute wealth. While for personal income taxes one can take into account personal circumstances, the VAT is by nature a regressive tax. This means that it does not take into consideration the household income. Some economic experts may say it is not regressive, but when taking into consideration the margin of utility, there is little room for doubt. If household A spends &#8364;1000 per month on groceries, they will have a VAT of, for example, 20 percent&#8212;that equals &#8364;200. Whereas household B, which spends only &#8364;200, will be taxed on the same percentage resulting in &#8364;20. But those €20 mean much more to the latter than the &#8364;200 means to household A. A way to go around this problem is by adding VAT to the US currency system, allowing for a balance of some of the regressivity with the income tax.</p>

<p>VAT is more important, more so now, than direct taxation. This is because there is more unemployment, and this causes a downward pressure on the employed income. This is why personal income taxes have been decreasing in revenue. Concerning corporate income taxes rates around the world, since the 1960's no country has increased corporate income taxes. This has to do with mobilization and mobility of income; mobility of capital leads to tax competition. In the US, it is worth mentioning the Delaware effect&#8212;Delaware was lacking an industry and decided to have almost no regulation for companies, no minimum capital for company establishment and very attractive corporate income tax rates. The effect refers to all the other states that tried to return companies to their home states by creating similar conditions, also known as the race to the bottom. So, because tax competition is a global phenomenon, particularly intensive within the US and Europe, there is a downward pressure on corporate income taxes. Countries are constantly under pressure to decrease their rates of corporate income tax. At the same time, during the down term, profits decrease. Reduced rates are a bad idea, alongside with exemptions as aforementioned. Rather than being worried about reducing the rate for, for example educational school books, one can just give a personal income tax credit for school books. These are ways that are more effective in protecting low income households. Also, from a legal standpoint, reduced rates establish an enticement to engage in aggressive tax planning&#8212;its consequences include double deductions (i.e., the same loss is deducted both in the state of source and residence) and double non-taxation (i.e., income which is not taxed in the source state is exempt in the state of residence) and the application of different rates of VAT to similar products. Also, there would have to be a uniform high rate for general goods, in order to avoid new consumption trends and businesses trying to manipulate their own merchandise like <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/showPdf.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130de6bb733b8133648008e34b937bd02eaa3.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4ObxqRe0?text=&docid=57067&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=243271">Marks and Spencer</a> did when they applied a standard rate for their teacakes therefore giving them a competitive disadvantage to other companies in the markets that applied a VAT reduced rate. They said that, a) in order to have costumers buy their products, they had to artificially decrease the price of sale; b) If they had not paid the standard rate of VAT, they could lower the prices and/or have a bigger profit margin and in this way they lost market share because they had a standard rate of VAT for 20 years. Because of this, the key criteria to define what is a cake or a biscuit is by what happens when they go stale: if it stays hard, it is a cake; if soft, it is a biscuit.</p>

<p>Congress should consider the following: more is not always better. After the credit crisis, everyone understood the necessities for an interchangeable mindset of spending/saving. And although consumption also makes the economy thrive, increased taxation will not hinder the economy&#8212;while high spending creates a short-lived economic high, saving and investing mage for longer-term sustainable growth, because businesses use capital to expand their operations, and entrepreneurship use them to begin businesses. Taxing saving and investment reduces their attractiveness to individuals and increases the cost of raising capital for businesses. And, like everything, the rate change is easy and convenient and it should be intertwined with the current economic situation.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Sarah Lamdan of the <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/index.html">CUNY School of Law</a> discusses the urgent need for federal agencies to reform their records management and data preservation and search functions so that they are not crippled by FOIA requests for email account data and other types of Internet generated electronic records that fall under the FOIA... </p><strong>A</strong>s the US House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform hosted <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/hearing/ensuring-agency-compliance-with-the-freedom-of-information-act-foia/">hearings</a> this week to take a closer look at the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) as a transparency tool and barriers to information access, journalists, FOIA scholars and others interested in government transparency complained about agency stonewalling, slack and stagnation when faced with requests for agency records under the federal information access law. Frustrations with current FOIA processes and practices were understandable in light of agency's hefty FOIA request backlogs, significant delays in FOIA request responses (one FOIA user, Jason Leopold, <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/vice-news-foia-terrorist-jason-leopold-to-testify-before-congress">reports</a> that less than 1 percent of his requests are satisfied within the statutorily mandated 20-day time limit), and other information blockages forcing FOIA requestors to rely on FOIA litigation to pry information from government agencies, often long after the information is newsworthy or useful to the public interest.<br />
Although some of these FOIA failures may be the result of poor FOIA implementation by the agencies or tactical efforts to withhold potentially damaging or sensitive materials from the public, a larger reason for FOIA failures is likely outmoded data storage practices and poor data searching techniques within agencies databases and information storage systems. A continuing FOIA struggle at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) highlights the data collection and search issues facing federal agencies.</p>

<p>Richard Windsor is the alias assigned to an email account used by former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson to communicate with people from her EPA post. People who used the email address included Cass Sunstein, eventual leader of the White House's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, who called the private account Jackson's "<a href="http://thehill.com/regulation/energy-environment/297255-former-epa-chief-under-fire-for-new-batch-of-richard-windsor-emails">special email</a>." The emails going into and coming out of the Richard Windsor email account flew under the government records radar, skirting government records preservation and transparency laws like the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/chapter-31">Federal Records Act</a> and FOIA by hiding Jackson's messages under a nom de plume.</p>

<p>In 2012 a conservative think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) discovered that Jackson had been using the <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/04/10/lisa-jackson-speaks-candidly-on-secret-epa-email-account/">second email account</a>, Windsor.richard@epa.gov, to conduct EPA business. CEI has since <a href="https://cei.org/richard-windsor">filed</a> several FOIA requests to EPA and subsequent lawsuits in federal court to obtain the emails contained in the Richard Windsor account. </p>

<p>If the facts in this Richard Windsor email case sound familiar, it may be because they are similar to those in news stories about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/03/10/hillary-clintons-emails-a-timeline-of-actions-and-regulations/">Hillary Clinton's private email account</a> that she used as Secretary of State. Publicity about Clinton's non-government email account started a national debate about government officials' email records, and their inclusion in laws that require government records to be properly preserved and made available to the public. <a href="http://www.govexec.com/technology/2015/03/hillary-clinton-not-alone-using-private-emails-govern/106545/">A recent study confirms that Clinton and Jackson are not alone</a> in using secondary email accounts as government executives. Although in Clinton's case, she did not make up an alias or use a ".gov" email address, many of the information transparency implications are the same and the application of existing government rules are just as tenuous.</p>

<p>The political grandstanding surrounding the Clinton emails also appears in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/18/epa-government-transparency-foia-public-information-sunshine-week">Jackson's case</a>. CEI openly disfavors many EPA policies and equates the EPA to "<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/419080/americas-own-fifa-epa-iain-murray">America's Own FIFA</a>" in terms of corruption. The think tank has been accused of harassing the EPA by filing extensive, extremely broad FOIA requests. CEI senior fellow <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/chris-horner-foia-epa-white-house-93264.html#ixzz3buszzJz3">Chris Horner admits</a> that these requests are not mere information gathering, but also political tactics saying, <blockquote>"I'm simply working the corner across the street from the environmentalist or other, generally leftish pressure groups who have been far more active in this area for far longer. What I do is fill a void, flattering the other side with imitation."</blockquote></p>

<p>However, even if the FOIA requests are politically-driven ploys, the documents at issue in CEI's FOIA requests fall within the FOIA's parameters, and the EPA's fulfillment of CEI's FOIA request should not take an eternity (CEI's most recent lawsuit alleges that, at the EPA's current pace, it will take over 100 years to fulfill the FOIA request), nor should they administratively cripple the agency. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/18/epa-government-transparency-foia-public-information-sunshine-week">The current state</a> of the EPA's record management systems is obviously ineffective for responding to FOIA requests for online data. CEI's FOIA requests seemingly broke down the EPA's FOIA infrastructure by requiring the processing of tens of thousands of emails. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/18/epa-government-transparency-foia-public-information-sunshine-week">According to an EPA employee</a>, the Richard Windsor request had attorneys from the Office of the Executive Secretariat working full time for four months including weekends, without tending to any other business, leading to other requests being put on hold. In a time of EPA budget cuts, three attorneys from the Office of General Counsel, EPA's chief legal advisors, also had to assist with the processing.</p>

<p>Federal agencies must do better to preserve government transparency in the Internet age. With the rapidly increasing use of multiple email addresses, cloud computing and document storage and online social media (like Twitter and Facebook) by people working in the federal government, the contours of government records are continually changing, and the need to begin collecting more and more online data as part of government records management grows more urgent. Emails, Tweets and memos tucked away in Google Drive may seem like mere missives, but as these online systems become primary forms of communication and information sharing, the documents within them will likely become pieces of American history and the (virtual) papers that shape national policy.</p>

<p>Jackson's FOIA email case demonstrates that times are changing for federal records collection and preservation, highlighting the altered world of government transparency in the Internet age. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2012/m-12-18.pdf">The federal government is thinking about these changes</a> [PDF], working with the National Archives and setting benchmark goals for <a href="http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/email-mgmt.html">improving email preservation</a> by 2016 and switching fully to electronic records management by 2019. The formulation of these goals are steps in the right direction, but in an age where electronic media and communication are rapidly eclipsing any other record formats, now is an ideal time for government agencies to be even more innovative and swift in progressing to holistic digital preservation and search systems, taking honest looks at the existing troves of agency information and determining how it could be most efficiently delivered to the public.</p>

<p>Another important revelation of the FOIA email cases is sheer volume of data collection that must be undertaken by the government to comply with transparency and records preservation laws in the Internet age. As the massive amounts of email and online communication become part of FOIA's parameters, the FOIA process may become more like e-discovery, where an entire new specialty has developed around collecting and sifting through the multitudes of emails and Internet data necessary for the discovery process in most court cases. Government agencies may have to develop systems not just for preserving email records, but also for sorting through them and making them publicly accessible in an efficient manner. Looking into the innovations of e-discovery and large-scale database search products may be a logical next step for agencies as they modernize their records management systems. </p>

<p>As CEI continues its <a href="https://cei.org/content/new-epa-email-lawsuit-challenges-administration's-transparency-claims">FOIA campaign</a> into Jackson's email accounts, it becomes clear that government agencies must create a more streamlined, efficient systems for electronic communication transparency so that we can more easily satisfy these electronic, Internet-driven FOIA requests and improve government transparency, allowing agencies to dedicate more time and resources to dealing with the substantive regulatory issues.</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/">Magna Carta</a> sealed by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/john.shtml">King John</a> on <a href="http://www.historyextra.com/article/medieval/15-june-1215-true-date-magna-carta">June 15, 1215 </a>in Runnymede England is one of the world's most important legal documents. It has become an ageless symbol of bringing raw power under the rule of law. We celebrate its 800th anniversary.  </p>

<p>Receiving a digital-age commemoration, the Magna Carta now has its own Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/magnacarta800th">handle</a>: hardly adequate tribute. Even in a form exponentially-longer than 140 characters, it is near-impossible to overstate the importance of the Magna Carta to our nation's revolutionary founding, to our Republic's constitutional framing and to our people's ongoing faith in freedom under law.     </p>

<p><strong>Magna Carta Was Foundational to America's Founding/Framing.</strong></p>

<p>Magna Carta stood for the rights due to all Englishmen. American colonists sailed across the Atlantic, however, reading Sir <a href="http://lawlibrary.wm.edu/wythepedia/index.php/Third_Part_of_the_Institutes_of_the_Laws_of_England">Edward Coke's Institutes</a> and <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/john-locke">John Locke'</a>s Treatises on Government as annotations of the Great Charter. <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/penn/bio.htm">William Penn</a> adopted parts of the Magna Carta (a/k/a the "Great Charter") for his <a href="http://www.constitution.org/bcp/frampenn.htm">Province of Pennsylvania'</a>s remarkably progressive governance. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html">Declaration of Independence</a> adopted both the Magna Carta's core thesis and its specificity by listing grievances against the King. The separation announcement, however, was not addressed to an abusive King-in-Parliament, but was broadly published out of "a decent respect to the opinions of mankind." And its articulation of unalienable, Creator-endowed rights were applicable not just to Englishmen, but to all humankind.    </p>

<p>The 1787 Framers paid tribute to the Great Charter with the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/overview">US Constitution</a>'s structure of separated powers and balanced federalism. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Article I</a> enumerated, and thus limited, the bicameral Congress's national legislative authority. And Article I also implemented novel restrictions on old, oft-practiced governmental abuses: no legislative punishments (attainders), no retroactive acts (<em>ex post facto</em> laws) and no unlimited confinements (<em>habeas</em> writ suspensions).   </p>

<p>The 1215 Magna Carta and its influence on English constitutionalism gave a glimpse of the possibility for an executive-in-check. The 1787 Framers knew that the Republic needed a strong executive. The <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1776-1783/articles">1781 Articles of Confederation</a> had failed in-large-part because it vested all authority and duty in an incompetent, dysfunctional Congress. The newly independent states had suffered similar bad experiences&#8212;legislatures can not govern. In less than a generation (from 1776 to 1787), the Framers were able to largely "move beyond" their King-phobia (the roots of which traced back before abusive King John through King George III). They implemented the idea an executive-in-check. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Article II</a> thus creates a president; a single person charged as commander in chief, given appointment discretion to efficiently govern, and trusted with powers to enforce the law. And <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> charges the two political branches to create a Supreme Court and a lower court system staffed with neutral judges placed far above politics. As Magna Carta chapter 45 promises: "We will appoint as justices, constables, sheriffs, or other officials, only men that know the law of the realm and are minded to keep it well." </p>

<p>However Article I allows for the removal of the independent judges and the powerful executive by House impeachment and Senate trial conviction. In accord with the Magna Carta as a transformative instrument, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlev">Article V</a> allows a constitution-altering process. It is the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">Bill of Rights</a> the first 10 of such amendments that most directly enshrines specific Magna Carta chapters. The 1781 Bill of Rights takes Great Charter ideals for <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process</a>, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">jury trials</a>, speedy trials, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">proportional punishment</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">property compensation</a>. The 1215 baronial courage mustered to march on London and then personally confront King John's abuses with Magna Carter finds fitting tribute in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment's</a> freedom-guarantees of religion, speech, association and grievance petitioning.     </p>

<p><strong>Lawyers Take the Lead in the 800th Anniversary Celebration</strong> </p>

<p>Since our founding, Americans have honored the Magna Carta in equal measure as have our English cousins, perhaps with somewhat greater enthusiasm. The <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/aba.html">American Bar Association</a> deserves particular praise for its long record of Magna Carta reverence. In 1957 the ABA built the first monument at Runnymede. </p>

<p>For the 800th anniversary the ABA <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_800-year_reunion_aba_to_hold_commemorative_events_in_2015_to_mark_magna">launched</a> comprehensive celebration and education programs in conjunction with Mother England's solicitors, barristers, silks and judges. It is a year-long celebration. <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">US Chief Justice John Roberts</a>'s 2014 ABA <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/magna_carta_should_inspire_lawyers_to_rise_above_partisanship_solve_problem">speech</a> in Magna Carta tribute deserves special note. </p>

<p>Over 150 Supreme Court opinions have cited the document; indeed a 2012 Roberts' religious freedom <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6711345368740496870">ruling</a> did so. Odds are low among London bookmakers that there will be another such Great Charter citation in majority and/or dissenting opinion(s) for this Court term's marriage cases [<a href="https://scholar.google.nl/scholar_case?case=497090211360466192">Obergefell v. Hodges</a>]. One of the better known Magna Carta provisions involved marriage equality and freedom, chapter 8 declared "No widow shall be compelled to marry, so long as she wishes to remain without a husband."  </p>

<p>Also celebrating the eight centennial, the Law Library of Congress prepared an <a href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/magna-carta-muse-and-mentor/public-programs.html">exhibit</a> and hosted a series of lectures, and the Cato Institute most recently presented global perspectives of the Magna Carta. Elsewhere however, some academics use the occasion to minimize the Magna Carta's actual High-Middle-Age impact. They accurately note that King John quickly persuaded <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/288633/Innocent-III">Pope Innocent III</a> to annul the document. And snarky New Yorker-type commentators entertainingly write of "Magna Carta myth." </p>

<p>Yet the renown English historian William Stubbs <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/magna-carta-eight-centuries-of-liberty-1432912022">stated</a> that "the whole constitutional history of England is little more than a commentary on Magna Carta." In balance is the analysis of the late-Thomas Bingham, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: "The significance of Magna Carta lay not only in what it actually said, but in what later generations claimed and believed it has said."</p>

<p><strong>Two American Celebrations in 2015</strong></p>

<p>At the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/two-magna-cartas-in-dc/2014/10/30/a24d2853-79ac-47cb-84c0-e200ba6591f7_story.html">1939</a> Worlds Fair in New York, 13 million Americans lined up to see an original Magna Carta displayed. Today Americans can easily Google and Twitter to both see the Magna Carta and instantly access historic amounts of information. We can personally plot the inflection point of King John's capitulation. Together we should all celebrate how much Magna Carta bent&#8212;what another King described as &#8212;the "moral arc of the universe." How long? Not long because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. On this side of the pond we also celebrate, in 2015, the <a href="http://www.selma50.com/">50th</a> Anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery civil rights march. Martin Luther King, Jr. concluded that march with his "How Long, Not Long" speech. It was delivered on the same Alabama Capitol steps where Governor George Wallace had just two years before pledged "segregation forever." Again raw power brought under the rule of law.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.dal.ca/faculty/law/faculty-staff/our-faculty/diana-ginn.html">Diana Ginn</a> of <a href="http://www.dal.ca/faculty/law.html">Schulich School of Law</a>, Dalhousie University, discusses the debate surrounding the freedom of religion held by private and public schools in Canada with regards to curriculum...</p><strong>I</strong>n<a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2015/2015scc12/2015scc12.html"> Loyola High School and John Zucci v. Attorney General of Quebec </a> the Supreme Court of Canada addressed the issue of religious freedom in the context of teaching religion and ethics in a private Catholic school. In 2008 Quebec introduced an Ethics and Religious Culture (ERC) program, which it made mandatory in public schools. The program is taught from a secular perspective and is intended to "develop three competencies among students: the ability to understand 'religious culture'...[t]he ability to reflect on ethical questions; and the ability to engage in dialogue." The Minister of Education has the discretionary power to authorize equivalent courses in lieu of mandatory ones in private schools. Loyola High School applied for permission to replace the ERC curriculum with a course taught primarily from a Catholic perspective. The Minister refused to grant the exemption, and Loyola sought judicial review on the basis that the Minister's decision was an unreasonable restriction on freedom of religion. Loyola's position was clarified as the litigation proceeded: by the time the matter reached the Supreme Court, the school had committed to teach the doctrine of other world religions from a neutral stance but claimed the right to teach about the ethics of other religions, as well as about Catholicism, from a Catholic perspective. The Minister maintained that all aspects of the curriculum must be taught from a secular viewpoint. The Supreme Court found that the school's religious freedom had been unreasonably infringed, with the majority and minority disagreeing over whether all or only part of the Minister's decision failed the test of reasonableness.</p>

<p>The decision in <span class="casename">Loyola</span> provides a companion piece to <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2012/2012scc7/2012scc7.html">S.L v. Commission scolaire des Chenes</a>, where the court held that the mandatory nature of the ERC program did not infringe the religious freedom of public school parents who objected to the curriculum.  Rather than concluding that a refusal to allow exemptions from the ERC course limited freedom of religion, and then inquiring whether this limitation was justifiable, the court in <span class="casename">S.L.</span> held that freedom of religion had not been limited in the first place. In reaching its conclusion in <span class="casename">S.L.</span>, the Court placed significant weight on the state's duty of neutrality and commitment to multiculturalism. </p>

<p>Previously in these pages I argued that using principles of neutrality and multiculturalism "as the lens through which to determine whether freedom of religion has been infringed, rather than as a strong argument at the justification stage" risks diluting the constitutional protection of freedom of religion. In <span class="casename">Loyola</span> the court distinguished <span class="casename">S.L.</span> on the grounds that Loyola is a private Catholic school "created to support the collective practice of Catholicism and the transmission of the Catholic faith". Certainly this distinction is relevant, but the import of Loyola goes beyond this, remedying to some extent <span class="casename">S.L's</span> narrow approach to freedom of religion. <span class="casename">Loyola</span> marks a welcome return to earlier cases that defined religious freedom more broadly and is to be celebrated for its understanding of the secular multicultural state as including "respect for religious differences."</p>

<p>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects freedom of religion and conscience. However, even constitutionally-entrenched rights and freedoms are not absolute. If it is shown that legislation restricts a Charter right, <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html">section one</a> of the Charter allows the government to try to persuade the court that the restriction is reasonable and "can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society." Where the Charter violation arises not from legislation but from an administrative decision (as in this case, with the Minister's refusal to grant an exemption), the test is whether the decision reasonably balances protection of Charter rights with the objectives of the legislation under which the decision-maker is acting. Thus, <br />
<blockquote>[t]he reasonableness of the Minister's decision depends on whether it reflected a proportionate balance between the statutory mandate to grant exemptions only when a proposed alternative program is "equivalent" to the prescribed curriculum, based on the ERC's goals of promoting tolerance and respect for difference, and the religious freedom of the Loyola community who seek to offer and wish to receive a Catholic education.</blockquote></p>

<p>The court in <span class="casename">Loyola</span> recognized that the state "has a legitimate interest in ensuring that students in all schools are capable, as adults, of conducting themselves with openness and respect as they confront cultural and religious difference" and that religious freedom does not automatically "trump core national values" such as "equality, human rights and democracy." However, the court also recognized that the Minister's statutory power to authorize alternative equivalent programs in private schools would be an empty promise of flexibility if the alternative program "had to be identical to the mandatory program in every way." The Minister's position that any departure from "strict neutrality" would fail to meet the government's goals (namely, to promote respect for others and diversity) was found to be unreasonable by the Supreme Court. Specifically, four of the seven justices who decided the case held that prohibiting Loyola from teaching about Catholicism from a Catholic viewpoint "had a serious impact on religious freedom" and did not fairly balance that freedom with the statutory scheme under which the Minister was acting. They accepted, however, that it was reasonable for the Minister to require Loyola to teach "the ethics of other religions in a neutral, historical and phenomenological way." The majority of the court set aside the Minister's decision and directed her to reconsider Loyola's application for an exemption. </p>

<p>The remaining three justices would have gone further. Characterizing Loyola's proposed approach as encompassing both a focus on Catholic doctrine and teachings and "a full and rich exploration of non-Christian religious beliefs, and ethical perspectives that do not mirror Catholic moral teachings", these justices held that the Minister of Education had erred in taking the "flawed" position that "only a cultural and non-denominational approach could serve as an equivalent" to the ERC program. In their view, religious freedom would be insufficiently protected by "merely grant[ing] an exemption for Loyola to teach Catholicism from a Catholic perspective, while requiring an unmodified curriculum and a neutral posture in all other aspects of the program." Treating other religious perspectives with respect&#8212;something Loyola had committed to do in its proposed program&#8212;did not require that these other viewpoints be presented as "equally legitimate and equally credible." They found that such a requirement would be "incompatible with religious freedom." Rather than remitting the matter to the Minister, the three justices writing the minority opinion would have ordered that Loyola be granted an exemption from the ERC program.    </p>

<p>Given Loyola's commitment to teach about the beliefs of other religions from a neutral perspective, the court was divided only on the issue of whether the same approach was required for teaching about the ethical standpoint of other faiths. The majority held that requiring the school to teach the ethics of other religions "as objectively as possible does not seriously harm the values underlying religious freedom". The minority, however, was of the view that "[b]inding Loyola to a secular perspective at all times, other than during their discussion of the Catholic religion, offers scant protection for Loyola's freedom of religion, and would be unworkable in practice."</p>

<p>I prefer the minority's reasoning on this as it would be stifling and perhaps impossible for a school committed to teaching Catholic doctrine to present, for instance, the pro-choice arguments on abortion as having the same legitimacy as the Church's stance on the issue. However, it is possible that the majority and minority decisions are not poles apart, since the majority's phrase "as objectively as possible" does seem to provide some acknowledgement of the difficulty of attaining complete neutrality. </p>

<p>Taken as a whole, there is much to celebrate in the Supreme Court's handling of the issues in Loyola. Perhaps the most significant moment of the decision comes when Justice Abella, writing for the majority, states: "The pursuit of secular values means respecting the right to hold and manifest different religious beliefs. A secular state respects religious differences, it does not seek to extinguish them". This is an extraordinarily important point, distinguishing as it does between secularism and secularization, that is, distinguishing between the state avoiding favoritism among religions or as between religion and non-religion, and the state seeking to erase religion or at least profoundly privatize and marginalize it. The former stance is in accord with the Canadian constitution's protection for religious freedom&#8212;the latter is not. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.unh.edu/about/personnel/faculty/buzz-scherr-bio">Albert Scherr</a> of the University of New Hampshire School of Law, discusses the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice's new rules regarding torture...</p><strong>F</strong>or the past four and a half years, the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (the "Commission") has been working on a revision of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the "Rules"). The Rules have been in existence in some form since 1957. This most recent effort sought to revise the Rules adopted in 1977. The Commission has relied on a series of efforts by an intergovernmental expert group to develop a draft that considered developments in the area of prisons and other facilities holding individuals who had been convicted, charged or detained without charges.  The Rules also exist in the context of other international norms set by the UN, such as the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms (BPUFF), which are applicable to all law enforcement officials.</p>

<p>On May 18, 2015, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (the "Rapporteur"), Juan E. Méndez, addressed an "<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/SRTorture/OpenLetterUNCommission18Mai2015.doc#sthash.j2Nvjitw.dpuf">Open Letter</a>" to the chair of the Commission, which was due to consider the final revised draft of the Rules (tentatively designated as the "Mandela Rules. The Rapporteur's mandate operates within the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 25:13. The Rapporteur has participated regularly in the process of revision. The letter reflects his mandate to ensure "an updated set of procedural standards and safeguards from the perspective of the prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment that should be applied, at a minimum, to all cases of deprivation of liberty." (Open Letter at 2). Both the Rapporteur's open letter and the revised Mandela Rules adopted by the Commission and forwarded to the UN General Assembly reflect an international consensus on norms that put the Mandela Rules in conflict with current US law and/or practice in three areas: torture; solitary confinement and the role of medical professionals.</p>

<p>In regards to Torture Rule 6 of the Mandela <a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/commissions/CCPCJ/CCPCJ_Sessions/CCPCJ_24/draft_reports/E-2015-30-E-CN.15-2015-19/E2015_30_ECN152015_19_ADVANCE_UNEDITED.pdf">Rules </a> [PDF] states: "All prisoners shall be treated with the respect due to their inherent dignity and value as human beings. No prisoner shall be subjected to, and all prisoners shall be protected from, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, for which no circumstances whatsoever may be invoked as a justification. The safety and security of prisoners, staff, service providers and visitors shall be ensured at all times." The prohibition on torture tolerates no exception and has even less ambiguity than previous rules. The US Senate on June 18 2015 passed the "anti-torture" amendment would apply the Army Service Manual's definition of prohibited interrogation conduct to all government agencies, not just the military. Previously, under the Bush administration, the Army Service Manual ban on torture had applied only to the military, excluding, most importantly, the CIA, the locus of allegations of torture by the US government. The famous Yoo <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/safefree/yoo_army_torture_memo.pdf">memorandum </a>[PDF] of 2003 made the argument that the President's war authority trumped international law on the issue of torture.</p>

<p>In 2009, President Obama issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations">Executive Order</a> applying the Army Service Manual definition more broadly to the US government, including to the CIA. On June 18 the US Senate passed the "anti-torture amendment" effectively codifying the Army Services Manual as the law of the land for interrogations. Even so, current US law, including the uncertain and undisclosed breadth of the president's war powers, does not reflect the "no exceptions" clarity. The Mandela Rules also call for investigations and prosecution of those who have engaged in violations of the norms as well as access to detainees.  The <a href="http://antitorture.org/latest-news/%206/4/15">Rapporteur </a>very recently noted that his request to the US government to have access to Guantanamo detainees has, as yet, received no response. The Obama administration has also chosen not to prosecute those who are alleged to have engaged in torture during the early years of the war on terrorism.</p>

<p>The Rapporteur's Open Letter notes that he has long called for a ban on prolonged or indefinite solitary confinement. The Mandela Rules prohibit the use of prolonged solitary confinement, defined as more than fifteen days. That <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/04/25/the-alcatraz-rockies/a0BWrZjRpmQatMsfm8FUOL/story.html">approach</a>has not been the practice of the US or state governments. Most often, the Guantanamo detainees have been in solitary confinements.The US prison's "super-max" facility in Colorado houses over 400 inmates in what is effectively solitary confinement permanently over the course of life sentences. Attention to the issue of solitary confinement in US prisons and jails has not gained much attention in the media and the evolution of reforms in that area has been, at best, slow. However, one member of the Supreme Court has taken up the issue aggressively.  On June 18, 2015, Justice Anthony Kennedy spoke up forcefully about solitary confinement in a concurring opinion in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1428_1a7d.pdf">Davis v. Ayala</a>. <br />
<blockquote>Yet if his solitary confinement follows the usual pattern, it is likely respondent has been held for all or most of the past twenty years or more in a windowless cell no larger than a typical parking spot for twenty-three hours a day; and in the one hour when he leaves it, he likely is allowed little or no opportunity for conversation or interaction with anyone.  It is estimated that 25,000 inmates in the United States are currently serving their sentence in whole or substantial part in solitary confinement, many regardless of their conduct in prison.</blockquote> Justice Kennedy made it evident that he was quite troubled by current practices in the US to the extent of saying: <blockquote>In a case that presented the issue, the judiciary may be required, within its proper jurisdiction and authority, to determine whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them.</blockquote> He concluded by quoting Dostoyevsky, "The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons" and saying "There is truth to this in our own time." </p>

<p>The US <a href="http://www.prisonpolicy.org/global/">practices </a>stand in contrast to the international norm articulated in the Mandela Rules.  This is not to say that, by any stretch of the imagination, the United States is the sole offender.  But, it incarcerates a dramatically larger percentage of its citizens than any other country in the world.</p>

<p>The Rapporteur also highlighted the issue of the developing independent role of medical professionals in the treatment of prisoners as reflected in the revisions in the Mandela Rules. He emphasized that the Mandela Rules supported "the independence of healthcare professionals, their duty to refrain from participating in torture or other ill-treatment, and their role in detecting such ill-treatment and reporting it..." In April 2015, a group of psychologists and members of the American Psychological Association (APA), published a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/01/us/document-report.html">report </a>alleging that the APA was complicit "in the CIA torture program, by allowing psychologists to administer and calibrate permitted harm, undermines the fundamental ethical standards of the profession." More specifically, the group alleges that the APA coordinated with officials from the CIA, White House, and the Department of Defense to create an APA ethics policy on national security interrogations that comported with legal guidance authorizing the CIA torture program. Along with allegations that the APA had numerous contacts with CIA contract psychologists related to interrogation techniques. However this particular dispute is resolved, the issue of medical professionals' involvement in interrogations and, it appears, the development of torture techniques is relatively new in US public policy debates.  The norm established by the Mandela Rules may contribute to a healthy debate amongst psychologists, military and prison professionals.</p>

<p>The perspective that these brief comparisons offer provokes two additional thoughts. The US is anything but alone in struggling with issues about torture, solitary confinement and the independence of medical professionals in the custodial/interrogation environment. And, the ongoing debate is increasingly a public one with at least a limited measure of disclosure of core information. However, the developing international norms call for much more.  The Rapporteur receives little in terms of formal response from the US government.  A significant portion of politicians and the American public are wedded to the image of American exceptionalism, unsupported by the facts in the areas described above - the idea that "we are better" and need not heed international norms. Too many figures in power in the US scorn the value and utility of international law, be it conventions, treaties or norms like the Mandela Rules (for example, see Jens David Ohlin, The Assault on International Law, Oxford University Press, 2015 documenting the current and historical skepticism in the US towards international law). The work of the Rapporteur and the drafters of the Mandela Rules as to torture, solitary confinement and the independence of medical professionals provides a thoughtful and significant reference point as the debate in America about full participation in the international community marches on.  </p>

		<title>Four Things the FIFA Scandal Tells Us About International Criminal Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Albert E. Scherr of the <a href="http://law.unh.edu">University of New Hampshire School of Law</a> discusses four outcomes of the FIFA scandal in the context of international criminal law... </p><strong>T</strong>he FIFA scandal has dominated recent international sports news. As FIFA's annual conference was about to begin, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and">US Department of Justice</a> charged high-level soccer executives and several sports marketing/media executives with racketeering, money laundering, wire fraud and conspiracy spanning more than a decade. The allegations of criminal conduct included kickbacks, bribes, undisclosed and illegal payments and unauthorized World Cup ticket sales.</p>

<p>Seven of the high-level soccer executives were arrested, not in the US and not by American police. Rather, the Swiss police arrested them in Switzerland at a five-star hotel in Zurich with American law enforcement officials looking on. And much, if not all, of the alleged conduct occurred outside the US, engaged in by citizens of Uruguay, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Venezuela etc. Four of the 14 defendants' whereabouts are unknown and Interpol continues to search for them. It is expected that several of those arrested will fight return to the US where the cases will be prosecuted. Only <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/soccer/soccer-exec-cut-deal-fifa-corruption-probe-article-1.2243020">one defendant</a> was arrested in the US.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, criticized the US for engaging in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/sports/vladimir-putin-fifa-corruption-soccer.html?_r=0">"another blatant attempt ... to extend its jurisdiction to other states."</a>  He defended the FIFA president and aligned those arrested with Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. A Russian news agency asserted, "The United States, which plays soccer, not football, has drawn its best resources to investigate a foreign scandal, to meddle into affairs of others and impose its rules and laws."</p>

<p>International criminal law itself does not provide an international criminal justice system under which most types of crimes can be charged. But the body of international law does recognize, by default at least, the value to the international community as a whole of individual countries charging individuals who are not their citizens or residents with crimes. At the very least, the extent of the reach of a country's criminal statutes act both as a substitute for an "international statute" and as a way of filling an otherwise gaping enforcement and punishment gap created by what would be a form of immunity.</p>

<p>The FIFA scandal brings to the fore at least four things about international criminal law in this context:</p>

<p><strong>1. No international judicial system or court exists that can handle the FIFA scandal.</strong></p>

<p>The two most obvious candidates are the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) and the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC). Neither have jurisdiction over this scandal. <br />
The ICJ is the primary judicial branch of the UN. The ICJ handles disputes between nations: <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/court/index.php?p1=1">"The Court's role is to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States and to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies."</a> The ICJ is not a court with criminal jurisdiction nor does it resolve disputes between a private entity and a nation that involves criminal conduct, as does the FIFA scandal.</p>

<p>The ICC is an independent international organization governed by what is called the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Rome statute</a> [PDF]. It is not part of the UN system. It is a permanent, treaty-based court "established to help end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community." Currently those crimes are identified as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The crimes alleged by the US prosecutors in the FIFA scandal do not fall within the ambit of the ICC's jurisdiction.</p>

<p><strong>2. US prosecutors can charge someone even if <em>some or</em> all of the conduct occurred outside US territorial boundaries and even if the defendant is not a US resident or citizen.</strong></p>

<p>Some of the conduct alleged in the FIFA indictments occurred outside the territorial boundaries of the US. Neither the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html">Constitution</a>, <a href="http://uscode.house.gov">US statutes</a> nor international law prohibit the FIFA prosecutors from charging an individual under the US criminal code. Some US statutes explicitly provide for this possibility and others have been interpreted to allow for such a possibility. For example, several of the defendants in the FIFA indictments were charged with racketeering, a charge frequently used against what some call criminal enterprises. Some of the schemes involved in the FIFA organized crime or racketeering indictments occurred in part or in whole outside the US and US federal courts have said that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-96">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act</a> (RICO) can apply to schemes and criminal enterprises outside the US as well as those within the US. And many international scholars recognize that the country can exercise its criminal jurisdiction over the conduct as long as it fits within one of five jurisdictional principles:<br />
1) Territorial jurisdiction: based on the location of the alleged crime or extra-territorial acts intended to produce detrimental effects within the nation;<br />
2) Nationality jurisdiction: based on the nationality of the offender;<br />
3) Protective jurisdiction: based on the protection of the interests/integrity of the nation;<br />
4) Universality jurisdiction: for certain crimes where custody of the offender is sufficient and<br />
5) Passive personality jurisdiction: based on the nationality of the victim.<br />
The FIFA indictments allege more than enough conduct to meet several of these criteria. The defendants in the FIFA scandal are citizens of at least ten countries. However, the nationality of the defendant does not determine whether a US federal prosecutor can charge that individual with a federal crime.</p>

<p><strong>3. Other countries retain the power and right to charge the FIFA defendants under their domestic statutes no matter what the outcome of the US prosecutions.</strong></p>

<p>The FIFA defendants come from a number of countries. If the country of residence/citizenship or in which some of the conduct may have occurred has statutes prohibiting such conduct and/or allowing for extra-territorial jurisdiction over conduct occurring in other countries, the defendants could also be charged in those countries. The American constitutional principle of double jeopardy does not prohibit the prosecution of a defendant in another country that has statutes prohibiting conduct exactly like the conduct charged by the American prosecutors. Those charges could be concurrent in time with the US charges or they could follow the resolution of the US charges. The country that has custody of the defendant either directly or through the extradition process most often proceeds first in its prosecution effort. Sometimes, custody over the defendant reverts to the next country upon completion of the sentence, if convicted. Sometimes, custody is transferred to the country with the next-in-time charges after conviction and sentencing, but before the serving of the sentence.</p>

<p>To simplify, the US does not have exclusive domain over charges against the FIFA defendants. In fact, it appears that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/06/04/world/africa/ap-soc-fifa-investigation-south-africa.html">South Africa is conducting an investigation</a> into bribes related to awarding the 2010 World Cup to that country even though the current FIFA indictments cover that conduct.</p>

<p><strong>4. The law of Extradition most likely determined the choice by the US prosecutors to arrest six defendants in Zurich, Switzerland</strong></p>

<p>Swiss police arrested six of the defendants in Zurich. Some have questioned why Switzerland was the locus of arrest when the charges were not of Swiss origin nor were any of the arrested defendants Swiss. The law of extradition may offer some explanations. Extradition is the process by which a criminal justice system brings an individual who has been charged and then arrested outside the charging jurisdiction back to for trial. In the US, a uniform process exists for bringing defendants back to the charging state from another state. When the arrested individual is outside the US, any formal extradition process depends upon whether the charging country and the holding country have an extradition treaty. <br />
In form, international extradition treaties are relatively similar. For example, the process allows for a defendant to challenge the extradition request in the courts of the holding country. Several FIFA defendants have expressed a desire to challenge extradition. </p>

<p>In substance, such treaties vary. The treaties are not as simple as a charging country extraditing a person from the holding country for any crime. Many such treaties articulate a specific list of crimes for which a country will extradite. For example, Switzerland has an <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CDOC-104tdoc9/html/CDOC-104tdoc9.htm">extradition treaty</a> with the US. It does not allow for extradition for tax crimes, but does allow it for the FIFA crimes.<br />
Even if the charging and holding countries have an extradition treaty, the government of the holding country can make what is essentially a political decision not to extradite an individual. For example, in the FIFA scandal, some have suggested that countries like Argentina, Venezuela and Paraguay may choose not to complete the extradition process by declining to formally approve extradition once the court process is complete. That result might be for reasons of the health of a defendant, concern about possible punishments or political concerns. It is very possible that US prosecutors chose to arrest six defendants in Zurich not only because it is easier to arrest six in one country than six in six different countries but also because the extradition process will work more predictably in Switzerland than in some other countries.</p>

<p><strong> ***</strong><br />
Without doubt, the wrongs for which a criminal justice system might hold the FIFA defendants responsible are primarily those affecting FIFA itself, an international organization, and the international community&#8212;football players, fans etc. Though by location of commission, the crimes are country-specific the harms are much more to global institutions and the global community, undifferentiated by country. Yet, no international criminal justice system exists designed to hold individuals responsible for these harms, and so attentive countries, powerful countries, aggressive countries and imperialistic countries with all the strengths and weaknesses of their individual systems fill the gap.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://cldp.doc.gov/about-cldp/staff-bios/adam-al-sarraf">Adam Al-Sarraf</a>, International Program Specialist at the <a href="http://cldp.doc.gov/">United States Department of Commerce</a>, discusses Iraq's new commercial court...</p> <br />
                Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, the US Department of Commerce or the Commercial Law Development Program.</p>

                <p><strong>F</strong>aced with the prospect of a failed state, Iraq's main political blocs reached a compromise agreement that has allowed the country to slowly confront its internal and external threats in order to achieve some level of stability. Despite ISIS's successes in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/06/isis-mosul-iraq/395531/">Mosul</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/18/asia/isis-success-and-failure/">Ramadi</a>, the Iraqi government, supported by the international coalition, has made significant progress in containing Daesh's (ISIS) expansion and in retaking cities such as Tikrit earlier this year. However, in order to address the root causes of Iraq's instability and turn the tide against ISIS, Iraq will need to achieve real economic growth as quickly as possible to create jobs for the newly liberated areas. Unemployment and the lack of basic services fuel much of the terrorism that threatens the lives of Iraqis, and ISIS and other terrorist groups have capitalized on this reality to reinforce their ranks and propagate their ideology.</p>

                <p>While the Iraqi legislature has enacted an <a href="http://trade.gov/static/iraq_investmentlaw.pdf">Investment Law</a> [PDF] to provide incentives to foreigners to invest, and the Iraqi executive branch is attempting to address investor concerns through an <a href="http://investpromo.gov.iq/">amendment</a> to the Investment Law, the Iraqi judiciary has achieved significant progress in creating an efficient and predictable legal environment for foreign companies. It did so through the creation of a system of <a href="http://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2014/228872.htm">commercial courts</a>, whose decisions have been deemed fair by foreign companies. The early track record of these courts suggests that they will play an important role in moving Iraq from its socialist past, when foreign investment was viewed as a source of suspicion and mistrust. However, the courts alone will not be able to provide the long-term guarantees that are needed to transform Iraq's legal environment for businesses, foreign and domestic, to thrive. Since Iraq is civil law country, the legislative and executive branches will need to enact comprehensive legislative and regulatory reforms to Iraq's intellectual property, investment and arbitration systems, among others. Without a codified set of modern laws and regulations, the courts will be limited to gap-filling measures that are susceptible to narrow or inconsistent application. </p>

                <p>By way of background, in 2009, while the Iraqi government was rolling out its first oil bid rounds, the <a href="http://irfad.org/iraq-government/">Iraqi Higher Judicial Council</a> (HJC) announced that it would start training Iraqi judges in modern commercial law topics with the goal of assuaging the concerns of foreign companies and investors. The HJC was fully aware of the country's unemployment problems, of the need for foreign investment and international trade and of the complaints of both foreign and Iraqi companies that Iraqi courts were not capable of handling complex commercial disputes in an unbiased manner. Aware of the growing trend of business courts in the US, the UK and the Middle East, such as Egypt, the HJC sought to apply these successful models to the Iraqi context by creating its own specialized commercial courts, staffed by judges highly trained in commercial matters. The HJC focused its training efforts initially on letters of credit, international arbitration and intellectual property disputes given their critical roles in international business transactions. The HJC inaugurated a multi-phase training program in 2009 with the Commercial Law Development Program of the US Department of Commerce to prepare Iraqi judges for the new courts, the first of which was eventually created in Baghdad in 2010. The HJC subsequently expanded its training efforts to include other regional and international technical assistance providers following the court's establishment.</p>

                <p>In order to achieve its two primary goals, efficiency and specialization, the judiciary limited the new commercial court's jurisdiction to commercial disputes involving at least one foreign party. Moreover, the matter in dispute had to be of a commercial nature, as defined by the <a href="http://gjpi.org/library/primary/statutes/">Iraqi commercial code (No. 30 1984)</a>, which includes 16 separate categories for commercial activities, an example of how Iraq's outdated commercial laws may tie the hands of Iraq's judges. A modern commercial code should expand the categories of commercial activities to include modern transactions such as e-commerce and technology transfer.</p>

                <p>According to the HJC procedure every Iraqi court would be required to transfer a case to the Baghdad Commercial Court if it fell within the latter's jurisdiction as defined above. The HJC assigned two judges for the Baghdad Commercial Court based on their performance in the specialized training programs. According to the HJC's latest statistics the Baghdad Commercial Court has adjudicated 1146 cases out of a total of 1252 cases filed since its inception.The average trial length for these cases is 60 days,according to the HJC, with many cases finally decided in as few as 30 days. The court's impressive efficiency is a dramatic improvement on Iraqi courts' past record when adjudication of commercial cases would take months and sometimes years on crowded dockets that included both civil and criminal cases. </p>

                <p>Pro-government bias is a concern for foreign companies operating in any jurisdiction, a key reason that international arbitration is required in most international business transactions. Even when international arbitration clauses are included in contracts, national courts can find for a national government party by refusing to enforce contract rights, such as the right to resort to arbitration, or by refusing to enforce foreign arbitral awards. This can become a significant deterrent to foreign investment and trade. Furthermore given the Iraqi government's hostility towards international arbitration, the Baghdad Commercial Court was uniquely aware of the importance of demonstrating its ability to enforce contract rights, rights that are enshrined in Iraqi law as "the law of the contracting parties" and to specifically enforce the contractual right of parties to resolve their disputes outside of Iraqi courts.</p>

                <p>In the area of transparency, the Baghdad Commercial Court began to publish summaries of its major decisions in English and Arabic on the HJC website. The HJC's most recent statistics show that no less than 40% of the Baghdad Commercial Court cases have been decided against the Iraqi government and  in favor of the foreign company. Moreover the Baghdad Commercial Court has achieved significant progress in adapting international principles to cases involving arbitration and intellectual property, which were affirmed by Iraq's highest civil courts, thereby setting major precedents for Iraqi courts.</p>

                <p>In the area of arbitration Iraqi courts' past hostility to arbitration and the government's failure to join the <a href="http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention.html">UN Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards</a> (<a href="http://www.newyorkconvention.org/">New York Convention</a>) exposes companies to the risk that their arbitration agreements and awards will not be enforced in Iraqi courts. However, in 2011, the <a href="http://cldp.doc.gov/programs/cldp-in-action/details/653">Baghdad Commercial Court</a> heard a case involving international arbitration in a dispute between an Italian company and the <a href="http://www.mof.gov.iq/Pages/MainMof.aspx">Iraqi Ministry of Finance</a>. The Baghdad Commercial Court decided to revisit Iraq's longstanding interpretation of the arbitration provisions of its civil procedure code. Iraqi courts previously held that international arbitration was not explicitly recognized in Iraqi law and dismissed requests for enforcement for lack of jurisdiction. However, in 2011 the Baghdad Commercial Court broke with past precedent and held that the civil procedure code did not distinguish between international and domestic arbitration. In determining if a valid arbitration agreement existed, the court referred to the New York Convention and to the UNCITRAL model law to supplement Iraq's civil procedure code. This decision, which was affirmed by Iraq's Court of Cassation, is binding on lower courts, establishing a firm judicial position for enforcing international arbitration agreements. While this decision is historic in its interpretation of arbitration-related provisions, it is also critical in demonstrating the Iraqi courts' ability to enforce contract rights against a government party.</p>

                <p>According to the HJC's latest statistics at least eight cases have been decided by the Baghdad Commercial Court involving the enforcement of an international arbitration agreement. However, we have yet to see if this new interpretation will allow Iraqi courts to enforce foreign arbitral awards, a critical issue for foreign trade and investment. The courts will need the support of a domestic arbitration law or, ideally, a law ratifying Iraq becoming a party to the New York Convention, so that they have a sound legal basis for enforcing foreign arbitral awards without judicial review of the merits. The legislative and executive branches would need to take the lead in passing either or both of these laws.</p>

                <p>In the area of intellectual property the Baghdad Commercial Court has decided two landmark trademark cases, involving multi-national companies that were challenging decisions by Iraq's Trademark Office to register knock-off trademarks. In both <a href="http://www.agip.com/Agip_Country_Service.aspx country_key=140&service_key=T&lang=en">decisions</a>, the Baghdad Commercial Court relied on international principles to find that the knock-off products created confusion in the Iraqi marketplace.The Court ordered the Iraqi Trademark Office to cancel the trademarks of the knock-offs and to register the original trademarks.This is yet another example of gap-filling measures where Iraqi courts are faced with a 1950s era trademark law that will need to be updated for Iraqi courts to consistently and effectively apply international best practices.  </p>

                <p>Since 2010, the HJC has created two additional commercial courts in BasraBasra and Al-Najaf, where there is significant commercial activity related to Iraq's oil industry and religious tourism respectively The creation of these three specialized courts and the subsequent development of judicial precedents have helped to level the playing field for foreign investors.  As such the judiciary has been able to provide foreign companies with a degree of assurance that their investments and resources in Iraq will be protected. However, this is not enough. The Iraqi government will ultimately need to pass and enforce new laws to provide guarantees to foreign investors, reduce corruption and diversify its economy in order to create the level of economic growth that is needed to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure and dramatically reduce unemployment.</p>

		<title>Amnesty International Report on Police Use of Force</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.duq.edu/faculty/wesley-oliver">Wesley Oliver </a> of <a href="http://law.duq.edu/">Duquesne University School of Law</a> discusses the Amnesty International Report condemning US for police use of force... </p>

<p><a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/"><strong>A</strong>mnesty International</a> last week harshly <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/deadly-force-police-use-of-lethal-force-in-the-united-states">criticized</a>  the US for not providing standards strictly limiting the use of lethal force by police to those occasions when no other options are available and such force is essential to save lives.</p>

<p>The organization observed that the UN has promulgated standards for the use of deadly force by officers that, on their face, seem not only reasonable, but superior to the laws of many states. As the June 19 Amnesty <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/aiusa_deadlyforcereportjune2015.pdf">report [PDF]</a> described the UN standard, "intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable to protect life," that force must be "necessary and appropriate to achieve the objective," and any kind of force may be used "only when there are no other means available that are likely to achieve the same legitimate objectives." The Amnesty report quite correctly observed that many states, by contrast, are far less restrictive of the use of lethal force by police officers.<br />
	<br />
Amnesty's statutory comparison is certainly valid, but it is not clear that adoption of that standard by American states would change the way police officers use deadly force.  </p>

<p>The real problem with American law on police force is not the legal standard for its justifiable use, it is the vantage point courts take when they consider the actions of officers. Courts for perfectly understandably reasons are deferential to the instantaneous decisions officers must make when confronted with life-threatening situations. Even if every American jurisdiction embraced the UN standard for deadly force, an officer faced with a split-second choice between using a taser and a revolver to save his own life would hardly be responsible if he made the more lethal choice, even if the taser would have sufficed in hindsight.</p>

<p>Deadly encounters with police, however, do not usually begin at the moment when the officer has but a second to make such decisions, though courts typically consider only the last seconds before a trigger is pulled in determining whether the officer's action was reasonable. Courts do not generally consider whether the officer failed to take steps to de-escalate the situation prior to the firing of the fatal shot. </p>

<p>No doubt the UN standard lauded by Amnesty International provides a preferable pre-requisite to lethal force than the statutory scheme in, say, <a href="http://delcode.delaware.gov/title11/c004/index.shtml">Delaware</a>, Title 11 Section 467 provides that an officer may use lethal force to suppress a riot, which seems to give an officer <em>carte blanche</em> to kill. In making such comparisons though Amnesty has set up something of a straw man&#8212;it neither considers the judicial construction of such statutes, nor does it describe the liability of state officers to federal civil rights laws, civil and criminal. The statutes on the state books simply do not tell the whole story.</p>

<p>But there is a bigger problem with the Amnesty report. The frame of reference American courts take when looking at police killings is far more problematic than the legal standard courts use to evaluate the facts in that frame. If reasonableness is evaluated seconds or milliseconds before the killing, not only will officers generally be exonerated but the law will not fashion rules for de-escalating violence.  </p>

<p>University of South Carolina Law Professor <a href="http://www.law.sc.edu/faculty/stoughton/">Seth Stoughton</a>, a former police officer himself, has recently written a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/04/09/are-police-too-quick-to-use-force/police-shouldnt-ask-if-a-shooting-is-justified-but-if-its-avoidable">series</a> of very insightful articles on how courts have failed to incentivize police to de-escalate a situation before it becomes one in which an officer has to make a fateful decision to take a life. </p>

<p>For good or ill as Stoughton describes, police academies typically teach officers using judicial opinions. Courts essentially announce the standards police follow on the streets. As courts evaluate the reasonableness of an officer's actions by looking only at the moments before the citizen was killed, they do nothing to assess the job the officer did to prevent the situation from turning into a life and death struggle. Officers are then left with little guidance as to when lethal force is permitted - or when and how to prevent encounters from requiring such force.  Even with the standards that exist in American law today, if courts considered the reasonableness of the officer's actions from the moment the citizen was first encountered, a body of law might develop&#8212;and hence programs to train officers&#8212;on how to keep police encounters from turning deadly.</p>

<p>In other contexts the law certainly has contributed to the way police are trained and conduct themselves on the street. Consider searches and seizures. Officers are fairly certain when a search is legitimate because the law gives them very solid guidance on this issue.</p>

<p>With reasonable clarity an officer knows when he can search a trunk but is largely left to decide for himself when it is appropriate to take a life. The answer lies in the remedy for each violation. When a trunk is improperly searched any incriminating evidence is excluded in a defendant's criminal trial. A conviction is potentially lost especially in a drug case, and future officers may or may not be more leery of searching trunks. Their behavior may well be unchanged because if the evidence is suppressed, the officer has only lost evidence he would not have had without the search.</p>

<p>If an officer is sanctioned civilly for improperly using force, a jury will get to assign damages, which could be substantial, or if the defendant is criminally convicted, he faces substantial jail time and the collateral consequences of a conviction. Each of these sanctions could make officers substantially less willing to place themselves in positions where they may find lethal force essential. Not surprisingly then courts have made it difficult to find officers civilly or criminally liable for the use of lethal force.</p>

<p>The suppression remedy is, of course, not available for claims of excessive force unless somehow the excessive force produced incriminating evidence, a possibility difficult to construct even for a law school hypothetical. How did American law come to construct a remedy that does a better job protecting our trunks from prying eyes than our bodies from shooting officers?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://law.missouri.edu/faculty/symposium/lawreview2015/articles/oliver.pdf">answer [PDF] </a> lies in history&#8212;the Era of Prohibition. During the Roaring '20s, the fear of police was focused on lawful and particularly unlawful searches for alcohol in businesses and private homes. The exclusionary rule, mere glimpses of which had been seen prior to Prohibition, became the rule of law in nearly half of American jurisdictions. With the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=589965672959279882">Mapp v. Ohio</a> in 1961, the exclusionary rule&#8212;the rule that came into its own because of Prohibition&#8212;became the primary mechanism of regulating police, even though by the 1950s, police brutality, not police searches were the public's primary concern.</p>

<p>For a variety of reasons, many recognized in the <span class="casename">Mapp</span> decision itself, an ordinary scheme of civil damages had proven inadequate to deter police misconduct. But in adopting a remedy that only excluded evidence connected to illegal practices, the court did nothing to address excessive force, or even simple harassment by police, something the court would acknowledge in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17773604035873288886">Terry v. Ohio</a>.</p>

<p>The Prohibition Era remedy for deterring police misconduct&#8212;one that was well suited to address illegal seizures of alcohol&#8212;was not one that was well suited to address society's concerns about police in 1961, when the Supreme Court imposed the rule on all state courts. The Court's choice of remedy provided no mechanism to sanction, or even address, police misconduct unrelated to seizures of evidence.. Allowing judges to enjoin <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> violations, for instance, would have permitted judicial sanctions based on the seriousness of the infraction and regardless of the connection between the illegality and incriminating evidence. <span class="casename">Mapp</span>, however, took a very different path. The court's choice allowed a body of law to develop that thoroughly regulated the seizure of reliable evidence, but gave officers little or no more guidance on the appropriateness of deadly force than they had at the dawn of the Republic.</p>

<p>Amnesty International is correct to observe that the UN standards for the use of deadly force appear to be preferable to those contained in the statutes of most American jurisdictions. Far more important, though, is whether a court will look at the entire context of the police-citizen encounter in applying the standard, whatever it is, and the remedy for a violation of the standard. As with all laws it will be the application of the standard that matters more than the standard itself.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.nesl.edu/faculty/full_time.cfm?facid=15">Lawrence Friedman</a> of <a href="http://www.nesl.edu">New England Law | Boston</a></a> discusses how the 2015 Kansas bill is a no-win situation for the people of Kansas... </p><strong>C</strong>onstitutional litigation is, in a sense, politics by other means. Advocates of individual rights look to judges to be their knights, guardians against legislative overreach. But the judges who rule in their favor may well be seen by legislators and governors as mere pawns of special interests, upsetting hard-wrought legislative accommodations and compromises and overstepping the bounds of judicial review.</p>

<p>Such a <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/press-release/kansas-governor-signs-bill-could-defund-state">scenario</a> recently has been playing out in Kansas. There, plaintiffs filed a lawsuit alleging that the levels at which the state funded the public education system were inadequate under <a href="http://law.justia.com/constitution/kansas/art6.html">Article 6, Section </a> of the state constitution. In a <a href="http://www.kscourts.org/Cases-and-Opinions/opinions/SupCt/2014/20140307/109335.pdf">2014 decision</a> [PDF], the state supreme court agreed. Lawmakers balked, arguing that the court had impinged upon their constitutional appropriations authority. In a move that seems more than coincidental, the legislature, led by the Governor <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/us/courts-budget-intensifies-kansas-dispute-over-powers.html">Sam Brownback</a>, moved to trim the high court's sails through a law, stripping the supreme court of some authority to control lower courts. Then the legislature doubled down, by threatening to eliminate funding for the judiciary should the courts find that law unconstitutional.</p>

<p>This is not the first time a state judicial system has been threatened by the political departments merely for exercising the power of judicial review, and it is not likely to be the last. Still, events in Kansas put into sharp relief the practical obstacles to the ability of state courts to give life to many state constitutional provisions intended to compel government to act affirmatively on behalf of the citizenry.</p>

<p>As the political scientist Emily Zackin has explained in her book, <a href="http://government.arts.cornell.edu/assets/psac/fa12/Zackin_PSAC_Oct26.pdf">Looking for Rights in All the Wrong Places: Why State Constitutions Contain America's Positive Rights,</a> [PDF] many state constitutions obligate government to act in various areas of public life, including education, fair labor conditions and the quality of the environment. These kinds of provisions stand in contrast to the typical federal constitutional individual rights protections, such as the right to free expression, which act negatively, to prevent government from acting.</p>

<p>That the positive rights provisions of state constitutions are often under-enforced should come as no surprise. Though a court may acknowledge that a particular provision requires government to take steps to, say, protect the environment, such acknowledgement does not necessarily lead a court to order the necessary relief. When a court orders the political branches to act, there is always risk&#8212;that the legislature or the governor will simply ignore the court's decision or seek to punish the court in some way. This could be accomplished through a state's budget process or by making changes to the judicial selection process. Such a response to the practical effects of judicial review could, at a minimum, undermine the judiciary's legitimacy.</p>

<p>The situation in Kansas is arguably more extreme. One part of a 2015 <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2014/b2013_14/measures/documents/summary_hb_2338_2014.pdf">bill</a> [PDF] allocating money for the judiciary provides that, should a state court overturn the 2014 law that removed from the Kansas Supreme Court the power to appoint chief judges for the district courts and set district court budgets, the judiciary will lose all its funding. In other words, the political departments responded to their displeasure with the Kansas Supreme Court in two ways: first, by seeking to reduce the supreme court's authority over the lower courts and, second, by threatening to eliminate any allocation to the courts system should a court hold the 2014 law in conflict with the constitutional grant to the supreme court of <a href="http://www.kscourts.org/kansas-courts/supreme-court/purpose-and-authority.asp">"general administrative authority over all courts in th[e] state."</a></p>

<p>The 2014 law is in fact being challenged&#8212;by one of the state's district court judges. Thus the Kansas courts appear to face a Hobson's choice: either bow to the effort by the political departments to wrest some authority from the supreme court over the judiciary itself, by finding the 2014 law to be constitutional; or hold the relevant provisions of that law invalid and risk the loss of funding for the judiciary.</p>

<p>Either way, of course, the judiciary loses. As Alexander Hamilton observed of the federal judiciary, state courts are possessed of neither the purse nor the sword. They must make budget requests in the same way as any state-funded entity and, unlike many of those departments of government, the courts have no natural constituency that will rally to their support. Indeed, most citizens are likely oblivious to the work of the judiciary until they have need of the courts or are brought before them&#8212;perhaps in the context of a marriage beyond repair, a contractual commitment broken or in connection with criminal charges.</p>

<p>And, either way, the people of Kansas lose. If the 2014 law ultimately is upheld, it will become clear that the legislature does not really consider the judiciary to be an independent and co-equal branch of government&#8212;and citizens will have good reason not to trust in the hope that the courts will, for example, enforce the positive obligations imposed on the government by constitutional provisions like Article 6, Section 1. Further, should a court strike down the 2014 law, the judiciary then will be denied the resources needed to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities&#8212;hearings, trials and appeals will be delayed; motions will go undecided; justice will not in any real sense be promptly and efficiently administered. Brownback and his allies in the legislature will have succeeded in diminishing public confidence in the state's judicial system.</p>

<p>It did not have to come to this. <a href="http://www.kssos.org/other/pubs/KS_Constitution.pdf">Article 15, Section 14</a> [PDF] of the constitution requires every member of the Kansas legislature&#8212;and the governor&#8212;to swear an oath when taking office to "support ... th[e] constitution of the state." That means respecting what the state supreme court says the state constitution means, even when you do not like it.</p>

<p>When faced with a legitimate constitutional case or controversy, courts have an obligation to resolve it and determine the meaning of the constitution in light of the facts presented. They are aided in this task by recourse to constitutional history and judicial precedent: they will interpret the text using these guides and effectively have little control over whether they will later be regarded in a particular case as having acted as knights or pawns. Inevitably they will make decisions about a state's constitutional commitments with which legislators and governors will take issue&#8212;that is the nature of judicial review in a constitutional democracy. But the ability of courts to act as an independent check on the exercise of public power would mean little if the fear of political disagreement with their conclusions factored into their deliberations. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/geraldine-mattioli-zeltner">Geraldine Mattioli-Zeltner</a>, the advocacy director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch, discusses how a Special Criminal Court, created by the interim authorities of the Central African Republic, has the potential to strengthen the fight against impunity within the countries where the crimes took place... </p><strong>O</strong>n June 3, Catherine Samba-Panza, interim president of the Central African Republic, promulgated a law creating a <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/central-african-republic-government-establishes-special-criminal-court.php">Special Criminal Court</a> to investigate and prosecute grave human rights violations committed in the country since 2003. Her action crowned a speedy nine-month drafting and legislative process. </p>

                <p>This is good news, not just for the people of the Central African Republic who have suffered so much, but also for victims around the world seeking effective solutions to curb impunity. </p>

                <p>For the first time, a sovereign government has created through national law an innovative hybrid court where national, international judges and prosecutors will work together for victims to obtain justice for the atrocities they have suffered. If implemented well, the Special Criminal Court in the Central African Republic has the potential to become a new model of justice for grave international crimes.</p>

                <p>The interim government acknowledged early on that the national justice system, ravaged by a series of conflicts, was too weak to handle the large scale atrocities during the most recent crisis&#8212;in which thousands of civilians were brutally killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. </p>

                <p>In April 2014, it referred the situation since 2012&#8212;when the most recent crisis began&#8212;to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (<a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/2014-05-30-CAR-referral.pdf">ICC</a>) [PDF]. The office of the ICC prosecutor, which already had opened an investigation into an earlier period of violence, opened a second investigation in the Central African Republic in September 2014, offering real hope for a measure of justice. But it was always clear that the ICC could only be one part of the solution given its capacity to handle only a small number of cases in each given situation.</p>

                <p>In August 2014, the interim government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the UN peacekeeping mission that sketched out the idea of hybrid justice mechanism. With advice from a drafting committee of national and international legal experts and the input from civil society, the Justice Ministry drafted a law for a specialized court inside the national justice system to try crimes that were not likely to be selected by the ICC. On April 22, 2015, the country's interim parliament, the National Transitional Council, adopted the law by a vast majority. It tasked the new court with investigating crimes committed since 2003&#8212;the date of a coup against an elected president, Ange-Félix Patassé, which was marked by a wave of abuses against civilians&#8212;instead of 2012, as proposed by the interim government. </p>

                <p>There have been other hybrid courts and chambers, such as the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, the war crimes chamber in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Senegal's Extraordinary Chambers, created for the upcoming trial of the former Chadian president Hissène Habré. </p>

                <p>But this is the first time that national lawmakers have created a hybrid court to try serious international crimes committed in their own country and to work alongside the ICC. The Special Criminal Court is a temporary court embedded within the Central African Republic's national justice system for a renewable period of five years. It has its own judicial police and prosecution office and all levels of jurisdiction up to the appeals chamber. It will apply the country's law and criminal procedure.</p>

                <p>The law foresees that the Special Criminal Court will have a majority of Central African judges, a Central African president and chief registrar, while the chief prosecutor will be international. The law also foresees that the court can be set up in phases, allowing its investigative arm to get to work quickly, before the rest of the court is set up. If the ICC and the Special Criminal Court happen to work on the same cases, priority will go to the ICC, reversing the principle of complementarity in the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">ICC Statute</a> [PDF] that gives national courts precedence. The newly established Special Criminal Court also does not deprive ordinary courts of their jurisdiction over grave international crimes. </p>

                <p>The Special Criminal Court is thus firmly situated at a unique and new level, between the ICC and ordinary courts. If it plays its role as a complement to both, it could significantly increase access to justice for the victims in the Central African Republic.</p>

                <p>Recurrent crises in the Central African Republic over the past few decades have been marked by widespread impunity. The people of the Central African Republic and their political representatives have decided to turn the page on this practice. The thirst for justice was clear during national talks in May in the capital, Bangui, known as the Bangui Forum for National Reconciliation. Participants <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/africa-in-focus/posts/2015/05/15-bangui-forum-central-african-republic-copley-sy">emphasized</a> the need for justice and showed strong support for the ICC, the Special Criminal Court, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and reparations for victims as complementary tools to ensure accountability.</p>

                <p>In the face of high expectations and a complex accountability landscape, there are many challenges ahead in ensuring the Special Criminal Court fulfills its objectives. As they embark on establishing the new institution, Central African and international actors should spare no effort to ensure that it will be cost-effective, impartial, fair and credible in delivering justice for the worst crimes.</p>

                <p>The international community will need to provide adequate financial and logistical support to the court on the basis of a realistic budget drawn up by the interim government and the UN. As foreseen in its mandate, the peacekeeping mission will play a critical role in assisting the new court with recruiting staff, supporting investigations, arrests, security for judicial staff and protection of victims and witnesses. Other UN agencies involved in supporting justice and the rule of law will also have an important role to play, and the UN should effectively coordinate and implement this crucial assistance.</p>

                <p>The Special Criminal Court will need to be staffed with competent and motivated personnel. The Central African government and the UN should set out a clear recruitment process and identify the qualifications required. Selected national and international candidates should be experienced, independent and willing to work in a collaborative environment. International experts should not only speak French and be familiar with the civil law system, but also have demonstrated expertise in investigating and prosecuting grave international crimes and in interacting with vulnerable victims&#8212;including victims of sexual and gender violence, women and children. </p>

                <p>The ICC and the Special Criminal Court will need to work out ways to cooperate, share information and coordinate their work so that their coexistence in one country will truly multiply opportunities for justice. </p>

                <p>Finally, to have long term impact at the national level, the establishment of the Special Criminal Court should be an opportunity to enhance the ordinary courts' capacity to handle grave international crimes. Shared training and workshops could be organized for staff at both levels, for example regarding specialized investigation techniques and the protection of victims or defense rights. </p>

                <p>Given the resource limitations of the ICC and lack of capacity or will of national courts, the Special Criminal Court model has the potential to strengthen the fight against impunity within the countries where the crimes happened. Other countries have considered the establishment of hybrid courts or chambers, but have not yet taken the final plunge. </p>

                <p>The eyes of the world will be on the Central African Republic and its new hybrid court. For the victims there and others elsewhere who are waiting for justice, it cannot fail.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists Brian Hodges and Christopher Kieser discuss the recent ruling by the Supreme Court in <span class="casename">Horne v. Department of Agriculture</span>...</p><strong>O</strong>n June 22 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-275_feah.pdf">ruled</a> [PDF] in favor of Fresno-area raisin farmers Marvin and Laura Horne, concluding that a program requiring raisin growers to surrender up to half of their annual crop to the government violated the Takings Clause of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a>.</p>

                <p>The dispute in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-275_feah.pdf">Horne v. Department of Agriculture</a> [PDF] arose from the government&#8217;s continued enforcement of a New Deal-era statute that had been designed to prop up the price of crops by preventing farmers from bringing their entire harvest to market&#8212;a law that Justice Elena Kagan <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-123_l537.pdf">labeled</a> [PDF]&#8220;the world&#8217;s most outdated law&#8221; just two years ago on the case&#8217;s first trip to the court. Under the <a href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5067868">Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937</a> (AMAA), a government agency called the &#8220;Raisin Administrative Committee,&#8221; consisting of 46 raisin growers and packers and one &#8220;member of the public,&#8221; decides how many raisins should be kept off the market each year in order to keep the price of raisins artificially high. Raisin farmers like the Hornes are then ordered to surrender a portion of their annual crop to the committee as a condition of selling the remaining raisins on the free market.</p>

                <p>The Hornes had been farming raisins in California&#8217;s Central Valley since 1969. They complied with the raisin committee&#8217;s demands for nearly thirty years, but they eventually grew disillusioned with a system they believed amounted to &#8220;involuntary servitude.&#8221; After having restructured their business in a way that they believed would excuse them from the committee&#8217;s demands, the Hornes balked at the government&#8217;s insistence that they forfeit up to 47% of their raisins without compensation. In response, the Department of Agriculture ordered the Hornes to pay $480,000 for the value of the withheld raisins and slapped them with a $200,000 penalty for failing to comply. After over a decade of litigation, including an initial trip to the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-123_c07d.pdf">2013</a> [PDF] to determine whether they even had a right to challenge the constitutionality of the government demands in a federal district court, the Hornes finally and fully prevailed with a near-unanimous decision from the Supreme Court. In the process, they struck several important blows for property rights and limited government.</p>

                <p>Most significantly, the court&#8217;s two opinions in <span class="casename">Horne</span> provide more evidence that the Roberts Court is steadily marching toward simplicity and common sense in its analysis and resolution of property rights cases. In recent years, for example, the court has rejected rules that (1) hold that some temporary physical invasions (but not others) effect takings based solely on the means of appropriation (<a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-597_i426.pdf">Arkansas Game & Fish Comm&#8217;n v. United States</a> [PDF]) (2) hold that the transfer of property from the government is not subject to the same common law rules that apply to all other property sales (<a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-597_i426.pdf">Marvin M. Brandt Revocable Trust v. United States</a>[PDF]) and (3) hold that a permit condition demanding payment of money in lieu of a dedication is subject to the same rules as a property dedication (<a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-1447_4e46.pdf">Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist.</a>[PDF]).</p>

                <p><strong>Horne I - It Would Make Little Sense to Block a Takings Defense</strong></p>

                <p>It is a commonly-held belief that the only remedy for a taking by the federal government is for the owner to hand over his or her property, and then travel to Washington, D.C. to sue for just compensation in the Court of Federal Claims. <span class="casename">Horne</span> dispels that myth. <br />
                    The Hornes appealed Agriculture&#8217;s order to pay penalties and fines to a California federal district court, arguing in part that the government&#8217;s demand for their raisins&#8212;or money in the form of penalties&#8212;violated the Takings Clause. The court ruled against them on the merits, and they took their appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. But the Ninth Circuit <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1727581745917629963">dismissed </a>the Hornes&#8217; constitutional claims for lack of jurisdiction&#8212;the court fell for the myth that the only remedy for a taking was to seek compensation (and the only court with jurisdiction to hear such compensation claims is the Federal Claims Court). Consequently, the court held that the Hornes would have to pay the penalties and fines before seeking reimbursement in the Claims Court. Until that time, their takings defense wouldn&#8217;t be ripe for review.</p>

                <p>In a unanimous <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-123_c07d.pdf">decision</a> [PDF] written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court reversed. The court concluded that when a taking is raised as a defense to an administrative order, the court that has jurisdiction to hear the administrative appeal also has jurisdiction to consider the takings defense. In so ruling, the court recognized three common-sense principles that should aid property owners litigating takings claims. First, the issuance of an order imposing penalties constitutes a cognizable injury, even when the terms of the order have not yet been enforced. Second, the remedies available under the Takings Clause are not limited to just compensation&#8212;in some circumstances, an order invalidating a government action may be the appropriate remedy. And third, a property owner does not need to surrender his or her property as a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of an unconstitutional agency order. As the court recognized, &#8220;it would make little sense to require the party to pay the fine in one proceeding and then turn around and sue for recovery of that same money in another proceeding.&#8221;The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit for a determination on the merits on whether the government&#8217;s demand that the Hornes fork over tons of raisins in order to sell their remaining crops on the open market violated the Takings Clause.</p>

                <p><strong>Horne II - Property Rights Cannot Be So Easily Manipulated</strong></p>

                <p>The remand proceeding went poorly for the Hornes. The Ninth Circuit <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1727581745917629963">concluded </a>that the government&#8217;s raisin demand did not violate the Takings Clause because, in the court&#8217;s opinion, &#8220;the Takings Clause affords less protection to personal property than to real property.&#8221; Thus, according to the Ninth Circuit, the government would have to demand all of the Hornes&#8217; raisins&#8212;not just almost half of them&#8212;before it would rise to the level of a compensable taking. Moreover, the Ninth Circuit noted that the Hornes could have mitigated the impact of the regulation. For example, the court suggested that they could have planted different crops to avoid the program altogether. Even if they continued to farm raisins, the court reasoned that they could reap indirect benefits from the seizure because the program&#8217;s aim was to inflate the price of raisins. And the government, after all, retained the discretion to pay the Hornes something (or not) depending on what it ultimately decided to do with the forfeited raisins. Because the Hornes retained some value in their harvests&#8212;no matter that it was significantly diminished&#8212;the court concluded that they could not advance a takings claim against the government. The Ninth Circuit, therefore, upheld the commission&#8217;s demands and all associated penalties and fines.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court systematically took apart the Ninth Circuit&#8217;s reasoning in an <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-275_feah.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF] that will likely have far-reaching impacts on takings litigation for years to come. First, Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for an eight-justice majority, rejected the Ninth Circuit&#8217;s foundational premise that personal property is due lesser protection than real property. The Chief Justice wrote that the Takings Clause protects personal property, like raisins, to the same extent as real property&#8212;a point that the Court made explicit two years ago in <span class="casename">Koontz</span>.</p>

                <p>The principle that &#8220;property&#8221; refers equally to real and personal property &#8220;goes back at least 800 years to Magna Carta, which specifically protected agricultural crops from uncompensated takings.&#8221; The government, therefore, &#8220;has a categorical duty to pay just compensation when it takes your car, just as when it takes your home.&#8221; Because the Hornes were required to hand over their raisins to the government, the court concluded that the government&#8217;s demand was as &#8220;clear [a] physical taking&#8221; as a government occupation of private land. Thus, the government&#8217;s demand for the Hornes&#8217; raisins must be subject to the same analysis as a regulation requiring that an owner surrender land to the government&#8212;both acts will per se violate the Takings Clause under the 1982 case of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5029480404868010518"> Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.</a></p>

                <p>The court then rejected the government&#8217;s argument that it could avoid a taking by offering to pay the Hornes something in the future based on the government&#8217;s eventual use of the seized raisins. <span class="casename">Loretto</span>, the court pointed out, holds that the government is obligated to compensate an owner for a physical appropriation of property, &#8220;without regard to the claimed public benefit or economic impact to the owner.&#8221; Again, eight justices agreed that, because the raisin reserve requirement operated by physically taking the Hornes&#8217; property in the first instance, the fact that the owners could later receive some benefit (or not) for the seized property was irrelevant to the question of whether a taking had occurred. In any case, the court noted that oftentimes raisin farmers, in fact, received nothing in return for &#8220;contributing&#8221; to the government&#8217;s raisin reserve. Thus, the court held that any residual value given to the Hornes could offset, at most, the amount of compensation due to the Hornes&#8212;but it could not change the fact that there was a taking. </p>

                <p>The court next rejected the government&#8217;s argument that the raisin reserve requirement was a permissible condition on the right to sell raisins in the stream of commerce. In effect, the government had argued that the Hornes had voluntarily accepted that condition when they chose to enter a regulated field of commerce. The Chief Justice roundly criticized the government&#8217;s assertion that the Hornes could have avoided the taking by growing different crops or making wine. &#8220;&#8216;Let them sell wine&#8217; is probably not much more comforting to the raisin growers than similar retorts have been to others throughout history,&#8221; wrote the Chief Justice in reference to the famously tin-eared quip, &#8220;let them eat cake.&#8221; An owner&#8217;s ability to exercise his or her property rights &#8220;cannot be so easily manipulated.&#8221; And the right to sell a product on the open market is not a government benefit subject to unlimited government control&#8212;it is a constitutionally protected right. If it were otherwise, nothing would prevent a government agency from requiring a car manufacturer, for example, to give the government every fifth car that comes off its assembly line in exchange for the privilege of selling cars at all.   </p>

                <p>The justices divided 5-3-1 over the question of remedy. Five justices, led by the Chief Justice, concluded that the case could be finally decided on the record because the government had already determined the value of the raisins when it assessed penalties against the Hornes. There was therefore no need to send this decade-old case back for further litigation.</p>

                <p>In a separate opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer, three justices agreed with the majority&#8217;s takings analysis, but would have remanded this case to the lower courts for a calculation of compensation. In Justice Breyer&#8217;s view, the Hornes should have had to comply with the reserve requirement and then seek just compensation afterward. If it turned out that the reserve requirement was more beneficial to the Hornes than the value of the raisins they had to surrender, they may not be entitled to any compensation. But, as the majority wrote, there is no authority for the proposition that &#8220;general regulatory activity such as enforcement of quality standards can constitute just compensation for a specific physical taking.&#8221; Instead, just compensation, barring exceptional circumstances, is typically measured by a much simpler standard: &#8220;the market value of the property at the time of the taking.&#8221; The government had conceded that value when it ordered the Hornes to pay $480,000 for the raisins they refused to forfeit. Thus, the Hornes were entitled to an order invalidating the fines and penalties, effectively preventing the taking from occurring. They did not have to submit to Agriculture&#8217;s unconstitutional demand only to find out later if the regulatory program provided them with any benefits that could offset the government&#8217;s liability in a costly and time-consuming lawsuit.</p>

                <p>The <span class="casename">Horne II</span> opinion strikes a chord for limited government in harmony with the Court&#8217;s recent property rights case law. Importantly, the Chief Justice noted that the Constitution is &#8220;concerned with means as well as ends. The government has broad powers, but the means it uses to achieve its ends must be consistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution.&#8221; The focus on means as well as ends marks a significant shift in regulatory takings jurisprudence, which had previously asked such questions as whether the greater power to deny a land use permit included the lesser power to impose near-ruinous restrictions, or whether the property was &#8220;fungible&#8221; (as if the ease of replacement mattered to the constitutional prohibition against uncompensated takings). Such considerations were aimed at excusing government appropriations based on a rationalized view of the ends, rather than looking at the process by which the government appropriated an interest in private property and the effect on the owner.</p>

                <p>The <span class="casename">Horne II</span> decision ensures that governments must treat your personal property with the same respect as real property and soundly rejects the idea that selling crops on the open market is a privilege for which the government can force you to pay. Of particular importance to property owners, it shows that, at least in some circumstances, property owners may successfully prevent an unconstitutional taking altogether&#8212;bucking the outdated belief that compensation is the only remedy available when the government demands that someone hand over his or her private property.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guests <a href="http://www.weforum.org/contributors/netsanet-belay">Netsanet Belay </a>and <a href="http://www.interights.org/staff-solomon-sacco/index.html">Solomon Sacco</a> of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> discuss two recent cases in which states have used diplomatic immunity as a pretext for not executing arrest warrants for visiting public officials who are wanted for crimes under international law, thereby upholding impunity for serious crimes.... </p><br />
                <strong>T</strong>wo cases in the last couple of weeks have shown the hypocrisy of states that rely on international rules of immunity to entrench impunity for serious crimes committed in conflict-torn nations across the world. While the nature of the charges against the two suspects differ, in both cases the governments chose to extend immunity where they were not obliged to do so. These two cases are those of Israeli opposition politician Tziporah Livni, who was granted special mission immunity while in the United Kingdom on what was effectively a private visit, and Sudanese President Omar Bashir, who was not prevented from fleeing South Africa despite a court order from the country's highest court and two open ICC arrest warrants against him for his alleged role in genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur. <br />
                <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/resources/international-law/amnesty-and-immunity.html">Immunity</a> acts as a procedural bar to proceedings, preventing judicial inquiry into the veracity of both the allegations against the suspect and of the propriety of the decision to grant immunity. Its use by governments across the world feeds an ingrained culture of impunity for serious crimes under international law, including war crimes, crimes against humanity and torture.</p>

                <p>In London, activists <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/israel-tzipi-livni-diplomatic-immunity-uk">sought an arrest warrant </a>for Livni, who was Foreign Minister at the time of the 2008&#8212;2009 war in the Gaza Strip, also referred to as <a href="http://imeu.org/article/operation-cast-lead">Operation Cast Lead</a>.</p>

                <p>The legal background is that in 2009 an arrest warrant was issued prior to a scheduled visit by Ms. Livni to the UK but was never executed as she ultimately decided not to travel to London. However, in 2011, an application for an arrest warrant on the basis of war crimes allegations was rejected on the grounds that Ms Livni enjoyed special mission immunity. In June this year she again travelled to the UK apparently to attend the <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/05/29/most-powerful-women-london/">Fortune Most Powerful Women International Summit</a>, which amounts to a visit in her private capacity, and another attempt was made to issue a warrant for her arrest. It was reported that the application for the arrest warrant was rejected on the <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/livni-dodges-war-crimes-arrest-in-london/">basis</a> that Ms Livni enjoys (special mission) immunity.</p>

                <p>In addition to speaking at the summit, Ms Livni allegedly held informal meetings with UK officials. She appeared to be aware of the likelihood that an application for an arrest warrant in her name would be made and seems to have sought these meetings purely to avail herself of special mission immunity. Granting special mission immunity to Ms. Livni was not required by international law. It was a conscious choice made by the government of the United Kingdom. This illustrates the extent to which special mission immunity is vulnerable to abuse by both the sending and receiving state for the benefit of persons suspected of committing serious crimes under international law.</p>

                <p>It appears that the only reason for the UK Government's decision to extend immunity was to protect a suspect from an allied nation from accountability for alleged crimes under international law.</p>

                <p>The Livni imbroglio in particular undercuts the UK's express commitment to universal jurisdiction and prevents judicial scrutiny by its own courts of the alleged commission of international crimes. By granting immunity to Ms. Livni, the UK Government has been complicit in creating impunity for international crimes. In contrast, recent proceedings in the High Court of South Africa (<a href="http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPPHC/">North Gauteng High Court, Pretoria</a>), with respect to Sudanese President Bashir show both a positive judicial determination of immunities and a more blatant example of executive abuse.</p>

                <p>President Bashir travelled to South Africa, a state party to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Rome Statute</a> of the International Criminal Court (<a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">ICC</a>), to attend an <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-15/al-bashir-crisis-mugabe-speech-overshadow-african-union-summit">African Union (AU) summit</a>. The South African government advised the High Court that following their agreement to host the AU Summit, the Sudanese Government requested <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/sudan/11673701/ICC-calls-on-South-Africa-to-arrest-Omar-al-Bashir-at-African-Union-summit.html">confirmation of Bashir's immunity</a>.  South Africa's Cabinet met to discuss the same, took advice from the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/ocsla/">Chief State Law Advisor</a> and decided that, as host country of an AU summit, it was first and foremost obliged to uphold and protect the inviolability of President Bashir and, accordingly, decided not to arrest him while he was attending the AU Summit. </p>

                <p>Apparently in an attempt to protect President Bashir from arrest, and shortly before the summit, the South African Government issued a Government Notice, purporting to provide for immunities and privileges in accordance with the South Africa - AU agreement governing the June AU Summit (which included immunities for all delegates to the AU summit). Like the United Kingdom, South Africa was not under any international obligation to confirm immunities for President Bashir. This is in contrast to what <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-18407396">Malawi did</a> in June 2012 when it refused to confirm President Bashir's immunities resulting in the July 2012 summit of the African Union being moved to Ethiopia. South Africa's decision to grant immunity to President Bashir was made despite the reasonable suspicion that he holds criminal responsibility for innumerable atrocities in Darfur. South Africa conceded in court that if President Bashir had traveled to South Africa for any other reason than attending the AU summit they would have had to arrest him.</p>

                <p>Indeed, there are <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200205/related%20cases/icc02050109/pages/icc02050109.aspx">two ICC arrest warrants</a> against Bashir for his alleged role in genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur. The South African Government was, while he was on its territory, under an obligation to arrest and surrender him to the ICC. There was no doubt or ambiguity as to this obligation. The South African Government was obliged to arrest and surrender President Bashir on the basis of domestic legislation, its constitution and its obligations under the Statute of the ICC. Further, on 12 June, at South Africa's request, representatives of the South African Government in The Hague met with an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/presidency/the%20second%20vice%20president/Pages/judge%20cuno%20jakob%20tarfusser%20_italy_.aspx">ICC judge</a> and representatives of the Court's Office of the Prosecutor and Registry. It was explained to the South African representatives that <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1995566.pdf">&#8220;there is no ambiguity in the law and that the Republic of South Africa is under the obligation to arrest and surrender to the Court Omar Al Bashir.&#8221</a>[PDF]</p>

                <p>The Rome Statute expressly excludes immunities and no person who is accused by the court and who is from a state party to the Rome Statute can plead immunity. However, Sudan is not a state party to the Rome Statute. Nonetheless, the ICC has, in a number of decisions, albeit on different grounds, held that Bashir does not have immunity under international law and has held that all ICC member states are obliged to comply with the arrest warrants, arresting and surrendering him to the court.</p>

                <p>In 2011, President Bashir travelled to Malawi, an ICC member state, to attend a summit of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (<a href="http://www.comesa.int">COMESA</a>). The failure of the Malawian authorities to arrest and surrender the Sudanese leader to The Hague prompted the court to <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1287184.pdf">issue a decision</a> [PDF] regarding Malawi&#8217;s non-compliance with the court&#8217;s request for Bashir&#8217;s arrest and surrender. Pre-Trial Chamber I was required to consider an argument that the Rome Statute includes two conflicting articles: <a href="http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/icc/statute/part-a.htm">Article 27(2)</a>, which removes immunities for Heads of State for the purposes of ICC proceedings, and <a href="http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/icc/statute/part-c.htm#11">Article 98(1)</a>, which implicitly allows immunities to subsist on the basis of customary international law by stipulating that a state is not required to comply with a request for surrender or assistance that would contravene its obligations regarding immunity under international law, unless that State consents to waive that immunity. The Chamber effectively held that <u>Article 27(2)</u> enjoys precedence over <u>Article 98(1)</u>. The Chamber&#8217;s decision, that Bashir did not enjoy immunity, is founded on the basis that there is a customary international law exception to immunity.</p>

                <p>In 2014, President Bashir again travelled to a COMESA summit held on the territory of another State party to the Rome Statute&#8212;this time the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Court again issued a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1759849.pdf">decision</a> [PDF] as to the DRC&#8217;s cooperation (or lack thereof) regarding Bashir&#8217;s arrest and surrender to the Court. The same conclusion was arrived at as in the Malawi decision, however, it was reached by a different line of reasoning. Pre-Trial Chamber II <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/292/73/PDF/N0529273.pdf?OpenElement">held</a> that by referring the situation in Darfur to the ICC, the Security Council decided that the Sudanese Government would cooperate with and provide any necessary assistance to the court. The Court <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1759849.pdf">interpreted</a> [PDF] this as, inter alia, lifting immunities on the basis that any other interpretation of the Security Council referral would render the latter &#8220;senseless.&#8221; Accordingly, the court held that Sudanese cooperation, by waiving Bashir&#8217;s immunity, was &#8220;already ensured.&#8221;by means of the Security Council referral&#8212;the Security Council &#8220;implicitly waived the immunities granted to Omar Al Bashir under international law and attached to his position as a Head of State.&#8221;  </p>

                <p>It was apparently conflicting obligations that the <a href="http://www.judiciary.org.za/high-courts.html">South Africa High Court</a> was asked to determine when an application was made for President Bashir's arrest. Ultimately, the High Court held that the South African Government had an obligation under its domestic law, its constitution and international law to arrest President Bashir. However, by the time the <a href="http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/complete-high-court-al-bashir-judgment/">decision</a> was handed down, President Bashir had already left the country, in apparent violation of a court order that the South African Government not let him leave until the court case had been finalized.</p>

                <p>There will be fierce academic debate about the decisions of the South African High Court, as there has been with decisions of the ICC itself on immunity. Leading the debate are Dapo Akande and Paula Gaeta. Akande posits that the removal of immunity effected by the Rome Statute applies at both the international and national level, and further, that the effect of the Security Council referral of the situation in Darfur to the ICC is that Sudan is &#8220;<a href="D. Akande, The Legal Nature of Security Council Referrals to the ICC and its Impact on Al Bashir&#8217;s Immunities, 7(2) JICJ 333 (2009).">to be regarded as bound</a>&#8221;by the Rome Statute. Gaeta, in contrast, <a href="http://jicj.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/2/315.short">argues</a> that an ICC request to its member States to arrest and surrender Bashir is contrary to immunity under customary international law unless a waiver is granted by the third State in question, a right enshrined by the Rome Statute; that such a request by the Court is ultra vires; and, that States party to the Rome Statute are not bound to comply with such a request.</p>

                <p>Nonetheless, there can be no debate that, by failing to arrest President Bashir and surrender him to The Hague South Africa violated its obligations under the Rome Statute. Further, by apparently allowing him to leave the country in defiance of a court order the South African Government violated the rule of law and contributed to impunity for atrocities in Darfur.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, therefore, the positions adopted by the governments in South Africa and the UK are similar - through the self-interested geopolitical interests of the executive, the courts have been prevented from ensuring and enabling justice for victims of crimes under international law. This is shameful. Worse than this&#8212;both South African and the United Kingdom made conscious decisions to protect suspects of crimes under international law from judicial scrutiny. That is the very definition of impunity. The only ray of sunshine is that the South African judiciary was able to stand up against the abuse of immunity and hopefully more courts will take a principled stand against impunity.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://do.linkedin.com/in/amauryreyes">Amaury A. Reyes-Torres</a>, of <a href="http://www.unibe.edu.do/">Ibero-American University</a>, discusses the recent Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage in the US... </p>The Supreme Court of the United States ("SCOTUS") issued its anticipated opinion on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/schoar_case?case=3463620945980488666">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> [PDF]. Regardless of what your view on the decision might be, <span class="casename">Obergefell v. Hodges</span> is historic. It is worth to mention that <span class="casename">Obergefell v. Hodges</span> was authored by Justice Kennedy, and it was released on June 26th, the exact same day when <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">United States v. Windsor</a> were decided. These opinions were written by Justice Kennedy as well.</p>

<p>The holding of <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> is very simple. Under the Constitution same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry as opposite-sex couples do. Nevertheless, the opinion of the court presents a lot of issues that will be open to discussion for a long time. I would like to comment on the most important topics that the decision presents.</p>

<p>I.	Federalism and Its Limits Under the US Constitution</p>

<p>One of the important issues raised by scholars and court analysts is how the power of the states to regulate domestic relations within their jurisdiction can be harmonized with the right to marry that same-sex couples seek. Sadly, the court did not spend a lot of time on this as Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Scalia did. Both Justices argued, relying on <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, that the states have the prerogative to regulate domestic relations such as marriage and how the Framers of the Constitution entrusted them to carry on that task. </p>

<p>It is correct to argue that the states were entrusted by the Framers to regulate domestic relations such marriage and divorce. Both justices, however,  missed a particular and important assertion made by the majority in <span class="casename">Windsor</span>. The majority of the court in <span class="casename">Windsor</span> stated that "State laws defining and regulating marriage, of course, must respect the constitutional rights of persons, see, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5103666188878568597">Loving v. Virginia</a>; but, subject to those guarantees, 'regulation of domestic relations' is 'an area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the States[...].'" What the Supreme Court did in <span class="casename">Windsor</span> was draw a logical conclusion from the rationale of <span class="casename">Loving</span>, that is that the power of the states on certain matters are subject and limited by the Constitution, namely the respect of fundamental rights such as the right to marry.</p>

<p>But, to be fair to the dissenting justices, the majority did not explicitly ground its rationale on <span class="casename">Windsor</span>; in fact, it did not devote as much attention as we expected on the federalism concerns of the states. Nevertheless, the court did not disregard the power of states in <span class="casename">Windsor</span> or in <span class="casename">Obergefell</span>. The court only reached a conclusion based on how the Constitution protects the right to marry and how the same-sex couples are entitled to it as opposite-sex couples are. Even when it was desirable for the court to address this issue properly, it was implicit in <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> that fundamental rights constitute a limitation on the prerogative of the States to regulate marriage. </p>

<p>Holding otherwise could have affected the current constitutional scheme. First, the power of states will be unlimited, and that could easily disregard the supremacy of the federal Constitution. Second, in the particular case of marriage and same-sex couples, holding that unlimited prerogative of states to regulate marriage will significantly undermine the core essence of <span class="casename">Loving v. Virginia</span>. If the respondents and the dissenters wanted to argue (as they did) that marriage concerning same-sex couples is a question exclusively reserved to the States, overruling <span class="casename">Loving</span> and <span class="casename">Lawrence</span> would have been the first step. At the very least, the court could have neutralized the issue by narrowing its rationale as much as possible. Therefore, the holding of <span class="casename">Obergefell</span>  is consistent with the federalist structure and the limitations on the regulation of domestic relations by states as established by the Constitution. </p>

<p>II.	Right to Marry and Substantive Due Process  </p>

<p>The second aspect to consider is related to the central holding in <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> and the fundamental right to marry. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito argued that the petitioners were asking for the recognition of a new right and that this the right to same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that, unlike other opinions issued by the court, the <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> majority does not expressly respond to any of the dissenters' objections. But without any specific mention, Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, addresses Chief Justice Roberts' and Justice Alito's concerns by concluding that what the court inquired under the substantive due process clause was "the right to marry in its comprehensive sense, asking if there was a sufficient justification for excluding the relevant class from the right (...)." We can confirm this by the way the holding is written: the court reaffirmed the right to marry as fundamental under the court's precedents, but also held that the right to marry is not limited to opposite-sex couples. </p>

<p>In addition to this point, the language used by the majority to describe and then hold that same-sex couples are entitled to marriage is interesting. The majority began its inquiry by analyzing the right to marry and not the existence of a right to same-sex marriage. In fact, the court uses the term "same-sex marriage" in a descriptive manner more than a normative one. Therefore, the court was not doing a careful description of a new fundamental right but instead was doing an inquiry on how same-sex couples benefit from a right that already exists.<br />
 <br />
Another appealing aspect of the opinion in relation to the substantive due process doctrine is whether <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17920279791882194984">Washington v. Glucksberg </a> was still relevant for cases related to the right to marry and intimacy. In one hand, while Chief Justice Roberts heavily grounds his objection on the lack of appropriate adherence to <span class="casename">Glucksberg</span>; the majority concluded that <span class="casename">Glucksberg</span> was only appropriate for the subject of discussion in that particular case. In other words, <span class="casename">Glucksberg</span> is only appropriate when there is a discussion on the existence of a new fundamental right or with the question of physician-assisted suicide. In <span class="casename">Obergefell</span>, SCOTUS was not discovering a new right covered by the word "liberty," but an interest protected by a right that already exists as rooted in the tradition and history of the nation, like the right to marry. </p>

<p>On the other hand, because of <span class="casename">Obergefell</span>, it is clear that <span class="casename">Glucksberg</span> suffered a significant blow. I agree with Professor Jack Balkin when he says that <span class="casename">Glucksberg</span> is not the leading case in substantive due process and implied fundamental rights (if it ever was). The problem with this case is that it heavily relies on tradition and history for implied rights, and this view might be itself a contradiction in terms. How could an implied right is in itself be new if it was exercised in the past? We could rely on certain practices related to the liberty in question, but we will never find the liberty by looking exclusively into the past without understanding the liberty under the glass of our present times. In the words of Justice Harlan in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=642884283459215206">Poe v. Ullman</a>, "the balance struck by this country, having regard to what history teaches are the traditions from which it developed as well as the traditions from which it broke. That tradition is a living thing." </p>

<p>III.	Right to Marry and the Equal Protection Clause</p>

<p>It is not difficult to agree with Chief Justice Roberts on one point and that is the way the majority dealt with the equal protection argument. However, the way the majority dealt with this argument does not render it invalid. At least, it held that there is an undeniable connection between equal protection and the right to marry. However, it could have been better, because ever since <span class="casename">Lawrence</span> the court has dodged an important issue: the status of LGBTI individuals under the Equal Protection Clause as a class or as a protected group and, eventually, what the proper standard of review would be in any given case. </p>

<p>I believe, along with Prof. K. Yoshino, that the court has denied constitutional protection to new groups and has moved to individual liberty claims under the <a href="http://www.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/vol124_yoshino.pdf">due process clause</a> [PDF].  But, the court could have construed an argument without creating a "new class" under the equal protection clause. By resorting to Justice O'Connor's concurrence in <span class="casename">Lawrence</span> , the court could have construed an argument based on the harm that same-sex couples have suffered because of the state laws enacted with the "the purpose to harm an unpopular group based on moral disapproval." The opinion of the court in <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> makes a compelling case on the significant harm suffered by same sex couples.</p>

<p>However, in her opinion, Justice O'Connor believed that there is a state interest in preserving traditional marriage. Nevertheless, the "animus" approach as developed by the court in <span class="casename">Windsor</span> could offer a new way to reshape the rational basis review with a "bite" to question that interest and to hold that same-sex couples were discriminated against as a result of states laws that were issued to harm an unpopular group. Also, by having an institution available solely to opposite-sex couples, the court also could have resorted to its analysis in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1428365285620704265">United States v. Virginia</a> when it when it found that it was unconstitutional to have a male-only admission policy that did not extend the same opportunities to women. </p>

<p>IV.	The Countermajoritarian Difficulty and Equal Marriage </p>

<p>Finally, there is the countermajoritarian argument advanced by the dissenting justices, in particular by Chief Justice Roberts. Chief Justice  Roberts, in his compelling dissenting opinion, argued that the issue of same-sex marriage belongs to the people and that five lawyers had decided to end this debate, even when the proponents of same-sex marriage were convincing their opponents. However, the majority concluded that, even when there is an ongoing debate and discussion, the issue under examination is a question of law. The court stated that the question before the court is whether the Constitution protects the right of same-sex couples to marry. If so, when an unlawful action of the government tends to abridge fundamental rights, the Constitution requires the situation to be redressed by the courts.</p>

<p>But, in terms of political theory, the assertion made by the Chief Justice is not quite accurate in a democracy. If a democracy contends to be a deliberative democracy, then there cannot be closed issues nor topics, even if they were decided by a court of justice. If we take the sensitive topic of abortion, we can see that the debate's still going on after <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673">Roe v. Wade</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994">Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</a> were delivered by SCOTUS. It is more accurate to say that a decision of the court might settle the issue, but it doesn't necessarily close it. The debate, now, will move to another scenario, and only time will tell us what will come from this. </p>

<p>Besides, in one of its most politically sensitive cases, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2298973060085224552">Bush v. Gore</a>, the court said that "[n]one are more conscious of the vital limits on judicial authority than are the members of this Court [...]. When contending parties invoke the process of the courts, however, it becomes our unsought responsibility to resolve the federal and constitutional issues the judicial system has been forced to confront."  That is why the debate will continue and people will go to courts to continue the debates. People rely on the Constitution and its principles as a powerful argument, even when the courts already have spoken. <br />
**<br />
There is a lot to say about <span class="casename">Obergefell v. Hodges</span>, hence the difficulty to condense the totality of views and objections to the majority and dissenting opinions. It will be naive to think that this decision by itself resolves all the problems that LGBTI individuals are facing. But, we can all agree that <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> is only the first step on the long road that the LGBTI individuals have before them to defend their rights under the Constitution. The right to (equal) marriage is only one aspect of what it means to be free and equal with dignity.

		<title>How the Legal Community Can Lead the Way  to Support Military Families</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.tscarterlaw.com/attorneys/#elizabeth">Elizabeth Jamison, Esq.</a> of the <a href="http://www.msjdn.org">Military Spouse JD Network</a> discusses the plight of the military spouse attorney and the need for changes to the current licensing structure ... </p><br />
                <strong>E</strong>arlier this year a series of online threats from ISIS and its sympathizers were directed not just to service members, but also to <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/military-spouses-hacked-threatened-alleged-isis-sympathizer-n303971">military spouses</a>, including a military spouse attorney. This attack underscored how the families of those who serve our country often share the burdens of conflict. While not engaged on the battlefield, military spouses sacrifice in numerous ways, including repeated geographic relocations and extended separations. These challenges have significant implications for military spouses, especially those seeking to balance the demands of a legal career with the unique challenges of the military lifestyle. Military spouses will quickly point to their service members as the true heroes; however, it is vital for our communities to recognize the families of our heroes as well. Public support for military families is an important tool in recruiting and retaining quality service members. The legal community can lead the way with meaningful changes by reducing burdensome professional licensing barriers and increasing flexibility in hiring to include military spouse attorneys.</p>

                <p>Consider the story of Valerie Hatcher. She graduated a semester early from law school in December 2012. Since then she has lived in Kansas, Texas and now Georgia due to her spouse's military obligations. After passing the Florida bar exam, Valerie successfully took the Kansas bar exam while also planning an out-of-state wedding and working full-time! She began her legal career as a research attorney to a Kansas Court of Appeals judge and is now employed remotely as a clerk for a Florida-based firm while her husband is stationed at Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, Georgia. Valerie would proudly join the Georgia bar even if it meant a third bar exam, but the financial and logistical realities are daunting. Valerie's husband received his orders to Georgia after it was too late for Valerie to register for the July exam without being subject to a hefty late fee. Although she could take the next available exam in February, by the time she would be eligible to practice, Valerie will have less than 18 months left in the state. The financial burden of the exam fee, a bar prep course and a third set of annual dues, combined with the uncertainty of finding employment for such a short time, means that Valerie will not be able to contribute her talents to the legal community in Georgia.</p>

                <p>Emily Arnett faced similar challenges upon her service member's relocation to Georgia. Emily passed the California, New York and Florida bar exams and waived in to the District of Columbia. Despite her good standing with four bars and an impressive resumé, she is four months shy of qualifying for reciprocity under Georgia's rules. Neither Valerie nor Emily will be allowed to practice law during their spouse's tour of duty in Georgia but it has nothing to do with their qualifications as an attorney and everything to do with the process of obtaining a license.</p>

                <p>As the military has engaged in the longest period of sustained conflict in our country's history, just one-half of one percent of American adults has served on active duty <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/11/23/the-military-civilian-gap-fewer-family-connections/">at any given time</a>. The connections between those who serve and the general population grow distant as our veteran population shrinks. It is not that Americans do not value the service of our military. But without a common understanding, the citizenry cannot properly support our military families. A handshake and heartfelt thank you is a nice gesture, but action on meaningful issues like licensing and hiring goes further in making a true impact in the lives of military families.</p>

                <p>As of November 2014, 68 percent of employers surveyed <a href="http://media.newjobs.com/cms/monsterabout/documents/veteran-talent-index/monster_vti_nov2014.pdf">reported</a> [PDF] that their company had a stated commitment to hiring veterans. No such numbers exist for military spouses, despite the fact that they face a 26 percent unemployment rate and a 25 percent wage gap <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=118543">compared</a> to their civilian counterparts. But the civilian community is beginning to recognize these challenges and the legal community is working to be part of the solution. In May 2015, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe hosted the <a href="http://www.veteranslegalcareerfair.com">first-ever legal career fair specifically for veterans and military spouses</a>. Co-sponsored by Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, Shearman and Sterling and others, the fair connected quality legal talent from the military community with participating employers including Proskauer, Hogan and Lovells and Pillsbury.</p>

                <p>Hiring military spouses is not just the right thing to do&#8212;it is the smart thing. Military spouses possess traits valued in any workplace&#8212;leadership, initiative, problem solving and the ability to adapt and perform in changing environments. Ask a military spouse attorney who has successfully navigated a legal career, parenthood and a spouse's deployment&#8212;they are the masters of their practice areas as well as holding down the homefront.</p>

                <p>Yet military spouses who seek to develop and maintain a legal career face a myriad of obstacles, stymied by relocations, frustrated with unsupportive employers and under-employed as a result of the current licensing structure. Over half of military spouse attorneys polled earlier this year <a href="http://www.msjdn.org/2015/04/2015annualreport/">indicated</a> that they elected to live separately from their spouse at one point during their career in order to maintain continued employment. It is simply not fair to ask military families to endure continued separations when common sense solutions exist to ease these burdens.</p>

                <p>As our country continues to commit to military obligations around the globe, it is time to address these employment challenges for military spouses with simple but meaningful fixes to state licensing and employment policies. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/joiningforces">Recent White House initiatives</a> led by First Lady Michelle Obama have brought much-needed attention to the employment challenges facing military spouses stationed around the globe. In the legal community, the Military Spouse JD Network (<a href="http://www.msjdn.org">MSJDN</a>) has worked since its formation in 2011 to enact licensing accommodations and connect employers with military spouse attorneys. In February 2012, the American Bar Association House of Delegates passed <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/house_of_delegates/resolutions/2012_hod_midyear_meeting_108.doc">Resolution 108</a>, encouraging state bar authorities to adopt rules to accommodate military spouse attorneys. In April 2012, Idaho became the first state in the nation to <a href="http://www.msjdn.org/2012/04/first-state-approves-military-spouse-attorney-admission/">adopt a licensing accommodation</a> to allow qualified military spouses to practice law without the time and expense of additional examination. <a href="http://www.msjdn.org/rule-change/">Twelve other jurisdictions have since followed</a>: Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Virginia. MSJDN's <a href="http://msjdn.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/military-spouse-practice-rule-12-10-12.doc">model rule</a> is being pursued in 14 other states, including California, Georgia, Ohio and Tennessee.</p>

                <p>A licensing accommodation levels the playing field and recognizes the service of our military families. It does not confer preferred status on military spouses, who must adhere to the same professional standards as any member of a state bar.  These attorneys are legal professionals who have demonstrated success, often in several jurisdictions across the country. State and local bar associations should embrace the opportunity to welcome military spouses to their jurisdiction&#8212;a group that includes Supreme Court litigators, Peace Corps workers, big law partners, solo practitioners and law school deans. Although they serve willingly alongside their service member, they also face obstacles creating unnecessary sacrifice in the pursuit of their chosen profession. They are simply asking the legal community to help minimize the inherent burdens that come with the military lifestyle through licensing accommodations and increased awareness in hiring practices.</p>

		<title>Call Me Caitlyn: Expanding the Circle of Human Concern</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.wayne.edu/profile/peter.hammer/">Peter Hammer</a>, of <a href="http://law.wayne.edu/">Wayne State University Law School</a>, discusses the controversy surrounding Caitlyn Jenner and rights for transgender individuals...</p><blockquote><strong>P</strong>lease call me by my true names,<br />
so I can wake up,<br />
and so the door of my heart can be left open,<br />
the door of compassion.<br />
<a href="http://www.quietspaces.com/poemHanh.html">Call Me By My True Names</a><br />
-Thich Nhat Hanh</blockquote></p>

<p>"<a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-cover-annie-leibovitz">Call me Caitlyn</a>." Few human needs are greater than the desire to belong and to be called by your true name. There are few traumas more severe than being shamed, ostracized and socially outcast. <a href="http://diversity.berkeley.edu/staff-faculty">john powell</a> and his colleagues at the <a href="http://diversity.berkeley.edu/haas-institute">Hass Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society</a> have highlighted the universal significance of "<a href="http://www.otheringandbelonging.org/">othering and belonging</a>" and the importance of expanding the circle of <a href="http://www.projectlinkedfate.org/deliberate/remember/circle-of-human-concern/">human concern</a>.</p>

<p>Notions of "othering" and "belonging" provide a powerful frame to embrace the concerns of our transgender brothers and sisters. Calling another person by their chosen name can be a profound means of expanding the circle of human concern. It sees and acknowledges an individual for who they really are.</p>

<p>These notions are tellingly consistent with Justice Kennedy's language in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3463620945980488666">Obergefell v. Hodges</a>, which recognizes the constitutional foundation of marriage equality. Kennedy's reasoning is grounded in a basic respect for an individual's ability to define their own identity.</p>

<p>The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity.</p>

<p>An affirming interpretation of American history and constitutional law tells a positive story of an ever expanding circle of human concern. Notions of rights and personhood have expanded from the narrow concerns of white male property holders, to white men as men, to men regardless of race, to an increasing concern for the rights and needs of women, to and expending recognition of the dignity and rights of the LGBTQ community.</p>

<p>But even from this positive perspective, many in the transgender community still feel the burdens of profound othering &#8212; standing on the outside looking in. In this context, Caitlyn Jenner has created important space for more open dialogue and more compassionate understandings.</p>

<p>Stories are more powerful than statistics and few stories are more iconic for transgender persons than Caitlyn Jenner's search for individual meaning and identity: a story moving from Olympic decathlon champion, to ever-present breakfast companion on the Wheaties box, to reality TV star, to the first person that many Americans feel like they "know" to express in very human terms what it means to struggle with the challenges and triumphs of being transgender. The dignity with which she told her story met with a surprising level of respect and empathy in the media and in the general public.</p>

<p>This is a tremendous service, but it is important to realize that the struggles of most transgender Americans have little of the glamor of Caitlyn Jenner or Vanity Fair magazine. Transgender individuals are often the most marginalized and othered members of an LBGTQ community that itself is frequently marginalized and othered. The perverse logic of exclusion does not end there. Consistent with the teaching of intersectionality, transgender women of color are often the most victimized of a victimized group. <a href="http://avp.org/storage/documents/2013_ncavp_hvreport_final.pdf">The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs</a> found that 72 percent of victims of anti-LGBTQ homicide were transgender women, and 89 percent of victims were people of color. </p>

<p>While hate crimes and murder represent the most extreme examples of discrimination and othering, our transgender brothers and sisters face daily humiliations, large and small. <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/gender-marker-lawsuit">Love v. Johnson</a>, a case brought by the Michigan ACLU on behalf of six transgender persons, illustrates some of the challenges of being forced to stand outside the circle of human concern.</p>

<p>Most of us take our driver's license for granted. It provides a picture ID and designates basic information, such as our height and weight and eye color and gender. And there lies the catch. What driver's license should be available to an individual born of one gender who identifies with another? In Michigan, it is nearly impossible for transgender individuals to correct the gender on their driver's licenses and other forms of state identification.</p>

<p>In 2011, Secretary of State Ruth Johnson implemented a policy refusing to change the gender marker on an identity document unless the person produces an amended birth certificate showing the correct gender. Most do not realize how difficult it is to amend one's birth certificate. Michigan law requires a person to undergo gender confirmation surgery to receive an amended birth certificate. This is an expensive process that can present serious health risks. Moreover, it is a process that only a fraction of transgender individuals opt to undergo.</p>

<p>Other states require a court order to switch the gender designation on a birth certificate, while three states prohibit gender marker changes on birth certificates altogether. In contrast, federal policy does not require surgery to change the gender marker on US Passport or Social Security records.</p>

<p>What does it mean for a transgender person to go through life with the wrong driver's license? Named plaintiff Emani Love <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/gender-marker-lawsuit">explains</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I'm very comfortable and confident in who I am, but I shouldn't have to divulge my personal information or 'come out' as a trans person every time I want to cash a check or cast a ballot. I just want ID that is truthful in its description of who I really am.</blockquote></p>

<p>The circle of human concern needs to be expanded to include people like Emani Love.</p>

<p>Words can be a powerful marker of inclusion and exclusion. Even more than its ruling, the language of the 1986 Supreme Court opinion in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/478/186/">Bowers v. Hardwick</a>, upholding the constitutionality of state criminal bans of expressions of intimacy, was a hostile act of judicial othering. This all changed with Justice Kennedy.</p>

<p>I was working in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on June 26, 2003, when <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas</a> was decided, overturning <span class="casename">Bowers</span>. I read Kennedy's opinion on the internet, while working on a moored riverboat that used to function as a floating dance hall and brothel. It was now the headquarters of an international NGO assisting, among other groups, a union of sex workers, including a number of amazing transgender women. Kennedy's language of dignity was language of inclusion, truly expanding the circle of human concern. It was the first time I felt that the Supreme Court was speaking to me as a gay man and acknowledging me as a real human being.</p>

<p>The sex workers' union on the riverboat was proudly organizing under a banner that read "Sex Work is Work." These women were some of the smartest, strongest and funniest people I have ever met. They led an impressive challenge to an internationally funded and sponsored clinical trial targeting them as a vulnerable population to test antiretroviral drugs as an HIV prophylaxis. By demanding respect for basic standards of medical ethics, they successfully protected their rights and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UTSLawRw/2005/9.html">Prime Minister</a> shut down the trials.</p>

<p>What this group of transgender women really wanted, however, was beyond their reach. They sought my advice as a lawyer on how to get the police to stop beating and abusing them. I have seldom felt more helpless as a supposed expert offering advice. They stood marginal and victimized, outside the circle of human concern. They had little protection against the police.</p>

<p>While the language of Kennedy's opinion in <span class="casename">Lawrence</span> was light-years beyond that of <span class="casename">Bowers</span> , his language in <span class="casename">Obergefell </span> reflects continued profound evolution. The language of "dignity" has evolved to a fundamental recognition of self-identity. This offers continued hope to members of the transgender community and a road-map to the further expansion of the circle of human concern.</p>

<p>To be asked to be called Caitlyn is to ask to be seen as the unique human being she is, as she chooses to define herself. It is a human call to be respected and to belong. It is a simple request to be called by her true name.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.whittier.edu/index/meet-the-faculty/profile/manoj-mate">Manoj Mate</a> of <a href="https://www.law.whittier.edu/index">Whittier Law School </a> discusses the National Judicial Appointments Commission...</p><strong>O</strong>ver the past months, the political whirlwinds surrounding efforts by Narendra Modi's BJP government to <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Modi-govt-politicizing-judicial-appointments-Ram-Jethmalani-says/articleshow/47099817.cms">change</a> India's judicial appointments system have given way to a storm of constitutional contestation. Since 1993, India's top judges, including the chief justice and senior justices of the Supreme Court of India ("SCI"), have had primacy and an effective final say in appointments. However, in late 2014, the Modi government, in a direct challenge to judicial power and primacy, enacted the <a href="http://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/the-national-judicial-appointments-commission-bill-2014-3359/">National Judicial Appointments Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2014/162235.pdf">Constitutional (99th) Amendment Act </a> [PDF] , establishing a new <correction num=1>National Judicial Appointments Commission ("NJAC")</correction>.  Following ratification by state legislatures, President Pranab Mukherjee gave assent to these acts, and in April, the government officially notified the <a href="http://www.egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2014/162235.pdf">99th Constitutional (Amendment) Act, </a> [PDF] and the NJAC Act, bringing the new laws into force.</p>

<p>The NJAC Act and Amendment Bill amends <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1164880/">Article 124 of the Indian Constitution</a> by adding <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/592523/">Article 124A</a>, which provides for the creation of the NJAC in place of the current collegium system. The new NJAC dramatically limits the primacy of the judiciary and increases the government's power in appointments. The NJAC is to be comprised of the chief justice of India and two senior-most Supreme Court judges, the union law minister and two "eminent people," one of whom would be drawn from the scheduled castes, tribes, minorities and other backward classes or women. At present, the chief justice is H.L. Dattu, and the two senior justices are Justice T.S. Thakur and Justice Anil Dave. Under this new system, the two eminent persons would be selected from a panel consisting of the chief justice, the prime minister and the leader of the opposition in the <a href="http://loksabha.nic.in/">Lok Sabha</a>. Significantly each of the six members of the NJAC would have a vote, and two members would be able to veto an appointment to the court. In addition, the NJAC would have the power to promulgate new regulations governing criteria for selection and procedures for appointment of Indian Supreme Court and high court judges.</p>

<p>Following the enactment of the NJAC, judicial appointments have reached a standstill. In a letter to Modi, Chief Justice of India, H.L. Dattu <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/cji-refuses-to-be-part-of-panel-to-select-njac-members-sc-told/">stated</a> that he would refuse to participate in the three-person committee charged with selecting the two eminent persons to the NJAC until its constitutionality has been decided by the Supreme Court. As of April 2015, there were 364 vacancies in high courts that are currently on hold as a result of the constitutional impasse over the NJAC. The battle has now shifted to the judiciary, and following the filing of a series of petitions challenging the constitutionality of the NJAC, a supreme court panel referred the <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-supreme-court-declines-centre-s-plea-to-refer-njac-issue-to-larger-bench-2085313">matter</a>  to a larger five-judge constitutional bench which began hearing oral arguments in April.   </p>

<p>Since the 1980s, the court dramatically expanded its role in the governance of the polity and selectively asserted itself in fundamental rights. As I have <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2544307">argued</a> elsewhere, this selective assertiveness has reflected the judges' unique elite worldviews and conceptions of the rule of law and the broader ethos of professional and intellectual elite opinion that frames and shapes judicial-decision making in India. Faced with the power of a strong government following years of weak coalition governments, will the court continue to assert itself in protecting its institutional structure and power or bow to the winds of political pressure seeking to democratize a professionalized model of judicial appointments?    </p>

<p><strong>The Historical Context </strong></p>

<p>Under the present "collegium" system, the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and senior justices had primacy in a consultative appointment process with the government, a product of a series of judicial decisions in the 1990s. Prior to the 1970s, the court's appointments and transfers were a collaborative process in which the prime minister and council of ministers would consult with the chief justice and other constitutional functionaries. During the 1970s, following a series of decisions challenging the policies and power of Indira Gandhi's government, the government politicized the appointment process by effectively packing the court and attacking its power, culminating in the emergency rule period (1975-1977). </p>

<p>Articles 124, 217 and 222 of the Indian Constitution provide that the executive (the Prime Minister, Council of Ministers, and President) must consult with justices from the Supreme Court and state high courts, along with other constitutional functionaries at the state level, in judicial appointments and transfers. In the <a href="http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/the-collegium-controversy/836029/">First Judges' Case</a>, a case involving challenges to judicial transfers by the Gandhi regime in 1980, the Court interpreted the "consultation" requirement in articles articles <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1164880/">124</a>, <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1682952/">217</a>, and <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/819787/">222</a> of the Indian Constitution to mean that  the executive had primacy in judicial appointments and transfers following consultation with the judiciary and other functionaries. However in the <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/753224/">Second Judges' Case</a> (1993), the court reversed course and held that the "consultation" requirement in Article 222 of the Indian Constitution meant that the executive needed the concurrence of the judiciary in appointment decisions.  In justifying its decision the Court suggested that judicial independence was a basic feature and that allowing the executive to have primacy would threaten this independence and also held that judges' were in the best position to determine the merits of appointments.  The court established the "collegium" system of appointments wherein the chief justice and senior justices would now have primacy. In the <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/829952/">Third Judges' Case</a> (1998), the court expanded the collegium to include four senior justices.  </p>

<p><strong>Litigation and Constitutional Arguments</strong></p>

<p>In April, a three-judge bench of the SCI referred a series of petitions challenging the NJAC to a five- judge bench. Justice Anil Dave recused himself from the five-judge bench because he had already been appointed to the three-person committee charged with selecting eminent persons. In his place, Chief Justice Dattu chose Justice J.S. Khehar to lead the bench. Significantly the court rejected the government's request that the matter be heard by an eleven-judge bench in order to review the court's earlier judgments in the <span class="casename">Second Judges Case</span> and <span class="casename">Third Judges' Cases</span>, in holding that the constitutionality of the NJAC under the basic structure doctrine needed to be evaluated independently of these decisions.</p>

<p>The petitioners challenging the NJAC have effectively been consolidated around the lead petition of the <a href="http://www.scaora.in/about-us/">Supreme Court Advocates of Record Association</a> (SCAORA). Petitioners have argued that the NJAC violates the basic structure of the Indian Constitution by attacking judicial independence. The basic structure doctrine was first asserted by the <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/">Court in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala</a> in 1973 and later reaffirmed in <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1939993/?formInput=minerva%20mills">Minerva Mills v. Union of India </a> (1980). Under the basic structure doctrine, the court has the power to invalidate constitutional amendments that violate the basic structure or basic features of the Indian Constitution.  Based on previous decisions, jurists have <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro6HAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA204&lpg=PA204&dq=sorabjee+basic+structure+secularism+democracy&source=bl&ots=NullxDVKms&sig=hBdC3SWbEgoSwq2L8UbRHVdq33c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIrb2f-MLoxgIVSZuICh346AJc#v=onepage&q=sorabjee%20basic%20structure&f=false">suggested</a> that secularism, democracy, the rule of law, federalism, equality and judicial independence are all basic features of the Indian Constitution,  though this is still contested terrain and not necessarily an exhaustive list of features.</p>

<p>Arguing for the petitioners, senior Advocates, including Fali Nariman, Anil Divan, Rajeev Dhavan, Arvind Datar  and Prashant Bhushan argued that the NJAC violates judicial independence by creating a system in which the chief justice would no longer have primacy in judicial appointments and in which the judiciary would not have majority control over the NJAC in a system where the political influence of the executive and Parliament would be dominant.  In addition petitioners also argued that the NJAC would override the convention that Chief Justices are selected on the basis of seniority.  Furthermore petitioners challenged the new NJAC act on the grounds that it grants Parliament the power to change and alter judicial selection criteria and procedures, which constitutes a violation of judicial independence, separation of powers, and the rule of law. In his oral arguments, senior advocate Ram Jethmalani, <a href="http://www.livelaw.in/njac-ags-submissions-are-wholly-wrong-jethmalani/">rebutted</a> the government's arguments, observing the NJAC violated judicial independence by allowing the Union Law Minister, a major litigant before the court, to play a role in appointments and also argued that the NJAC constituted a clear attack on the separation of powers under <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/192717/">Article 50</a> of the Constitution.   </p>

<p>Advocates for the government and several states have argued that the NJAC would improve judicial selection and the quality of the judiciary and that the NJAC does not violate the basic structure. In defending the NJAC, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi argued that expanding the appointment process to include a more formal role for the law minister, along with two "eminent persons," would help lead to a more diverse and representative judiciary that is more accountable to the people. The government has also argued that a switch to the NJAC would improve the quality and merit of judicial appointments, going so far as to impugn the merit of specific appointments under the collegium. In addition senior advocate K.K. Venugopal, representing the state of Madhya Pradesh, argued that the NJAC did not violate the basic structure, as Article 124 has drafted conferred primacy on the executive, not the judiciary, in judicial appointments and that the Supreme Court had distorted and departed from the original understanding of <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1164880/">Article 124</a> the allocation of executive and judicial power in judicial appointments4 in the <span class="casename">Second Judges Case</span> and <span class="casename">Third Judges' Cases</span>.</p>

<p>In recent hearings in July, the bench has expressed concerns that the NJAC in its present form violates the basic structure doctrine by compromising judicial independence. The bench also has asked petitioners to suggest potential modifications to the NJAC, while acknowledging the need for reform of the collegium system. The Court recently reserved judgment on the case on July 15th and is expected to issue a decision within the next few weeks.  </p>

<p>Undoubtedly the court's decision will have profound implications for the future of the judiciary. While the NJAC could enhance the accountability and transparency of the appointment process, a decision upholding the NJAC would weaken judicial independence.  Moreover upholding the NJAC could temper the recent assertiveness of the Court, by allowing the government to appoint and transfer judges on the basis of their policy ideology, potentially diminishing the salutary role of the Court as a check on corruption and malgovernance in Indian politics. Based on the Court's earlier precedents, oral arguments and the bench's own statements, it is likely that the court will invalidate the NJAC in its current form.  While invalidating the NJAC under the basic structure doctrine would be extraordinary from a comparative perspective, such a ruling would be consistent with the Court's record of assertiveness in the defense of judicial integrity and independence.</p>

		<title>Protecting Michigan&#039;s No-Fault Insurance Act</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.davidchristensenlaw.com/attorneys/david-e-christensen/">David Christensen</a> of <a href="https://www.davidchristensenlaw.com">Christensen Law</a> discusses the benefits of Michigan's No-Fault Insurance Act and the need to protect it...</p><br />
                <strong>M</strong>ichigan has the most comprehensive no-fault auto insurance laws in the nation, but a series of no-fault reform bills have threatened the law this legislative session. The efforts to cut motorists off from benefits and offer sub-par plans without any guarantee of lower premiums have caused protests across the state, and yet the proposals continue to pile up, each one doing more harm to a system that has protected Michigan motorists for decades.</p>

                <p>Michigan's <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(3d2uhfae3zkhjpuvrqeuwq3k))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-218-1956-31">No-Fault Insurance Act</a>, first established in 1973, requires every motorist in the state to buy car insurance to cover any injuries resulting from an auto accident. Michigan is one of several states that have transitioned to the no-fault model, where each driver or passenger looks to their own insurance for benefits to cover medical expenses as the result of a car crash, rather than suing the at-fault driver. Passengers are covered by their own policies, if they have one, or by the driver's policy if no one in their household has no-fault insurance. When all else fails, the Assigned Claims Facility delegates the case to one of the state's licensed auto insurers. One way or another, every Michigan resident can be covered for their injuries.</p>

                <p>In exchange for this certainty, Michigan drivers are very limited in their ability to sue at-fault drivers for their non-economic damages, like disability, loss of support, pain and suffering. There is no monetary threshold, like there are in other no-fault states, but unless drivers or passengers have suffered death, disability, or a &#8220;serious impairment of a body function&#8221; they will be limited to the benefits described in the Michigan No-Fault Insurance Act. Before an injured motorist can sue the other driver, he or she will have to show that they have an &#8220;objectively manifested impairment to an important body function that has affected your general ability to lead your normal life.&#8221;</p>

                <p>What sets Michigan apart from the other states that allow no-fault insurance, however, is that the medical benefits provided under the Michigan No-Fault Insurance Act are unlimited. Most states place per person and per accident limits on medical benefits. In Michigan, though, as long as a treatment is medically necessary to treat an injury that was the result of an auto accident, it is covered. Claims continue as long as treatment is necessary. This can take years, particularly in the most serious cases, where brain injuries or disabilities affect the patients' abilities for life.</p>

                <p>The law is interpreted broadly, ensuring injured motorists have access to doctors and surgeons, diagnostic and assessment tests, physical and occupational therapy, crutches, wheelchairs, prosthetic devices and other medical equipment. It even covers modifications to the injured party's home or vehicle to accommodate an accident-related disability. It covers home health care and attendant services too, as long as they are prescribed by a doctor.</p>

                <p>Injured motorists are also entitled to lost wages for any time they were off work as a result of their injuries. Drivers can receive 85 percent of their salaries for up to three years of unemployment. This helps to make sure that an injured motorist never has to choose between their treatments and their mortgage or child support payments.</p>

                <p>To keep insurance companies from having to pay out all of this all-inclusive coverage, the Michigan No-Fault Insurance Act created the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/cis/MCCA_FAQ_2007_190996_7.pdf">Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association</a> [PDF] (MCCA) &#8212; a non-profit organization made up of all the insurance providers licensed to sell car insurance in the state. The MCCA reimburses any auto insurer required to pay more than $530,000 in medical expenses as the result of a catastrophic motor vehicle accident. Its fund is made up of a relatively small fee ($150 in 2014) charged to every driver attached to their auto insurance bill.</p>

                <p>Opponents of the current system have been trying to convince Michigan legislators to modify the law for years. They argue that the high cost of Michigan's no-fault auto insurance is a burden on residents and causes too many people to drive uninsured. The 2014 and 2015 legislative sessions have seen the strongest push yet for no-fault reform.</p>

                <p>Last year, Republican and Democratic lawmakers each put forward a pack of bills to change the way auto accident law was practiced in Michigan. The GOP reforms focused on limiting auto insurance providers' liability, including caps on benefits for necessary medical care. They also eliminated an injured motorist's right to a jury and made it harder for plaintiffs to pursue their cases. The Democrats' no-fault reform instead placed limits on industry practices and attempted to bolster consumer protections. Neither set of bills managed to survive the legislative session.</p>

                <p>This year, the proposed reforms have once again tried to cut off Michigan's catastrophically injured motorists. The reforms, which <a href="https://www.davidchristensenlaw.com/update-michigan-senate-rushes-to-approve-no-good-no-fault-reform/">sped through the Michigan Senate in less than 48 hours</a>, would close out the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association, replacing it with a new organization that cuts off insurance providers' liability at $500,000 and puts the burden of any additional claims directly in injured motorists. The bill would also put strict limits on attendant care benefits and create a Automobile Insurance Fraud Authority to allow insurance providers to pursue consumers and doctors filing false claims for injuries.</p>

                <p>After this no-fault reform bill stalled out in the Michigan House of Representatives, the Democratic mayor of Detroit raised a new proposal, this one designed to reduce the cost of car insurance for the residents of Detroit (which are substantially higher than anywhere else in the state). He proposed a &#8220;qualified benefits plan&#8221; that would ask residents of cities where over half the residents are uninsured to give up on Michigan's high-quality no-fault auto insurance policies. Instead, they could only receive $250,000 in critical care and $25,000 in continuing care per accident. The qualified benefits recipients would also be excluded from benefits from the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association. The bill wasn't clear on whether plan participants would be able to sue at-fault drivers to help make up the difference, so once they have used up their benefits Detroit residence could have to cover all the rest of their medical expenses themselves.</p>

                <p>All of the no-fault reforms proposed in 2015 have been based on the idea that Michigan's insurance policies are too expensive for motorists. But none of the proposals require insurance providers to cut costs or lower premiums. In fact, there are no protections for drivers at all. Even though proponents of the reforms claim that the benefit limits will result in reduced premiums, they could just as easily support increased industry profits. That's why the Coalition Protecting Auto No-Fault and other consumer advocates have been vocally opposed to the reforms. The debate has attracted <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/05/14/406744591/why-some-detroit-residents-claim-to-live-someplace-else">national attention</a> and has raised the question of what the purpose of all the reforms really are.</p>

                <p>Michigan's no-fault auto insurance laws are designed to make sure that no one faces financial ruin because of an auto accident. After decades of successful coverage, opponents are pushing to cut critically injured motorists off when they need help the most, all without any guarantee of short-term financial benefit. The Michigan No-Fault Insurance Act isn't perfect, but any reform needs to protect the motorists the insurance is designed to benefit, not just the companies that make a profit on their premiums.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.umassd.edu/law/faculty/jeremiahho/">Jeremiah A. Ho </a>of <a href="http://www.umassd.edu/law/">the University of Massachusetts School of Law,</a> discusses the substantial federal question underlining in <span class="casename">Obergefell v. Hodges</span>...</p>

<p>Last month the US Supreme Court ruled on marriage equality in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=497090211360466192">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> and ushered in the decision that the fundamental right to marriage applies not only to opposite-sex couples but equally to same-sex couples as well. With that, state exclusions of this unenumerated and constitutionally-basic right from same-sex couples were viewed as intolerable under the US Constitution. This perspective was not so readily evident in the national imagination even in the recent past, let alone more than four decades ago when the court itself had summarily dismissed its first same-sex marriage case, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14283825888588258352">Baker v. Nelson</a>, "for want of a substantial federal question." Nearly 43 years later, <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> has now revealed that there definitely is a federal question within the context of same-sex marriage. The court's answer to that federal question last month showed just how substantial that question was.  <br />
  <br />
So how did we get here? Writing for the <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> majority, Justice Kennedy reasoned through the issue within a specific context of discrimination that he&#8212;as the author of now four canonical gay rights decisions in recent Supreme Court memory&#8212;began building in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17758055891258118781">Romer v. Evans</a> and has developed throughout the rest of the quartet: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">US v. Windsor</a> and <span class="casename">Obergefell</span>. Throughout these opinions, Kennedy has relied on concepts of animus and dignity to create a narrative&#8212;both emotional and doctrinal&#8212;of the experience of marginalization endured by sexual minorities under the law. Gradually, the connection between animus and dignity in these cases has crystallized into an anti-stereotyping principle, proven crucial for mediating from one gay rights case to another and for overturning discrimination in each instance at the court.  </p>

<p>Although <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> did not rule on the issue of whether sexual minorities deserved higher tiered scrutiny protection than rational basis, Kennedy's reliance on animus and dignity in <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> sets up importantly the next step in gay rights activism: antidiscrimination.  </p>

<p>By tracking Kennedy's quartet of gay rights cases, we see that the concepts of animus and dignity were first introduced separately in earlier cases and then married together in the later ones. Kennedy introduced the concept of animus within the context of sexual orientation discrimination in <span class="casename">Romer</span> in 1996, importing its use from other equal protection cases such as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13551564938391933211">Department of Agriculture v. Moreno</a>. Rather than exploring whether sexual orientation warranted suspect or quasi-suspect classification to overrule Colorado's Amendment 2, a voter-approved referendum that banned any specified legal protections for gays and lesbians from discrimination, Kennedy drew upon a significant finding of animus to rule that Amendment 2 was unconstitutional under rational basis. In a political society, we cannot reasonably sustain laws created with hatred or animus against a particular group and Amendment 2 "seem[ed] inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects."   </p>

<p>Then with <span class="casename">Lawrence</span> in 2003, Kennedy introduced the idea that discrimination against sexual orientation could amount to a deprivation of dignity when he wrote to overturn <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14901730125647575103">Bowers v. Hardwick</a>, a Supreme Court decision that had permitted states to criminalize consensual same-sex intimacy. Kennedy articulated the idea that state sodomy laws that criminalized consensual same-sex intimacy interfered with the autonomy and privacy of consensual adults engaging in same-sex sexual behavior and singled them out to be criminals if caught. This criminalizing effect left such adults without dignity for engaging in intimate behavior possibly indicative of their sexual orientation. By likening <span class="casename">Lawrence</span> to other privacy cases such as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>, Kennedy extrapolated the dignitary harms concerns from the context of privacy and contraceptives in <span class="casename">Casey</span> and embedded them here in the realm of same-sex intimacy and demonstrated that for same-sex couples, the criminalization of intimacy that could be indicative of their sexual orientation deprived them of the privacy, freedoms and dignity that were afforded couples engaging in sex acts indicative of heterosexuality. From <span class="casename">Lawrence</span>, the freedom to engage in consensual sex was deemed part of "the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, and of the universe, and of the mystery of human life." Criminalization of such acts amounted to indignity.  </p>

<p>While <span class="casename">Romer</span> was solely an animus case and Lawrence championed dignity rights, <span class="casename"> Windsor</span> was Kennedy's first gay rights opinion to explicitly combine the two concepts. While discussing <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-104hr3396enr/pdf/BILLS-104hr3396enr.pdf">DOMA's</a> [PDF] discriminatory effect against sexual minorities in <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, Kennedy found that DOMA was a law steeped in animus that effectively marginalized married same-sex couples on the federal level. His examination of DOMA's legislative intent captured a finding that DOMA was borne of legislative animus&#8212;a moral disapproval reinforced by antigay essentialist notions about same-sex relationships&#8212;and animus that had an intolerable purpose of imposing inequality. Fueled by animus, DOMA then existed to discriminate against married same-sex couples, not only by excluding federal benefits available to married opposite-sex couples, but by also symbolically relegating them to second-class labeling. Kennedy distinctively characterized such relegation as stigmatizing and demeaning to same-sex relationships and to the families created by those relationships. In <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, he doctrinally and centrally wove both animus and dignity into his calculation of DOMA's unconstitutionality under equal protection, fully galvanizing the connection as the reason to overturn such discrimination in the law.    </p>

<p>Post-<span class="casename">Windsor</span>, lower courts imported and elaborated upon Kennedy's animus-dignity connection into their own resolutions over state marriage bans and mini-DOMAs. Such courts utilized the broadness of Kennedy's language in <span class="casename">Windsor</span> to explore the animus-dignity connection in marriage and sexual orientation discrimination even further. The post-<span class="casename">Windsor</span> moment was an interesting one for observing how subsequent courts have used some of the open-endedness of the animus-dignity connection in <span class="casename">Windsor</span> to reinterpret doctrinally how denying same-sex couples the right to marry constituted discrimination. Essentially, these courts in post-<span class="casename">Windsor</span> marriage cases picked up where Justice Kennedy left off.  </p>

<p>When marriage litigation boomeranged back to the Supreme Court in <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> this year, Kennedy extended the animus-dignity connection in an opinion that encompassed the same-sex marriage issue under both fundamental rights and equal protection. Kennedy was able to humanize discrimination against same-sex couples by framing the facts between historical animus toward sexual minorities that excluded them from marriage and the genuine indignities such animus has caused. Kennedy began his opinion by reiterating the intellectualized stance taken by same-sex marriage opponents that "it would demean a timeless institution if the concept and lawful status of marriage were extended to two persons of the same sex." Implicit in Kennedy's depiction is the rhetorical question, why would such inclusion "demean" the institution of marriage but for the moral disapproval or animus of same-sex couples? He then transitioned to the depictions of that exclusion, notably mentioning the plights of the petitioners in undignified positions because of marriage bans in their home states. Particularly heart-breaking was the account of Petitioner Obergefell who had to marry his ailing spouse inside a medical transport plane on a Baltimore tarmac far away from their home state of Ohio only to have Ohio later strip them of the benefits of marital status. The animus-dignity connection also appeared in Kennedy historicism on the modern gay rights movement, when he discussed how "same-sex intimacy long had been condemned as immoral by the state itself in most Western nations" and that was why "many persons did not deem homosexuals to have dignity in their own distinct identity." In a similar passage, he noted a time when "the argument that gays and lesbians had a just claim to dignity was in conflict with both law and widespread social conventions." These narrative uses of animus and dignity exemplify the connection as an anti-stereotyping principle that channels toward an emotional rather than an intellectualized core. It is also the first time in these cases that animus and dignity have been used on this visceral level.   </p>

<p>In articulating why the fundamental right to marriage applied also to same-sex couples, Kennedy relied primarily on dignity rights reminiscent of how he reached his result in <span class="casename">Lawrence</span> and <span class="casename">Windsor</span>. Withholding the exercise of marriage rights from same-sex couples restricted personal choice and self-determinism, perpetuated a second-class citizenship, demeaned the families created by same-sex unions and precluded benefits of marriage accorded opposite-sex couples. And once the fundamental rights issue for the ability of same-sex couples to exercise the right to marriage was set, Kennedy did not need to venture into a protected class analysis in his equal protection rationale. Of course, pro-LGBTQ rights advocates had hoped that <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> 's equal protection analysis would have been more robust in regards to sexual orientation as a protected class. But even here, the result was favorable for same-sex couples and Kennedy accomplished this in part by relying again on connecting animus and dignity when he wrote that "[e]specially against a long history of disapproval of their relationships, this denial to same-sex couples of the right to marry works a grave and continuing harm.  The imposition of this disability on gays and lesbians serves to disrespect and subordinate them."  </p>

<p>Where do we go from here? The animus-dignity propagated in these gay rights cases has established a correlative effect between the two concepts that elevates the connection into an anti-stereotyping principle or channeling device. The connection shows us what is wrong with the way the law has been used to marginalize a sub-group in society based on disapproval for a characteristic that members of this sub-group possess. The connection then highlights how that marginalization pervasively hinders members of the sub-group's ability to lead their lives according to our collective beliefs of self-determinism, freedom and individuality. That correlative effect offers potential furthering advances in sexual orientation antidiscrimination, the next realm for gay rights advocacy.   </p>

<p>Post-<span class="casename">Obergefell</span>, antidiscrimination advocates should seek more instances for exposing how some long-standing societal prejudices toward sexual minorities are based on animus and how that animus leads to marginalization that deprives human dignity. Through those instances, the experiences of sexual minorities will be revisited within the context of important big-word concepts in American democracy&#8212;ideas such as autonomy, liberty, equality and justice&#8212;that we all fundamentally value, but perhaps in different ways. In particular, sexual orientation could be regarded highly as a characteristic, protectable like race or gender, viewed as being so basic to peoples' identities that the law ought not to curtail or force them to change. In order to get there, advocates will need to rely on concepts of animus to demonstrate how notions that being gay was either a choice that is morally blameworthy or a biological pathology are prejudicial and have been the impetus for policies and laws that marginalize sexual minorities. Advocates will also need to employ dignity concepts in showing how marginalization harms personal and human dignities by interfering with freedom of sexual minorities to live based on their constitutive sexual identities. Aside from being historically important judgments, the animus-dignity connection is the legacy that Kennedy's <span class="casename">Romer</span> to <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> gay rights cases leaves us for the next step.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.alliancealert.org/2010/03/01/about-david-cortman/">David A. Cortman</a>, senior counsel at <a href="http://www.adflegal.org/">Alliance Defending Freedom</a>, discusses the implications of the Supreme Court decision in <span class="casename">Reed v. Town of Gilbert</span>...</p>

                <p><br />
                    <strong>T</strong>he government is relatively good at some things: protecting its citizens through police and fire departments, collecting and spending money (sometimes too good) and fixing potholes (on occasion). But one thing the government has repeatedly shown itself incapable of doing is regulating speech. Time and again the government has played favorites by giving preferred access to expression it likes and censoring speech it does not.  </p>

                <p>This is exactly what happened in the town of Gilbert, Arizona. When a small church attempted to put up a few small signs inviting passersby to its services, it found itself on the losing end of government speech regulations. The winners: political signs. No surprise there, since those making the rules want to ensure they get re-elected and stay in power. So while scores of political and many other types of signs could be displayed on the street corners throughout Gilbert for months at a time, the small church was restricted to put smaller signs that could only be displayed a few hours before the service.  </p>

                <p>The US Supreme Court's unanimous ruling in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15960869126869933440">Reed v. Town of Gilbert</a> in favor of the church, which I represented, was thus an important victory for all the little guys who have ever found their speech silenced by the strong arm of government. By affirming that the government cannot ban speech based on "the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed" unless it has a compelling interest, the court ensured that government entities, both federal and local, cannot pick winners and losers when it comes to free speech. Indeed as Justice Elena Kagan explained in her concurring opinion, the town's restrictions did not pass "even the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/us/justices-side-with-arizona-church-in-dispute-over-sign-limits.html?_r=0">laugh test</a>."</p>

                <p>  The court's ruling means that whenever the government attempts to regulate speech&#8212;whether that speech is on roadside signs, in rooms rented out in schools and libraries, or at rallies in a public park&#8212;it must do so in an even-handed, neutral way. So whether your speech is religious like the church's or is just discussing a particular topic that is important to you, it must be given the same access as all other speech.  </p>

                <p>There is another important impact of the court's ruling. For many years some lower courts had upheld government restrictions on speech that harmed some speakers but not others as long as the government did not have a bad motive for enacting the restrictions. In other words as long as the government officials could articulate a seemingly legitimate rationale for censoring some speech or hide its bad motive well, that was sufficient. In fact, that is what happened to the small church in this case. Gilbert officials claimed that the restrictions on the church's temporary signs were not the result of ill will but rather were needed to limit clutter. But if that was truly the justification, why did it allow an unlimited number of political signs to clutter up the town?  </p>

                <p>Fortunately the Supreme Court recognized that even "[i]nnocent motives do not eliminate the danger of censorship." The town could not legitimately claim an interest in limiting clutter while "at the same time allowing unlimited numbers of other types of signs that create the same problem."   The impact of the broad protections for free speech the court recognized in <span class="casename">Reed</span> will be badly needed far outside of the context of sign regulations. Two areas in particular are worth noting.  </p>

                <p>First, just a few weeks after the <span class="casename">Reed</span> decision, the court ruled in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=497090211360466192">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> that a constitutional right to same-sex marriage exists. As a multitude of commentators have recognized, the <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> decision does more than simply change the marriage laws of every state; it opens the door for greater restrictions against those who vocally oppose same-sex marriage based on religious, political or other grounds.  </p>

                <p>While Justice Anthony Kennedy weakly acknowledged that "religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned," we are already seeing efforts to paint opposition to same-sex marriage as beyond the pale in our post-<span class="casename">Obergefell</span> society. Indeed groups like the ACLU have already <a href="http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/06/28/aclu-were-not-defending-religious-freedom-laws-anymore-n2018582">withdrawn</a> their support from laws like the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> that provide protections to religious speakers.</p>

                <p>  Things are even more dire on university campuses across our nation. The hot new trend among college administrators is the enactment of speech codes-policies that ban speech based upon its content or the reaction of the listener. Florida State University provides a perfect example. FSU's <a href="http://www.hr.fsu.edu/PDF/Publications/diversity/EEO_Statement.pdf">Equal Opportunity and Non-Discrimination Statement</a> [PDF] provides that "behavior that may be considered offensive, demeaning, or degrading to persons or groups will not be tolerated."   But who decides what is offensive or demeaning? Rather than provide robust protection for speech that offends, FSU defers to the arbitrary standards of tolerance of the most delicate in the student body whose ears cannot stand to hear an opinion that challenges or contradicts their own beliefs.</p>

                <p>  <span class="casename">Reed</span> addresses both of these scenarios head-on. Just like those in power in <span class="casename">Reed</span> could not afford special protection for their favored speech (political signs that help keep them in power) while denying protection for the church's less favored speech, so too are same-sex marriage proponents restricted from banning speech opposing such marriages, and so too are university officials restricted from elevating their preferred orthodoxy and silencing the views of students they deem offensive.  </p>

                <p>Those in power cannot limit debate and dialogue to those views that flow in the same direction as their own. Tolerance is a two-way street and that means everyone is going to bump into those with opposing beliefs and views now and then. <span class="casename">Reed</span> teaches us that such conflict is desirable in a democratic society and the court will subject with exacting scrutiny efforts to mandate the flow of dialogue in a single direction.  </p>

                <p>Likewise any seemingly innocent motives of same-sex marriage advocates and university officials who claim to be solely concerned with protecting LGBT individuals and students do not change the outcome. When the government seeks to ban entire topics or viewpoints to address perceived societal harms, it is a clear sign of laziness (at best) or outright animosity (at worst) to those holding "unacceptable" beliefs.  </p>

                <p>Rather than drafting clear guidelines to remedy the perceived harm, government officials draft broad bans on protected expression-often targeted at certain groups, and then hide under the umbrella of "but we had good intentions." Under <span class="casename">Reed</span> the nobility of the cause is not a sufficient justification for a restriction that impinges fundamental rights; otherwise, those rights are no longer fundamental.</p>

                <p>  Many more cultural debates will take place in our nation, just as many have since its inception. The debates between federalists and anti-federalists were as heated then as the debates are today between those who affirm the man-woman definition of marriage and those who do not. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> ensures that these debates can continue unfettered and without interference by government actors who favor one side of the debate.   Whether you like signs or not, same-sex marriage or not, we can all agree that society is worse off when the government is given too much authority over what its citizens can say. The <span class="casename">Reed</span> decision provides an important check against this authority, ensuring a fair playing field in the marketplace of ideas.</p>

                <p><em>  David A. Cortman is senior counsel with <a href="http://www.adflegal.org/">Alliance Defending Freedom</a> and argued the case <span class="casename">Reed v. Town of Gilbert</span> on behalf of an Arizona church before the US Supreme Court.</em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.southernafricalitigationcentre.org/about/staff/anneke-meerkotter/">Anneke Meerkotter</a> of the Southern Africa Litigation Centre and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/graeme-reid">Graeme Reid</a> of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/about">Human Rights Watch</a> discuss how recent court rulings in Botswana, Kenya and Zambia illustrate significant progress in human rights in general and in LGBT rights in particular... </p><br />
                <strong>I</strong>n the past eight months, three African court decisions&#8212;in Botswana, Kenya and Zambia&#8212;have asserted basic freedoms in the face of popular prejudice and discriminatory laws. These cases represent significant progress on human rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people and have broader implications with regard to countries' obligations to uphold basic rights for marginalized or unpopular groups. <br />
                <br />
                Botswana is one of 36 countries in Africa that outlaw same-sex sexual conduct. In February 2012, activists in Botswana applied to register their organization, Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals of Botswana (<a href="https://legabibo.wordpress.com/about/">LEGABIBO</a>), with the government. The registrar rejected their application on the grounds that Botswana's constitution does not recognize homosexuals and that the application would contravene the Societies Act, by operating for an "unlawful purpose or other purpose prejudicial to, or incompatible with, peace, welfare or good order in Botswana."</p>

                <p>But more than two years later, in November 2014, LEGABIBO's persistence paid off when the Botswanan High Court <a href="http://www.southernafricalitigationcentre.org/1/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LEGABIBO-judgment-low-resolution.pdf">held</a> [PDF] that refusal to register the group was a violation of the applicants' rights to equal protection of the law and to freedoms of expression, association and assembly. This decision was especially significant as the court emphasized that the laws prohibiting same-sex sexual acts did not criminalize homosexuality <em>per se</em>. Nor did they criminalize advocacy for the reform of these laws.</p>

                <p>The court asserted that gay, lesbian and bisexual people have the same rights as anyone else, regardless of laws that criminalize consensual same-sex conduct. In other words the court drew a clear line between identity&#8212;who a person is, and practice&#8212;what a person does. This is very significant because it helps protect the ability of groups to organize around the rights of LGBT people. The attorney general appealed the decision and the matter will be heard before the Court of Appeal later this year.<br />
                    <br />
                    The Kenya High Court handed down a similar <a href="http://kenyalaw.org/caselaw/cases/view/108412/">judgment</a> in April. The NGO Coordination Board, a government body, had refused to register the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission on moral grounds and because the organization purportedly aimed to promote prohibited acts. The three judges rejected subjective moral convictions and asserted fundamental human rights and the rule of law: "No matter how strongly held moral and religious beliefs may be, they cannot be a basis for limiting rights."</p>

                <p>The judgment strikes a similar tone to the Botswana ruling, emphasizing that, the Penal Code does not criminalize homosexuality, or the state of being homosexual, but only certain sexual acts against the order of nature, and that the Penal Code does not criminalize the right of association of people based on their sexual orientation. The judgment observed that "an interpretation of non-discrimination which excludes people based on their sexual orientation would be in conflict with the principles of human dignity, inclusiveness, equality, human rights and non-discrimination."<br />
                    <br />
                    In the third case, in May, the Zambian High Court upheld the acquittal of a human rights activist, Paul Kasonkomona. In April 2013 he expressed his opinion&#8212;on a privately owned television channel&#8212;that the rights of sexual minorities, including LGBT people and sex workers, should be recognized. He was arrested outside the television studio and charged under an obscure and archaic provision of the Penal Code outlawing "soliciting for immoral purposes" in a public place.</p>

                <p>Kasonkomona was <a href="http://www.southernafricalitigationcentre.org/1/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Kasonkomona-Ruling.pdf">acquitted</a> [PDF] in the Magistrate's Court, where the magistrate held that the "accused was exercising his freedom of expression" as provided for in the Zambian Constitution. "What I heard," said the magistrate, "was that he was advocating for the rights of those already practicing [homosexuality] to be protected." He posed&#8212;and answered&#8212;a rhetorical question about whether a person who advocated abolition of the death sentence would be "soliciting for immoral purposes? The answer is no."<br />
                    <br />
                    The government appealed the acquittal, but on May 15, the High Court confirmed Kasonkomona's acquittal and reiterated the ruling of the magistrate, which distinguished between soliciting someone to engage in same-sex sexual acts, a criminal offense in Zambia, and advocating for people's rights.</p>

                <p>The three cases stand in stark contrast to a <a href="http://www.ulii.org/ug/judgment/high-court/2014/85">judgment</a> by the Ugandan High Court in July 2014, in which a judge ruled against four activists who had sued the ethics and integrity minister, Simon Lokodo, for shutting down a February 2012 workshop on advocacy for LGBT rights. The judge ruled that the workshop participants were "promoting" or "inciting" same-sex acts, in a ruling that went so far as to suggest that even distributing condoms to gay and bisexual men would amount to 'direct or indirect promotion of same-sex practices."<br />
                    <br />
                    Each case revolves around the fundamental rights of a marginalized and unpopular minority. The underlying principles affirmed in the three most recent rulings apply more widely. Freedoms of expression and association are fundamental rights provided for in the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. All too often African human rights defenders are silenced by means of arbitrary, vague or overbroad criminal laws.</p>

                <p>It is essential, to protect human rights in general and LGBT rights in particular, to ensure that the rights to freedom of expression and association are protected in national constitutions and legislation and not eroded through politically motivated prosecutions or the threat of prosecutions. It is heartening to see cases in which freedoms of association and expression have trumped archaic laws and popular prejudice. These judgments illustrate that justice can prevail where the judiciary is independent and able to uphold its constitutional mandate to protect human rights.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.indianatech.edu/staff/faculty/marcus/">Nancy Marcus</a> of <a href="http://law.indianatech.edu/">Indiana Tech Law School</a> discusses religious freedom in the US...</p><strong>I</strong>n a recent battle between reproductive rights and religious freedom, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1860979712663520436">Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman</a> rejected claims brought by a pharmacy owner and two pharmacists seeking exemptions from regulations requiring the timely dispensation of drugs to patients. The pharmacist plaintiffs, alleging "<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/free_exercise_clause">free exercise</a>" religious freedom and other constitutional claims, initiated the lawsuit in 2007, challenging the Washington state regulations based on their religious objections to being required to provide emergency contraceptives to rape victims and other patients in need. The court rejected their free exercise and other constitutional claims, concluding that the pharmacy rules were neutral laws of general applicability and justified under rational basis review.  </p>

<p>The <span class="casename">Stormans</span> decision emphasized the need for patients to be able to access medicine expediently and free from shame imposed by their pharmacists. The court also followed the Supreme Court's 1990 decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10098593029363815472" >Employment Division v. Smith</a>, in which Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, established that the right to freely exercise one's religion "does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes)." Given that Scalia is himself a proudly staunch Catholic whose religious views inform many of his positions, his strong condemnation in <span class="casename">Smith</span> of attempts to carve out religious exemptions to laws may at first seem counterintuitive. His majority opinion in <span class="casename">Smith</span>, however, may perhaps best be understood by reference to the case's context: Smith involved religious freedom claims by members of the Native American Church seeking drug law exemptions due to their use of peyote during religious ceremonies. Scalia, it appears, was more loathe to rule in favor of judicially limiting drug laws than he was willing to facilitate free exercise claims at any cost. And so it came to be that perhaps the most vocally religious sitting member of the Supreme Court bench ended up authoring the Supreme Court decision that most severely curtailed constitutional religious freedom protections.</p>

<p>Due to <span class="casename">Smith's</span> establishment of rational basis deference as the applicable standard for free exercise claims, it should come as no surprise when courts in free exercise cases such as <span class="casename">Stormans</span> defer to reasonable justifications for laws of general applicability in rejecting religious exemption claims. Religious plaintiffs seeking exemptions from laws that they feel force them to participate in the provision of reproductive health care services against their beliefs are less likely to succeed in a constitutional challenge triggering only deferential rational basis review than under other types of challenges grounded in statutes that either accord a higher degree of scrutiny to government actions or that specifically carve out refusal, or "conscience" clause, exemptions to laws.</p>

<p>For example, in the aftermath of <span class="casename">Smith</span>, the federal <a href="http://prop1.org/legal/rfra.htm">Religious Freedom Restoration Act ("RFRA")</a> was enacted by those who felt that the decision had curtailed religious freedom to a damaging degree. An ultimately bipartisan majority of Congress, with President Clinton's signature, enacted RFRA to restore a higher degree of scrutiny to government actions that allegedly violate religious freedom. Specifically, RFRA replaces <span class="casename">Smith's</span> rational basis review for free exercise claims with the heightened scrutiny standard of review that, in RFRA claims, requires the government to justify through a compelling government interest its actions that impose substantial burdens on religious exercises.  </p>

<p>While the original federal RFRA was not enacted initially as an anti-reproductive rights statute (or even as an anti-LGBT rights statute, which has been the underlying tenor of more recent state RFRA battles), both the federal statute and their state RFRA progenies have in recent years become the focal point of challenges by religious conservatives to laws providing reproductive health care coverage.   </p>

<p>At the Supreme Court level, the federal RFRA was the basis of the plaintiffs' successful challenge in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5322529599500468186">Hobby Lobby v. Burwell</a> to contraceptive coverage requirements of the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> as applied to certain closely held corporations. In <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span>, the court allowed closely held corporations that cited religious objections to contraceptives they believed to be abortifacients to make a certification for the accommodation of its objections, which would result in the coverage still being provided to employees, but through a separate payment structure not funded directly by the employer.   </p>

<p>It remains to be seen how broadly the <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> decision can be extended as a shield, or even a sword, by those claiming religious exemptions from other laws of general applicability. So far, its reach has been somewhat limited in post-<span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> challenges to the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive coverage requirements.  In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4916633601898220891">University of Notre Dame v. Burwell</a>, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected a RFRA-based claim by the Catholic university to the Affordable Care Act, concluding that the school had no viable claim based solely on its contractual relationship with health care companies that provide contraceptive coverage to students and employees, and noting that the school's demands were even broader than those in <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span>, with the school refusing to accept even the certification accommodation compromise. Similarly, in <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/B5124BF67FED385785257D900053E80B/$file/13-5368-1522271.pdf">Priests for Life v. Department of Health and Human Services</a> [PDF], the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected arguments that the regulatory certification accommodations did not go far enough in protecting the religious freedom of various religious nonprofit organizations that chose to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive coverage requirements.</p>

<p>The free exercise and federal RFRA cases are only two types of cases that are part of a broader and more complex history of religion-based challenges to laws of general applicability pertaining to reproductive health care access. While some claims have been brought through federal or state RFRAs, there is also a legislative trend of religious objectors legislatively carving out exemptions from laws specifically governing reproductive health services. As the <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/">Guttmacher Institute</a> reports, every state in the country allows health care providers to refuse to perform abortions. In addition, eighteen states allows some health care providers to refuse to provide sterilization services, and thirteen allow some health care providers to refuse to provide contraceptive coverage. These exemptions, often written in terms of "conscience" clause exemptions, or "refusal" clauses, extend in many states to pharmacies, to both secular and religious medical institutions and to health care professionals ranging from doctors and nurses to pharmacists. The Guttmacher Institute further reports that while a few states have enacted laws "that specifically allow pharmacists or pharmacies to refuse to provide health care because of religious or moral objections ... other states have broadly worded refusal clause statutes that also might apply in these circumstances." </p>

<p>Not every religious organization, or even Christian organization, it should be noted, shares moral objections to birth control, emergency contraception, or even abortion. To the contrary, the <a href="http://rcrc.org/">Religious Coalition for Reproductive Rights</a>, a broad coalition of religious organizations that oppose religious freedom-based challenges to reproductive rights, has taken the position "that real religious liberty protects the right of a woman to make thoughtful decisions in private consultation with her doctor, her family, and her own faith. Politicians and the religious dogma of another faith should never interfere with religious liberty of an individual." </p>

<p>In recent years, free exercise, RFRA and conscience clause debates have expanded into a different but related area:  the access of LGBT citizens to equal marriage rights, to public accommodations and to other rights and privileges that go hand in hand with equal citizenship. Citing moral objections akin to their reproductive health care objections, some groups have recently raised religious freedom claims in efforts to avoid becoming even minimally involved in the equal treatment of LGBT citizens. One of the famous and divisive such <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/02/sweet-cakes-by-melissa-fined-same-sex-wedding_n_7718540.html">incidents</a> is the case of an Oregon bakery, Sweet Cakes by Melissa, that was found to have violated a state nondiscrimination ordinance when its owners refused to sell a wedding cake to a same-sex couple and was consequently fined by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries in a final order that rejected a free exercise constitution defense raised by the bakery.  </p>

<p>Those who seek to use religious freedom as a shield against accommodating LGBT individuals are more likely to be successful when their claims also involve compelled speech, as in a recent case that involved successful RFRA and compelled speech arguments by a t-shirt company that successfully defended itself against a discrimination claim brought by the Lexington, Kentucky, Pride festival organizers after the company refused to make t-shirts for the group. The court decision in favor of the t-shirt company applied both Kentucky's RFRA statute and the Supreme Court's <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8332999881059454410">Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston</a> case&#8212;in which the court had held that parade organizers may not be compelled even under an anti-discrimination statute to include a pro-LGBT message with which it disagrees in their parade&#8212;in its ruling for the t-shirt companies.</p>

<p>Whatever the particular legal basis of a religious freedom claim, this series of developments begs the larger question: should one group's religious freedom claims be used, not just as a shield against oppressive laws that might limit how one's religion is practiced in the privacy of one's own religious community, but also as a sword to intrude upon the rights of others, whether in the context of reproductive health care access or the civil rights of LGBT individuals? These tensions between reproductive and LGBT rights, on the one hand, and the religious freedom to either discriminate against sexual minorities or deny access to their rights and to the reproductive rights of women, on the other, will continue to percolate in legal battles across the country, as conflicts continue among those resisting the trajectory of progress toward greater LGBT rights and reproductive health care access in this country.</p>

		<title>The Toshiba Corporate Governance Scandal: How Can Japanese Corporate Governance be Fixed?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.ics.hit-u.ac.jp/jp/bl/english/index.html">Bruce Aronson</a> of <a href="http://www.law.hit-u.ac.jp/eng/lawschool/">Hitotsubashi University's Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy</a> discusses the controversy surrounding Japanese corporate governance practices...</p><strong>A</strong> third-party investigative report released on July 20, 2015, found that Toshiba Corporation had padded its profits by $1.2 billion (1.5 billion yen) over the past six years. The current and two past presidents and half of the board of directors have resigned from their positions. Once again we are faced with the questions of how good Japanese corporate governance practices are and how might they be improved.</p>

<p>The Toshiba case was shocking news, even compared to other recent Japanese corporate governance scandals, such as the Olympus case in 2011, for two reasons. First, Toshiba is very much a part of Japan's business establishment. Two of the past four presidents have been Vice Chairmen of the main big business lobby (Keidanren), and a number of its top executives have served on cabinet-level committees charged with improving Japan's economic growth. Second, Toshiba was noted for its efforts in the corporate governance area. It was one of the roughly two percent of listed Japanese companies that chose to replace traditional governance structures with an "American-style" system of executive officers and board committees with independent directors.</p>

<p>Additionally, Toshiba instituted a modified "hybrid" board committee system that it held out as a "best of both worlds" approach that was more practical and effective for Japanese companies (for my law review article analyzing Toshiba's corporate governance model, see http://ssrn.com/abstract=2185127). For over a decade half of the Toshiba board (currently totaling 16 directors) consisted of "insider" executive directors and half of non-executive directors. The latter were equally divided between former senior company officials and independent directors. There are currently four independent directors, and, unlike the Olympus case, they are reported to have been truly independent and to have participated actively in open board discussions.        </p>

<p>How did things go so wrong despite this apparently sophisticated corporate governance structure? The former top management continues to insist that although it pressured operating divisions with aggressive profit targets it never intended, and was unaware of, any manipulation of accounting records. So far, the Japanese press has referred only to "inappropriate accounting" at Toshiba and has refrained from using more aggressive language such as "window dressing" of accounts that would indicate deliberate manipulation by top management.</p>

<p>The third-party investigative report criticized Toshiba's "corporate culture" under which operational managers "couldn't refuse" challenging profit targets demanded by top management. However, this is an incomplete explanation for bad practices that continued for six years during the terms of three company presidents. </p>

<p>While it is not a simple matter to pinpoint what exactly should be "fixed," the Toshiba case serves as a reminder that the real issue is not board structure, but rather actual board functioning, including processes, people, true independence, and management respect for the same. As part of its "American-style" board committee system, Toshiba had an audit committee of the board with a majority of outside directors, an arrangement which experts generally regard as superior to Japan's traditional internal corporate auditor system. However, as part of Toshiba's modification of the committee structure, the head of the audit committee was an inside director and two of the independent directors on the committee were ex-diplomats with little business experience. It does not appear to have functioned effectively.</p>

<p>In addition, more general weaknesses in Japan's corporate governance system that contributed to the Olympus scandal still remain today. These include relatively weak regulation and little risk of liability for external auditors who act as "gatekeepers" or financial intermediaries between companies and financial markets with respect to the accuracy of financial statements, a relatively ineffective whistleblower system, and a general lack of public and private enforcement to provide incentives for both disclosure and monitoring. </p>

<p>This is not to suggest that accounting problems at Toshiba condemn the entire system of Japanese corporate governance. Japan's household electronics companies may be something of a special case; they all have faced tremendous problems for two decades as the rise of low-cost competitors in Asia has decimated their traditional lines of business such as the manufacture of television sets. Sony, an industry rival, has been a particularly popular lightning rod for Japanese criticism of the ineffectiveness of the "American-style" board committee system; however, more traditional Japanese rivals such as Panasonic and Sharp have performed no better.  </p>

<p>It will be interesting to see what lessons are drawn from Toshiba's failure. Problems with Toshiba's seemingly well-considered "hybrid" approach to governance clearly illustrate the tension and difficult tradeoffs between insider and outsider perspectives. Director independence is important for monitoring management, however failures by American companies during the 2008 financial crisis have also exposed the limits of independence and resulted in a renewed call for director competence. Toshiba made an effort to utilize the knowledge and experience of former insiders, in combination with independent directors, to ensure effective monitoring of management. <br />
However, in this case, what it assumed was a strength proved to be a two-edged sword, as the audit committee apparently failed to function with sufficient independence.</p>

<p>Japan's corporate governance may be aided by a new corporate governance code for listed companies (which became effective June 1, 2015). Under this code Japanese companies must now report ("comply or explain") with respect to a long list of governance issues. Although a clear principle recommending a minimum of two independent directors has claimed much of the attention, other new areas such as director training and board self-evaluation may have a greater impact on board functioning.</p>

		<title>Framing Internationalization of West Papua Issues As Another Kosovo&#039;s Independency</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Dimas Kuncoro Jati, of <a href="http://www.ugm.ac.id/en/">Gadjah Mada University</a>, discusses the separatist movement in the West Papua and estimates its chances of exercising secession from Indonesia under the Kosovo scenario ... </p>

                <p><strong>W</strong>est Papua separatists are allegedly trying to seek international community attention by arranging a new strategy to compose a strong and well-grounded claim to secede from Indonesia. They are aware that the world does not turn its eyes and get sympathy for them if they are not supported by unbeatable reason to become an independent state. Just google "West Papua Independence" related-topics and you will hit on expositions of human rights violations, suppression policies by the government, discrimination and indications that all arrangements and negotiations aiming to resolve and placate the conflicts must be abandoned. The main point is trying to convince the readers that Indonesian policymakers have failed to "indonesianize" Papua.</p>

                <p>The recent incident of<a href="http://www.globalindonesianvoices.com/21710/on-tolikara-incident-president-to-hold-dialog-with-religious-leaders/"> fire-raising Mosque in Tolikara</a>&#8212;if confirmed to be fueled by the separatist splinter&#8212;can be regarded as a signal for the government to see how internationalization of the Papua issue really matters. Unsurprisingly, those examples in international law recently have been acknowledged as the criteria to secede based on the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CDUQFjACahUKEwiozbG1qb_HAhVCOD4KHS0FA6M&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmercury.ethz.ch%2Fserviceengine%2FFiles%2FISN%2F153359%2Fichaptersection_singledocument%2Fa9174341-b54f-4616-8bcc-c631e10b908f%2Fen%2F2.Secession_Day.pdf&ei=XszZVaimHMLw-AGtioyYCg&usg=AFQjCNFxgCR5rpMbdT74JDctb-Cfc-RG_g&sig2=srK4-KRbX8k4YBigqkL8Dw">Remedial Secession Doctrine</a> [PDF]. It argues that a certain category of people is able to separate from the sovereign state in the event of gross and systematic violations of human rights and instances of discrimination, subject to exhaustion of local and international remedies to resolve the conflicts. This motive has shown its patterns by attempting to tailor the West Papua case as another <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-urges-cooperation-in-aiding-of-displaced-persons-in-serbia-kosovo.php">Kosovo</a> or any other country that is deemed to have become independent because it was exercising its right to secede protected under the international law.</p>

                <p>History has noted that separations of an entity from a sovereign state have never ended in a single result. The results are always unpredictable. There are several entities who fight to secede from their "parent" states but have presently ended unsuccessfully, such as <a href="/forum/2015/05/Larry-Eaker-self-determination.php">Abkhazia</a>, <a href="/feature/2014/03/russia-history.php">Chechnya</a>, Bhiafra, <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-reports-humanitarian-law-violations-by-uganda-rebels-in-drc.php">Congo</a>, Angola, Bogainville and others. On the other hand, there are also entities who struggle and successfully become an independent state, such as Bangladesh, <a href="/feature/2013/11/icty---history-of-the-region.php">Bosnia-Herzegovina</a> and Kosovo.</p>

                <p>There are shades of grey in the legal certainty regarding the doctrine, which has made separatism in West Papua vulnerable. Indonesian policymakers are challenged to undertake preventive measures to anticipate this West Papua separatists' strategic surprise. The sole method to accomplish this goal is to bring the case in international law perspective. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FUh8W1-TnNcC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=David+Raic+John+Dugard&source=bl&ots=XHL0vWDGan&sig=-XUVbWqJkYwaBEfMzkfRDh8FRNA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAWoVChMIq_Csq7LCxwIVATU-Ch1U6QRU#v=onepage&q=David%20Raic%20John%20Dugard&f=false">David Raic and John Dugard </a>have discovered patterns or criteria to determine whether such people have the right to secede from their parent state.</p>

                <p>First, the people must be a minority. Papua and West Papua provinces have been given special autonomy through the <a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/46af542e2.html">Special Autonomy Act 2001</a>. Given this fact, whether a group in West Papua is a minority is not simply determinated by the calculated result of inferiority, but it is based on the government's alternative policies towards the population, which is changed from aggressive military approach to more fruitful and more humanizing focus with an autonomy framework. Hence, West Papua has met the inferiority element of being a minority and therefore has complied with the first requirement of the right to secede.</p>

                <p>Second, it is systematical discrimination. Article 2 of Special Autonomy Act on Papua mentions: "the establishment of The People of Papua Assembly (MRP) which constitutes representation of Papua's indigenous people possessing certain authorities toward the protection of Papua‟s indigenous people ..."</p>

                <p>MRP has been granted broad authority to represent Papua's rights of indigenous people. Such authority <em>inter alia</em> includes giving consideration on approval of candidates of Governor and Vice Governor, who have previously been proposed by the House of Papua‟s Legislative (DPRP), giving consideration and approval of the Special Autonomy Act's plan. In addition, the broad autonomy is enhanced by the statutory requirement that only an indigenous Papuan can be a Governor and a Vice Governor. These liberties do not simply prevent the people from being discriminated against, but also give priority as to who can be involved in public affairs.</p>

                <p>Third, we must use Executive Investigation Report by <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/81427c9bacaf9847c1256c6800603ff2?Opendocument">Indonesia's Commission of Human Rights</a> as guidance to establish the likelihood of human rights violations. Investigators implied that there is sufficient preliminary evidence of a gross violation of human rights in Wasior, Wamena and Abepura. These violations include embellishment, deprivation of liberty, tortures, rape and forced disappearance of civil population. Because the activities occurred widely and systematically, they can be categorized as crimes against humanity.</p>

                <p>However, such tragedies are not able to lead to the birth of a right to secede. International law strictly obligates states under <em>erga omnes</em> to put perpetrators of international law to justice and to embody such attempt in order to return to peaceful conditions (Restitutio in Integrum). Normally, the duty is embodied in prosecuting the violators of such severe crimes in Human Rights Court and by establishing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and other task forces.</p>

                <p>Last element is the exhaustion of peaceful arrangements and remedies. Domestically, this conflict can still be resolved peacefully through legal settlement by bringing an action against the perpetrators in Wamena, Wasior and Abepura in Human Rights Court. Although highly sensitive, this is a necessary step, because a court's judgment will demonstrate to both the perpetrators and the victims that in no circumstances should these atrocities happen ever again. The justice by the court will eventually give the sense of security, comfort, serenity and harmony to Papua.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile in the context of non-legal arrangements, Indonesia has been arranging several initiatives. The first and foremost one is through Special Autonomy. The second one is establishing the Human Rights Court and Truth and Reconciliation Commission under the mandate from the Special Autonomy Act, which will be a branch office of the National Commission of Human Rights National aimed to bring peace, justice and truth in Papua. Third one is through fully institutionalizing the Acceleration of Papua and West Papua Development Unit (UP4B), which is used to support the coordination, synchronization, facilitation and control of the development in Papua and West Papua. The last initiative is through peaceful dialogue between central and regional government, including DPRP, MRP and the Papua Adat Council. With this consistent relation on bridging Jakarta-Papua, the concerned-stakeholders and parties will hold open dialogue to find a solution to the autonomy's obstacles. Alternatively, it can lead to the conclusion that West Papua is not meeting all the above requirements and therefore is not entitled to the right to secede.</p>

                <p>Although Kosovo has completed all these requirements to exercise their right to secede, it does not mean that the birth of Kosovo is the template to exercise the right to secede. Secession matters of fact are not always governed by legal logic. Factors like geopolitics, national identity, national interests of other states, concern for maintaining regional peace and security often intertwine with each other. It has been predominantly concerted that there is no single explanation and cause of secession, including law. This legal perspective is the common ground which especially for the every separatist splinter in the earth delicate to be digested and accepted, yet it is highly important to understand how the world works.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Amaury A. Reyes-Torres of the <a href="http://www.unibe.edu.do/es">Iberoamerican University (UNIBE)</a> [Spanish] discusses the legal developments of same-sex marriage in Europe...</p>
<strong>Q</strong>uite recently, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) rendered a landmark decision in the protection of rights of same-sex couples under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR): <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-156265">Oliari and Others v. Italy</a>. However, it is nothing more than the logical consequence of <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-99605">Schalk & Kopf v. Austria</a> and <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-145768">Hämäläien v. Finland</a>. In other words, the ECtHR itself and all of us who are following the footsteps of the court on the human rights protections of same-sex couples saw this decision coming.</p>

<p>The question before the court was whether Italy had complied with its positive obligations under the convention when same-sex couples do not have any legal protections in the form of marriage or civil partnerships. Having analyzed the arguments of the applicants and respondents, the court held that, since in Italy same-sex couples lack any legal recognition and protection as couples, it violated the ECHR. </p>

<p>The court began its inquiry by recalling the breadth of <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">Article 8 ECHR</a> [PDF] in relation to same-sex couples and the right to private and family life. The court recalled that same-sex couples in a de facto partnership falls within the limb of the right to a family and private life. Article 8, according to the court, may impose positive obligations on the state to enforce the guarantees of the convention to respect private and family life that favor same sex couples.</p>

<p>The petitioners claimed that Italy had not fulfilled its obligation under the convention by failing to introduce proper legislation to regulate same-sex couples' partnerships. The petitioners also held that even the Italian Constitutional Court affirmed that the State has an obligation to so, a fact that was also noted by the court. The applicants held as well that, <blockquote>the recognition in law of one's family life and status was crucial for the existence and well-being of an individual and for his or her dignity. In the absence of marriage the State should, at least, give access to a recognised (sic) union by means of a solemn juridical institution, based on a public commitment and capable of offering them legal certainty.</blockquote> The government, on the other hand, considered that the convention does not oblige states to assume a legal obligation regarding same-sex couples and the states enjoy a wide margin of appreciation for this topic.</p>

<p>One might be motivated to dismiss the complaints based on the holdings of <span class="casename">Schalk & Kopf v. Austria</span> and <span class="casename">Hämäläien v. Finland</span>, but it is not possible. The court correctly distinguished <span class="casename">Oliari</span> from <span class="casename">Schalk & Kopf</span> and <span class="casename">Hämäläien</span> in several points. The most important difference refers to the fact that this case was not a case about marriage as protected in <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">Article 12 of the ECHR</a> [PDF]. In addition to this, in those cases the court observed that there were existing legal institutions that could provide legal guarantees for same-sex couples on similar grounds as marriage. For the court this was a sufficient guarantee for same-sex couples seeking recognition and legal protection, due to the view that there is no obligation on behalf of the members of the <a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/european-council/index_en.htm">European Council</a> to extend the access to marriage to same-sex couples.</p>

<p>Following this train of thought, and recalling prior judgments such as <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre?i=001-128294">Vallianatos et al v. Greece</a>, the court considered that same-sex couples are just as capable as opposite-sex couples. The court reiterates that it has already held that same-sex couples are just as capable as different-sex couples of entering into stable, committed relationships and that they are in a relevantly similar situation to a different-sex couple as regards their need for legal recognition and protection of their relationship (internal quotations omitted). It follows that the court has already acknowledged that same-sex couples are in need of legal recognition and protection of their relationship.</p>

<p>From this point of view, since same-sex couples are just as capable as opposite-sex couples, both couples are indeed in the same need for legal recognition and protection in order to legitimatize their unions. So under the convention, the state has a positive obligation to make these possible because by affording the appropriate recognition and protection is how same-sex couples' right to private and family life is respected. In the case under examination, the court concluded that the lack of any legal recognition and protection for same-sex couples under Italian domestic law is a violation of Article 8 ECHR.  In the words of the court, <blockquote>In view of the above considerations, the court considers that in the absence of marriage, same-sex couples like the applicants have a particular interest in obtaining the option of entering into a form of civil union or registered partnership, since this would be the most appropriate way in which they could have their relationship legally recognised (sic) and which would guarantee them the relevant protection&#8212;in the form of core rights relevant to a couple in a stable and committed relationship&#8212;without unnecessary hindrance. Further, the court has already held that such civil partnerships have an intrinsic value for persons in the applicants' position, irrespective of the legal effects, however narrow or extensive, that they would produce... </blockquote> This recognition would further bring a sense of legitimacy to same-sex couples.</p>

<p>It is in fact remarkable the emphasis made by the court on the effectiveness that the recognition and protections must entail for the benefit of same-sex couples. The court properly observed how in Italy, in spite of the lack of particular legal guarantees in favor of same-sex couples, there were some contractual arrangements available for the couple, and some domestic courts are doing a case-by-case assessment to grant some rights and legal effects to this unions, which does not tackle the uncertainty of this legal instruments. And the existing system of registry available in some places for same-sex couples is only a symbolic one with no effect of granting the couples any official civil status.</p>

<p>The court found this as insufficient to recognize and protect the unions by same-sex couples. It called the attention of the court the constant need of recurrence to the judicial boy in order to determine the rights and interests of same-sex couples, a situation that is aggravated by how overburdened the Italian judicial system is. All of these aspects do nothing more to contribute to a state of uncertainty that considerably affects same-sex couples, an uncertainty produced also by a legal system that is totally disconnected from a social need that is the interest of entering in a sort of legal institution that would legitimatize and protect same-sex unions. In the view of the court, the existing legislation is limited to particular circumstances and its effect does not tantamount to a full legal recognition and protection to same-sex couples.</p>

<p>In another hand, the holding in <span class="casename">Oliari</span> helps to dissipate the continuous and erroneous interpretations that limited the protection of same-sex unions under the convention. Now, <span class="casename">Schalk & Kopf</span> has been clarified; since in Austria there exists a civil partnership that offers substantial protections to same-sex couples just like marriage does, there is no obligation under the convention to recognize marriage. The same thing happens in <span class="casename">Hämäläien</span>, regardless of the other problems arising from this decision&#8212;especially in relation to <a href="http://www.hrcr.org/safrica/privacy/Christine.html">Christie Goodwin v. United Kingdom</a>&#8212;the reason why the court did not hold a violation to the convention was that in Finland there exists an institution that offers similar legal protections to same-sex unions. By reading these cases together, we may conclude that even if the convention does not grant a general right to marry, it mandates the legal recognition and protection to same-sex unions. This is the central holding of <span class="casename">Oliari</span>.</p>

<p>The case law regarding same-sex couples and their unions is simple: it is up to the states to decide whether or not to extend the access to marriage to same-sex couples. But I am not quite sure about whether the court is aware of the consequences of this judgment in the future. Now, the fact that same-sex couples cannot be deprived of legal recognitions and protections will add another element to the discussion on same-sex couples rights under the convention from an equal protection account.</p>

<p>In my view, <span class="casename">Oliari</span> marks the first inevitable step for the court to reconsider <span class="casename">Schalk & Kopf v. Austria</span>, which &#8212;as I wrote <a href="http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?Article=1822&context=auilr">elsewhere</a>&#8212; was wrongly decided. Since states are now obliged under the convention to offer similar legal protections to same-sex couples as the one enjoyed by opposite-sex couples, the question before us will be if there is really any difference between these types of sex couples. This question might be analyzed under Article 8 and in conjunction with <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">Article 14 ECHR</a> [PDF]. But also, if the respondent State had already adopted <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/discrimination/files/the_prohibition_of_discrimination_under_european_human_rights_law_update_2011__en.pdf">Protocol 12 on the General Prohibition of Discrimination</a>, there might be a more powerful argument for same-sex couples to argue for a right to marry under the Convention.</p>

<p>What we are talking about is whether or not is permissible, under the convention, the existence of a &#8220;separate and equal&#8221; doctrine when it comes to opposite-sex and same-sex unions and the right to marry. The opportunity to tackle that question has been presented in two recent petitions  <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-155550#{"itemid":["001-155550"]}">Hörmann and Moser v. Austria</a> and  <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-155549#{"itemid":["001-155549"]}">Dietz and Suttasom v. Austria</a> currently pending before the court.</p>

<p>Sadly, it is becoming difficult to see where the court will shift on these issues related to same-sex couples. Truth be told, the ECtHR has not been up to the task in the questions of equal marriage, but it is building a path by which it might lead to an inevitable answer to bring same-sex couples to an equal stance with respect to the opposite-sex couples. Maybe, <span class="casename">Schalk & Kopf</span> was a necessary &#8216;evil&#8217; to apprehend where the European consensus is going, how States are reacting and also how we feel about marriage and civil partnerships. <span class="casename">Oliari</span> is now a first step in a long and inevitable path to equal marriage and the court is running out of changes to keep dodging that bullet.</p>

                <p><strong>T</strong>he Ohio Board of Professional Conduct has issued a scorched-earth policy against state judges who decide to stop performing all wedding ceremonies because they believe marriage is defined only as one man and one woman and cannot, in good conscience, conduct a ceremony joining together in marriage any other combination of people, including same-sex couples.</p>

                <p>This is not only quite startling, it is overly harsh. Ohio law allows some judges and a number of other individuals to conduct wedding ceremonies. This is a discretionary, permissive authority the law grants judges. It is not one of their required duties. The law does not require judges to perform every wedding ceremony some couple might ask them to perform and the judges can decide not to perform wedding ceremonies. At least that is what the law says, but you would not know it by reading the <a href="http://www.sc.ohio.gov/Boards/BOC/Advisory_Opinions/2015/Op_15-001.pdf">opinion that the board issued on August 7</a>.</p>

                <p>The opinion states in its first paragraph <blockquote>that [a] judge may not decline to perform all marriages in order to avoid marrying same-sex couples based on his or her personal, moral, or religious beliefs.</blockquote> This emphatic rule eliminates what seems like one of many reasonable, sensible accommodations for judges who hold to the sincere belief that marriage is defined only as one man and one woman. No accommodation possible. Perform all weddings, or else.</p>

                <p>It is bizarre to say that judges show unethical bias if they choose not to do something state law says is merely discretionary and not one of their mandatory or essential duties. The board's opinion buries the fact that, under Ohio law, conducting wedding ceremonies is a permissive power of judges, because to admit that would severely weaken the board's extreme opinion.</p>

                <p>Second, according to the US Supreme Court, government has a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> "duty to accommodate" people with sincere religious beliefs. Other accommodations the government could or must grant to those with sincere beliefs about marriage may exist, but certainly, accommodating a believer's conscience by allowing him or her to stop performing all weddings is eminently reasonable. The board's opinion gives absolutely no accommodation of any kind to a judge who cannot in good conscience perform a totally nonessential act that many other judges, clergy persons and others legally qualified to perform marriage ceremonies would do.</p>

                <p>Third, the board glosses over the fact that we are talking about a judge presiding over a ceremony. It would be bad enough if the opinion required judges to participate in a ceremony they disapproved of. Here, the board goes one step further into unconstitutional coercion by compelling unwilling judges to perform a ceremony they cannot condone because of their beliefs. Ohio law could not require a judge to recite the Pledge of Allegiance against his will. Certainly, Ohio law could not constitutionally require a judge to attend a religious ceremony, or even a secular ceremony, when attendance would violate the judge's beliefs. Yes, judges are governmental officials, but they do not lose all of their rights to freedom of thought and belief.</p>

                <p>Fourth, it seems odd if not outrageous that this opinion suddenly decrees that it is unethical for Ohio judges to decline to do something that was not legally permitted in their state until two months ago. Same-sex couples could not legally marry in Ohio until the US Supreme Court handed down the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/14-556/dissent7.html">Obergefell decision</a> in late June (the decision mandating same-sex marriage nationwide), so judges up until earlier this summer never had to confront this conflict between their permissive authority to conduct wedding ceremonies and their personal belief that marriage is defined only as one man and one woman. But now, according to the board, a judge's decision to decline to conduct any wedding ceremonies at all indicates unlawful bias or prejudice:<br />
                    <br />
                <blockquote>A judge who takes the position that he or she will discontinue performing all marriages, in order to avoid marrying same-sex couples based on his or her personal, moral or religious beliefs, may be interpreted as manifesting an improper bias or prejudice toward a particular class. The judge's decision also may raise reasonable questions about his or her impartiality in legal proceedings where sexual orientation is at issue and consequently would require disqualification under <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/LegalResources/Rules/conduct/judcond0309.pdf">Jud. Cond. R. 2.11.</a></blockquote><br />
                <br />
                Again, it would seem that a reasonable way to accommodate the personal beliefs of the judge would be for him or her to choose to stop performing all weddings. Yet this is not enough for the board because, in its reasoning, the judge would be manifesting bias against same-sex couples that would call into question his or her neutrality in presiding over cases involving those couples. The board then chooses an inflammatory example of domestic battery to make its questionable point: <blockquote>Even if a judge decides not to perform any marriages, but does so only after <span class="casename">Obergefell</span>, the judge may face the prospect of disqualification in matters where the sexual orientation of the parties is at issue. For example, if a judge who has declined to perform same-sex marriages is later assigned to hear a misdemeanor domestic violence charge involving a same-sex couple, the judge's ability to follow the law and impartially apply the domestic violence laws could reasonably be questioned.</blockquote> <br />
                This outrageous example is difficult to understand, although the obvious smear is easy to grasp. If spouse A from a same-sex couple legally married in Ohio hits spouse B, the judge's duty is to preside over a proceeding to determine whether spouse A is guilty of domestic battery and then punish the perpetrator. Hitting other people is wrong and criminal, regardless the aggressor's marital status. I would be very surprised if a judge with the most conservative views on marriage possible would do anything other than give the accused a fair trial, and, if found guilty, impose appropriate punishment on spouse A. It would make no sense for a judge to rule: "spouse A, I am finding you not guilty of the crime of striking your partner because you are in a same-sex marriage."</p>

                <p>Similarly, in other legal cases, like breach of contract or a tort brought by a same-sex couple, it is difficult to imagine a judge ruling that a same-sex couple does not get damages from someone who breaches their contract or smashes into their car, because they are in a same-sex marriage. To assume such a judge has bias, with no evidence other than the fact he or she declined to preside at same-sex wedding ceremonies, unfairly slanders members of the judiciary with reasonable views and convictions about marriage.</p>

                <p>And I doubt the board would apply its expansive rule to other beliefs. A judge may publicly state that his vegan beliefs mean he will never step into a restaurant serving meat or that he will attend football games only where the Cleveland Browns play, or that he will only send his children to a public school. That does not mean the judge could not decide cases involving people who eat steaks, or who root for the Pittsburgh Steelers, or who place their children in private schools. Those people would lack even a legitimate concern about receiving impartial justice from that judge, absent something specific that shows actual bias that will affect how the judge conducts the case.</p>

                <p>The board's opinion has the feel of a decree by a state church trying to root out heretics straying from the new ascendant orthodoxy on marriage. The voters of Ohio and its lawmakers, and even its state judges, should not allow this coercive opinion by the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/Boards/BOC/default.aspx">Board of Professional Conduct</a> to remain.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Mohamed Abdelaal of <a href="http://law.au.alexu.edu.eg/English/Pages/default.aspx">Alexandria University Faculty of Law</a> discusses Egypt's anti-terrorism law...</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>fter the revolution of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/01/201112515334871490.html">2011</a>, which resulted in President Hosni Mubarak being forced to step down, delegating his powers to the armed forces, Egypt witnessed a huge wave of factional protest movements and escalated violence, nearly paralyzing the country's facilities and services. However following the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/world/middleeast/egypt.html?_r=0">removal</a> of President Mohamed Morsi by the Egyptian armed forces on July 3, 2013 amid wide popular demonstrations and protests against his rule and the Muslim Brotherhood's regime, violence in Egypt took a more danger turn after the involvement of pro-Morsi Islamic-ideology driving terrorists.</p>

<p>The security situation in Egypt continued to deteriorate in 2014 and 2015. Islamic militants' <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/world/middleeast/sinai-isis-attack.html?_r=0">attacks</a> were everywhere in Cairo. They detonated bombs in the metro and in Cairo University and assassinated the prosecutor general. Further, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula has undergone a huge Islamic insurgency to the extent that some extremists swore allegiance to the Islamic State declaring the peninsula independent from Egypt and naming it Wilayat <a href="http://timep.org/commentary/battle-egypts-sinai/">Sinai</a> (The State of Sinai.)</p>

<p>To help facing this growing terrorism and insurgency, on August 15, 2015, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah el-Sissi signed into law a new <a href="https://www.icrc.org/ihl-nat/a24d1cf3344e99934125673e00508142/4d39e76935f76f4fc125767e00320698/$FILE/Anti-Terrorism%20Law.PDF">55-article anti-terrorism bill</a> [pdf]. The law was heavily criticized by international human rights organizations and political activists in Egypt that it is no more than a draconian law which widens the government power and restricts individual rights. However the Egyptian administration defended the new law arguing that it is an attempt to combat violence and terrorism and to restore stability in the country.</p>

<p>Here I provide my analysis to some of the most controversial articles in Egypt's new anti-terrorism law.<br />
Firstly, Article 2 of the law defines the act of terrorism to mean "The use of force, violence, threat or intimidation internally or externally for the purpose of disturbing public order or endangering the safety, security and interests of the community." Pursuant to the article an act of terrorism is also any act that "undermines national unity, social peace and national security," aims to "endanger the environment, natural resources, antiquities or public or private property" and "obstructs public authorities, judicial bodies, governmental local units, diplomatic or consular missions, regional or international organizations and places of worship."</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that the article provides for a very sweeping-broad definition regarding what to be consider as an act of terrorism, the article failed to avoid one of the major criticisms that could be directed towards a punitive legislation; that is the criminal act must be unequivocally determined. Specifically <a href="https://www.icrc.org/ihl-nat/a24d1cf3344e99934125673e00508142/4d39e76935f76f4fc125767e00320698/$FILE/Anti-Terrorism%20Law.PDF">Article 2</a> [pdf} could be criticized for using loose standards such as, "public order" and "social security and peace" in determining the terrorism crime without providing any guidance on how to define the borders of these loose standards. Accordingly, individuals could face the risk of being subject to the harsh punishments provided by the law for endangering the "public order" and "social security and peace" without actually knowing what is exactly meant by these terms, which significantly hurts the predictability of law. Further, such situation is likely to render the principle of legality vulnerable to such an extent that offenses would not be clear and ascertainable.</p>

<p>In fact in the context of the Egyptian legislation, using loose and vague standards to determine the content of a given crime is a common-frequently committed mistake. For example, under the now-abolished Egypt's emergency law, the state of emergency could be declared "whenever the general security or the public order of the republic is threatened." Further Egypt's Protest Law of 2013 criminalizes protests that constitute "violations of general security, public order or production, calling for disrupting public interests..."</p>

<p>An equally significant aspect of vagueness and indeterminacy is evident in <a href="https://www.icrc.org/ihl-nat/a24d1cf3344e99934125673e00508142/4d39e76935f76f4fc125767e00320698/$FILE/Anti-Terrorism%20Law.PDF">Article</a> [pdf] 8 which shields law enforcement agents from criminal liability in case they "use force to perform their duty (in implementing provisions of the law) or to protect themselves from imminent danger that is likely to affect persons or properties, as long as this right (the use of force) deemed necessary and proportionate." According to the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/ihl-nat/a24d1cf3344e99934125673e00508142/4d39e76935f76f4fc125767e00320698/$FILE/Anti-Terrorism%20Law.PDF">article</a> [pdf], law enforcement agents, likely police forces and the military, are immune from criminal liability if they use "necessary and proportionate" force to face "imminent danger." The Egyptian judiciary has a long history applying what is known as the "average reasonable person standard." According to this standard the judiciary would evaluate the law enforcement agent's using of force as to how a typical "reasonable" agent would behave under the same or similar circumstances. Although as Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. argued, the urgency of the "average reasonable person standard" has emerged from "the impossibility of nicely measuring a man's powers and limitations," the language of Article 8 elects the Egyptian judiciary to solely determine whether the used force was necessary and proportionate and whether the faced danger was imminent without providing any guidance or limitations. In fact Article 8 is likely to be construed as an absolute immunity for law enforcement agents from criminal liability given the record of the Egyptian judiciary that it has rarely held security forces and military men accountable.</p>

<p>Another controversial provision is Article 29, which sets a sanction of five year aggravated imprisonment for "the establishment of a social media account or a website that promotes ideas and beliefs that call for the commission of terrorist acts, or that broadcasts for information and news that misleads the security forces or obstructs the administration of justice." Similarly Article 35 prescribed a fine up to 200,000 Egyptian pound ($29,000) without exceeding 500,000 Egyptian pound ($71,000) for "the publication, broadcast or promotion of false news or statements regarding terrorist attacks committed within the country or operations associated with fighting terrorism that differ from official statements by the Defense Ministry."</p>

<p>A careful reading to these two articles reveals that practicing press and journalism could be a crime in Egypt and imposes further restrictions of the freedom of expression. Further these two articles could be seen as unconstitutional for being in conflict with <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf">Article 71</a> [pdf] of the <a href="http://www.sis.gov.eg/Newvr/Dustor-en001.pdf">Egyptian Constitution</a> [pdf] of 2014 which prohibits to "censor, confiscate, suspend or shut down Egyptian newspapers and media outlets in any way [and that] no freedom restricting penalty shall be imposed for publication or publicity crimes."</p>

<p>Another provision that could be seen as curtailing individual rights and personal freedoms is Article 40, which authorizes law enforcement agents to arrest suspects "if a serious danger associated with the terrorism crime has arisen and if avoiding such danger necessitates the detention." Indeed this article shifts the law enforcement agents from being responsible for guaranteeing individual freedoms into a mere repressive tool. Precisely since the article does not give any guidance regarding what might be considered "a danger associated with the terrorism crime," the authorities are delegated a huge deal of discretion to determine the nature and the content of this danger, which may render individual rights and freedoms subject to arbitrary acts of public authorities.</p>

<p>Also worth noting is Article 50's approach in assigning one or more circuits of Egypt's criminal courts to preside over terrorism-felonies cases and circuits of Egypt's first instance courts to decide terrorism-misdemeanors cases, provided that these cases are to be expeditiously settled. Indeed the article failed to define the scope of the expedited judicial decision and to mention what guarantees available for the judiciary to render its decision expeditiously. Nevertheless the article did well in avoiding the establishment of special courts to decide terrorism-related cases pursuant to the constitutional command found in <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf">Article 97</a> [pdf] of the Egyptian Constitution of 2014 that "No person may be tried except before the ordinary judge and exceptional courts are prohibited."</p>

<p>In fact a careful examination of the Egyptian punitive legislations discloses the fact that many laws could serve the same purpose the 2015 Anti-terrorism law intends to serve. For instance consider the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/research/Egypt/criminal-code.pdf">Egyptian Penal Code of 1937</a> [pdf] as well as the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/11/26/egypt-deeply-restrictive-new-assembly-law">Egyptian protest law</a> of 2013, which both include some crimes that are similar to those mentioned in the anti-terrorism law such as the possession of weapons and explosives, the dissemination of false news and information and the joining of an armed group. Further Egypt's Penal Code contains a definition of what shall be considered an act of terrorism which to a great extent resembles that definition mentioned in the anti-terrorism law. Egypt's conduct in being so active issuing new laws that govern areas that are likely to be already governed by existing laws could raise major discrepancies in courts regarding which law is applicable and whether a judge should favor a harsher sanction or a lesser one.</p>

<p>Finally in a country such as Egypt, that seeks stability and economic prosperity after the two popular uprisings in January 2011 and June 2013 that toppled two defiant regimes, those who spread terror, riots and chaos certainly need to be deterred. However this should be done the proper way. I am not arguing against the concept that a law must exist to help alleviating the severity of violence and to enable the government to extend its grip for the purpose of providing security and end the unrest state in Egypt. However such law must be subtle to the extent that it can precisely determine the scope and the consequences of the criminal offense in such a way that ensures the rule of law and promotes the predictability of law.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/profiles/martin-craig.html">Craig Martin</a>, an Associate Professor at the <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu">Washburn University School of Law</a>, discusses how the Japan's government's reinterpretation of Japan's constitutional limits on the use of military force will affect the US foreign policies... </p>

<p>On August 30, tens of thousands of Japanese citizens demonstrated outside of the Diet (parliament), and in other cities across Japan, protesting against <a href="http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/gaiyou/jimu/housei_seibi.html">draft national security legislation</a> that would expand the permissible operations of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF). The bills are the culmination of an effort by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to expand Japan's role in international collective security efforts. To do so, however, the government has sought to "reinterpret" Japan's constitutional limits on the use of military force, in a manner that circumvents the formal constitutional amendment process, and thereby undermines the rule of law and constitutionalism in Japan. </p>

<p>It is this process as much as the substance of the bills that has provoked the protests and triggered a constitutional crisis in Japan. Yet these developments have been largely welcomed in US policy circles. The objectives may be in America's short-term interest, but a deeper understanding of the issues and a longer-term perspective would caution against US endorsement of this illegitimate process.</p>

<p><em>Constitutional Background</em></p>

<p>To understand the issues one has to begin with the constitutional limits. Article 9 of the <a href="http://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html">constitution</a> renounces war as a sovereign right of the nation, and the threat or use of force for the settlement of international disputes (Art. 9(1)). It also prohibits the maintenance of armed forces or other war potential (Art. 9(2)). These provisions have been consistently interpreted by the <a href="http://www.clb.go.jp/english/">Cabinet Legislation Bureau</a> (CLB) (which is loosely analogous to the US Office of Legal Counsel) and successive governments since the early 1950s, as meaning that Japan was entitled to use force for individual self-defense in the event of an armed attack on Japan; and that Japan was thus entitled to maintain a minimum level of armed forces necessary for such defense. This understanding was also implicitly confirmed by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.courts.go.jp/app/hanrei_en/detail?id=13">the Sunagawa decision</a>, the only decision it has rendered on the issue. But the CLB has also clearly maintained that Art. 9(1) means that Japan is prohibited from any participation in collective self-defense as authorized by Article 51 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">UN Charter</a>, or other collective security operations as authorized by the UN Security Council under Articles 39 and 42 of the UN Charter. </p>

<p>There were many within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) who have sought to amend Article 9 over the years. But the constitution requires that amendments be initiated by the Diet and approved by a two-thirds vote in each of the two chambers, and then approved by more than a majority of votes cast in a public referendum. This has proved too high a bar for the LDP, due to <a href="http://www.eastwestcenter.org/publications/nine-lives-politics-constitutional-reform-japan">complex political dynamics</a> and broad public support for Article 9, though in comparative terms the amendment formula is about average in difficulty ((see Donald Lutz, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Responding-Imperfection-Practice-Constitutional-Amendment/dp/0691025703/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1440447372&sr=1-1&keywords=levinson+theory+of+constitutional+amendment">Sanford Levinson's Responding to Imperfection</a>: Toward a Theory of Constitutional Amendment).</p>

<p><em>The "Reinterpretation" Project</em></p>

<p>Based in part on the myth that the constitution is too difficult to amend, Prime Minister Abe set out to circumvent the formal amendment process by embarking on a "reinterpretation" project. He established an ad-hoc "panel of experts" to make recommendations on how to "reinterpret" Article 9. This panel, known as the Yanai Committee, had few lawyers and no constitutional scholars among its members. It had no constitutional authority whatsoever to pronounce on the proper interpretation of the constitution. Nonetheless, it submitted a <a href="http://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/anzenhosyou2/dai7/houkoku_en.pdf">final report</a> [PDF] in 2014, arguing in result-oriented fashion that since the strategic situation around Japan had changed, the meaning of Article 9 must be understood to have also changed. </p>

<p>In July 2014, the Cabinet <a href="http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/gaiyou/jimu/pdf/anpohosei_eng.pdf">released a resolution</a> [PDF] that purported to "reinterpret" Article 9 in accordance with the Yanai Committee's recommendations. In particular, it announced that the SDF would be entitled to: (i) use force in response to "an infringement that does not amount to an armed attack;" (ii) provide greater support to the armed forces of the US and other countries involved in armed conflict; and (iii) most controversially, use force in collective self-defense. The use of force in collective self-defense was said to be conditional upon it being: in response to an armed attack on a close ally; in circumstances that constitute a threat to the survival of Japan and "poses a clear danger to fundamentally overturn [the] people's right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness;" and where there is no other alternative. </p>

<p>Before any debate on the issue in the Diet, the Abe government then had the Cabinet Resolution implemented in revisions to the<a href="http://www.mod.go.jp/e/d_act/anpo/"> Guidelines for US-Japan Defense Cooperation</a>, which operationalize the US-Japan Security Treaty. Only after this, with statements that Japan was now committed by this international agreement, did the government introduce the national security legislation that is now under debate in the Diet. </p>

<p><em>Illegitimacy of the "Reinterpretation"</em></p>

<p>These developments pose problems of both process and substance. From a process perspective, this attempt to significantly alter the constitution while deliberately avoiding the formal amendment procedure is profoundly disturbing.  It should be stressed that the draft legislation does not constitute a constitutional amendment proposal, or even take the form of the Cabinet Resolution. The bills are merely revisions to national security laws in a manner consistent with the Cabinet Resolution, but in violation of the established understanding of Article 9, with the intent of obliquely effecting a <em>de facto</em> change in constitutional interpretation. </p>

<p>This process has been accompanied by clumsy political interference in the <a href="http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201308020080">leadership of the CLB</a> in order to ensure support for the "reinterpretation," efforts to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/world/asia/in-japan-bid-to-stifle-media-is-working.html">intimidate and control the media</a> reporting on the process, and <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/02/14/national/lawyer-group-charges-abe-with-constitutional-ignorance/#.Vdt-UdNViko">numerous statements</a> by Abe and his ministers that suggest a shocking contempt for constitutionalism. </p>

<p>As I have <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2014/06/27/commentary/japan-commentary/reinterpreting-article-9-endangers-japans-rule-of-law/#.Vdt-edNViko">suggested elsewhere</a>, and as has been argued by many constitutional scholars in Japan, this project could weaken the constitutional order and undermine the rule of law in Japan. The effort to effect constitutional change outside of the formal amendment procedure cannot be justified by academic theories of "informal amendment," or be understood as a natural evolution in constitutional interpretation, as will be discussed further below. And if Article 9 is successfully "reinterpreted" to now permit precisely what it once prohibited, then other provisions&#8212;the various rights of the people, other limits on the executive, the status of the Emperor&#8212;all are within easy reach of similar "reinterpretation." Short of that, these efforts have already caused harm to Japan's democratic institutions&#8212;the integrity of the CLB, for one, has been seriously undermined by these events.</p>

<p>From a substantive perspective, the Cabinet "reinterpretation" and subsequent legislation are clearly inconsistent with the constitution&#8212;not only with the established interpretation of Article 9, but also with any reasonable interpretation of the provision as informed by established principles of constitutional interpretation. Article 9 cannot be understood, when read in the context of the history of its drafting, ratification and subsequent interpretation and operation, to mean that Japan is permitted to engage in collective self-defense (my detailed analysis of Article 9 can be found<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1296667"> here</a>). </p>

<p>Similarly, increased Japanese logistical and other rear area operations in support of the armed forces of other countries engaged in hostilities could become integral to the actions of the belligerents, thereby constituting a use of force in violation of Article 9. The Nagoya High Court came to that conclusion in a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1767658">controversial judgment</a> in 2008, and this is consistent with principles articulated in the UN General Assembly resolution on the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/3314(XXIX)">definition of aggression</a>. </p>

<p>Moreover, the purported changes that would permit the SDF to use force in response to "infringements that do not amount to an armed attack," are inconsistent with international law. In the <em>jus ad bellum</em> regime of the UN system, the use of force in either individual or collective self-defense is only permissible in response to an actual or imminent armed attack. Yet this sly move by the Abe Cabinet would appear to create authority for the use of force in response to lower levels of provocation. This move is consistent with earlier efforts of the LDP, in its formal constitutional amendment <a href="https://www.jimin.jp/policy/pamphlet/pdf/kenpou_qa.pdf">proposals</a> [PDF] of 2012, to <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2012/06/06/opinion/ldps-dangerous-proposals-for-amending-antiwar-article/#.Vd4NtNNViko">sever the relationship</a> between Article 9 and the <em>jus ad bellum</em> regime of international law. </p>

<p><em>Responding to Likely Objections</em></p>

<p>Many in American policy circles may find these substantive objections absurd, arguing that the constraints imposed by Article 9 are anachronistic and increasingly counterproductive to the regional security interests of Japan and the US. But this is to miss the point. Perhaps there should be a debate in Japan over whether to loosen the constraints of Article 9. But the crucial point here is that if this is to be done, it should be done through formal constitutional amendment, not an illegitimate exercise of Cabinet "reinterpretation" that could serve to weaken the rule of law and fundamental principles of democracy in Japan.</p>

<p>Some may object that constitutions generally evolve over time, with changes occurring through mechanisms other than formal amendment&#8212;and thus these allegations of illegitimacy are exaggerated. The understanding of any given constitution does indeed evolve, but such development is typically gradual, incremental, constrained by certain principles of interpretation and effected by the institutions that have the constitutional authority to engage in such interpretation. In Japan that is explicitly the judiciary. Through long established convention, the CLB has also emerged as having a legitimate role in such interpretation. The executive, in the form of the Cabinet, has the least claim to any role in such process of incremental interpretation. And as just discussed, the "reinterpretation" here is neither incremental, nor reasonable.  </p>

<p>Nor can this process be given a pass by reference to theories of "informal amendment" that have been advanced (and are anyway deeply contested) in American constitutional law scholarship. It has never been suggested that such theories could provide <em>ex ante</em> legitimization of deliberate government efforts to circumvent the formal amendment procedures. Moreover, all such theories rely on some measure of popular approval. In Japan we have the executive engaging in an effort that is quite self-conscious in its intent to make a radical and deeply unpopular change to a constitutional provision in disregard of the amendment procedure&#8212;a provision that is quite specifically designed to constrain the executive's actions. </p>

<p><em>Constitutional Crisis</em></p>

<p>It is no exaggeration to say that Japan is in the midst of a constitutional crisis. In June three very prominent constitutional scholars, one of them representing the LDP, testified before a constitutional commission in the Diet. Questions turned to the topic of the national security legislation that was being debated in the Lower House down the hall. All three scholars quite <a href="http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201506050040">emphatically responded</a> that the draft laws were unconstitutional. </p>

<p>Since then over two hundred constitutional scholars and several hundred more legal academics have <a href="http://anti-security-related-bill.jp/signature_en.html">publicly repudiated</a> the bills. Three former directors of the CLB have come forth to <a href="http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201506220041">publicly chastise their protégés</a> in the CLB and assert the unconstitutionality of the bills. Five former prime ministers have <a href="http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201508120068">come out against</a> the legislation. There have been protests involving tens of thousands of people, young and old, in cities across Japan. The government's approval ratings have dropped from the high 60s to <a href="http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201507200028">less than 40 percent</a> in less than two months as a result of these developments.</p>

<p>The bills were passed in the Lower House earlier this summer, and are before the Upper House for debate and passage in the next month. While the LDP and its junior coalition partner, the <em>Komeito</em>, have the numbers to ensure passage, there is increasing speculation that the <em>Komeito</em> could bolt and that the bills would not pass. That would require the government to override the Upper House with a two-thirds vote in the Lower House&#8212;a prospect that would further weaken Abe's government and undermine the legitimacy of the legislation. </p>

<p>If passed the laws are certain to be challenged in court. But most scholars are pessimistic about the prospects of the courts striking down such legislation. The standing doctrine would make claims difficult to mount, and in any event the supreme court is <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1406169">notoriously deferential</a> and weak on such issues. Yet in the wake of virtually unanimous scholarly objection to the draft laws, a perceived failure by the courts to enforce Article 9 could further undermine the credibility and legitimacy of the judiciary&#8212;creating yet another collateral victim of this "reinterpretation" process.</p>

<p>This process, inimical to the rule of law and constitutionalism, is not consistent with the values that the US espouses to the world, and it cannot be in the long term interests of US foreign policy. Increased Japanese involvement in international collective security may be a desired goal, but American policy makers should reconsider endorsing this means of getting there. </p>

		<title>Decoding the Politics Underlying the Resolution on Protection of the Family</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://arc-international.net/about/about-arvind-narrain-geneva-director/">Arvind Narrain</a> of <a href="http://arc-international.net/about/">ARC</a> discusses the intricacies of the definition of  family in the international human rights arena and what this means for LGBTI people, women and children...</p><strong>A</strong> significant development in the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session29/Pages/29RegularSession.aspx">29th Session of the Human Rights Council</a> was the passing of a deeply controversial resolution to 'protect the family'. The Resolution was sponsored by a cross-regional group of states including Egypt, Cote d'Ivoire, El Salvador, Mauritania, Morocco, Russian Federation, Tunisia, Uganda, Qatar, Belarus, China and Bangladesh. The 'controversy' at the center of the resolution concerned the intent of the resolution itself. Was it to protect the family, or was it to use the language of protecting the family to actually target those who were vulnerable to abuse within families including children, women and LGBTI persons?</p>

                <p>The problems with the resolution, as articulated by both states opposing the resolution as well as civil society invested in working on rights of women, children and LGBTI people, were that:</p>

                <p><strong>(1)</strong> The resolution was titled protection of the family, while in reality in regions around the world, there were a diversity of family forms.<br />
                    <strong>(2) </strong>The mandate of international human rights law is to protect individuals and not institutions. Rights holders had to be individuals, hence it was misplaced to attempt to protect the family.</li><br />
                    <strong>(3)</strong> The resolution also refused to acknowledge that at points there may be a conflict between individual rights and tradition.</p>

                <p>What gives a clue as to the motivations of the sponsors was the response of the core group to the South African amendment to the resolution proposing that the resolution recognize a diversity of families. In response, the core states moved a no action motion, preventing debate on the amendment. The fact that the core group wanted to even prevent debate on this issue indicates that this perhaps was the crux of what an otherwise wordy and confusing resolution was trying to protect.</p>

                <p>It is possible to surmise that the resolution at its heart was premised on the targeting of the rights of LGBTI persons and the use of the language of, 'protection of the family' was only a means to an end. This emerged most critically in Egypt's statement introducing the resolution. As Egypt noted,<br />
                <blockquote>Speaking about absolute and unspecified diversity can be an invitation to cast protection on family settings where human rights may not flourish to be respected.  Family is family everywhere as a unit that bonds men, women and children together...[family] should remain reflective of similar essence and shared values.</blockquote></p>

                <p>The crucial intent of the resolution was to circumscribe diversity within the notion that a family was a bond between men, women and children. This core intent was manifested in another amendment moved by Pakistan which called for a recognition that "men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the rights to marry and to found a family, bearing in mind that <em>marriage is a union between a man and a woman</em>"  (emphasis provided).</p>

                <p>One approach to unpacking the meaning of the resolution is by understanding the family as an institution marked by  relationships of power, where the more powerful exercise domination over the less powerful; i.e. heterosexual men over women, children and LGBTI persons. Therefore protecting the family is to really protect the interests of the more powerful family members against the less powerful ones.</p>

                <p>Though the resolution does state the principle of equality between men and women, the very fact that the resolution is premised on the protection of the family sets up a tension. The tension is between the major premise of the resolution, which is the protection of the family, and the minor premise, which is gender equality. It is up to activism in the coming days to ensure that in future resolutions, the major premise of family protection does not expand at the expense of the minor premise. Thinking optimistically, one should consider whether it is possible to invert the order such that gender equality becomes the major premise and family protection the minor premise?</p>

                <p>One could ask the question &#8212; as to whether on the terms set by the core group itself &#8212; is the core group really committed to the protection of the family? It is telling that even a wordy protection of the family resolution is extraordinarily silent on the protection of civil and political rights and its implication for the protection of the family.</p>

                <p>One of the factors, which has rendered families deeply vulnerable to disintegration, is the practice of <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/disappearancesday/background.shtml">enforced disappearance</a>. The question of how the practice of enforced disappearances is a threat to the family is best captured in a report popularly known as, <a href="http://www.desaparecidos.org/nuncamas/web/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_001.htm">Nunca Más</a>, on the disappearances perpetrated by the Argentinian military from 1978 to 1983. In this time period, thousands of Argentinians were disappeared by the military junta. As <a href="http://www.desaparecidos.org/nuncamas/web/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_226.htm">Nunca Mas</a> observed:<br />
                <blockquote>It is a feature of the disappearance syndrome that the stability and structure of the family of the person who disappears is profoundly affected&#8230;.Behind each disappearance, there is often a family that is destroyed or dismembered, and always a family that is assaulted in what is most intimate: its right to privacy, to the security of its members, and to respect for the profoundly affectionate relations that are the reason for its existence.</blockquote></p>

                <p>The question of enforced disappearances as a fundamental attack on the family is also squarely <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14123&LangID=E">referenced</a> by the Human Rights Council in the context of the enforced disappearances by both state and non-state actors in Syria.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_other/arabic/commission-of-inquiry-report7-arabic.pdf">Report</a>[Arabic and English] on Syria identifies the crux of the violation caused by disappearances,<br />
                <blockquote>The heart of the anguish suffered by families lies in the authorities systematic refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or to disclose any information about the relatives. Across Syria, parents, siblings, husbands, wives, children and friends wait anxiously to know the fate or whereabouts of their loved ones&#8230; This mental anguish may rise to the level of torture or inhuman treatment and makes entire families the victims of enforced disappearances.</blockquote></p>

                <p>It is this comprehensive understanding of how destructive the practice of enforced disappearances is to the security of the family unit, which is entirely absent in the family resolution. None of the core sponsors, be it Russia, China, Egypt, Belarus or Qatar have ratified the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CED/Pages/ConventionCED.aspx">Convention on Enforced Disappearances</a>. On the contrary, as a matter of state practice, there is ample documentation of the enforced disappearance of political opponents of the regime by Belarus, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/07/crimea-enforced-disappearances">activists in Crimea</a> and in <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/08/10/russia-find-activist-missing-chechnya">Chechnya by Russia</a> and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/06/egypt-human-rights-groups-decry-forced-disappearances-150617091242563.html">perceived political opponents by Egypt</a>.</p>

                <p>Thus one needs to place the family resolution within a wider political context. One thing common among the key sponsors is that they practice repression at home even when they take on the task of defending the family both at home and internationally. Clearly, repressive states suffer from a crisis of legitimacy. When a state has to take up arms against its own people, its own capacity to represent the diversity and plurality of the nation is severely called into question. This crisis of legitimacy often leads to states trying to refurbish their reputations by becoming defenders of notions such as family, culture and tradition.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, the championship of these notions is not neutral and results in the scapegoating of minorities, be it religious or sexual. To take the case of Egypt, this crisis of legitimacy of the new military government headed by General Sisi had led to an intensified campaign against LGBT people. As <a href="https://www.fidh.org/International-Federation-for-Human-Rights">FIDH</a> in its <a href="https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/egypt_report.pdf">report</a> [PDF] notes that, "since October 2011, campaigns targeting LGBT persons have become more frequent." Sensationalist coverage "depicts homosexuality as a crime, gives common currency to the idea that since the revolution LGBT persons have increased in number and are part of a foreign plot threatening Egyptian society." The targeting of LGBT people is nothing else but "the regime's strategy to demonstrate its moral conservatism in an attempt to gain the support of Islamist fringes of the population whose support brought the Muslim Brotherhood to power."</p>

                <p>Added to the brutal targeting of minorities within the country goes an attempt to refurbish one's credentials at the international level. It is in the context of this unprecedented mass repression back in Egypt that the reasons for the Egyptian government&#8217;s leadership of the resolution to protect the family need to be understood.</p>

                <p>Thus it is possible to conclude that the core states are not serious in wanting to protect the family and that if one pushes the logic of protection of the family in certain directions, the lack of seriousness is bound to show. If such is indeed the understanding, then one needs ask: can a resolution to protect the family be proposed, which is uncompromising on the questions of gender equality, child rights and rights of LGBTI persons? Can such a resolution at the same time enlarge an understanding of how repressive state practices from enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrest and detention, and arbitrary imposition of the death penalty are all practices which threaten the family at its root? Can the dichotomy between protecting the family and protecting the individual be shown to be false?</p>

                <p><strong>I</strong>n short: is an inclusive, rights-oriented resolution of the family possible?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Harrison Thorne of <a href="http://www.law.ucla.edu">UCLA School of Law</a> discusses the possible implications that a recent decision from the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit might bear on internships ... </j:header><br />
<strong>E</strong>mployees are entitled to many benefits, including minimum wage, overtime wage, social security tax contributions, insurance (disability, unemployment), Family and Medical Leave and workers' compensation. Interns generally do not receive benefits, nor are they paid. Accordingly, some businesses have relied on interns as a source of free labor. The businesses exploiting interns typically claim that they are providing the interns with intangible benefits such as access to high-level professionals, practical experience and resume value. The interns respond that they are performing tasks for which they should receive compensation. Interns have generally lost this battle.</p>

<p>All that could change, based on the decision of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/13-4478/13-4478-2015-07-02.html">Glatt v. Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc.</a>, also known as the "intern case." The plaintiffs were college graduates working as interns for Fox Searchlight. Several worked well over 40 hours per week, and all of them performed tasks typically associated with entry-level paid positions. They argued that they were "employees" under the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf">Fair Labor and Standards Act</a> [PDF] (the "FLSA"), and must be compensated for the work they performed. </p>

<p>The FLSA itself was of little assistance in the case, as it defines employees as, "individual[s] employed by an employer," and "employ" as "to suffer or permit to work." <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/203">29 U.S.C. § 203</a>. Rather, the plaintiffs relied on the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.pdf">Department of Labor's six-factor test</a> to determine whether a worker is an intern or employee. Applying the DOL's six-factor test, the US Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, finding that they had been improperly classified as unpaid interns rather than employees. Fox Searchlight appealed, and the Second Circuit granted its petition for leave to file an interlocutory appeal from the district court's order. </p>

<p>The court noted that the DOL's six-factor test is outdated and based on apprenticeship programs that are not relevant to the issue at hand. "The purpose of a bona-fide internship is to integrate classroom learning with practical skill development in a real-world setting," the court held. Accordingly, the court displaced the DOL's six-factor test with its own factor-based, non-exhaustive test. Courts should consider the following:</p>

<blockquote><strong>(1)</strong> The extent to which the intern and the employer clearly understand that there is no expectation of compensation. Any promise of compensation, express or implied, suggests that the intern is an employee&#8212;and vice versa. <strong>(2) </strong>The extent to which the internship provides training that would be similar to that which would be given in an educational environment, including the clinical and other hands-on training provided by educational institutions. <strong>(3)</strong> The extent to which the internship is tied to the intern's formal education program by integrated coursework or the receipt of academic credit. <strong>(4)</strong> The extent to which the internship accommodates the intern's academic commitments by corresponding to the academic calendar. <strong>(5)</strong> The extent to which the internship's duration is limited to the period in which the internship provides the intern with beneficial learning. <strong>(6)</strong> The extent to which the intern's work complements, rather than displaces, the work of paid employees while providing significant educational benefits to the intern. <strong>(7)</strong> The extent to which the intern and the employer understand that the internship is conducted without entitlement to a paid job at the conclusion of the internship.</blockquote>

<p>The court noted that no one factor is dispositive and that courts may consider relevant evidence beyond the specified factors in appropriate cases. Because the district court only considered the DOL's six-factor, outdated test, the court vacated the district court's decision in favor of the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and remanded for further proceedings. </p>

<p>The court's new factor-based test has serious implications for employers. Conducting business as usual and hiring an unpaid intern to perform various tasks is no longer an option. Companies must now carefully review the court's seven-factor test. For instance, companies must diligently insure that tasks delegated to interns are educational in nature and not exploitative at all. Moreover, companies must understand that complying with the seven factors might not be enough, as the court noted that the list is non-exhaustive.</p>

<p>Overall, the court's attempt to help unpaid interns avoid exploitation while working for free might come to hurt interns. Employers attempting to comply with the seven-factor, non-exhaustive test may find themselves going out of the way to create tasks for interns to complete. Moreover, they might fear liability. Thus, employers may shut down their internship programs and avoid all potential legal complications.</p>

<p>Before attending law school, I worked as an unpaid intern in the entertainment industry. My job began just as the district court ruled for the plaintiffs' in the <span class="casename">Fox Searchlight</span> case were employees misclassified as interns. Accordingly, the company bent over backwards to ensure the interns were not given any work that may be construed as "<a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/13-4478/13-4478-2015-07-02.html">displacing the work of paid employees</a>." </p>

<p>My supervisor would spend hours attempting to create projects for the interns, all of which were unnecessary to the company and made up solely for our benefit. The result was that the interns did not feel like part of the team, and the regular employees did not view us as valuable.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/profiles/rich-william.html">William J. Rich</a>, of Washburn University School of Law, discusses the conflict between branches of the Kansas government that has been intensified in the case of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11484914675879136445">Solomon v. Kansas</a>...</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>n 2014, the Kansas legislature altered the way in which chief administrative judges are chosen, transferring selection authority from the Kansas Supreme Court to the judges of each of the thirty-one judicial districts. Larry Solomon, Chief Judge of the 30th Judicial District in Kansas, challenged the statute on grounds that it conflicts with a provision of the Kansas Constitution giving the Supreme Court "general administrative authority over all courts in this state." On September 2, 2015, Kansas District Court Judge Larry Hendricks ruled that the statute violated the state's constitution. In a deeply rooted conflict between branches of the Kansas government, the judicial branch won that skirmish, but now faces a threat to all judicial funding as a result.</p>

<p>Judge Hendricks had little difficulty resolving the limited legal issue he faced in the case of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11484914675879136445">Solomon v. Kansas</a>. The primary question boiled down to whether removal of the Supreme Court from its role appointing the chief judges responsible for administering the district courts significantly interfered with administration of the judiciary. The state's lawyers had little to offer in defense. They argued that some states had opted for peer selection of chief judges, but they could not identify any states that opted for such a system in the face of contrary rules promulgated by the state's highest court. They noted that in the state's two largest districts, judges had already worked out a cooperative arrangement with the state Supreme Court for peer selection of their chief judges, but that argument appeared better designed to demonstrate that the current system worked rather than providing support for change. The judge reached a predictable and superficially unremarkable conclusion that<a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/"> the state legislature</a> significantly interfered with <a href="http://www.kscourts.org/kansas-courts/supreme-court/default.asp">Kansas Supreme Court</a> authority to administer the judicial branch.  </p>

<p>The decision by Hendricks, however, triggered a more fundamental dispute. When the legislature initially mandated the change in selection of chief judges, they did so within the context of an appropriations bill for the judicial branch that included a non-severability clause voiding the entire act if courts invalidated any of its provisions. When that appropriations bill expired, the legislature tied future judicial appropriations to the outcome of the pending litigation with a new severability clause that again terminates all funding for the judicial branch if Judge Solomon ultimately prevails in his case against the state. </p>

<p>On September 4, 2015, four district court judges in Kansas, including Judge Solomon, sued the state to challenge that legislation. The new constitutional question before the Kansas courts asks whether a state may condition judicial appropriations on the outcome of pending litigation. Arguably, states may condition appropriations in a manner that presumes the validity of related state laws, and the original non-severability clause enacted by the Kansas legislature in 2014 may have fallen within that relatively innocuous category. The decision by the legislature to subsequently condition funding in what appears to be a direct response to pending litigation, however, crosses a different line. The plaintiff judges challenging the 2015 enactment argue that such a law violates separation of powers doctrine by interfering "with the judicial branch's exclusive constitutional authority ... to hear and decide cases on the merits without fear or favor." They also argue that elimination of funds for the judicial branch breaches a separate state constitutional obligation to maintain compensation for judges, and that due process rights of litigants are violated by a clause tempting a court to reject a challenge for fear of otherwise losing its funding. Furthermore, although beyond the scope of the plaintiffs' immediate litigation, enforcement of a law defunding the judiciary would eventually leave all litigants without access to due process.</p>

<p>In the face of such constitutional challenges, observers may question the aims of legislators who seem intent on waging this war. Without answering that question, lawyers for the state sought an emergency stay pending appeal from the ruling by Hendricks, and supported their motion with an admission that "loss of funding would cause irreparable injury to both parties and the public at large," and that "key legislators have indicated that such a drastic outcome was not the Legislature's intent." The same lawyers, however, had filed a "Supplemental Statement of Facts" shortly after the legislature acted in 2015 emphasizing the threat to judicial appropriations that would follow from an adverse ruling, implying that such consequences should be considered prior to ruling against the state.</p>

<p>In <u>Solomon</u>, the plaintiff and the trial judge voiced questions about legislative intent. No legitimate reasons were offered to explain why judicial funding should be tied to the power to appoint chief district court judges. Recognizing the "troubling set of circumstances" crated by the defunding threat, Judge Hendricks noted "legitimate questions" regarding "any presumption the court might otherwise give to the legislative motive at work." He also noted the plaintiff's more pointed characterization of the defunding provision as a "naked act of intimidation" that would threaten "the public's confidence in a fair and impartial judiciary."</p>

<p>The argument that the legislature wanted to threaten the judiciary to gain leverage in litigation gains credibility from a variety of other Kansas legislative proposals that have circulated within the statehouse. The same legislators who challenged the state's supreme court authority to appoint chief judges also debated plans for changing the process of selecting judges, limiting their tenure in office and limiting the state supreme court's jurisdiction. Their alternative "court-packing" plans would have made Franklin Roosevelt blush.</p>

<p>Recognizing threats against the judiciary still does not answer the question about why so much animosity exists between Kansas politicians and judges. The answer to that question appears to be tied to another issue pending before the Kansas Supreme Court. For more than a decade, legislators and judges have locked horns over questions about funding education. In spite of repeated rejections from the district court and the Kansas Supreme Court, lawyers for the state remain intent on arguing that judges have no authority to interpret the "suitable education" provision of the state's constitution in a manner that requires increased and more equitable funding for public schools.</p>

<p>Education funding issues have devolved into questions about the exercise of judicial power. No leap of imagination is needed to see the connection between this school finance issue and the lawsuit over judicial administration. Lawyers for the state argued in <u>Solomon</u> that allowing courts to prevail when they disagree with the legislature about how to select chief administrative judges "would give the Kansas Supreme Court a veto over an entire category of legislation." Outside of Kansas, such an argument may seem bizarre. Within the US, the "rule of law" includes a commitment to the principle that courts may make final rulings regarding constitutional interpretation. In Kansas, however, that commitment to judicial supremacy may not be so secure.</p>

<p>In any case involving arguments that a legislature overstepped its constitutional authority, legitimate questions arise regarding the extent to which judges should defer to legislative judgments. That question applies to issues of school finance or judicial administration. Although other states have provided a range of answers to that question specifically within the context of deciding what the judicial role should be when asked whether obligations to fund schools have been met, no other state has seriously questioned the underlying authority of the judicial branch to resolve such disputes. In Kansas, however, the legislature appears prepared to retaliate against the judges who determine legislative action violates the state constitution.</p>

<p>Judge Hendricks concluded his opinion in the <u>Solomon</u> case with what may best be described as a plea for cooperation between the branches of the Kansas government. As he noted, our "usual parlance ... refers to the legislative, executive and judicial departments of government as 'branches.' Each is largely independent in executing its constitutionally mandated duties. But what is all too frequently lost in the metaphor, without going too far out on a limb, is that the branches must, ultimately, remain connected with one another on some level in order to survive and thrive." The question in Kansas is whether anyone will hear that plea.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Devin Cohen from St. John's University School of Law Class of 2016, is the first author in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development. Cohen discusses the problems surrounding Veterans suffering PTSD and their right to receive military benefits...</j:header><strong>I</strong>ndividuals who enlist in the US Army are fully aware that they are risking their lives for their nation. While they are voluntarily subjecting themselves to being in the crosshairs of fire, they are not waiving their rights as American citizens. One in every five soldiers suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however the military has failed to properly care for those who suffer from the disease. </p>

<p><a href="thenationshealth.aphapublications.org/content/42/3/1.1.full">Individuals</a> with PTSD constantly battle sleeplessness, anger, anxiety and a sense of isolation, making it extremely difficult to live what would be considered a normal life. Soldiers encounter countless traumatic incidents while in the line of duty, and hence many develop PTSD. The US Department of Veterans Affairs reports that 11 to 12 percent of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan war and about 30 percent of Vietnam veterans suffer from the disease. The correlation between PTSD and military tenure is indisputable and yet the military has failed to follow the laws that oblige them to properly care for the veterans who have been inflicted with the disease.<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/1201"> 10 U.S.C. § 1201</a> requires the Army to retire and provide certain benefits to individuals who suffer from PTSD; the permanent nature and stability of PTSD qualifies the condition under § 1201, thus requiring benefits. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held "if an individual meets section 1201's requirements, payment of benefits is mandatory, not discretionary." </p>

<p>Soldiers who incur physical or mental disabilities in the line of duty are subject to an official evaluation process by military authorities. If the evaluation board issues a disability <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/4.130">rating</a> of at least 30 percent, the member will be medically retired. The soldier will then receive 30 percent (or more) of his base pay and other important benefits, including free health care at a military hospital. However, if the soldier's disability is rated at <a href="www.dfas.mil/retiredmilitary/disability/disability.html">less than 30 percent</a>, the physical examination board will recommend that he is separated from active duty. He will likely be awarded severance pay based on his time in the service and his current pay grade, but he will not receive free health care.  </p>

<p>Beginning in 2001, there was a pervasive fear that many soldiers had their PTSD diagnoses reversed because of the high costs of treating the disease. Finally, in 2012 the Army responded by launching a review of its handling of PTSD and other behavioral evaluations. The <a href="www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/army-probing-ptsd-diagnoses/2012/05/16/gIQA1G3MUU_story.html">review</a> found that the original PTSD diagnoses for at least 290 soldiers were reversed after a presentation by Dr. William Keppler to staff members at the Lewis-McChord Army Medical Center in 2012. As the head of the psychiatry team, Dr. Keppler emphasized that every diagnosis of PTSD costs the military $1.5 million per veteran in health benefits and pension payments. The soldiers were subsequently diagnosed with personality disorders; such a diagnosis leads to an "Other Designated Physical and Mental Conditions Discharge" which precludes the military from having to pay for their medical treatment. </p>

<p>Veteran William B. Cowles' tenure in the Army started when he served in the National Guard in 1974. On May 3, 2003, he was deployed to Kuwait and then to Iraq where he saw the remains of soldiers from the unit serving next to him; he also witnessed a soldier beat a Pakistani civilian to death with a rifle. Cowles' emotional stress led to immense physical pain that ultimately caused him to lose consciousness. After reporting to a military psychologist who was unreceptive to his complaints, Cowles was separated from the Army with an adjustment-disorder. This is a condition where an individual is unable to adjust to his surroundings and did not qualify him for retirement pay and medical benefits under § 1201. As he continued to experience severe psychological symptoms, Cowles went to a Veteran Affairs Medical Center where he was finally diagnosed with "combat-related PTSD, now chronic." Had Cowles been discharged correctly and initially on the basis of PTSD, he would have been medically retired and would have received appropriate medical attention. </p>

<p>Cowles went to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to challenge his discharge status and demanded that the Army issue him a correct designation based on the fact that he suffers from PTSD, which he incurred while serving on duty; his request was rejected. Cowles' incident is not unique, he is one of <a href="www.law.yale.edu/academics/18096.htm">thousands</a> of veterans who have been given an incorrect diagnosis and then have been refused correction upon appeal. Last year a class action lawsuit was filed in federal court "seeking relief for tens of thousands of Vietnam veterans who developed PTSD during their military service and received an other than honorable discharge." 		</p>

<p>The veterans allege that the correction/discharge upgrade boards have been ineffective due to their impenetrable and unlawful evidentiary standards. The boards refuse to consider critical medical evidence of an incorrect diagnosis at the time of discharge. Without such evidence it is impossible for the veterans to prevail, thus violating their rights under § 1201.</p>

<p>One improvement that would enable Veterans with PTSD to obtain proper benefits would be to compel the Review and Correction Boards to consider post-discharge evidence. In September 2014, then Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel issued a <a href="www.defense.gov/news/osd009883-14.pdf">memorandum</a> [PDF] for the secretaries of the military departments stating that review boards will fully and carefully consider every petition based on PTSD brought by each veteran, effective immediately. The memo's main purpose called for the boards to consider a wider array of evidence. While Hagel's memo provided several notable policy considerations, it lacked the ability to guarantee that boards will follow it because it lacked legal enforceability. Congress should pass a statute or the Department of Defense should adopt a new regulation mandating the consideration of more evidence including post-discharge evidence by review boards. These reforms would abide by the existing obligation under 10 U.S.C. § 1201 to provide proper benefits to veterans with PTSD. </p>

<p>The US Army's wrongful stigmatization and denial of benefits to William Cowles and thousands like him is simply the latest example of the military's unethical and illegal treatment of veterans. Only legislation can adequately remedy the injustices that have become so deeply entrenched in the military system. While defending their country, these veterans have developed chronic disabilities; failure to compensate them is not only morally wrong, but illegal.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://webapp4.asu.edu/directory/person/1436144">James G. Hodge, Jr.</a> of Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at Arizona State University discusses the significance of the outcome of <span class="casename">Wollschlaeger II</span> and its impact on the public's health... </p><strong>W</strong>ithout question significant access to guns and ammunition implicates major public health risks. There were <a href="http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate10_us.html">33,636 gun-related deaths</a> and tens of thousands more injuries in the US in 2013, far more than in other industrialized countries whose citizens lack similar ease of access to guns. Even though the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> of the US Constitution firmly protects the rights of Americans to own and use guns, all is not lost from the public health perspective. Firearm deaths and injuries can be prevented through efficacious gun safety and control laws and practical interventions (<em>e.g.</em>, locking guns while not in use, keeping guns unloaded and separating ammunition). These and other measures can lower gun-related tragedies, especially among minors. Of course, not everyone is aware or convinced of the need for these common sense interventions. </p>

<p>For years, the <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/legal-topics/litigation-center/case-summaries-topic/physician-patient-communications.page">American Medical Association</a> and other medical and public health associations have strongly counseled doctors and other health care workers (HCWs) to engage patients about the risk of gun-related injuries and safety measures. However, in <a href="http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201214009.reh.pdf">Wollschlaeger v. Governor of Florida</a> [PDF] (<span class="casename">Wollschlaeger II</span>), decided on July 28, 2015, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld (for the second time) a Florida law that restricts HCWs in their ability to talk to their patients truthfully about how to reduce gun-related risks of death and injury. In doing so, the court rejects doctors' <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> rights to speak to patients about firearms in favor of the need to protect patients' privacy rights. Absent further appeal, <u>Wollschlaeger II</u> <a href="http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/4b5678e4639e4a05bfdcd51fc95ccd5a/FL--Docs-vs-Glocks">estops</a> Florida HCWs from dispensing meaningful information on gun safety to many patients. </p>

<p><strong>The Firearm Owners Privacy Act</strong></p>

<p>In 2011 Florida passed the <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=44993">Firearm Owners Privacy Act</a> (FOPA) to prevent HCWs from raising, recording and discussing politically-sensitive, gun-related safety and health risks with patients. FOPA was passed after legislators became aware of several anecdotal accounts of (1) doctors discriminating against patients during medical visits for failing to answer gun-related questions or (2) patients who just did not want to listen to doctors' guidance on gun safety. FOPA includes four primary sections:</p>

<p><strong>1. Inquiry</strong>: HCWs "should refrain" from asking about whether patients (or their families) own firearms absent a good faith belief that such information is "relevant" to the patient's or others' health or safety;</p>

<p><strong>2. Record-keeping</strong>: HCWs and facilities may not "intentionally enter" data about a patient's firearm ownership into their medical records if they know the data are "not relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others;"</p>

<p><strong>3. Discrimination</strong>: HCWs "may not discriminate" against a patient on the basis of firearm ownership; and</p>

<p><strong>4. Harassment</strong>: HCWs must avoid "unnecessarily [harassing]" a patient about gun ownership.</p>

<p>Violations can lead to disciplinary actions against HCWs including fines, practice restrictions, return of medical fees, probation and license suspension or revocation.         </p>

<p>Within days of FOPA's enactment, a group of Florida doctors (and others) filed suit in federal district court challenging its provisions on multiple, constitutional grounds. The court enjoined its enforcement initially on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12196752562458332965">September 14, 2011</a>, and again on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17955665324082762168">June 29, 2012</a>, when it ruled that the Act offended free speech and due process principles under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The state appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta which overturned the lower court on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2529847211888045190">July 25, 2014</a>. The court largely dispensed with any significant freedom of speech analyses, finding instead that FOPA regulated medical professionals' conduct (<em>i.e.</em>, with only incidental effects on protected speech). This decision was instantly appealed, reheard by the same court and resulted in the most recent decision, <a href="http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201214009.reh.pdf">Wollschlaeger II</a> [PDF], on July 28, 2015. The court's subsequent decision relies on alternative legal theories more than its first, but concludes largely the same way: <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article29245474.html">protecting gun owners' privacy prevails over HCWs' free speech rights</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Wollschlaeger II</strong></p>

<p>Doctors and other plaintiffs contested FOPA's restrictions on two primary basis. First, they contended that each of the Act's provisions constitutes impermissible and overbroad content-based infringements of their free speech rights via the First Amendment. They also challenged the vagueness of the provisions under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/substantive_due_process">substantive due process</a>. As to this latter claim, the court's assessment of the record-keeping provision of the Act is illustrative. According to the court, under FOPA <blockquote>"a physician may not record a patient's firearm-ownership status unless the physician believes that&#8212;because of some particularized information about the individual patient, for example, that the patient is suicidal or has violent tendencies&#8212;[this status] pertains to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others."</blockquote> Even though FOPA never clarifies what "relevant" means, Judges Gerald Bard Tjoflat and L. Scott Coogler for the majority intimate that it refers to "a specific health threat facing a specific patient." Plaintiffs further question how HCWs are actually supposed to assess relevancy to patients' health or safety, but the court dismisses their funding the statute's "plain meaning" sufficiently clear. </p>

<p>Tying in their First Amendment claims to the due process angle, the plaintiffs point out that the mere need to establish relevancy to disseminate gun-related information has a "chilling effect" on HCWs' assessment of patients. In dissent Judge  Charles R. Wilson labels this provision of FOPA as "classic viewpoint discrimination." The majority, however, sees it differently. The court remarks correctly that not all speech-related laws are protected via the First Amendment. In this sense the majority is correct. Government routinely and lawfully restricts what doctors and other licensed professionals can say. Patient confidentiality laws may limit what doctors say about their patients to others. Commercial speech laws may prohibit non-board certified doctors from advertising they possess specific skills. </p>

<p>The main objective, concludes the court, "is to determine whether any provision of [FOPA] crosses the boundary between a law regulating professional conduct with an incidental effect on speech and a law regulating protected speech," subject to First Amendment scrutiny. This rationale, however, contravenes recent US Supreme Court's jurisprudence. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=838098438403992670">Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc. (2011)</a>, the court struck down a Vermont state law prohibiting drug companies from reviewing physician prescription practices on the basis that even commercial speech requires at least heightened scrutiny whenever government regulates content. More recently in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15197847235482399259">Reed v. Town of Gilbert</a> (2015), the court invalidated an Arizona city's attempt to ban specific political messages contained on church-sponsored signage. It clarified that virtually any content regulation is subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. Not only did the Eleventh Circuit fail to apply strict scrutiny to FOPA's content-based speech restrictions, its expressed support and bases for upholding the Act's provisions invert government public health powers as discussed below.</p>

<p><strong>Curtailing Public Health Messaging</strong></p>

<p>The majority opinion distinguishes between HCWs' speech in professional and relationship settings. When doctors speak professionally, such as at a medical conference, government's ability to regulate their messages is at its lowest. When they speak to individuals pursuant to a doctor-patient relationship, government's interests are more substantial. So long as government properly balances its interests with free speech principles, concluded the court, it can control the content of HCW's messages to protect patients and the public's health. The majority hones in on the "long recognized authority&#8212;duty, even&#8212;of states to regulate the practice of professions" as "<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13155838236565589433">part of their [police] power to protect the public health, safety, and other valid interests ...</a>" Correspondingly, it holds that state licensing of HCWs includes the ability to limit their conduct, including related speech.</p>

<p>What the court muddles, however, is that the main justification for HCWs' messaging on firearm violence prevention and safety, especially related to minors in households with gun-owning adults, is also implicit within the police powers. It seemingly ignores the fact that while doctors's conduct can be regulated via state-based police powers, these same powers support dissemination of essential public health messages protected by the First Amendment. Balancing the rights of doctors to counsel patients on gun safety with the privacy interests of select patients, the court finds that disseminating truthful, publicly-available, and empirically-proven data about the health and safety risks of firearms is somehow "outside the bounds of good medical care." As a result not only does the Eleventh Circuit look past Supreme Court freedom of speech jurisprudence, it misconstrues the foundation for HCWs to share such information with patients to protect their health and the public's safety.</p>

<p>To the degree FOPA constrains public health messages between HCWs and patients, it thwarts legitimate and lawful public health objectives to prevent firearm deaths and injuries in Florida. Absent further appeals,  <span class="casename">Wollschlaeger II</span> carries significant negative ramifications especially in Florida whose rate of gun deaths was nearly 18 percent higher than the national average in 2013. Upholding government restrictions of content-based gun safety messages by Florida HCWs based on medical licensure is counter-intuitive. Doctors should always be free to communicate truthful, non-misleading health and safety messages in the furtherance of protecting patient's and public's health. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.avemarialaw.edu/faculty/profile/Kevin.Govern">Kevin Govern</a> of Ave Maria School of Law discusses the latest cyber security agreement between China and the US... </p><strong>I</strong>t is a longstanding <a href="http://www.pinyin.info/chinese/crisis.html">fiction</a> that the Chinese word for "crisis" is composed of elements that signify "danger" and "opportunity." Nevertheless, in the realm of science fiction writing, author William Gibson coined the term "cyberspace" in his short story, "Burning Chrome," before most of the public had a concept of, let alone actual experience with, using networked computer systems. Science fiction has given way to cyber reality, with 42.3 percent of the world's population using the internet on a regular basis, some <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm">741 percent growth</a> between 2000-2014 alone. At the same time, cyber weapons and cyber warfare are among the most dangerous innovations in recent years. Cyber weapons can imperil economic, political and military systems by a single act, or by multifaceted orders of effect, with wide ranging potential consequences. A non-exclusive list of some notable past cyber incidents includes but is not limited to:</p>

<p><strong>· 1994</strong>: Chechen rebels use <a href="http://www.soc.mil/SWCS/SWEG/AY_2004-/Petit,%20B%202003%20MMAS.pdf">Internet-enabled propaganda</a> [PDF] in the Russo-Chechen war.<br />
<strong>· 1999</strong>: Serbian hackers try to <a href="https://fcw.com/articles/1999/04/04/serbs-launch-cyberattack-on-nato.aspx">disrupt NATO military operations</a> that clogged NATO's e-mail server with 2,000 messages a day.<br />
<strong>· 2007</strong>: Syrian air defense was reportedly <a href="http://www.wired.com/2007/10/how-israel-spoo/">disabled by a cyber attack</a> moments before the Israeli Air Force demolished an alleged Syrian nuclear reactor; <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia">massive cyber attacks</a> experienced by Estonia, with most of the compromised and attacking computers located within the US but attributed to Russia.<br />
<strong>· 2008</strong>: Russo-Georgian war with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=0">integrated cyber and conventional operations</a>.<br />
<strong>· 2009</strong>: the whole of <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/05/are-cyber-militias-attacking-kyrgyzstan/">Kyrgyzstan was knocked offline</a> during a time of domestic political crisis.<br />
<strong>· 2010</strong>: Stuxnet <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/10/06/iran-nuclear-computer-technology-security-stuxnet-worm.html">worm attacking Iranian nuclear centrifuges</a> identified as most sophisticated <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/stuxnet-was-work-of-us-and-israeli-experts-officials-say/2012/06/01/gJQAlnEy6U_story.html">state-sponsored malware</a>.<br />
<strong>· 2014</strong>: Release of confidential data belonging to Sony Pictures Entertainment, including employee personal information, e-mails, copies of (previously) unreleased Sony films and other information, via a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/07/fbi-director-north-korea-source-sony-cyber-attack-james-comey">hack believed to be of North Korean origin</a>, and two major breaches reputedly by China of US government databases exposed <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/10/chinese-national-security-officials-hack">sensitive information</a> about at least 22.1 million people, including not only federal employees and contractors but their families and friends.<br />
<strong>· 2015</strong>: A <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/10/chinese-national-security-officials-hack">Chinese attack targeted personal emails</a> of "all top [US] national security" officials just days after a "<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/10/chinese-national-security-officials-hack">spear-phishing</a>" attack of suspected Russian origin on the Pentagon's joint staff email system, which exposed some 4,000 civilian and military employees.</p>

<p>The US Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, recently told the House Intelligence Committee the next phase of escalating online data theft most likely will involve the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/10/cyber-threat-data-manipulation-us-intelligence-chief">manipulation of digital information</a>, with a lower likelihood of a "cyber Armageddon" of digitally triggered damage to catastrophically damage physical infrastructure. </p>

<p>On September 25, 2015, during the state visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping, the US and China signed a <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1870/9-24-15-Final%20MoU%20on%20Development%20Cooperation%20-%20USAID-MoFCOM-%20Clean.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a> [PDF] on a range of global, regional and bilateral subjects. According to a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/fact-sheet-president-xi-jinpings-state-visit-united-states">statement from the White House</a>, the two countries now <blockquote>"agree that neither country's government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors." </blockquote><br />
Many details are left to be determined, though, in the "common effort to further identify and promote appropriate norms of state behavior in cyberspace within the international community," including, but not limited to, which acts in cyberspace would be tantamount to an act of war.</p>

<p>In this era of great cyber danger and opportunity, my colleagues and co-editors <a href="http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/faculty/bio_jens_ohlin.cfm">Jens Ohlin</a> from Cornell Law School and <a href="https://www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/cfinkels/">Claire Finkelstein</a> from the University of Pennsylvania Law School and I had the privilege of contributing to and editing a book that assembles the timely and insightful writings of renowned technical experts, industrial leaders, philosophers, legal scholars and military officers as presented at a <a href="https://www.law.upenn.edu/institutes/cerl/">Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law </a>roundtable conference entitled <a href="https://www.law.upenn.edu/institutes/cerl/conferences/cyberwar/">Cyberwar and the Rule of Law</a>.</p>

<p>That work, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cyber-war-9780198717492?cc=us&lang=en">Cyber War&#8212;Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts</a>, explores cyber warfare's moral and legal issues in three categories, pertinent to any cyber security agreement that may be concluded, not just the present Sino-US accord. First, it is critical to address foundational questions regarding cyber attacks. What are they and what does it mean to talk about a cyber war? State sponsored cyber warriors as well as hackers employ ever more sophisticated and persistent means to penetrate government computer systems; in response, governments and industry develop more elaborate and innovative defensive systems. There are valid alternative views concerning whether the laws of war should apply, whether transnational criminal law or some other peacetime framework is more appropriate, or if there is a tipping point that enables the laws of war to be used. Secondly, cyber security challenges traditional conceptualizations of the law of war, or <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/what-are-jus-ad-bellum-and-jus-bello-0">jus in bello</a>, in determining how they might be applied to cyber-conflicts, in particular those of proportionality and necessity. It also investigates the distinction between civilian and combatant in this context and studies the level of causation necessary to elicit a response, looking at the notion of a "proximate cause." Finally, it is essential to analyze the specific operational realities implicated by cyber warfare technology employed and deployed under existing and potential future regulatory regimes.</p>

<p>On the national and foreign policy front, individual freedom of expression and privacy considerations must be balanced against national sovereignty and security concerns in the enforcement of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?CL=ENG&NT=185">Convention on Cybercrime</a>, just as they should be for any future Cyber Weapons Convention or cyber security agreements that China, the US, or any other nations conclude. From a technical perspective, the prospect of increased cyber oversight, regulation and protection appears increasingly challenging but more imperative than any prior time in history, yet as the <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2012/2/23%20cybersecurity%20china%20us%20singer%20lieberthal/0223_cybersecurity_china_us_lieberthal_singer_pdf_english.PDF">Brookings Institute has aptly observed</a> [PDF], improved engagement between China and the US on cyber security will likely have a positive impact in establishing global cyber security norms and implementing mechanisms, as well as other shared concerns, like global finance and the environment. For the above reasons and more, any cyber security agreement concluded will be indispensable to prescribing limits, if not proscribing, cyber warfare, and will have dramatic significance to national and homeland security and foreign affairs of each nation.</p>

		<title>1951 Refugee Convention: Moral Aspiration or Legal Obligation?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Karla McKanders of the <a href="http://law.utk.edu/people/karla-mckanders/">University of Tennessee, Knoxville College of Law</a> discusses the European refugee crisis...</p>

<p><strong>"T</strong>hey are people in genuine need of our protection. There is no wall you would not climb, no sea you would not cross if you are fleeing violence and terror. I believe we have a moral duty (to) offer them protection."&#8212;<a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/9/17/croatia-becomes-latest-refugee-focus-after-hungary-actions.html">Dimitris Avramopoulos</a>, European Union's Migration Commissioner. </p>

<p>Avramopolous's statement raises contemporary issues of accountability of individual nation states to respond to the current global refugee crisis. His statements highlight the moral aspirations that were converted into legal obligations under the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html">1951 Refugee Convention</a>; and the increasing burden that many countries in the Global South have recently encountered in attempting to process refugee flows at their borders.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b73b0d63.html">Hungary</a>, a 1982 a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention ("Convention") and the 1967 Protocol ("Protocol"), took seemingly unprecedented steps to halt refugee flows at the country's Southern border. Hungary's geographic location has made it a transit, sending and destination country. The recent issues that have surfaced in Hungary highlight a refugee issue that has been building over the years in Hungary without much international attention. <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/hungary-transit-country-between-east-and-west">Hungary</a> until 1997 accepted refugees only from European countries. After 1997, the majority of the asylum applications were non-European migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Iraq. <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/hungary-transit-country-between-east-and-west">Hungary's</a> past history of migration is important to understand the current refugee crisis and it also provides context to increasing demands on countries that have increasingly become destination countries for migrants.</p>

<p>The international community responded with outrage and incredulity to Hungary erecting legal and physical barriers to providing protection to vulnerable refugees. Hungary's barriers diverted refugee flows to <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b73b0d63.pdf">Croatia</a>, an also 1992 signatory to the Convention, and prompted the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and nation states across the globe to delve into long overdue discussions regarding signatories' obligations under the Convention.</p>

<p>The 1951 Refugee Convention defines a refugee as "someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social <br />
group, or political opinion." The principle underlying Convention is one of non-refoulement. <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html">Article 33</a> of the Convention defines non-refoulement as the promise to not return a refugee to a country where s/he may be persecuted. The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html">1967 Protocol</a> modified the Refugee Convention broadening the definitional scope of who is a refugee and providing protection to "persons who have become refugees as a result of events occurring after 1 January 1951." The Convention was created to set up an international mechanism to respond to the events of WWII to avoid failure to provide protection to migrants displaced by war, conflicts, government upheavals and genocide.</p>

<p>The Convention's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/StatusOfRefugees.aspx">Preamble</a> calls on signatories to act in good faith to ensure refugees within their borders are protected. Hungary's recent response in affirmatively deterring and halting refugees and asylum seekers raises issues of the binding effect of the Convention on signatories and what mechanisms and strategies exist to hold signatories accountable. In addition EU members are also bound to abide by the provisions in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a>. Secretary General of the Council of Europe <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/secretary-general/home">Thorbjørn</a> Jagland <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/refugee-crisis-council-of-europe-reminds-states-of-respect-for-human-rights-of-all?redirect=http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/home?p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_DibKFqnpE518&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=2">stressed</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Any person arriving in the territory of the 47 member States of the Council of Europe is entitled to the same fundamental rights as everyone else," Jagland said, stressing that even in times of large-scale arrivals, there can be no derogation from the European Convention on Human Rights, prohibiting inhuman and degrading treatment.</blockquote>

<p>Hungary's response highlights contemporary challenges that countries in the Global South face as new migration destination countries. Hungary's response is indicative of a continuing global tug of war between the Global North and Global South. This tug of war involves disputes over which nation states are responsible and have the financial means to <br />
manage large-scale refugee flows. </p>

<p>The exchanges between countries have occurred across the globe especially on borders where the Global North and South meet, leading refugee law scholars, like <a href="http://perma.cc/B7QW-YXFY">James Hathaway</a>, to posit:</p>

<blockquote>Not only governments&#8212;but most tragically, even the international refugee agency, UNHCR&#8212;have been inattentive to the fact that the drafters of the convention never intended the treaty to operate in the atomized and uncoordinated way that has characterized most of its nearly 65-year history. To the contrary, the preamble to the Refugee Convention expressly recognizes that "the grant of asylum may place unduly heavy burdens on certain countries," such that real global protection "cannot therefore be achieved without international co-operation." </blockquote>

<p>For example, Morocco, only <a href="http://www.mapcrow.info/Distance_between_Tarifa_SP_and_Tangier_MO.html">20</a> miles (31.72 kilometers) from the European Union ("EU"), across the Mediterranean and with Spanish Enclaves within its borders, has become a <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/morocco-setting-stage-becoming-migration-transition-country">destination country</a>. Morocco, as a new migrant destination country, is a result of more stringent <a href="http://rightsinexile.tumblr.com/post/117892226632/migration-policy-reform-in-morocco-implications">EU border policies</a>. The result is that countries in the Global South must address how to provide legal and humanitarian protection refugees and asylum seekers within its borders.</p>

<p>The same tensions exist on the US and Mexican border where since last year the US immigration system has been struggling to effectively address the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-calls-wave-of-children-across-us-mexican-border-urgent-humanitarian-situation/2014/06/02/4d29df5e-ea8f-11e3-93d2-edd4be1f5d9e_story.html">2014 humanitarian crisis</a>. This crisis occurred when an unprecedented number of women and children asylum seekers fleeing violence in Central America were turned away from US borders. </p>

<p>This has led to a blame shifting game that contradicts the spirit of the Refugee Convention and calls into question its ability to effectively address refugee crises. "Indeed, more than 80% of the world's refugees live in countries of the <a href="http://perma.cc/B7QW-YXFY">less developed world</a> and are guaranteed no financial support from wealthier countries. Nor are these front-line states meaningfully assisted by resettlement. Of the roughly 14,000,000 refugees in the world last year, only about 100,000 were resettled&#8212;with just two countries, the US and Canada, providing the lion's share of this woefully inadequate contribution."</p>

<p>To address these issues many nation states in the Global North have entered into first country of arrival agreements. The US and Canada have signed the <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/laws-policy/menu-safethird.asp">Safe Third Country Agreement</a>. This agreement provides "refugee claimants are required to request refugee protection in the first safe country they arrive in, unless they qualify for an exception to the agreement." Similarly countries in the EU are parties to the <a href="http://www.ecre.org/topics/areas-of-work/protection-in-europe/10-dublin-regulation.html">Dublin Agreement</a> that "establishes a hierarchy of criteria for identifying the Member State responsible for the examination of an asylum claim in Europe." The Dublin Agreement provides a system wherein a asylum seeker may select where to travel predominantly on the basis of family links followed by responsibility assigned on the basis of the state through which the asylum seeker first entered, or the state responsible for their entry into the territory of the EU member states, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. In the wake of the current refugee crisis, the <a href="http://website-pace.net/documents/19863/1278654/20150909-AfterDublin-EN.pdf/755eb5b6-3bd1-4d99-af22-0b18fdb5a513">EU</a> is evaluating effectiveness of the agreement's burden sharing mechanisms.</p>

<p>The goal of these agreements is to ensure that the country of first arrival takes responsibility for evaluating the asylum seekers claim to refugee status, to deter forum shopping and to ensure the country of first arrival provides access to its national asylum procedures. </p>

<p>Within this context individual nation states have the discretion to implement refugee-processing mechanisms in accordance with their nation's domestic laws. Specifically <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html">article nine</a> of the Convention provides "[n]othing in this Convention shall prevent a contracting state, in time of war or other grave and exceptional circumstances, from taking provisionally measures which it considers to be essential to the national security in the case of a particular person, pending a determination by the contracting state that that person is in fact a refugee and that the continuance of such measures is necessary in his case in the interests of national security." This reflects the general principle that controlling migration is regarding as a key element that nation states regard as a threat to their sovereignty and security. </p>

<p>Hungary's <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/9/11/eastern-european-countries-reject-migrant-quotas.html">recent</a> response, to the entry of approximately 175,000 migrants this year, was "to lay a razor-wire barrier along the Serb border and for almost 4,000 soldiers to begin erecting a fence 13 feet high with the help of prisoners from a nearby jail." In addition Hungary has implemented laws to jail migrants, deploy its army and give law enforcement officials wide-ranging new powers to control migration flows. Hungary's argues that it is their prerogative as a sovereign nation to decide and implement its own way of responding to the refugee crisis.</p>

<p>The questions surrounding Hungary's response is whether its laws and polices towards refugees are tailored to manage refugee flows in furtherance of its national sovereignty, or simply pre-textual actions disguising discriminatory and xenophobic attitudes aimed at excluding Muslim asylum seekers from the Middle East and North Africa ("MENA"). Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban's public statements highlight this concern. He unapologetically <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/09/03/muslims-threaten-europes-christian-identity-hungarys-leader-says/">stated</a>:</p>

<blockquote>We shouldn't forget that the people who are coming here grew up in a different religion and represent a completely different culture. Most are not Christian, but Muslim.... That is an important question, because Europe and European culture have a Christian root.</blockquote>

<p>Article three of the Refugee Convention provides that signatories are to apply the Convention's provisions "without discrimination as to race, religion or country of origin. Developments in international human rights law also reinforce the principle that the Convention be applied without discrimination as to sex, age, disability, sexuality or other prohibited grounds of discrimination." </p>

<p>The Hungarian prime minister's statements and actions call into question the legality of Hungary's building of fences, use of military and implementing new laws to halt the flow of refugees. Further statements by the prime minister also call into question the fairness and ability Hungary's judicial bodies to impartially process refugee status determinations under their national system. </p>

<p>The treatment of refugees in Hungary is not a new issue. In 2014, UNHCR repeatedly criticized Hungary for its treatment of refugees claiming that they were housing refugees in former military barracks and had unclear policies that mandated the detention of migrants and refugees,. As lawyers, legal scholars and international actors, we need to use the current refugee crisis to assess and develop mechanisms to hold Convention signatories account able for its actions. Even though countries in the Global South are becoming new destination countries, they should not be permitted to hide behind the pretext of sovereignty to avoid their obligations under the Convention and implement discriminatory policies where they are able to pick and choose which refugee populations they deem acceptable.</p>

		<title>Gay Marriage and Michigan No-Fault Spousal Benefits</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist David Christensen from <a href="https://www.davidchristensenlaw.com/">Christensen Law</a> discusses the impact of spousal benefits on the LGBT community...</p><strong>W</strong>hen the US Supreme Court ruled that states could not ban gay marriage earlier this year, it did more than just given them access to marriage certificates. The legal designation of "spouse" opens LGBT couples up to rights and benefits in many areas of the law. That includes Michigan no-fault auto law and third-party negligence actions.</p>

                <p><strong>The Resident Relative Provision</strong></p>

                <p>Michigan law provides for no fault auto insurance coverage for passengers even if they do not carry individual auto insurance policies. While the first recourse is always a person's own insurance, if she is uninsured, she can look to her immediate family. Pursuant to <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(vl5shkvvxmkxx5vkrkh50k4y))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-500-3114">MCL 500.3114</a>, an auto insurance policy "applies to accidental bodily injury to the person named in the policy, the person's spouse, and a relative of either domiciled in the same household, if the injury arises from a motor vehicle accident."</p>

                <p>Before the decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/">Obergefell v Hodges</a>, if a gay man was injured he would not be able to turn to his partner's insurance policy for help. Even if they had been married in one of the many states that had legalized same-sex marriage prior to the court ruling, Michigan would not recognize his partner as his legal spouse. </p>

                <p>This result was particularly harsh when it came to the children of those uninsured gay residents. Under Michigan law, if two men or two women wanted to raise a child together, only one of them could be the legal parent. Whether this was by way of natural child birth using a donor or adoption, Michigan would only grant parental rights to, and therefore the child could only benefit from, one legal mother or father within the couple.</p>

                <p>Imagine a case where Joe and Tom are raising Lily, who is Joe's biological daughter. Until <span class="casename">Obergefell</span>, there was no way for Tom to become a legal father to Lily. Now imagine that Joe is not insured but Tom is. If Lily were in a car accident, she would not be able to receive benefits from Tom's insurance policy as a resident relative. Instead the claim would progress down the order of priority to the owner of the vehicle in which she was riding.</p>

                <p>Now that the court has required states to grant marriage certificates to gay couples and recognize the same-sex marriages celebrated elsewhere, the Joes and Lilys in Michigan can take advantage of spousal benefits and resident relative benefits of their loved ones' insurance policies. All they need to do to cement protection for their family is get married.</p>

                <p><strong>The Legal Significance of a Spouse</strong></p>

                <p>A person's spouse has a lot more rights than just auto insurance benefits, though. Under negligence law, a spouse can be the next friend of an incapacitated individual and file suit on his or her behalf. This means that, continuing with the same example, if Tom were to suffer a traumatic brain injury and be unable to file a lawsuit on his own, under <span class="casename">Obergefell</span>, Joe is now authorized to file it for him. </p>

                <p>Before, as a legal stranger, Joe would have had to turn to Tom's family members for help. Because of the social stigma and the beliefs of certain religions, many members of the LGBT community are not able to rely on their biological family to help them. For this very reason, gay and lesbian couples will often go through added burden and expense to name their partners as health care decision makers. But that does not affect the partner's legal standing to bring suit on behalf of the injured person. The partners need to be legally married to do that.</p>

                <p><strong>Spousal Benefits in Third Party Cases</strong></p>

                <p>If the injuries resulting from a car accident are serious enough to allow a <a href="https://www.davidchristensenlaw.com/third-party-claims/">Third Party</a> lawsuit against the at-fault driver, being the legal spouse of that injured person becomes even more important. That is because spouses have access to a special class of non-economic damages: loss of consortium (or companionship). This damage claim legitimizes the lost emotional and physical support that couples provide one another.</p>

                <p>Before <span class="casename">Obergefell</span>, if a woman in a same-sex partnership was severely injured, the support she provided to her partner would go unrecognized and uncompensated. The couple would be treated as legal strangers. Once that lesbian couple is legally allowed to marry, however, they are also allowed all of the litigation awards traditionally available to spouses.</p>

                <p><strong>Spousal Benefits in Wrongful Death Cases</strong></p>

                <p>The most tragic of auto accident cases involve estates, not injured parties. Just like in incapacity cases, the natural person to bring a wrongful death action on behalf of a person's estate is his or her spouse (unless a different personal representative is identified in estate planning documents). No matter how many assets a gay couple owns jointly&#8212;homes, cars, boats, even bank accounts&#8212;the surviving partner will not have any authority to file a wrongful death action without either a personal representative designation or the legal identity of "spouse." </p>

                <p>If a same-sex couple does marry (or their out-of-state marriage is recognized under <span class="casename">Obergefell</span>), and an accident later takes one partner's life, the surviving spouse can move forward with a wrongful death action to recover his or her spouse's medical expenses, funeral and burial costs, and non-economic pain and suffering awards. The spouse is also entitled to certain survivor benefits including loss of financial support in the form of lost wages. All of these rights are connected to the word "spouse" and were not available to same-sex couples in Michigan just a few months ago.</p>

                <p><strong>Protecting the Family Under Obergefell</strong></p>

                <p>The Plaintiffs in <span class="casename">Obergefell</span>, and its Michigan counterpart <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/deboer-v-snyder/">DeBoer v Snyder</a> (which was consolidated into the Supreme Court case), were not just suing for dignity and equality. The lawsuit that changed the way this nation defines marriage was not just about a label. It was about the thousands of state and federal rights that connect to the word "spouse." The <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> decision said the state law protections for families and children were "material." Justice Kennedy wrote:<br />
                <blockquote>"By giving recognition and legal structure to their parents' relationship, marriage allows children 'to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.' Marriage also affords the permanency and stability important to children's best interests."</blockquote> Under Michigan auto law, that stability comes in part from a child's ability to collect benefits from both parents and for the child's surviving parent to be able to go to court to recover damages available only to a spouse.</p>

                <p>As family lawyers, magistrates and ministers across the Michigan do the hard work of legalizing and legitimizing the committed relationships of thousands of LGBT couples living in Michigan, auto accident attorneys need to be aware of the effect of this decision on the lives of their clients. By being clear on the rights of same-sex spouses and inquiring into the details of their clients' marital history, car accident lawyers can better protect clients and their families from missing out on important spousal benefits and survivor damage claims based on legal marital or parental status.</p>

		<title>Responding to the Refugee Crisis, Can Lawyers Help?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Karla McKanders of the <a href="http://law.utk.edu/people/karla-mckanders/">University of Tennessee Knoxville College of Law</a> discusses the European refugee crisis...</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>his commentary explores actions lawyers can take to hold signatories to the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html">1951 Refugee Convention</a> accountable for protecting refugee and asylum seekers within or at their borders.</p>

<p>The 1951 Refugee Convention defines a refugee as "someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion." The principle underlying the convention is one of non-refoulement. <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html">Article 33</a> of the convention defines non-refoulement as the promise to not return a refugee to a country where s/he may be persecuted. <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html">The 1967 Protocol</a> modified the Refugee Convention broadening the definitional scope of who is a refugee and providing protection to "persons who have become refugees as a result of events occurring after January 1, 1951.<br />
<blockquote>"Pursuant to the Refugee Convention, there is a <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4a16b1d06.html">refugee status determination</a> ("RSD") process "by which governments or [the UN High Commissioner for Refugees] UNHCR determine whether a person seeking international protection is considered a refugee under international, regional or national law."</blockquote></p>

<p>During RSD process, typically,  individual interviews are conducted to determine whether an individual, an asylum seeker, is able to meet the legal criteria under the convention as a person fleeing persecution on account of a protected ground. <blockquote>"During mass movements of refugees (usually as a result of conflicts or generalized violence as opposed to individual persecution), there is not&#8212;and never will be&#8212;a capacity to conduct individual asylum interviews for everyone who has crossed the border. Nor is it usually necessary, since in such circumstances it is generally evident why they have fled. As a result, such groups are often declared "<a href="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c137.html">prima facie</a>" refugees."</blockquote></p>

<p>As a refugee law scholar and practicing refugee lawyer, it is hard to theorize regarding the future and effectiveness of the existing implementation of the Convention in various contexts, without seeking solutions to ensure that signatories to the Convention are upholding asylum seekers' due process and basic human rights. The challenge becomes how to learn from the existing crisis in conjunction with other crisis and develop long-term strategies to hold signatories to the Convention accountable for treatment of refugees. The Convention provides a solid framework. The prevalent contemporary issue is to address the increasing number of countries who are new destinations for refugees.</p>

<p>When Hungary put up the barbwire and fences, their national RSD process required asylum seekers to present identification at the reduced border entries and demand asylum. It should be noted that rarely do asylum seekers have proper documentation as it is often lost in transit or intentionally not carried for protection. If the asylum seeker passes this stage, then s/he is given hearing before a Hungarian judicial authority to decide whether s/he has a fear of persecution under the Convention. When going through the Hungarian RSD process,recently Syrians have claimed that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/16/hungary-dismisses-refugee-asylum-requests-within-minutes">Hungarian</a> officials are rejecting, within minutes, their asylum claims without a substantive review.</p>

<p>For example, NPR reported on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/16/hungary-dismisses-refugee-asylum-requests-within-minutes">Habbal</a> who was one of at least 16 applicants to be rejected, in Hungary. He claimed that each person was turned down in a maximum of 20 minutes. "They didn't ask about my life," said Habbal, who claims he is a wanted man in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria">Syria</a> because of his involvement in anti-regime protests several years ago.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/559641846.html">July 2015</a>, UNHCR called for Hungary to halt proposed legislative amendments to expedite asylum seekers claims to refugee status stating, "[w]e are asking the Hungarian government and public representatives to ensure that any amendments to its national asylum legislation are in conformity with international and regional protection standards, and are not contrary to those standards."</p>

<p>In response to the humanitarian refugee crisis, various lawyers and human rights advocates around the globe have taken actions to provide legal representation and consultations to asylum seekers after their initial <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/migrant-crisis-eu-ministers-must-meet-human-needs-1.2352515">human</a> needs are met. There are numerous legal aid projects in Uganda, Germany, Morocco and across the globe. Refugee law scholars, activists and advocates, like Professor Emerita Barbara Harrell-Bond, have successfully pushed for and globally implemented refugee legal aid programs to help asylum seekers navigate the legal and political barriers to asylum and hold signatories to their obligations under the Convention.</p>

<p>In 2012 I had the opportunity to work with lawyers, legal scholars and human rights activists in Morocco to provide assistance in creating Morocco's first refugee legal aid pro bono representation project with the organization Droit et Justice. The goal of the project was to provide <a href="http://rightsinexile.tumblr.com/post/62775662754/legal-aid-for-refugees-in-morocco-droit-et">refugees</a> with legal assistance in presenting their claims for refugee status. Three years after the initial implementation, the program has trained Moroccan lawyers and law students to assist asylum seekers in navigating refugee status determinations. The larger impact of <a href="http://droitetjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Flyer-Oujda-Aout-2014-en-ANGLAIS.pdf">Droit et Justice's</a> work has been helping Morocco as a new destination country for asylum seekers and migrants to develop its own national system for processing refugees. The EU's <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewPDF.asp?FileID=22017&lang=en">Council of Europe</a> has lauded Morocco as being an exemplar of how transit countries can manage migration flows, even though Morocco has more progress to make in this area.</p>

<p>In addition as we think through the effectiveness of lawyer interventions, we also can use the response to the US 2014 humanitarian crisis on the border as a tool to assess the effectiveness in providing asylum seekers with legal guidance in navigating national asylum procedures during chaotic humanitarian crisis. During the summer of 2014, the US experienced a significant increase in woman and unaccompanied children crossing the border fleeing violence in Central America. In response the US government opened a remote detention facility for women and children in Artesia, New Mexico. "During the first five weeks that the Artesia facility was open, officials summarily <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/magazine/the-shame-of-americas-family-detention-camps.html?referrer=&_r=1">deported</a> more than 200 refugees to Central America."</p>

<p>Volunteer lawyers and law school <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bug0KdxO28c">immigration clinics</a> from across the US, under the leadership of the <a href="http://www.aila.org/">American Immigration Lawyers Association</a>, assembled to ensure that asylum seekers received proper due process rights in presenting their asylum claims in Immigration Court. The result was the significant decrease in expedited removals and women and children being able to properly assert their asylum claims.</p>

<p>In the US, the scholarly article, <a href="https://www.acslaw.org/files/RefugeeRoulette.pdf">Refugee Roulette</a>, highlights that "Represented asylum seekers were granted asylum at a rate of 45.6 percent, almost three times as high as the 16.3 percent grant rate for those without legal counsel. The regression analyses confirmed that, with all other variables in the study held constant, represented asylum seekers were substantially more likely to win their case than those without representation." </p>

<p>These examples highlight that lawyers can play a key role in ensuring that asylum seekers rights to RSDs are processed in accordance with legal standards under the Refugee Convention and that the Refugee Convention is not only an aspirational document but also a means to hold signatories accountable for their obligations to protect refugees and migrants fleeing persecution. As we reflect on the current refugee crisis, implementing legal guidance for asylum seekers and refugees should be added to humanitarian aid that includes legal counsel to help navigate a nation's asylum process and the general bureaucracy of legal rights associated with being a vulnerable migrant who has been forced to leave their home country.</p>

Huyhn discusses the impact a recent Supreme Court case might have on patentability of mobile apps and other IT creations ... </j:header></p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he world of entrepreneurship offers a detour from conventional employment. Trading in their cubicles for some managerial control, scores of young millennials enter the world of mobile app development. And why not? Millennials are well versed in the <a href="http://www.journalmtm.com/2014/fitness-apps-a-valid-alternative-to-the-gym-a-pilot-study/">value</a> of mobile apps, conversant in social media and understand their millennial consumer base. The allure of entering the mobile apps market increases when you consider the thousands of mobile apps related to health and fitness. And when you consider the benefits of a patented lucrative product, the idea becomes even more irresistible. After all, if <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/womens-training/apps/nike-training-club">Nike</a> can profit from providing fitness advice, so can I. Seems easy, right? Not if a wide-eyed inventor wishes to patent their creation.   	</p>

<p>Patents are not granted to anyone for any reason. And this is because patents provide the security of exclusive control over an invention. From an entrepreneur's perspective, owning a patent means no one can capitalize on your idea without due compensation. It places control in the hands of the entrepreneur promoting entrepreneurship instead of conventional employment. Entrepreneurs can <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323623304579054622258666900">sell</a> their patents to established companies for a sizeable profit. From the company's perspective, owning more patents means an increased business advantage.  	</p>

<p>However there are several <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/general-information-concerning-patents#heading-5">requirements</a> for obtaining a patent. The patent must pass several requirements under the Patent Act ("the Act"), <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35">35. U.S.C. §101</a>.  Among other requirements, patents must first pass subject matter eligibility. The US Supreme Court has determined that certain subject matter is not patent <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2106.html">eligible</a>: laws of nature, physical phenomena and abstract ideas. 	   	</p>

<p>Recently the court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7784134755284986738">Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Intern</a> raised the requirements for patentability. There the court invalidated a patent that informed financial professionals how to reduce the risks associated with settlements. The court reasoned that the concept of risk reduction is a well-understood concept in the financial industry. Accordingly under <span class="casename">Alice</span>, if an invention implicates a concept or method that is already customary to a particular industry, it cannot be patented.This means trouble for millennials who seek to patent their health and fitness mobile apps because those apps undoubtedly involve some area of dieting or exercise that is already common practice among fitness professionals. On a larger scale, <span class="casename">Alice</span> threatens the incentive for entering the entrepreneurial market.   </p>

<p><span class="casename">Alice</span> is as broad as it is troubling because of its impact on health and fitness mobile apps. Health and fitness mobile apps require users to input some degree of personalized information so that the app can provide customized workouts or meal plans unique to the user's fitness goals. However customized the workout or diet plan, the app will nevertheless involve general well-understood fitness practices. In fact most health and fitness apps will invariably involve some degree of an already well-known practice. Does this mean all patents that involve a well-known practice are automatically invalidated? Would this deter millennials from entering the entrepreneurial world of mobile apps development?  </p>

<p>All is not lost. <span class="casename">Alice</span> also informs us that patents that involve an abstract idea may nevertheless be patentable in certain circumstances. If the application of the "abstract idea" is to a "new and useful end," the patent may survive <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/101">subject matter</a> patentability. <span class="casename">Alice</span> states that the application of the abstract idea must "do more" than simply restate or define the abstract idea. And just when it seems as if the court is offering some meaningful guidance, it decides to stop short of a full explanation. <span class="casename">Alice</span> suggests that "doing more" with an abstract idea may help pass patentability, but exactly how much more is uncertain.    </p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Alice</span> the court criticized the use of the algorithm and computer as an intermediary because it failed to "transform the nature of the claim" into a patent eligible application. The method patent's use of a computer as an intermediary was no different from the current practice of using clearinghouses. The use of the computer was "[p]urely convention[al]" because obtaining account data, adjusting account balances, and facilitating with other computers to execute transfers were all "well-understood, routine conventional activit[ies]."   	</p>

<p>Under <span class="casename">Alice</span> patents on health and fitness apps likely amount to a patent on an "abstract idea." By nature health and fitness apps counsel users on ways to efficiently diet, and meet their fitness goals. This is largely the same if not an identical, function as a personal trainer or other fitness professional. For example dieting involves the widely understood process of decreasing intake of carbohydrates and increasing intake of protein or some variation of the two. In any circumstance the app will undoubtedly rely on "well-understood, routine conventional [dieting or exercise] activit[ies]" in the fitness community. Health and fitness apps may involve the use of an algorithm or computer to make personalized computations based on the individual's data. However "obtaining" user information, "adjusting" for user preferences and "facilitating" a customized diet or exercise plan are all "well-understood, routine conventional activit[ies]" already performed by fitness professionals. 	  </p>

<p>To improve prospects of patentability, patent applicants should consider the following options. Applicants should specify how the invention does more than patent an abstract idea. One way would be by describing the various ways the invention takes the abstract idea and uses it in new and innovative ways that would not otherwise be used. If the patent involves the use of an algorithm, applicants should also describe how the invention falls apart without the proprietary algorithm. Fully explaining how the invention's proprietary algorithm impacts the uniqueness of the invention may improve the invention's patentability.  	</p>

<p>Though not readily apparent, intellectual property laws can further social goals. While cases are decided on the legal battleground, their implications may affect the social fabric of our society. Legally <span class="casename">Alice</span> raises the bar for patenting health and fitness mobile apps. But perhaps more important, socially, <span class="casename">Alice</span> lowers the appeal of entering the health and fitness mobile apps community. Echoing parental wisdom, <span class="casename">Alice</span> encourages young millennials to "do more." But exactly how much more remains unclear. And until clarity is provided, <span class="casename">Alice</span> may unintentionally dissuade millennials from the world of entrepreneurship. </p>

                <p>In the 30th Session of the Human Rights Council, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights&#8212;in the course of a passionate speech which also <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16414&LangID=E">outlined</a> the serious challenges faced by the world in the war in Syria as well as the situation in Palestine, Sri Lanka, Eritrea, among others&#8212;chose to highlight the rights violations perpetrated on grounds of intersex status.</p>

                <p>As the High Commissioner put it, <blockquote>Far too few of us are aware of the specific human rights violations faced by millions of <strong>intersex</strong> [emphasis added] people. Because their bodies do not comply with typical definitions of male or female, intersex children and adults are frequently subjected to forced sterilization and other unnecessary and irreversible surgery, and suffer discrimination in schools, workplaces and other settings.</blockquote></p>

                <p>The office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Astepforwardforintersexvisibility.aspx">organized a specific two day expert meeting</a> on ending human rights violations against intersex people, thereby unequivocally asserting that intersex issues have its own specificity and are not just an add on to LGBT issues.</p>

                <p>Intersex is an umbrella term including people with variations in sex characteristics, rather than a type per se. While variations of sex characteristics are natural, human cultures treat this natural diversity as a problem. Within human society, this natural diversity of sex characteristics is forced into the gender binary of male and female. It is this imperative of human society, to treat sexual diversity as a problem, which becomes the root cause of the great suffering imposed by society on those whose sex characteristics do not conform to rigid notions of male and female.</p>

                <p>Those who fall outside of the binary of male and female are classified within the <a href="http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/">International Classification of Diseases</a> (ICD) as <a href="http://www.ifge.org/302.85_Gender_Identity_Disorder_in_Adolescents_or_Adults">suffering from a form of pathology</a>. Once the person is classified as suffering from pathology, then the route to medical intervention is opened up. The key problem faced in countries around the world is that <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943">doctors tell </a> parents of children with diverse sex characteristics that their children require surgery so that they can fit into a specific sex. Often, the parents have too little knowledge and information about whether the surgery is a medical necessity. Parents are convinced that the surgery is required for medical as well as "<a href="https://oii.org.au/22925/clinicians-acknowledge-lack-of-justification-for-infant-surgeries/">psychosocial reasons</a>." Parents often believe that doctors know best and end up consenting to a  surgery, which is often <a href="https://oii.org.au/10217/international-coalition-genital-integrity-intersex-surgery-parents-doctors-decide/">medically unnecessary</a>.  </p>

                <p>Even if surgery is not a medical necessity doctors still justify it as a psychosocial problem. However, this has been <a href="https://oii.org.au/348/sanfrancisco-hrc-intersex-report/">exposed</a> by intersex activists as being nothing more than social discomfort with the lack of fixity of gender. Intersex activists make the point, that to subject children to genital mutilation&#8212; which the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf">UN Special Rapporteur on Torture</a> [PDF] considers a form of torture&#8212;so that society is not discomfited, is an unconscionable suffering, which is inflicted on children born with the intersex condition.</p>

                <p>As emerging documentation has shown, this surgery has long term impacts on the child. One <a href="http://observador.pt/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/issuepaper-on-intersex2015_en.pdf">intersex person described the implications of surgery</a> [PDF], <blockquote>Result[s] in physical and psychological damage, such as hot flashes, depression, sleeping disorders, the disappearance of my sexuality and my reproductive capacity&#8230;...The male genitalia surgically reconstructed has caused irreversible damage such as chronic urinary infections, disorders of urination, structures and scarring. These interventions have made me lose all my innate feeling of belonging to a sex and all sexual behavior.</blockquote></p>

                <p><a href="http://www.isna.org/articles/ambivalent_medicine">Studies</a> have also shown that the sex assigned at birth by the doctor can often times be wrong, with the person subjected to surgery, being assigned a sex which is not in accordance with the person&#8217;s internal sense of gender.</p>

                <p>Intersex activists have <a href="http://oiiinternational.com/2574/intersex-genital-mutilation-igm-fourteen-days-intersex/">equated</a> genital surgery to a form of genital mutilation, which is deeply invasive and destructive of bodily and psychological integrity. </p>

                <p>Given all the pain and trauma that surgery causes, the question is why is it still so prevalent? The answer has partly to do with the fact that the medical profession, with its codes of knowledge, still chooses to see intersex variation as pathology and hence treatment becomes the first option. It has also to do with the deep-rooted social imperative of a fixed gender in society and culture.</p>

                <p>The solution, which intersex activists have been advocating is a law on the lines of the pioneering <a href="http://tgeu.org/gender-identity-gender-expression-sex-characteristics-act-malta-2015/">Maltese legislation</a>, which unequivocally opposes medically unnecessary surgery and protects the right to bodily integrity and physical autonomy. This law prohibits sex assignment treatment and/or surgical intervention on the sex characteristics of a minor when treatment and/or intervention can be deferred until the person to be treated can provide informed consent.</p>

                <p>The point the Maltese legislation is making is that the child is the best person best placed to make the decision on surgical intervention once she/he can is old enough and mature enough to make an informed decision. It unequivocally asserts that substituted decision making by parents and doctors is not an option when it comes to medically unnecessary surgery. The Maltese law privileges the right of the child to participate in a decision, which affects him or her (<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx">Article 12 of the Convention on Rights of the Child</a>) over the right of parents and medical professionals to decide what is in the best interest of the child (<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx">Article 3 of the CRC</a>). It is the problematic understanding of "best interest" as determined by parents which is bypassed by the Maltese legislation which rightly gives weight to the right of the child to decide matters pertaining to his or her bodily integrity. </p>

                <p>When it comes to the question of prohibiting genital mutilation performed on intersex children, the world has a long way to go. The question of intersex mutilation is not even acknowledged as a rights violation in almost all parts of the world.</p>

                <p>While genital mutilation and the deep violation of bodily integrity should be legislatively prohibited around the world and the medical codes which classify intersex variation as a form of disorder or pathology should be changed, that by itself is not enough. Fundamentally, the cultural imagination of bodily diversity needs to change and society and culture needs to accept that sexual variation by itself is not a problem.</p>

                <p>However a future free of discrimination on grounds of intersex status cannot emerge, if the injustices of the past are not fully redressed. The issue of what has been done to intersex infants around the world is one of  which raises questions of <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/TruthJusticeReparation/Pages/Index.aspx">truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence</a>.</p>

                <p>The violence suffered by intersex persons is shrouded in shame, silence and secrecy. The courageous work of intersex activists is beginning to break the silence. However this issue is yet to find a proper place in human rights activism and LGBT activism.</p>

                <p>The first step in the struggle for justice is the acknowledgement that an enormous violation has been perpetrated and continues to be perpetrated on those born with an intersex condition. The medical profession has yet to acknowledge that a great wrong has been done and continues to be done.</p>

                <p>It is in this context that there is a need for a commission of inquiry on the lines of the Argentinian Commission on the Disappearance of Persons. The Argentinian Commission produced a famous report, <a href="http://www.desaparecidos.org/nuncamas/web/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_001.htm">Nunca Más</a>, which established the truth of what had happened to those the regime perceived as opponents. By documenting the crimes committed by the military junta on the Argentinian people, Nunca Más built an incontrovertible public archive and memorialized what had happened. A crucial part of remembering was the injunction that these horrors should never be perpetrated again as the evocative title of the report indicates&#8212;Nunca Más, translating as "Never Again."</p>

                <p>The global struggle of the intersex community for justice is in its infancy. What we need is a similar commission of inquiry which establishes in incontrovertible terms, the horror, pain, torture and suffering inflicted on intersex children around the world&#8212;all in the name of preserving the two gender system. Documenting the horrors should open up the question of justice, which has three key components: acknowledgement, reparation and the promise of non-recurrence.</p>

                <p>The courageous work of intersex activists has brought this struggle global attention. It is up to us all to ensure that this struggle for justice is not forgotten.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://pennstatelaw.psu.edu/faculty/copeland">Katrice Bridges Copeland</a> of Penn State Law at University Park discusses the controversy surrounding the Department of Justices' failure to prosecute corporations and those associated with corporate fraud following the Financial Crisis of 2008...</p>
<strong>T</strong>he Department of Justice (DOJ) has received a great deal of criticism for its failure to prosecute both corporations and individuals involved in corporate fraud, especially those associated with the financial collapse in 2008. Companies were labeled "too big to fail" and it was difficult to determine the responsible individuals within the corporations. In an effort to quiet some of that criticism, on September 9, 2015, newly-minted Deputy Attorney General Sally Quillian Yates issued the latest installment of the DOJ's charging guidelines. The policy entitled "Individual Accountability for Corporate Wrongdoing" or the "<a href="http://www.justice.gov/dag/file/769036/download">Yates Memo</a>" as it has been called, does not focus on criminal charges against corporations. Instead, the focus is on prosecuting individuals within the corporate entity: "[o]ne of the most effective ways to combat corporate misconduct is by seeking accountability from the individuals who perpetrated the wrongdoing." The Yates Memo announces six steps to pursue individual corporate wrongdoing, but the main thrust of the Memo is that the DOJ should pursue individuals within the corporation from the outset of the investigation and that a corporation's cooperation will be judged by whether the corporation provides all relevant information about culpable individuals. From my point of view, this Memo is important because it will have a significant impact on the way that corporations conduct internal investigations and on the corporate attorney-client privilege.</p>

<p><strong>Internal Investigations and Deferred Prosecution Agreements</strong></p>

<p>When a company is suspected of wrongdoing, the company will typically have its corporate counsel conduct an internal investigation. This involves reviewing thousands or even millions of documents, interviewing relevant employees and providing the company with reports about the interviews and results of the investigation. Because corporate counsel conducts the internal investigation, all of the results of the investigation are <a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/CaseLaw?cid=366047&%20cop=&native_id=366047&rest=1&collection=journals">protected </a>by the corporate attorney-client privilege. Importantly, corporations <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4748338318261666607">do not have</a> a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege against self-incrimination. Therefore, any documents in the company's possession that are not protected by the corporate attorney-client privilege must be produced to the government upon issuance of a subpoena.</p>

<p>In the past, in order to demonstrate cooperation with the government, corporations would waive their corporate-attorney client privilege and share the results of the internal investigation with the DOJ. But many <a href="http://elibrary.law.psu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1211&context=fac_works">commentators</a>, including myself, did not view the waiver of the corporate attorney-client privilege as a choice. It was more like a gun to the head; cooperate by waiving the privilege or face indictment. A criminal conviction or even an indictment could be devastating for a company because, in addition to the fine and criminal stigma, companies could lose the ability to contract with the government. Corporations were often rewarded for their cooperation with deferred prosecution agreements. When the DOJ enters into a deferred prosecution agreement with a corporation, the corporation pays a large fine and agrees to compliance measures. Over time, the use of deferred prosecution agreements became the DOJ's preferred method of dealing with corporations because it saved employees, investors and the public from the consequences of a criminal conviction. It also gave the DOJ the opportunity to change the corporate culture of an organization through stringent compliance measures. Further, it saved significant government resources because the corporation performed the internal investigation and there was no criminal trial. The strategy, however, subjected the DOJ to criticism that it was too soft on corporate crime. Critics do not believe that deferred prosecution agreements sufficiently deter corporations from engaging in corporate fraud. </p>

<p><strong>The Yates Memo's Focus on Individual Accountability</strong></p>

<p>With the dramatic rise in the use of deferred prosecution agreements and its accompanying criticism, the DOJ has received considerable pressure to pursue individual wrongdoers to demonstrate that they are tough on corporate crime. Thus, it is not surprising that the DOJ has publicly shifted to a policy that focuses on individual accountability. The Yates Memo states that both criminal and civil investigations should focus on individuals from the outset of the investigation. By focusing on individuals from the beginning, the DOJ argues that the investigation will be more effective and efficient because the DOJ will have a better chance of getting individuals to cooperate and provide information about upper level employees. It is certainly true that the DOJ has a better chance of employee cooperation if the DOJ conducts the investigation and talks directly with employees because the DOJ can offer immunity in exchange for testimony. If however, the DOJ continues to rely upon the corporation to conduct the internal investigation and then share the results with them, then it is hard to see how this policy changes anything. The Yates Memo also explains that the DOJ should not "agree to a corporate resolution that includes an agreement to dismiss charges against, or provide immunity for, individual officers or employees." In other words, corporations cannot negotiate for their employees to receive the same lenient treatment that corporations receive through deferred prosecution agreements. Many people will see this as a welcome change because they believe that corporations are protecting culpable employees.  </p>

<p>The real problem with the Memo is that it conditions cooperation on the corporation's willingness to hand over their culpable employees. This has serious implications for the corporate attorney-client privilege and unnecessarily pits employers against employees during internal investigations. These problems are inextricably linked.</p>

<p><strong>The Yates Memo Impact on the Corporate Attorney-Client Privilege</strong></p>

<p>The Yates Memo provides that, "in order to qualify for any cooperation credit, corporations must provide to the Department all relevant facts relating to the individuals responsible for the misconduct." Although the DOJ publicly changed its cooperation <a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-fraud/legacy/2012/11/14/response3-appx-f.pdf"> policy</a> so that it did not focus on waiver of the corporate attorney-client privilege, it also denied that waiver is or ever was a requirement for cooperation. The Yates Memo, however, puts the issue front and center once again. It states that, "[i]f a company seeking cooperation credit declines to ... provide the Department with complete factual information about individual wrongdoers, its cooperation will not be considered a mitigating factor." Without cooperation, the likelihood of a deferred prosecution agreement is low. It is not at all clear how a corporation would turn over interview memoranda and other documents created during the course of the investigation that point to an individual employee's wrongdoing and, at the same time, preserve the corporate attorney-client privilege. In order to provide that information to the DOJ, a corporation would either have to have non-attorneys conduct their internal investigations or waive the corporate attorney-client privilege. The former option is unrealistic given the fact that corporations do not possess the Fifth Amendment privilege. Therefore, it is hard to see how the Yates Memo is anything other than a return to the old days of the DOJ explicitly forcing corporations to waive the corporate attorney-client privilege in order to be eligible for cooperation credit and a deferred prosecution agreement.</p>

<p><strong>The Yates Memo's Negative Impact on Internal Investigations</strong></p>

<p>The Yates Memo is particularly problematic for employees during internal investigations. Even under the current rules, there is no protection for employees. Employees participate in interviews under the threat of termination for failure to cooperate and cannot later prevent the corporation from waiving the privilege due to their incriminating testimony. The typical employee would not understand that the corporation might choose to save itself by waiving the corporate attorney-client privilege and corporate counsel has never had an obligation to explain that before conducting the interview. Nor would the typical employee understand that waiver could mean that the employee would face criminal charges. Corporate counsel simply has to explain that she represents the corporation, that the interview is protected by the corporation's attorney-client privilege, that it is the corporation's privilege to waive, and that the employee is to keep the conversation confidential. An unsuspecting employee would go along with the interview because she does not believe that she did anything wrong. It is important to remember that not every criminal case involves clear employee wrongdoing, especially in heavily regulated industries. Unless there is already a grand jury subpoena requiring the testimony of the employee or the company has some reason to believe that the employee is involved in misconduct, the employee would not have her own counsel present to explain the potential implications of speaking with the corporation's counsel.  </p>

<p>The Yates Memo makes the internal investigation even more perilous for employees because it conditions cooperation on providing all of the relevant facts about individual misconduct. This makes every employee a potential bargaining chip. In the wake of the Yates Memo, every employee participating in an internal investigation should have her own lawyer to protect her interests. If every employee needs her own lawyer, however, the progress of an internal investigation will come to a screeching halt. At a minimum, corporate counsel needs to warn employees that the corporation may decide to cooperate with the government and provide any information obtained during the interview to the government which could potentially lead to criminal charges against the employee. Again, such a warning would make employees hesitate to speak with corporate counsel. Certainly, an employee who is culpable will not want to submit to an interview due to fear that any incriminating statements may be shared with the government. In such a situation, the employee may choose to lie to corporate counsel rather than lose her job for failing to cooperate with the investigation. Even employees who believe that they lack culpability may be afraid to submit to an interview with corporate counsel because if it turns out that their conduct was unlawful, the corporation has to waive the privilege and provide the relevant information to the government or face indictment. The logical "choice" for any corporation in that situation is to save itself.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.margaretdore.com/">Margaret Dore</a> argues that a new law to legalize assisted suicide is a recipe for elder abuse and family trauma, and that it will encourage people with years to live to throw away their lives...</p><strong>C</strong>alifornia has passed a bill to legalize physician-assisted suicide, which is scheduled to go into effect during 2016. "The End of Life Option Act" was sold as giving patients choice and control at the end of life. The bill, in fact, is about ending the lives of people who are not necessarily dying anytime soon and giving other people the "option" to hurry them along. The bill is a recipe for elder abuse and family trauma. </p>

                <p>The American Medical Association (AMA) defines physician-assisted suicide as occurring when "a physician facilitates a patient's death by providing the necessary means and/or information to enable the patient to perform the life-ending act."  The AMA gives the <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion2211.page">example</a>: "[A] physician provides sleeping pills and information about the lethal dose, while aware that the patient may commit suicide." Assisted suicide is a general term in which the assisting person is not necessarily a physician. Euthanasia, by contrast, is the direct administration of a lethal agent with the intent to cause another person's death. </p>

                <p>The AMA <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/ama-pas-euthanasia-serious-societal-risks.pdf">rejects assisted suicide and euthanasia</a> stating that they are "fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer, would be difficult or impossible to control, and would pose serious societal risks." </p>

                <p>In the last five years, four states <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/18-strengthened-laws_001.pdf">have strengthened</a> their laws against assisted suicide. Assisted suicide is no longer legal in New Mexico due to a <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/11/assisted-suicide-new-mexico-ruling-struck-higher-c/">court decision</a>. There are just three states where assisted suicide is legal: Oregon, Washington and Vermont. In a fourth state, Montana, case law gives doctors who assist a suicide a <a href="http://www.montanansagainstassistedsuicide.org/p/baxter-case-analysis.html">potential defense to a homicide charge</a>.<br />
                    <br />
                    The California bill applies to persons with a "terminal disease," which is <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/terminal-disease-definition.pdf">defined</a> as having a medical prognosis of less than six months to live. Such persons can, in reality, have years to live, with the more obvious reasons being <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/12-million-americans-misdiagnosed-each-year-study-says">misdiagnosis</a> and the fact that <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/terminal-uncertainty-w-o-ad.pdf">predicting life expectancy</a> is not an exact science. Doctors can sometimes be <a href="http://www.massagainstassistedsuicide.org/2012/09/john-norton-cautionary-tale.html">very wrong</a>. <br />
                    <br />
                    In Oregon and Washington, where assisted suicide laws use a nearly identical definition of <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/ca-or-wa-terminal-definitons.pdf">terminal disease</a>, terminality is determined <em>without treatment</em>. Consider, for example, Oregon resident Jeanette Hall who was diagnosed with cancer in 2000 and wanted to do assisted suicide. Her doctor convinced her to be treated instead. Twelve years later, she <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/12-jeanette-hall-aff_001.pdf">stated</a>: "This last July, it was 12 years since my diagnosis. If [my doctor] had believed in assisted suicide, I would be dead."  </p>

                <p><strong>Elder Abuse</strong></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/2011/mmi-elder-financial-abuse.pdf">Elder Abuse</a> is a problem throughout the United States. Perpetrators are often family members, some of whom feel entitled to the older person's assets. They often start out with small crimes, such as stealing jewelry and blank checks, before moving on to larger items or coercing victims to sign over deeds to their homes, change their wills or liquidate their assets. Victims may even be murdered.  </p>

                <p>In California, prominent elder abuse cases include: <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/02/06/43641.htm">Victorino Noval</a>, whose daughters allegedly told doctors to medically kill him, so as to obtain inheritances; and the "<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-widows-guilty-in-homeless-murders/">Black Widow</a>" murders in which two women insured the lives of homeless men and then killed them to collect the money. Paul Vados, a 73-year-old man, was one of the victims. </p>

                <p><strong>How the California Bill Works</strong></p>

                <p>The bill, <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/abx2-15-printed-10-7-15.pdf">ABX2-15</a>, has an application process to obtain the lethal dose, which includes a written <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/lethal-dose-request-form-w-2-witnesses.pdf">lethal dose request form with two required witnesses</a>. Once the lethal dose is issued by the pharmacy, there is no oversight over administration. No one, not even a doctor, is required to be present at the death.  <br />
                    <br />
                    ABX2-15 <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/lethal-dose-request-form-w-2-witnesses.pdf">allows</a> one of the two witnesses on the lethal dose request form to be the patient's heir, who will financially benefit from the patient's death. This is an extreme conflict of interest. Indeed, under California's Probate Code, similar conduct (an heir's acting as a witness on a will) can <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/ca-probate-code-6112-c.pdf">create a presumption</a> that the will was procured by "duress, menace, fraud or undue influence." ABX2-15, which specifically allows the patient's heir to be a witness on the lethal dose request form, does not promote patient choice. It invites duress, menace, fraud and undue influence.  </p>

                <p>Patients are also at risk due to the lack of oversight at the death. Alex Schadenberg, of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition, explains: <blockquote>"With assisted suicide laws in Washington and Oregon [and with ABX2-15], perpetrators can ... <a href="http://www.margaretdore.com/info/October_Letters.pdf">take a "legal" route</a>, by getting an elder to sign a lethal dose request. <em>Once the prescription is filled, there is no supervision over administration ... Even if a patient struggled, "who would know"</em> (Emphasis added)."</blockquote></p>

                <p>In 2011, the lack of oversight over administration of the lethal dose in Oregon prompted Montana State Senator Jeff Essmann to observe that studies claiming that Oregon's assisted suicide law is safe are invalid. During a legislative committee hearing, he <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/senator-essmann-sb-167.pdf">stated</a>: <blockquote>"[All] the protections end after the prescription is written. [The proponents] admitted that the provisions in the Oregon law would permit one person to be alone in that room with the patient. And in that situation, there is no guarantee that that medication is self-administered. So frankly, any of the studies that come out of the state of Oregon's experience are invalid because no one who administers that drug ... to that patient is going to be turning themselves in for the commission of a homicide."</blockquote></p>

                <p><strong>The Death Must Be Certified as "Natural"</strong></p>

                <p>ABX2-15 <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/443-18.pdf">states</a>, "Actions taken in accordance with this [act] shall not, for any purposes, constitute suicide, assisted suicide, homicide or elder abuse under the law." In Washington State, similar language, interpreted by the Department of Health, requires <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/wa-death-cert-instruct_001.pdf">Medical Examiners, Coroners and Prosecuting Attorneys</a> to certify a death as "Natural" if Washington's assisted suicide law was used. If California follows this interpretation, no matter what the facts, even a "murder for the money" will be certified as natural if the California bill is used. The significance will be a lack of transparency and a legal inability to prosecute criminal behavior. The opportunity will be created for the perfect crime.</p>

                <p><strong>Trauma</strong></p>

                <p>In 2012, a <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/family-members-traumatized-eur-psych-2012.pdf">study</a> was published addressing trauma suffered by people who witnessed a legal assisted suicide in Switzerland. The study found that one out of five family members or friends present at an assisted suicide were traumatized. These people "[E]xperienced full or sub-threshold PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) related to the loss of a close person through assisted suicide."</p>

                <p>Two of my clients, whose fathers signed up for the lethal dose in Washington and Oregon, suffered similar trauma. In the first case, one side of the family wanted the father to take the lethal dose, while the other side did not. The father spent the last months of his life caught in the middle and torn over whether or not he should kill himself. My client, his adult daughter, was severely traumatized. The father did not take the lethal dose and died a natural death. In the other case, it is not clear that administration of the lethal dose was voluntary. A man who was present told my client that the client's father had refused to take the lethal dose when it was delivered, stating: "You're not killing me. I'm going to bed."  But then took the lethal dose the next night when he was already intoxicated on alcohol. My client, although he was not present, was traumatized over the incident, and also by the sudden loss of his father.</p>

                <p><strong>How Did We Get Here?</strong></p>

                <p>ABX2-15 was passed by the California legislature via an <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/abx2-15-bill-history-highlighted.pdf">expedited process during a special session</a>. Many legislators debated the bill in religious, moral and personal terms; there was little debate over what the bill said and did. California Governor Jerry Brown, in a poignant letter explaining his decision to sign ABX2-15, continued this theme, stating that he had considered "<a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/brown-signing-letter-religion.pdf">theological and religious perspectives</a>." He also said "The <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/brown-signing-letter.pdf">crux of the matter</a> is whether the State of California should continue to make it a crime for a dying person to end his life..."  There is, however, <a href="https://choiceisanillusion.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/suicide-not-a-crime-in-california.pdf">no such crime</a> in California. Governor Brown did not understand what he was signing.</p>

                <p>California's new law is promoted as assuring choice and control. The bill instead creates new paths of elder abuse, which will be legally permissible. There will be family trauma.  Persons with years, even decades, to live will be encouraged to throw away their lives. In Vermont, which is the only other state to have enacted assisted suicide via a legislature, there is an active repeal movement. Californians should do the same. </p>

		<title>Hiding Behind the Veil of the &#034;Civil System&#034; to Perpetuate Inhumane Treatment Against Pregnant Women</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Makousse Ilboudo of <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2016 is the third author in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development. Makousse discusses the need for regulation to ensure fair and humane treatment of immigrant pregnant women in detention... </j:header> <strong>I</strong>n 2014 five-month pregnant <a href="http://fusion.net/story/5210/ice-says-pregnant-detainees-are-rare-we-found-40-in-1-facility-last-year/">Sugey Carrazco</a> was apprehended at a US border and held in a detention center in San Diego, Texas. She was seeking asylum from Mexico and escaping an ex-husband who assaulted her. She did not have a criminal history. She and others like her complained they were severely underfed and lacked basic medical treatment. Throughout her confinement, she did not have access to legal counsel.</p>

<p>Sadly, Sugey's story is not rare. There are hundreds of undocumented pregnant women who have not committed heinous crimes and yet are held in detention for months without access to legal representation or trial. According to <a href="http://www.ice.gov">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> ("ICE"), at least 559 pregnant women, apprehended while crossing the US border, were detained in six facilities throughout the US since 2012. During this time, they did not receive appropriate prenatal care.  Undocumented pregnant detainees have limited access to programming or activities appropriate for their conditions and they are subject to routine strip searches and are shackled during transport. </p>

<p>The worst part of their ordeal is that they do not have access to legal representation. Unless they can afford it, they are left alone without resources or legal venue to express their grief.  They are treated like criminals but, unlike criminal defendants, are denied the most fundamental right under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a>: assistance of court appointed counsel.</p>

<p>Under the main <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/iframe/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-9617.html">provision of the Immigration and Naturalization Act ("INA") § 292</a>, an individual in an immigration proceeding has the privilege of being represented (at no expense to the Government) by such counsel, as he or she shall choose. Thus, pregnant detainees like Sugey may retain private attorneys only if they can afford to or may seek to retain pro bono legal services if they can find one. Why, you ask?  Because the Sixth Amendment's "assistance of counsel" applies only to criminal defendants and immigration removals are civil, not criminal in nature. </p>

<p>Most persons in removal proceedings appear pro se and the lack of counsel has a pronounced negative impact on case outcomes. Now imagine being pregnant and not speaking the language&#8212;what impact these difficulties might have on case outcomes? In appearing pro se, the pregnant detainees face overwhelming barriers in presenting their cases. They are unfamiliar with the laws and procedures and yet are expected to present their cases for relief while facing opposition from government lawyers who specialize in the particulars and intricacies of immigration laws and regulations.  If they lose their case, some of them will be removed to a country where they, along with their newborn, may face persecution, torture or even death.</p>

<p>This system must change. More than 50 years ago, the US Supreme Court found in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/372/335">Gideon v. Wainwright</a> an "obvious truth" that "any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him." By doing so, the court recognized the need to provide assistance to those who could not obtain it themselves&#8212;a constitutional right to counsel for criminal defendants in order to help those most in need. This right is the backbone of the American judicial system. To that end, the promise of <span class="casename">Gideon</span> needs to be afforded to pregnant detainees as well because they are a group that is in need&#8212;the most vulnerable.</p>

<p>The Pregnant Immigrant Protection Act ("PIPA") as a proposed amendment to INA § 292 will mandate legal representation for all pregnant detainees to protect against mistreatment and ensure that the government carries out its immigration mandate with regard to these women in a way that warrants a fair outcome. Legal counsel will give them an advocate to ensure access to health services such as adequate and constant onsite prenatal care and visits to specialty clinics for conditions such as diabetes, repeated pregnancy losses or preterm births. Furthermore, such legislation is essential to educate the detainees on the different types of relief available and to ensure more humane treatment.</p>

<p>Despite the government's position that detaining these women will guarantee that they will appear in court and not leave town, they should still have access to an attorney to appear at those court appearances to make sure the process is fair. Even if they are found to be deportable, they at least would have had an attorney.</p>

<p>It is crucial to remember that the immigration detention system is a civil system and the pregnant women within this system are not awaiting criminal trials or threatening national security. Yet, they are treated worse than those in the criminal system. It is very hard to reconcile the idea of judicial fairness with treating pregnant women this way. The system guarantees legal representation for indigent murderers, rapists, terrorists, child abusers and serial killers yet, it turns its eyes away from defenseless pregnant women whose crimes are defined as "attempting to enter the US illegally." The government is trying to deport them&#8212;which may be the proper solution&#8212;but to do so without giving them legal counsel is unconscionable and against American values. It is not a matter of stopping deportations. It is a matter of treating the women fairly and humanely.</p>

<p>How can we allow a terrorist and murderer like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind behind the September 11 attacks, to have court appointed counsel and not extend the same right to a pregnant woman who faces removal to a place where she and her baby may be killed? Where is the justice in that? Pregnant women in immigration detention do not have the right to counsel; that is wrong, and something must be done about it. Without PIPA ensuring legal representation, they will continue to be mistreated.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Alyse A. Casale of <a href="http://www.avemarialaw.edu">Ave Maria School of Law</a>, discusses the recent Volkswagen scandal where the car maker installed software to alternate the measurement of emission of nitrogen oxide... </j:header></p>

<p><br />
<strong>I</strong>s this the end of Volkswagen? Since Friday, September 18, 2015 Volkswagen has been under fire for cheating emissions tests with complex software, and being responsible for producing forty times more pollution than is allocated. Volkswagen was forced to recall roughly 482,000 cars in the US because of this. Since the scandal broke, there are numerous agencies that are holding Volkswagen accountable for its actions. The investigation of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/environmental_law">Environment Protection Act</a> was driven by the International Council on Clean Technology, who helped influence Volkswagen to admit its actions. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www3.epa.gov">Environment Protection Agency</a> (EPA) asserts that Volkswagen installed defeat devices. These defeat devices cut nitrogen oxide pollution of the vehicles during certification tests that the cars had to undergo. Nitrogen oxide is a pollutant that can cause many health problems including: asthma, bronchitic and emphysema. The EPA is holding Volkswagen accountable for its use of the defeat devices, because avoiding clean air standards is not only an illegal practice, but also causes a threat to the public health. Volkswagen is continuing to be investigated further and the company could be fined per vehicle, which totals an estimated $18 billion dollars. The company can also be found to have breached the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/clean_air_act_caa">Clean Air Act</a>. Under Federal Law, the Clean Air Act regulates air emissions from sources that can either be mobile or stationary. The EPA is given the ability to establish <a href="http://www3.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/">National Ambient Air Quality Standards</a> in order to ensure that the health of the public is protected, and that there is an ability to regulate hazardous air pollutants, such as nitrogen oxide. </p>

<p>Volkswagen has now admitted to 11 million diesel cars that were equipped with the software that had the ability to cheat the emissions tests. Volkswagen has admitted that the vehicles sold within the US were programmed to sense when the emissions were being tested. There are different emissions regulations found in both Europe and the US. EU emissions regulations have set mandatory emission reduction targets for new cars. The EU uses this strategy in order to improve the fuel economy of cars that are sold throughout Europe. In 2004, the EU emissions regulations were specified in Directive 70/220/EEC, which was then replaced by Regulation 715/2007 (Euro 5/6). The European emissions standards define the acceptable exhaust emissions of new vehicles that are sold within member countries of the EU. Other emissions standards are found within the US. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has its own emissions standards. The EPA has to certify cars under its own standards. In other words, the CARB emissions standards are not enough to pass in order for a vehicle to be approved to go into commerce. The way that the company was able to cheat these types of emissions standards was by turning on special equipment to reduce the emissions. </p>

<p>Volkswagen may face lawsuits and criminal prosecutions in the US and abroad. California has started its own criminal investigation, and the US Department of Justice said that prosecutors are working with the US Environmental Protection Agency investigators.  </p>

<p>The center in Oxnard was a site where Volkswagen vehicles were put through tests to check if the vehicles were polluting as little as what was being advertised to the public, and to see if the vehicles met the emissions standards. Two law firms that are located in Southern California have cited the center in Oxnard, in lawsuits against Volkswagen. These law firms are pursuing damages for fraud and negligence in the Los Angeles Federal Court on behalf of owners of the Volkswagen diesel vehicles in California.<br />
  <br />
California is not the only state that is pursing lawsuits against Volkswagen. Florida Senator, Bill Nelson has asked the Federal Trade Commission to start looking for remedies for the owners of these Volkswagen vehicles. Attorney generals for New York, along with other states have said that they are forming groups to investigate the scandal. Several class-action lawsuits have been filed in the US and Canada and firms within the UK have also prepared cases on behalf of Volkswagen owners. Germany's government has said that they have started an investigation within their country into the company's conduct. The German government has also warned that this scandal that Volkswagen has created is jeopardizing the reputation of Germany's auto industry. Italy, France and South Korea are among other nations that are looking into the matter. </p>

<p>This scandal has also caused the Volkswagen stock to drop. Shares in other carmakers also took a fall including: Peugot, BMW, Daimler and Mercedes-Benz. Since the scandal's public revelation, not only has the CEO of Volkswagen resigned, but the Audi development chief Ulrich Hackenberg who was responsible for brand development in 2007 to 2013, and Wolfgang Hatz who ran the group's powertrain development from 2007 to 2011 are said to also be leaving in the future. </p>

<p>Stocks have fallen, people are being forced to leave their positions in the company, future fines and the future costs of the actions against them, Volkswagen can be facing the end of their company that has been in business since 1937. It is even possible that with all of the allegations and findings that are being discovered in this scandal will cause the company to go out of business.     </p>

		<title>King v. Burwell: ACA Destruction Denied, ACA Expansion Enabled</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.washington.edu/directory/Profile.aspx?ID=261&vw=pubs">Sallie Thieme Sanford</a> of University of Washington School of Law discusses  the decisive impact of the most recent Supreme Court ACA decision on the Marketplaces and also on state decisions regarding Medicaid expansion. She argues that the Court's decision in King v. Burwell not only averted the ACA's potential destruction but also places it on more solid footing in the face of ongoing legal, political and practical challenges.... </p>
<strong>T</strong>he November 1, 2015 beginning of the Affordable Care Act's third health insurance open enrollment season highlights the decisive impact of the US Supreme Court's most recent <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ148/html/PLAW-111publ148.htm">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) decision. In late June 2015, the court handed down <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/king-v-burwell/">King v. Burwell</a>, holding that the ACA authorizes the federal government to provide subsidies throughout the country to help low and middle-income people buy health insurance. These subsidies are a crucial linchpin of the ACA's efforts to expand access to health insurance and, by extension, to expand access to health care and good health.</p>

<p>Beyond saving the law, the court's 6-3 decision in <span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> solidifies it. It grounds the crucial subsidies in the statute's design rather than in an agency's regulatory choice. It highlights key policy bases for the ACA's framework. And it paves the way for access across the coverage continuum.</p>

<p><strong>Key Subsidies on the Federally Run Marketplace</strong></p>

<p>The ACA creates Marketplaces (also known as exchanges) where people who lack health insurance can buy private plans for themselves or their families and receive premium subsidies to do so if they are income-eligible. These subsidies are technically advanceable, refundable tax credits that generally go directly to the insurance company chosen by the purchaser; hence the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the federal agency that administers them.</p>

<p>Many states set up their own Marketplaces, as anticipated by the law, but about three dozen declined to do so and thus left the federal government as the fallback to run them through the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov">healthcare.gov</a> portal. Healthcare.gov and the dozen or so state-run portals also serve the important function of directing eligible people to state Medicaid programs, which cover low-income citizens to differing extents depending on the state.</p>

<p>For coverage effective 2015, about 8.8 million people purchased a plan through a federally run (rather than state-run) Marketplace. More than 85 percent of that number received an income-based premium subsidy. Subsidies are available to those who do not have other adequate insurance and whose incomes are between 100 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) and 400 percent FPL. In the continental US in 2015, that translated to $11,670&#8212;$46,640 for an individual and $23,850&#8212;$95,400 for a family of four. The average subsidy for a single person was $263 a month, bringing the average price of their subsidized coverage down to $101 per month.</p>

<p>The question in <span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> centered on language in the ACA that on its face seemed to make these crucial subsidies available only to people buying insurance on "an exchange established by the State." The challengers argued that a plain reading of that language allowed the IRS to provide subsidies only to those who lived in a state that set up its own Marketplaces. Those who lived in the 36 or so other states were not, the challengers argued, eligible for these premium subsidies.</p>

<p>Without subsidies, the individual plaintiffs (and millions of others) would find their insurance statutorily unaffordable and thus be exempt from the ACA's tax penalty for failing to maintain health insurance coverage. They would not have to have insurance, and they would not have to pay the tax penalty. With fewer people covered and predictably skyrocketing premiums, the ACA likely would have been upended by the resulting impacts on the health insurance markets, on health care providers, on patients and on employers.</p>

<p><strong>ACA Destruction Denied</strong></p>

<p>Chief Justice Roberts' atypically short and straightforward opinion in <span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> opens with a cogent summary of the policy bases for the ACA's "series of interlocking reforms." Functioning in tandem are three key reforms: the prohibition on pre-existing condition consideration; the requirement that most people maintain insurance; and the income-based premium subsidies for low and moderate-income purchasers.</p>

<p>The lack of all three together doomed state health reform efforts in the 1990s, the Roberts opined. Citing health economists, he raised the specter of a "death spiral" if the lack of subsidies makes insurance unaffordable for many and the expensively sick come to dominate the thus increasingly limited market for self-purchased insurance.</p>

<p>"Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them," Roberts wrote for the six-justice majority. "If at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter." Interpreting the ACA's meaning was complicated, he noted, by "more than a few examples of inartful drafting."</p>

<p>Roberts acknowledged that the plaintiffs made strong arguments about the plain, natural meaning of the words "established by the State." Statutory language is not to be construed in isolation, however, but must be viewed, he wrote, with an eye towards the context of the language and the structure of the statute as a whole. Considering the challenged phrase within the context and structure of the ACA compels the conclusion that subsidies are to be available nationwide.</p>

<p>For example, the language that the ACA uses to create the fallback of a federally run Marketplace creates an equivalency between the two types of Marketplaces. As a fallback, the federal government is to set up and run "such Exchange," applying the same statutory standards. Furthermore, the court concluded that many other provisions would make little or no sense if there were no subsidies to be had. For example, one ACA provision requires regular reports about the amount of subsidies provided on each Marketplace.</p>

<p>Many expected that the court would adopt the reasoning of underlying US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit decision and uphold the subsidies on the theory that when faced with an ambiguous statutory provision, courts should defer to the reasonable interpretation of the agency (here the IRS) tasked with implementing it. A long line of cases utilize this type of analysis, known as the "<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/chevron_deference">Chevron framework</a>" after the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/467/837/case.html">1984 Supreme Court decision in Chevron v. NRDC</a>. Roberts himself raised the possibility of this type of agency deference during oral argument. He asked the government's lawyer whether, if the court did defer to the IRS's interpretation here under a <span class="casename">Chevron</span> analysis, a subsequent administration could reach a different interpretation and revise the relevant regulations.</p>

<p>Ultimately, though, the court declined to apply <span class="casename">Chevron</span> to this issue. With billions of dollars and millions of insured lives at stake each year, interpretation of this central ACA provision "is not a case for the IRS," Roberts wrote. It is not a situation in which the court should defer to agency interpretation. "It is instead our task to determine the correct ruling." And the court determined that the IRS correctly applied the statutory framework in making subsidies available throughout the country.</p>

<p>With that analysis, the court foreclosed the possibility of a subsequent administration using regulatory revision to limit subsidies to the state-run Marketplaces. Doing so would instead require Congressional action to revise the statute, a much more complicated task, politically and practically.</p>

<p><strong>"Pure Applesauce"</strong></p>

<p>A notable aspect of <span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> is the dissent written by Justice Scalia and joined by two others. The dissent is both colorful and scathing. Scalia chastised the majority for engaging in "interpretive jiggery pokery" to reach a result that is "quite absurd." Of course statutory context matters, he wrote, but its use is "as a tool for understanding the terms of the law, not an excuse for rewriting them." Characterizing part of the majority's reasoning as "pure applesauce," he concluded by opining that as the court has not once, but now twice effectively redrafted the ACA, the statute should perhaps be called "SCOTUScare."</p>

<p><strong>ACA Expansion Enabled</strong></p>

<p>Whether called SCOTUScare or Obamacare, this historic health reform effort is now on much more solid ground. For the foreseeable future, premium subsidies are available throughout the country, regardless of whether the coverage is purchased through a federal or state-run Marketplace. A future administration could not undo <span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> by simply revising the IRS regulation at issue. </p>

<p>Millions more might also receive coverage through Medicaid in states that, post <span class="casename">King-v. Burwell</span>, adopt the ACA's option to expand this joint federal-state program to cover all uninsured citizens with incomes up to 138 percent FPL. Under the ACA, the federal government now picks up all of the costs of this "expansion population" with the federal contribution ultimately reducing to a 90 percent match. As of October 2015, 20 states (including populous Florida and Texas) had not expanded. With subsidies secure for those who purchase insurance on the Marketplaces, there may well be increased pressure on these states to adopt the expansion.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court in its 2012 <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a> [PDF] decision made the expansion optional for the states. This led to the current anomalous situation whereby millions of adults in non-expansion states are not eligible for Medicaid but make too little to qualify for premium subsidies (which are available only to those between 100 percent&#8212;400 percent FPL).  Calls to bring the very low-income into the coverage continuum would have had much less force in the face of a collapsing individual market.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2015, <a href="http://dhss.alaska.gov/dpa/pages/medicaid/default.aspx">Alaska expanded its Medicaid program</a>, and <a href="http://dphhs.mt.gov/medicaidexpansion">Montana </a> prepared to do so. <span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> also keeps alive the possibility of "Red State" or "private option" Medicaid expansion in some states. This type of alternate program, first adopted by Arkansas, depends on drawing down federal premium subsidies that would otherwise be available to a subset of the low-income population (those with incomes between 100 percent FPL and 138 percent FPL). So, although <span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> was not about Medicaid, it indirectly supports that major federal-state program.</p>

<p>Another consequence of the decision might well be in the nature of the Marketplaces. An early version of the ACA contemplated a single federal Marketplace. Pressure for more state-level control prevailed to shape the final legislation with its presumption of state-run Marketplaces and a federal fallback. Somewhat ironically, state-level opposition to the ACA has led to more federal control. Now, with the subsidies secure, more states might shift some or all of the functions of their Marketplaces to the federal government. In the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/06/hawaii-health-insurance_n_7524426.html">summer of 2015 Hawaii did so</a>. Many of the dozen or so states that continue to run their own Marketplaces face <a href="http://khn.org/morning-breakout/nearly-half-of-state-run-health-exchanges-face-financial-woes/">technical and financial challenges</a> that make the federal fallback at least somewhat appealing.</p>

<p>The fierce political and policy debates over the ACA are sure to continue. There will be continued pressure to both refine the law and to repeal it. A few important legal cases are still pending.

The major legal threat to the ACA is gone, and with its resolution this health reform effort is on much surer footing.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.utoledo.edu/law/faculty/fulltime/bdavis.html">Benjamin G. Davis</a> of the <a href="http://www.utoledo.edu/law/">University of Toledo College of Law</a> discusses the recent decision in <span class="casename">Meshal v. Higgenbotham</span>...</p>
<strong>I</strong>n the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6069091174448637246">Meshal</a> <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-court-dismisses-suit-by-us-citizen-alleging-constitutional-violation-by-us-agents-in-africa.php">decision</a> on Friday, October 23, 2015, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit found (as did the district court below) what FBI agents allegedly did to an American citizen abroad quite troubling. Yet by a majority, no relief was granted under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4836406244398815814">Bivens</a> due to the law enforcement action being tied to the national security space and that this happened outside the US.</p>

<p>The Court of Appeals said it hesitated to extend <span class="casename">Bivens</span> relief in this setting and left it to the Supreme Court to decide whether <span class="casename">Bivens</span> should reach this space.<br />
As long ago as 1957 in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2412865658294709561">Reid v. Covert</a>, the Supreme Court said that the US Government cannot do to American citizen abroad what it cannot do to them domestically, to wit:<blockquote>"At the beginning, we reject the idea that, when the US acts against citizens abroad, it can do so free of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">Bill of Rights</a>. The US is entirely a creature of the Constitution. Its power and authority have no other source. It can only act in accordance with all the limitations imposed by the Constitution. When the Government reaches out to punish a citizen who is abroad, the shield which the Bill of Rights and other parts of the Constitution provide to protect his life and liberty should not be stripped away just because he happens to be in another land. This is not a novel concept. To the contrary, it is as old as government. It was recognized long before Paul successfully invoked his right as a Roman citizen to be tried in strict accordance with Roman law."</blockquote> As quoted above, <span class="casename">Reid v. Covert</span> tells the ordinary American citizen what they should expect from their government when they are abroad. Now some might seek a narrow reading of <span class="casename">Reid</span>, or maybe some would emphasize the narrowing of domestic <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process</a> rights over the past years (with such things as the various urgency exceptions to things like Miranda rights being read), but whatever those analyses of court decisions may imply about what the ordinary American citizen should expect of their government domestically, they do not undercut the principle of <span class="casename">Reid</span> that when the US acts against citizens abroad, the Bill of Rights applies.</p>

<p>Yet, even in the current narrow vision of the Bill of Rights protections, the District Court and the Court of Appeals were quite troubled by what happened to this American citizen. The obvious reason for the courts being quite troubled is what is described as repugnant violence of the American sovereign on an ordinary American citizen who just happens to be abroad.  For example, the threat to send Meshal to Egypt reveals that the intention was to have him tortured there or the threat to send him to Israel was to have him killed there. These types of actions violate with alacrity US treaty obligations under the <a href="http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/catcidtp/catcidtp.html">UN Convention Against Torture and other forms of Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a>. Moreover, given this intention of the US government, any diplomatic assurances given by Egypt or Israel when this American citizen would be sent there would be profoundly suspicious. It would be patently clear to the Egyptian and Israeli counterparts what the US Government wanted to be done to this person by these foreign governments&#8212the US government wanted this American citizen to be tortured or to be killed by the foreign government. The machinations of the American national security establishment are revealed to the light of day here, and the formulaic defenses of these practices of extraordinary rendition are revealed to be what they are&#8212legal mumbo jumbo to mask an intent to have people tortured and killed in foreign lands.  </p>

<p>What is of interest and somewhat new this time is these threats are not made by the US intelligence services or the US military but by the FBI, the ostensible "good guys" in the interrogation inquiries over the past years as presented in the testimony of persons such as Ali Soufan, the former FBI interrogator. They have contrasted their approaches with the approaches described in both the <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/torturingdemocracy/documents/20081211.pdf">2008 Senate Armed Services Committee</a> [PDF] and 2014 partially declassified Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reports on the medieval torture done since 9/11 in conjunction with 54 countries around the world. What a thin mask even the good guys seem to be wearing as they assert the state's ability to inflict violence on both foreign and American citizens. It is beyond the scope of this note to go in detail here, but these practices based on guidelines confirm the good sense of the American Psychological Association this summer to ban psychologists from participating in national security interrogations. The psychologists understand the techniques used on detainees in the process of rendition, detention and interrogation (not just the interrogation techniques) form a whole aimed at causing debility, dependence and dread in the target. These techniques have their antecedents in the czarist police, the Soviet NKVD and Soviet KGB and have been well-known since at least 1961 in the US as well as their tendency to cause false confessions of the kind seen at the Stalinist show trials of the 1930s. Taking as a whole Meshal's experience from his capture to release, one can see from the description of the rendition, detention and interrogation process to which he was subjugated, these Soviet era tactics to engender debility, dependence and dread were being used on this American citizen by the US government.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court in <span class="casename">Reid</span> spoke on the Bill of Rights protection for American citizens extending abroad and these <span="case name">Meshal</span> courts are quite troubled by what the American government did to this American citizen. At the same time both the District Court and the Court of Appeals go timid on us by not being willing to provide a <span class="casename">Bivens</span> remedy for an ordinary American citizen. So what is being said is basically an American citizen has constitutional rights, but the courts will not provide a remedy if the US government violates them, invokes national security and the American citizen happens to be abroad when the weight of American state violence comes down on her. As the Court of Appeals notes, Congress has not passed any law that protects an American citizen from American state violence abroad. Put succinctly, if an American citizen gets to the US court to challenge that state violence, the US courts will not provide a remedy to an American citizen for the egregious violations of the Bill of Rights by the American government abroad. </p>

<p>This approach of the District Court and the Court of Appeals is in direct violation of two of the most elementary rules of international law. The Draft Articles on <a href="http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/rsiwa/rsiwa.html">Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts</a> codify, <em>inter alia</em>, two customary international law rules that state.</p>

<blockquote>(Article 31  Reparation): 1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act. 2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State. In addition under (Article 32 - Irrelevance of internal law) "The responsible State may not rely on the provisions of its internal law as justification for failure to comply with its obligations under this part."</blockquote>
The judicial power is a power of the US and as such, the judicial power is called to not leave the American citizen abroad with no remedy for this kind of abuse by the US government. To be charitable, possibly due to the pitiful manner in which international law is taught in the US, the lawyers arguing the case or the judges and their clerks deciding the case were ignorant of these rules of international law. But, even those only steeped in US foreign relations law should be expected to have come across <span class="casename">Reid</span> in their research or in their law school textbook&#8212;if they took such a class.

<p>For the millions of Americans who travel abroad, what should they now do?</p>

<p>Americans who live, work or travel abroad should consider now taking out kidnapping insurance, not for some foreign kidnapper risk, but for the risk of kidnapping by their own government&#8212if such insurance exists. It would be through the payment on that insurance policy they might through private ordering assure as a matter of contract their compensation for the violations done by the US government given these courts inability to shape a constitutional remedy for that American citizen. The kidnap risk incurred is not from the local government and includes the threat of torture, the threat of actual transfer across national boundaries without any consideration to the legality of that (put another way, rendition, abduction, without extradition of the kind described in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6103279683071618777">Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain</a> in 1992 as not being a problem), and the threat of rendition to torture in places like Egypt or Syria as was done to foreigners such as Al-Libi, Al-Masri and Al-Arar by the self-same US Government.</p>

<p>If the facts of this case and the court decisions do not bother the ordinary American reader, then I submit the ordinary reader has lost their way. Implicit is the sentiment Meshal must have been a bad character for being caught up in all this, yet in the past 60 years how many times have we seen persons being identified as bad persons by the government and then that designation found out later to be a complete fabrication? Might I just suggest the name of Martin Luther King, Jr. and his travails with J. Edgar Hoover as the head of the FBI? Or the infiltration of civil rights and student movements in the past with the intention to discredit those actors in those movements? Or how about the infiltration of movements like Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street, Muslim mosques and other citizen groups we have seen in the most recent years? The American government national security space over and over demonstrates it is perfectly willing to use its vast capacity for state violence against American citizens and the courts tell us in <span="casename">Meshal</span> if they are abroad that American citizen is out of luck.</p>

<p>If these facts about an American citizen's treatment by her government do bother the reader, would your view be the same if the name was Al-Libi, Al-Masri or Al-Arar? For those cases of non-Americans being treated worse by the American government have been the subject of discussion for years with our courts demonstrating just as little willingness to provide them a remedy for the treatment done to them.  </p>

<p>If all lives matter then why did Al-Libi's death in Gaddhafi's prison after having been rendered by us to Egypt where he was tortured, Al-Masri's rendition to torture in Cobalt or Al-Arar's rendition to torture in Syria also not matter enough for our courts to care to give them a remedy? Such a remedy is demanded by international law as described above.</p>

<p>If human rights have any meaning, it is all lives matter. If such meaning includes recognizing that there is state oppression and confronting it as a human rights struggle, then we should highlight the specificities of certain kinds of state oppression. If the state oppression affects a subgroup of Americans, then it is to be highlighted&#8212so black lives matter. If it affects American citizens abroad, it is to be highlighted&#8212Expatriate American lives matter. If it affects foreigners, it is to be highlighted&#8212foreigners "with names that sound funny to some people" lives matter.</p>

<p>All lives matter or black lives matter are not mutually exclusive concepts. What is problematic is to undergird either of those concepts with a blindness to kinds of state oppression of persons that attack human dignity, that the Constitution's Bill of Rights only modestly vindicates, and that human rights law, humanitarian law and international criminal law remind us are inalienable to human dignity.</p>

<p>Yet, once again, we see the jurisdiction to adjudicate through the judicial power blinks before the national security state. Where does this judicial power find the source for this timidity before the egregious acts of state violence on the individual citizen? Does the citizen's name have to be Bill Miller instead of Amir Meshal for judges' consciences to perk up to impose a remedy?</p>

<p>I fear we are in the "better them than me" mode of being indifferent to the state violence on others as long as it does not come over to one's own life. Truly then, the classic divide and conquer strategy is so ingrained in us, we should never be surprised again why oppression persists.</p>

<p>We are not Dred Scott with no rights&#8212and particularly human rights as vindicated through the Constitution&#8212to be recognized by our government either when we are here or overseas.</p>

		<title>Can&#039;t Complain: How Post-Conviction Procedure Rules Inhibit Truth Finding</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.laylawoffice.com/daniel-wright.html">Daniel J. Wright</a> of the <a href="http://www.danielwrightlaw.com">Law Offices of Daniel Wright</a> discusses how post-conviction procedure rules hinder the ability to seek truth in faulty sentences... </p><strong>T</strong>hose accused of a serious crime are entitled by the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> to the United States Constitution to representation by an attorney. This right extends in most states not only to the initial trial, but also to at least one level of direct review. <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/dccc.pdf">In many states</a> [PDF], more than half of the criminal docket is handled by public defenders or attorneys appointed by the court to defend the indigent. </p>

                <p>Following a conviction and appeal, there may or may not be further review of the judgment by way of a permissive appeal to the state&#8217;s highest court. Review is normally discretionary, and the highest courts emphasize that they are not merely courts of &#8220;<a href="http://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/justice-sotomayor-and-the-supreme-courts-certiorari-process">error correction</a>.&#8221; </p>

                <p>But some kinds of errors escape this form of review, and are only correctable later by way of post-conviction proceedings. These would include <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/466/668/case.html">allegations that the defendant did not receive effective assistance of counsel</a>, for example, either at trial or on direct review. In some states, post-conviction representation is offered through the public defender's office to prisoners, just as at trial. For example, Maryland offers post-conviction counsel to defendants through the public defender's office.</p>

                <p>Typically, post-conviction cases involve the most serious crimes&#8212;murder, armed robbery, burglary, and so on&#8212;and prisoners with the longest sentences. This is because prisoners with shorter sentences parole out of the system before their post-conviction cases can be heard by the courts. Non-violent criminals in Maryland are generally eligible for <a href="http://www.dpscs.state.md.us/aboutdpscs/FAQmpc.shtml">parole</a> after serving 25 percent of their sentence. Even defendants convicted of a crime of violence are parole eligible after serving half their sentences. However, the most serious crimes can result in life sentences, life without parole (LWOP), or a term of years stretching past the life expectancy of the defendant (death-in-prison, or DIP). A defendant convicted of murder in Maryland typically receives a life sentence, plus another twenty years consecutive if a handgun was used in the crime. A second-degree murder or carjacking defendant may receive a sentence of more than a hundred years.</p>

                <p>LWOP and DIP sentences are <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/141027_iachr_racial_disparities_aclu_submission_0.pdf">disproportionately</a> [PDF] applied to minorities.The defendants typically are between the <a href="http://fairsentencingofyouth.org/the-issue/advocacy-resource-bank/racial-inequality-in-youth-sentencing/">ages of 18 and 30</a> and normally lack a strong educational background. They seldom come from families able to afford private legal representation.</p>

                <p>Overworked public defenders often meet with their clients only a few times before trial. This leads to a hands-off approach by many defendants. They allow the attorney to do his job and are not actively involved in their defense. Likewise, when a direct appeal is taken from a trial court's judgment, it is not unusual for the appellate attorney to develop the arguments and draft the brief without substantial input from the defendant, who may be locked up in a prison hundreds of miles away from his attorney. Communication can be difficult in both directions. Post-conviction proceedings can be equally as difficult.</p>

                <p>When all the appeals are exhausted, and the initial post-conviction proceeding is completed, the defendant for the first time is faced with the reality that he alone is now responsible for any efforts to overturn his conviction and win his freedom. At this point, the defendant's attorney may for the first time hand over the file. A freedom of information request for police files may take a year or more and may be prohibitively expensive.</p>

                <p>Legally, however, the situation is most difficult. The defendant has already been convicted and finished a post-conviction proceeding. Any further review is discretionary at best. Judges are often very reluctant to grant post-conviction relief. In states where judges are elected, public opinion often supports a tough-on-crime approach that is anything but defense-friendly.</p>

                <p>Nevertheless, when the defendants review their transcripts and court papers, sometimes years after the trial, errors often are revealed. Sometimes this is because the prisoner&#8212;with time on his hands&#8212;spends months or even years educating himself on the law and reviewing the details of his case. The prisoners sometimes form study groups to help each other learn. Maximum-security prisoners are not always let out of their cell every day, and often have limited access to a law library. For them to learn the applicable law of their case can take years. And yet, even under the horrific circumstances of America's prisons, many do just that. </p>

                <p>Jarmal Johnson was incarcerated for more than 16 years when he discovered that he had been convicted of a crime for which he had not been indicted by the grand jury. He was indicted for Attempted Murder, but convicted of Assault with Intent to Murder, a different crime with different elements. Maryland's highest court ultimately <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15965428322637901930">vacated the conviction</a>. His prior attorneys had simply not noticed the discrepancy.</p>

                <p>Edwin Pile faced three trials. One trial resulted in a hung jury, the second judgment was overturned on appeal, and the third resulted in a conviction. He had different lawyers. After 20 years of incarceration, his personal review of his docket records revealed that a judgment of acquittal had been entered in the first trial to his crime of conviction in the third&#8212;a clear <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Double Jeopardy</a> violation. This only came to light, however, because his attorney died and the firm sent him his file. He reviewed all the papers from his trial for the first time almost two decades after his conviction.</p>

                <p>The case of John Artis involved faulty jury instructions concerning the definition of reasonable doubt. Mr. Artis fought for more than 20 years against the trial judge's instructions to the jury concerning reasonable doubt. The court has now conceded that the instructions were erroneous, yet at every turn in the road over the course of more than a decade of appeals the defendant faced resistance, disbelief and stonewalling over his claims of error, from both the prosecutors, the courts, and even his own court-appointed attorney.</p>

                <p>Some prisoners benefit from a change in the law. Prior to 1981, courts in Maryland routinely informed jurors that the judge's instructions were merely advisory and not binding. The jurors were free to disregard the instructions of the judge. This situation was overturned in the early 1980s and made <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=merl+unger&hl=en&as_sdt=4,21&case=2070324801111071004&scilh=0">retroactive</a> about 30 years after that. State prosecutors tried to argue, for example, that Jarmal Johnson had waived his right to object to being convicted of a crime for which he wasn't indicted.</p>

                <p>Similarly, prosecutors sometimes try to raise high evidentiary bars to post conviction defendants. Rules may require defendants to produce transcripts of trials when files have long since been discarded. The file of Edwin Pile was missing from the clerk's office, yet state officials tried to have the case dismissed because a transcript was not compiled.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2244">Federal rules</a> require an inmate to bring a post-conviction challenge to a state court conviction within 12 months. This is an unrealistic time frame given the delays in state courts and the reality that prisoners rarely will have their paperwork available to them in that time, yet such a challenge can normally only be made by a prisoner on his own.</p>

                <p>Joseph Miller was convicted of armed robbery in 1988 and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole under Maryland's repeat offender statute. A review of his case, however, showed that his court appointed attorney had not made an opening statement, not made a closing statement and failed to ask a single question of any witness. The situation came to light more than 25 years after the initial trial. Maryland rules, however, impose higher legal standards on attempts to reopen post conviction proceedings and prevent them altogether if an inmate hasn't filed within the first ten years.</p>

                <p>The legal system cannot be faulted for giving priority to defendants facing trial for the first time. However, post-conviction procedures impose an array of rules that, however well intended, prevent a court from seeking the truth. The reality is that often an inmate's own efforts years after the fact will uncover errors at his trial. For a variety of reasons these efforts are not likely to occur soon after the initial trial. Concepts such as waiver and time limits on filing petitions (such as 12 months at the federal level) fail to reflect the grim reality that errors are made at trial, often significant errors, and they cannot necessarily be brought to light in the same time frame as a small claims case or landlord-tenant matter. These rules are in derogation of the truth seeking function of the court, yet are imposed on inmates who are often seeking review of life-without-parole or death-in-prison sentences.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.washington.edu/directory/Profile.aspx?ID=261&vw=pubs">Sallie Thieme Sanford</a> of University of Washington School of Law discusses the birth and growth of Medicare and Medicaid. She argues that in this, their 50th year, health care's fraternal twins are coming more to resemble each other, with Medicaid adopting some of the characteristics of its historically more favored twin, with both facing some similar challenges and with each flexing its <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/34/7/1084.abstract">financial muscle</a> to support health system changes...</p>
<strong>M</strong>edicare and Medicaid are 50. They were signed into law on July 30, 1965, and began to be implemented&#8212;with what in retrospect seems surprising rapidity&#8212;in the following year. As remarked upon in an excellent <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/news/medicare50.htm">Yale Law School symposium</a>, these extremely influential health care programs are as fraternal twins.</p>

<p>As with fraternal twins everywhere, they were born together, and created in the same context. Yet from the beginning, as Professor Abbe Gluck notes, they have had "<a href="http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1223&context=yjhple">distinct personalities and life stories</a>."  Both have improved the lives of many, many millions of people and made ours a better society. They have done so in different, though overlapping health care spheres.</p>

<p>In common with many fraternal twins, in their adulthood they are coming more to resemble each other. Medicaid is adopting some of the characteristics of its historically more favored sibling. While they retain their separate identities, both face similar questions about how they will develop in the future in the face of competing political visions, budgetary pressures, changing demographics and health care advances. Each is also flexing its financial muscle in support of overarching health system reforms.</p>

<p>This essay first considers the circumstances of Medicare and Medicaid's birth as part of the Great Society push. Next, it summarizes their growth over the decades as they expanded to address evolving health care challenges.  And finally, it assesses where these prominent American fraternal twins stand today.</p>

<p><strong>Turning first to the circumstances of their birth.</strong> Whether and how to create a universal health care system has been a <a href="https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/5-02-13-history-of-health-reform.pdf">perennial issue</a> [PDF] in the United States, dating back to the early 1900s. Theodore Roosevelt championed the cause and FDR considered including health coverage as part of the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v66n1/v66n1p1.html">original Social Security Act</a>. President Truman sent a <a href="http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/index.php?pid=483&st=&st1=">bill</a> to Congress that would cover all Americans, with subsidies for the poor. It did not get far, but in 1960 Congress passed the <a href="http://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/reports/rpt263.pdf">Kerr-Mills Act</a> [PDF], which gave federal financial support to states for programs for medically indigent seniors. Not all the states adopted it, though, and a substantial portion of the funds went to those in wealthier, Northern states.</p>

<p>In 1964, with the Democrats holding a decisive majority in Congress, <a href="http://kff.org/medicare/video/medicare-and-medicaid-at-50/">President Johnson pushed for a broader program</a>. The health care needs of the elderly were increasingly prominent, as most lacked sound health insurance. A serious illness could bring financial devastation.</p>

<p>President Johnson's initial plan was only for those 65 and older and for coverage only of seniors' hospital bills. That became Medicare Part A. As the bill progressed, coverage of physician bills was added as well. That became Medicare Part B. These were both federally financed programs. In a bid for further support, <a href="http://kff.org/medicare/video/medicare-and-medicaid-at-50/">key lawmakers</a> added another program to the legislation&#8212;support for Americans on welfare. That became Medicaid. It built on the earlier Kerr-Mills program to provide federal financial support for state programs to cover certain populations of low-income people.</p>

<p>These were what are sometimes termed in the academic literature the "<a href="https://www.unf.edu/uploadedFiles/aa/coas/cci/publication%20Dimensions%20of%20Poverty.pdf">deserving poor</a>" [PDF]&#8212;here low-income people over age 65, some of the disabled and some families with children on welfare. In support of these state programs, the federal government would provide <a href="http://kff.org/about-kaiser-commission-on-medicaid-and-the-uninsured/">matching funds</a> of between 50-75 percent depending on the wealth of the state. So, whereas Medicare was a "social insurance program" with relatively uniform administration by the federal government, Medicaid was "welfare medicine" with an emphasis on <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/34/7/1084.abstract">state-based discretion</a>.</p>

<p>From its inception, Medicare has influenced the health care system as a whole. For example, in 1965 about 1,000 of our nation's hospitals <a href="http://kff.org/medicare/video/medicare-and-medicaid-at-50/">were racially segregated</a>. If hospitals wanted to receive Medicare payments, they had to desegregate. They did, in short order. And not just in regard to patients, but also for physicians and staff. Along with the Civil Rights Act, Medicare has been an important factor in improving the health care environment for black Americans, and not only those over 65.</p>

<p>Both twins have grown steadily over the decades. This growth has encompassed both who is covered and also what types of health care services are included. Medicare's development has been the more staid of the two. From the beginning, it has been quite popular and enjoyed a high degree of political support.</p>

<p>In 1972, Medicare was expanded to cover people with serious permanent disabilities. They would be covered after a two-year waiting period. Also added that year was immediate coverage for people with end-stage renal disease. One of the key drivers of this expanded coverage was an invention a few years prior at the University of Washington. In the 1960's, physicians and scientists had developed what came to be known as the <a href="http://scholarship.richmond.edu/jolpi/vol13/iss3/3/">Scriber shunt</a>, which allowed for routine kidney dialysis. Loss of kidney function was no longer a death sentence&#8212;as long as there was a way to cover the cost of the treatment.</p>

<p>Several decades later, Congress addressed one of the gaping holes in Medicare coverage. Since its inception, the program had not covered out-patient prescription medications.  And, in light of so many advances in pharmaceuticals, prescription medications were increasingly important to the health of seniors and increasingly a source of financial difficulty.  In 2003, a Republican Congress passed and President Bush signed into law the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ173/html/PLAW-108publ173.htm">Medicare Modernization Act</a>. This established Part D prescription drug coverage, a subsidized program administered through private companies. This law also provided a boost for private Medicare managed care plans, now known as Medicare Advantage plans. These continue to be a popular choice among beneficiaries, with <a href="http://kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-2015-spotlight-enrollment-market-update/">nearly a third now enrolled in MA plans</a>.</p>

<p>While Medicare was not a focus on the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/where-can-i-read-the-affordable-care-act/">Affordable Care Act of 2010</a>, this major law did impact the program in various ways. For example, the ACA expands Medicare coverage by eliminating out-of-pocket costs for preventative care, such as mamographies and colonoscopies. In addition, it also progressively closes the Part D donut hole, providing discounts for heavy users of prescription medications.</p>

<p>If Medicare has been the staid and steady twin, Medicaid is the <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yjhple/vol15/iss1/11/">scrappy</a> one. It has not enjoyed the same degree of affection and support as Medicare and has seen repeated calls for significant cuts. Despite that, it also has <a href="http://kff.org/medicaid/timeline/medicaid-timeline/">grown over the years</a>, including significant expansion under Republican leadership.</p>

<p>After its enactment in 1965, not all states signed up right away.  Medicaid was not available throughout the country until 1982, when the last state, Arizona, joined the program.  From its inception, Medicaid has differed from state to state.  While the program has always had key mandatory elements in terms of populations to be covered and services to be offered, it has also allowed states a great deal of flexibility in terms of optional populations and services, as well as financing structures.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, Congress expanded Medicaid to require coverage of many more pregnant women and children.  This was prompted, in significant part, by concerns of Southern governors about persistently high rates of infant mortality in their states.  Other changes expanded coverage for services for people with disabilities, especially in the areas of home and community-based care.</p>

<p>In the late 1990s with the enactment of the<a href="http://www.medicaid.gov/chip/chip-program-information.html"> Children's Health Insurance Program</a>, more children in low-wage households received health insurance. In addition, to varying degrees throughout the country, states tweaked their programs to provide coverage of low-income parents of young children. However, low-income adults under age 65 who were not pregnant, not disabled and not the parent of a young child generally remained ineligible for Medicaid coverage no matter how low their income.</p>

<p>Until, that is, the Affordable Care Act of 2010. As written, the law requires all states to expand their Medicaid populations to cover all otherwise uninsured citizens with incomes below 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. Per the ACA, the federal government will cover 100 percent of the cost of the expansion population for the first few years, ratcheting down ultimately to 90 percent.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-393">2012 decision</a>, the Supreme Court effectively made this expansion an option for the states. Thus, each state could decide whether to cover this new population of low-income adults. Washington State was one of the ones that expanded its Medicaid program as soon as allowed under the ACA; Alaska is the most recent, with signups beginning in the fall of 2015 to be effective January 2016. Thus far, about 30 states have established expanded Medicaid under the ACA's terms.</p>

<p><strong>Now entering their 50th year, these programs have immensely improved the health of millions.</strong> <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleId=2411288&guestAccessKey=bcf5e21a-1163-4fb4-8a55-c49b488977d7">Medicare today</a> covers about 46 million seniors and 9 million younger disabled people. As of today, about 66 million people nationally are in the Medicaid program. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/opinion/medicare-and-medicaid-at-50.html?_r=1&mtrref=undefined&gwh=5F7634B952BC4145F24197E971DF7942&gwt=pay&assetType=opinion">Together</a>, these programs now cover about 111 million people, or about 1 in 3 Americans, including 10 million dual-eligible people covered by both programs. By 2025, the total is projected to reach 139 million people. Spending on the programs accounts for nearly a quarter of the federal budget and comprises more than 40 percent of hospital revenues.</p>

<p>The twins are rightly credited with improving the health of the nation's citizens. Medicare has been a huge success in improving life expectancy, enhancing health status and reducing poverty among the elderly. It has also been a key driver in helping to modernize our health care system. In recent years, the rate of growth of Medicare spending slowed dramatically, helping to put the program on more secure financial footing. In both Medicare and Medicaid, spending per enrollee has been <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhpr1411701">increasing at a slower rate</a> than in private insurance, though there are concerns about the growth trajectory into the future.</p>

<p>Medicaid's direct impacts are felt across the age spectrum. Without Medicaid, there likely would not be a modern nursing home industry.  Medicaid is the <a href="http://kff.org/medicaid/report/medicaid-and-long-term-services-and-supports-a-primer/">primary payer</a> for long-term care services. The program also covers about one in three of the nation's children and nearly half of the childbirths. And it has been a lifeline for many citizens with disabilities. </p>

<p><strong>Looking to their future, these fraternal twins are coming more to resemble each other and face some of the same challenges.</strong> Medicaid is adopting some of the key positive characteristics of its historically more favored sibling. It is evolving, in some parts of the country more than others, from an often stigmatized welfare program for some of the nation's poor into the nation's primary insurer for low-wage families. In expansion states, it functions in many ways more as a social insurance program and no longer leaves out major categories of low-income citizens.</p>

<p>As is Medicare, Medicaid is flexing its financial muscle to promote changes that aim to improve health outcomes while reigning in unnecessary spending. These include support for new payment models related to "value-based purchasing" and for new delivery systems, including medical homes and accountable care organizations. Both Medicare and Medicaid face similar questions about how they will develop into the future given competing political visions, budgetary pressures, health care advances, and changing demographics.</p>

<p>Back on July 30, 1965, when <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/history/lbjstmts.html#medicare">President Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law</a>, he noted that the law's passage showed we were not a nation "indifferent to despair."  "No longer," he said, "will older Americans be denied the healing miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and destroy [their] savings" or those of their families. He predicted that these programs would improve "the health and medical services for Americans of all ages."  In the 50th year of these fraternal twins, and in the face of their ongoing development challenges, President Johnson's prediction has been borne out.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST guest columnist <a href="http://www.law.umich.edu/FacultyBio/Pages/FacultyBio.aspx?FacID=dancrane">Daniel Crane</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.umich.edu/Pages/default.aspx">University of Michigan School of Law </a> discusses the rulings surrounding NCAA athlete amateurism...</p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n September 30, 2015, a divided panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit weighed in on the growing controversy regarding the <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/">National Collegiate Athletic Association's</a> (NCAA) rules limiting compensation of student athletes. While affirming aspects of the district court opinion finding the NCAA's rules anticompetitive, the court stopped short of opening the doors to market-based player compensation. Indeed although the newspaper headlines declared victory for the players' class action, the majority opinion rejected the principal thrust of the players' claim&#8212;that schools should be free to compensate players based on their economic value to the schools. And the Ninth Circuit opinion is unlikely to be the last word on the matter.</p>

<p>Since 1948, the NCAA has adhered to a <a href="http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/NCAANewsArchive/1999/19991122/active/3624n24.html">"Sanity Code" </a>that has effectively prohibited member colleges and universities from compensating student athletes for their athletic services. The NCAA has significantly revised the code on several occasions, increasingly to permit scholarships designed to help athletes cover their costs of attending college. Most recently, in 2014, the NCAA <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/09/30/14-16601.pdf">amended</a> [PDF] the code to permit full "grant-in-aid" scholarships, defined as the total cost of tuition and fees, room and board and course-related books. But the prohibition on compensating athletes based on athletic contribution has remained.</p>

<p>In recent years there has been a growing perception that NCAA schools are exploiting their star athletes by earning millions of dollars in revenues on the backs of athletes who work grueling hours, run the gauntlet of serious injury and sometimes fail to receive an adequate education. Political and legal pressures have been mounting. Bills have been introduced in Congress to regulate the NCAA athletic scholarship process. And the NCAA recently dodged a bullet when, on August 17, 2015, the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/">National Labor Relations Board </a> overturned a Regional Director's <a href="http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150817/NEWS03/150819865/northwestern-university-football-players-wont-unionize">determination</a> that Northwestern University football players who receive grant-in-aid scholarships are employees for purposes of the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/resources/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act</a>.</p>

<p>The most immediate threat to the NCAA has been the antitrust laws, particularly <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1">Section 1</a> of the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/antitrust-laws">Sherman Act</a>. Since the NCAA is essentially a horizontal agreement among competitive schools, it has frequently been the target of antitrust assault. In its landmark 1984 decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case">NCAA v. Board of Regents</a>, the Supreme Court struck down an NCAA rule limiting commercial broadcasting of television games. Nonetheless <span class="casename">Board of Regents</span> also provided an apparent firewall against student attacks on the NCAA's player compensation rules. In passing the Supreme Court remarked that "in order to protect the character and quality of" college football, "athletes must not be paid." Several lower courts have <a href="http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1327&context=sportslaw">interpreted</a> this dicta as a complete answer to any claim that it is anticompetitive for the NCAA to prohibit player compensation.</p>

<p>In 2009, Ed O'Bannon, a former all-american basketball player at UCLA <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/10/sports/ncaabasketball/understanding-ed-obannons-suit-against-the-ncaa.html?_r=0">initiated</a> a class action lawsuit against the NCAA on behalf all current and former student athletes whose image or likeness had been included in video game images licensed by the NCAA or its member schools. The class alleged that it was anticompetitive for the NCAA to prohibit member schools from compensating student athletes for the use of their image or likeness. Predictably the NCAA responded that <span class="casename">Board of Regents</span> had settled the question of whether the antitrust laws prohibited restrictions on player compensation.</p>

<p>After certifying the class and rejecting the NCAA's efforts to have the case dismissed, Federal District Judge Claudia Wilken (ND Cal) held a fourteen day bench trial in 2014. Judge Wilken <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/09/30/14-16601.pdf">found</a> [PDF] an appropriate relevant market for college education in which NCAA member schools competed, that the flat prohibition on compensating students for use of their image or likeness created anticompetitive effects in that relevant market (either by inflating the educational fees students pay as purchasers of education or by deflating the fees they earn as providers of services) and that the restriction could not be fully justified by the NCAA's interests in preserving amateurism, maintaining competitive balance, integrating academics and athletics or increasing the available opportunities for students at schools with fewer resources.  </p>

<p>However Wilken also found that some limits on player compensation were justified by increasing consumer demand for amateur athletics and preventing the formation of a "wedge" between student athletes and other students. Employing a "less restrictive alternatives" analysis, Wilken entered an injunction requiring the NCAA to loosen its player compensation restrictions as to image and likeness claims in two ways: (1) by allowing compensation up to the full cost of college attendance (i.e., covering any shortfall created by the 2014 rules); and (2) permitting schools to hold a percentage of their licensing fees--not to exceed $5,000 per student per year&#8212;in trust until after the students leave college.</p>

<p>On appeal the Ninth Circuit endorsed much of the district court's analysis. It agreed that the NCAA's effort to use the <span class="casename">Board of Regents</span> <em>dicta</em> as a complete foil to attacks on player compensation rules was overbroad. The court held that amateurism might be a legitimate goal of the NCAA's rules, but claims about amateurism cannot afford carte blanche immunity against rule of reason analysis under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1">Section 1 of the <a href="<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/antitrust-laws"</a>Sherman Act</a>.<br />
   <br />
The court then wrestled with several thorny issues regarding whether the student compensation rules relate to "commercial activity" and hence fall within the coverage of the antitrust laws (yes), whether the class demonstrated injury in fact because they were deprived of compensation for image and likeness they might otherwise receive (yes) and whether the copyright act might preempt the players' claims (irrelevant).</p>

<p>Having cleared the brush, the court got down to the heart of the case&#8212;whether the player compensation rules produced significant anticompetitive effects, whether those effects were offset by procompetitive effects and whether any procompetitive effects could be advanced through substantially less anticompetitive means. Consistent with the district court's ruling, the court of appeals held that the player compensation rules had an anticompetitive effect akin to price fixing, that some restrictions on player compensation advanced the procompetitive interest in preserving amateurism and that the restrictions were overbroad&#8212;that they were not the least restrictive means of promoting the procompetitive goals of amateurism.  </p>

<p>The court split 2-1 on the scope of remedy. Writing for himself and Judge Quist, Judge Bybee found that the compensation prohibition was overbroad to the extent it prohibited schools from compensating athletes for use of their image or likeness up to the full cost of attendance. Hence that much of the district court order was affirmed. However the majority also found that district court's creative injunction allowing colleges to set aside $5,000 per player per year in escrow was in error. The majority found insufficient the evidentiary support for the $5,000 figure&#8212;an offhand comment at trial by one of the NCAA's marketing experts&#8212;and also found the line between "offering student-athletes education-related compensation and offering cash sums untethered to education expenses" to be a "quantum leap." By contrast Chief Judge Thomas <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/court-strikes-down-possible-payments-college-athletes">dissented</a> from that portion of the majority opinion and would have affirmed the $5,000 deferred compensation portion of the injunction.</p>

<p>There is a very good chance that the Supreme Court will agree to hear the case. The issues are of significant national importance, the panel decision called into question the precedential effect of portions of the <span class="casename">Board of Regents</span> decision, the panel decision explicitly rejected precedents from at least two other circuits and a judge dissented from the panel decision. Unless the parties decide to settle short of seeking certiorari, the likelihood of Supreme Court decision is high. Should the court take the case, several interesting doctrinal questions of broader relevance than just college athletics could be implicated. One issue is whether educational or other non-profit institutions must justify restraints on competition with reference to the commercial appeal of their products or services. The panel decision assumes that amateurism is only a valid justification for the challenged restraints to the extent that it stimulates demand for college sports&#8212;basically, to the extent that amateurism is an aspect of the brand favored by consumers. Under an alternative view one might say that the NCAA and other non-profit groups should be able to articulate and pursue ideals whether or not such action translates into a product or service favored by consumers.</p>

<p>The implications of this question for educational institutions and other non-profit groups are large. For example should schools be able to band together to set financial aid policies in order to increase student diversity, whether or not that results in a "product" that consumers like better? The Supreme Court has not spoken directly to that question and might provide some guidance on appeal from the Ninth Circuit.</p>

<p>Another question of some importance to antitrust law is the tightness of means-ends fit in less restrictive alternative analysis. Once a restraint on competition has some anticompetitive effect but also advances some procompetitive objective, how searching is the inquiry into whether the procompetitive effect could have been achieved in a manner less restrictive of competition? This is a frequent question across many domains of law, with the tightness of means-ends fit ranging from extremely tight in areas like racial classifications to extremely loose in the domain of "rational basis" review under the equal protection clause. There is no authoritative answer to this question in antitrust law. The panel decision acknowledged concerns about courts using "antitrust law to make marginal adjustments to broadly reasonable market restraints," but found the restriction on grant-in-aid up to the full cost of education completely unrelated to the procompetitive objective of promoting amateurism.</p>

<p>In the event that the Ninth Circuit's decision stands, the consequences for collegiate athletics should be relatively modest&#8212;certainly far less disruptive than having to engage in collective bargaining with student athletes or providing full market compensation. One senses however, that this decision will be just one small point in a much broader reappraisal of the business of intercollegiate athletics.</p>

Jaffe discusses whether economic and social class can replace race in the university admission process to increase diversity in the universities... </j:header></p>

<p><strong>U</strong>niversities want diversity, that much is clear. You see it in their mission statements. But how do they get it? For decades, colleges used race as a primary plus factor in a holistic review of applicants in the admissions process. At the same time, colleges could not employ racial quotas to achieve racial diversity. Now, it appears using race to achieve diversity has run out of steam. Racial diversity has plateaued or fallen at many universities. With the court's recent holding in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13411827130215353204">Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action</a>, eight states now have broad bans on the use of race in higher education admissions. Furthermore, modern attitudes towards the use of race in college admissions have changed. Today, people understand that where you go to college matters and they do not like the idea of race counting in who gets ahead. So what if there was something else that could increase diversity? Or even supplement the use of race as an important plus factor? The answer is class.</p>

<p>In order for colleges to achieve more economic and racial diversity, class should be given more weight as a plus factor in the holistic application process. Class-based affirmative action is better for the future because it will not only increase enrollment in higher education for low-income students but also increase racial diversity. At the same time, race should still be employed as a plus factor as it is a necessary factor to achieving diversity. While race-based affirmative action has been successful in boosting diversity in higher education, the efforts only go so far.</p>

<p>Racial and economic diversity at selective universities, both public and private, has barely budged as schools are caught in a bind between satisfying the diversity constraint and avoiding harm to the general academic standing of the school. As these universities search for the "well-rounded" applicant they are equally constrained by limited financial aid, public relations campaigns to maintain relevance and most of all, the need to sustain elite rankings due to high SAT and GPA scores. In addition, for states that have banned the use of race in admissions, there has been a noticeable drop in minority representation at public undergraduate institutions; therefore, removing race from the equation is detrimental to maintaining racial diversity.</p>

<p>This is where class comes in. Class-based policies are designed to give a boost to applicants who have faced obstacles in college admissions. Since demographic factors like parental income and education directly correlate to a student's school performance, proponents of class-conscious affirmative action support this boost as a means to level the playing field. Schools that target class status as a plus factor can capture not only low-income candidates but also those minorities that overlap in this category. Focusing on class serves the dual-purpose of bringing in more economic and racial diversity while providing an opportunity for these students to increase future professional and economic prospects.</p>

<p>Recent research from states that have banned, supplemented or replaced race-based affirmative action with class-based policies shows effective, targeted and wide-ranging class-based policies increased admission rates for low-income students and minorities. Several factors played a role in maintaining or enhancing racial diversity in light of a shift to class-based preferences: use of percentage plans which are race/class neutral; expansion of Pell grants; among others. In fact, a 2010 study at the University of Colorado, Boulder suggests that some universities may be able to equal, or even exceed, the racial diversity they previously had if they provide a sufficiently large boost to socioeconomically disadvantaged students.</p>

<p>Considering the enormous impact college education has on future earnings schools must invest more resources to reach these students. Colleges already employ substantial resources to reach students. Universities should expand the scope by using targeted outreach programs such as local recruiting fairs, free college tours, and mailings for low-income students. By reaching students who may not know they are qualified for admission, schools provide opportunities to those who need it most.</p>

<p>Although class-based affirmative action offers promise to disadvantaged groups, critics offer several counter-arguments to using class instead of race. Chief among the complaints is class is not a suitable proxy for race. While various scholars may debate the exact correlation between class and race, the fact remains we should still use race as a plus factor. A more comprehensive solution employs both class and race, with class being a more pronounced plus factor to achieve a broader range of diversity.</p>

<p>According to some scholars, fighting discrimination with discrimination made sense in the past because racial disparities in higher education and employment could not be corrected through prospective anti-discriminatory laws and policies. But other scholars stress that the economic and professional landscape has changed dramatically since the 1960s, providing ammunition to the notion that using race to counteract structural racism is not necessary in 21st Century America.</p>

<p>With the court's recent affirmation in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6883717302676149601">Fisher v. University of Texas</a> about the use of race-based affirmative action in higher education, an exciting opportunity exists for colleges to look at a shift to a class-based system. Colleges should still employ race as a significant plus factor to ensure racial diversity; at the same time, more focus on class brings into the fray more low-income students as well as low-income minority applicants. Providing more college opportunities to low-income students creates hope for upward economic and social mobility for this once forgotten segment of the admissions landscape.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.smu.edu/professor-profiles/ryan">Meghan J. Ryan</a> of Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law discusses the controversy surrounding Richard Eugene Glossip's Oklahoma death penalty sentence...</p>
<strong>T</strong>he recent activity surrounding the scheduled execution of Oklahoma's Richard Eugene Glossip has once again spotlighted the three-ring circus that has become America's death penalty. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/richard-glossip-execution_55e4e535e4b0aec9f35454e6">Glossip</a> was <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/14-7955#writing-14-7955_OPINION_3">convicted</a> of hiring a hitman to kill a motel owner. His conviction was based primarily on the testimony of Justin Sneed, who claimed that Glossip had hired him to bludgeon the victim to death. In exchange for this testimony, Sneed was sentenced to life without parole rather than death. As Glossip's scheduled execution date neared, Glossip's attorneys challenged the method by which Glossip was to be executed. Unable to obtain the drugs it had regularly employed in executing offenders, Oklahoma was experimenting with different combinations of drugs to carry out executions. Executions had been botched as a result, and Glossip's attorneys argued that the method that was to be used to carry out this execution would violate the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment's</a> prohibition on "cruel and unusual punishments." The US Supreme Court rejected this claim. Glossip's lawyers later unearthed <a href="http://okcadp.org/2015/09/1249/">evidence</a> suggesting that Glossip may actually be innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. For <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/us/oklahoma-execution-richard-glossip.html">example</a>, one of Sneed's fellow inmates claims that Sneed has admitted he set up Glossip in exchange for obtaining a lesser sentence himself. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/09/28/oklahoma-court-denies-richard-glossips-request-for-a-stay-of-execution/">briefly stayed</a> Glossip's execution to provide time to wrestle with his actual innocence claim, but the court later rejected the claim. Two days later, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-richard-glossip-decision_560bf602e4b0768126fffc70">denied</a> Glossip's request for a stay of execution so that he could pursue his claim of actual innocence. That same day, Oklahoma's governor granted a stay as more questions arose about the drugs to be used in carrying out the execution. Glossip is now scheduled to be executed on November 6, 2015.</p>

<p>The possibility of executing an innocent person has made major waves in recent years. There have been approximately <a href="http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/browse.aspx">1,700 </a> exonerations in the US since 1989. The reasons why innocent individuals have been wrongfully convicted range from faulty forensic evidence, to inaccurate eyewitness testimony, to falsified snitch testimony like that alleged in Glossip's case. Considering the large number of exonerations, it seems likely that some people who have been executed were actually innocent. Indeed, our system of justice does not require certainty of guilt before a person is convicted and sentenced to even the worst of punishments. We require that guilt be proven only <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/397/358">beyond a reasonable doubt</a>. And of course requiring absolute certainty of guilt would create an unworkable system. </p>

<p>Perhaps hoping to reassure doubters, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-1170.ZC.html">Justice Scalia</a> and others have pointed out that it has never been legally determined that anyone who has been executed was actually innocent. However, there seems to be no real avenue for challenging the propriety of an execution that has already taken place. If wrongful executions cannot be legally challenged, of course there cannot be any legal determinations of wrongful execution. In an attempt to remedy this conundrum, the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/aba.html">American Bar Association</a> has recently passed a <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/news/reporter_resources/aba-2014-annual-meeting/2014-annual-meeting-house-of-delegates-resolutions/110a.html">resolution</a> urging jurisdictions to establish legal avenues to challenge wrongful executions and also to provide compensation if there is a determination of wrongful execution. Should jurisdictions pass legislation to this effect, we likely will be able to determine more definitively whether an innocent individual within the US has been executed. We might even be able to speculate as to how common of an occurrence this has been throughout time.</p>

<p>In addition to this wrongful execution quandary, Glossip's legal battles highlight the methodological problems with today's death penalty. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that the death penalty, itself, is not unconstitutional. Indeed, the Constitution enshrines the practice by referring to the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html">limitations</a> on depriving an individual "of life" in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth</a> Amendments. As the court explained in its recent case of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-5439.ZS.html">Baze v. Rees</a>, however, the way in which the death penalty is carried out could potentially violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on "cruel and unusual punishments." If the method involves a "substantial risk of serious harm...[or] pain" to the offender, it is unconstitutional. The difficulty is that we do not actually know the extent of the risk of harm or pain posed by these new lethal injection cocktails like the one challenged in Glossip's case. As states have had difficulty obtaining the drugs used in traditional lethal injection cocktails, states have had to begin experimenting with how their death row offenders are executed. Conducting experiments on human beings, though, is ethically questionable. And the lack of information about how to humanely execute offenders is exacerbated by the fact that one drug typically included in lethal injection cocktails is a paralytic that masks the offender's pain during execution. This paralytic is said to preserve the offender's dignity, to prevent him from flailing about as he is being killed. </p>

<p>In the court's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/14-7955">opinion</a> addressing Glossip's challenge to the drugs contemplated in his earlier-scheduled execution, a majority of the justices seemed to have ventured down a new path in its analysis of the Eighth Amendment and the acceptable methods for carrying out state-sanctioned death. The justices stated that "it is settled that capital punishment is constitutional," therefore "it necessarily follows that there must be a constitutional means of carrying it out." The majority then launched into the story about how the drugs traditionally employed in the lethal injection cocktail have been made unavailable to executioners due to capital punishment opposition from Europe and pressure on relevant domestic drug manufacturers. The Eighth Amendment, though, prohibits all "cruel and unusual punishments." If a punishment that would ordinarily be acceptable under the Constitution can only be carried out in a way that is cruel and unusual, it would directly contradict the terms of the Amendment. Imagine a world in which, for practical reasons, execution was not possible by any means other than <a href="http://www.britannica.com/topic/drawing-and-quartering">drawing and quartering</a>. To be sure, this is an unlikely scenario, but it gets at the heart of what the majority stated in the opinion. Are we really prepared to find constitutional the practice of executing someone by hanging them until they are almost dead, disemboweling them, burning their entrails, beheading them and then quartering them by tying each limb to a separate horse and then spurring the horses in different directions? Supreme Court case law before Glossip's case is quite clear that such torture is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Our exuberance for capital punishment has led us down some questionable avenues. The political process might finally be taking care of this, though. Budget deficits and concerns about the high number of recent exonerations have caused several states to reconsider the wisdom of capital punishment. Since 2007 New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Illinois, Connecticut, Maryland and Nebraska have <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-death-penalty">all abandoned the practice</a>. If states continue along this trajectory, the number of states and their consistency in moving away from the death penalty might cause the court to conclude that a consensus has been reached that we ought to turn our back on the punishment. Such a consensus should then lead to the conclusion that capital punishment is unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. That is, of course, unless the language of the Constitution specifically referencing the punishment of death is found to trump this traditional Eighth Amendment analysis of looking at "the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society."</p>

		<title>Does America Need A Children&amp;apos;s Bill of Rights?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST guest columnist <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/law/faculty/profiles/binford/">Warren Binford </a> of <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/law/index.html">Willamette University College of Law</a> discusses the Children's Bill of Rights...</p> <strong>E</strong>arlier this month, three House Democrats in the US Congress introduced a resolution calling for the establishment of a Children's Bill of Rights. But why? The US is already a <a href="https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-11&chapter=4&lang=en">signatory</a> to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>, which is the most widely ratified human rights treaty in the history of the world. In fact, both South Sudan and Somalia <a href="https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-11&chapter=4&lang=en">ratified</a> the treaty earlier this year, which means that every recognized country in the world has ratified the treaty except the US. </p>

<p>The failure of the US to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child is especially surprising in light of the treaty's history. The treaty grew out of two international declarations, the <a href="http://www.un-documents.net/gdrc1924.htm">1924 Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child</a> and the <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-declaration/">UN 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the Child.</a> The 1924 Declaration recognized children's fundamental political, civil, economic and social rights, proclaiming that "mankind owes to the Child the best that it has to give."  </p>

<p>The 1959 Declaration was necessary due to the dissolution of the <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1914-1920/league">League of Nations</a> and expanded the rights highlighted in the <a href="http://www.un-documents.net/gdrc1924.htm">1924 Geneva Declaration</a> to embody 10 core principles, including rights, for example, to education, protection and social security, and to be free from discrimination, exploitation and abuse. Moreover the 1959 Declaration incorporated references to both the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, making clear that the rights outlined in the 1959 Declaration are in addition to the rights children enjoy as human beings and are necessary due to their special status as children. The US actively participated in the drafting of the 1959 Declaration and voted in favor of its adoption on November 20, 1959. Indeed the adoption of both the 1924 Geneva Declaration and the 1959 Declaration were unanimous (although the US famously failed to join the League of Nations).</p>

<p>Although some countries lobbied for a binding children's rights treaty after the UN was created, the political will was lacking and so, as with the 1924 Declaration, the 1959 Declaration was a largely aspirational, non-binding instrument. However 20 years later, the political will for a binding children's rights treaty had grown and in 1979 (the International Year of the Child), drafting began on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Over 70 countries participated in the drafting process over a ten-year period, including the US. In fact the US was more <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.msu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1138&context=ilr">active</a> [PDF] in drafting the Convention on the Rights of the Child than any other country in the world, proposing text or amendments to 38 of the treaty's 40 substantive articles. The US participation in the drafting process involved both major political parties and three presidencies (Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush) and is largely influenced by US laws (both state and federal) and values with regard to children.</p>

<p>When the Convention on the Rights of the Child opened for signature on November 20, 1989, it broke records for the greatest number of signatories but the treaty's most active drafter, the US, was nowhere to be found. In fact it was not until February 16, 1995, that the treaty was finally signed by the US. More than 20 years later the Convention on the Rights of the Child continues to sit dormant before the <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/">US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations</a> and has never been sent to the full Senate for consideration. What treaties are actively being considered by the Foreign Relations Committee? The Committee recently was schedule to <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/hearings/treaties-102915p">consider</a> eight treaties regarding taxation with countries including Hungary, Poland, Chile and Luxembourg, for example. Without question fair taxation is critical to a civilized society, but so is the recognition of rights inherent to even the youngest of citizens.</p>

<p>Since the Convention on the Rights of the Child is not binding on the US until two-thirds of the US Senate votes to approve the treaty, does the treaty have any force or effect in the meanwhile? <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201155/volume-1155-I-18232-English.pdf">Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties </a>prohibits a signatory from defeating the purpose of a treaty prior to ratification. Unfortunately as with the Convention, the US has signed, but not ratified, the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201155/volume-1155-I-18232-English.pdf">Vienna Convention</a>. However the US State Department has recognized many of the Vienna Convention's provisions as customary law. Relatedly in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16987406842050815187">Roper v. Simmons</a>, the US Supreme Court cited the near universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child as weighing in support of the Court's decision to ban the juvenile death penalty. The influence of the treaty continues to be evident indirectly as the global community becomes more unified in its shared values vis-à-vis children and their unique rights due to their special status.</p>

<p>Notably the US has ratified other treaties regarding children's rights. For example the US is a party to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPSCCRC.aspx">Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography</a> , the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPACCRC.aspx">Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict</a> and the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C182">Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention</a>. The US is also a party to several family law treaties that relate to children's rights, including the <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=24">Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Abduction</a> and the <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=69">Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption</a>. </p>

<p>As a party to these treaties the US recognizes that children have rights and is affirmatively obligated to protect the rights specified in these treaties through compliance with the treaties' provisions at both the state and federal level. Indeed, under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause </a> of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution">US Constitution</a>, these treaties and their provisions have become "the law of the land." Combine these legal obligations with the US' obligation not to defeat the purposes of the Convention and it is clear that the US already has a growing body of international legal obligations that, when combined with state and federal law, constitute a large and growing legal framework that recognizes and protects children's rights. The problem is that they are not summarized in a single document and not all of these authorities rise to the level of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Article VI</a> supremacy. So what's a children's rights advocate to do?</p>

<p>One option is to call for a "Children's Bill of Rights," such as the House Democrats have done. The problem is that the same political partisanship that has prevented the ratification by the US of the most widely ratified treaty in the world will certainly defeat the resolution. Moreover the international community has already invested over 90 years actively drafting a children's rights framework that has been accepted by every single country on the planet except the US. There is no way that the current Congress could match the time, energy and expertise entailed in drafting the Convention. Nor should it have to in light of the high level of involvement by the US in the drafting process. Anything less than the ratification of that Convention would give American children less than they are owed. And as the 1924 Declaration recognized almost a century ago, "mankind owes to the Child the best that it has to give." It is time for America to give its children the very best legal protections they are owed and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child, once and for all.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Ewelina Kemp of the <a href="http://law.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> discusses the recent developments of Patent Law in the European Union... </j:header><br />
<strong>F</strong>all 2015 appears to be a prominent time for European Patent Law. On September 30, 2015 <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEX-15-5748_en.htm">Italy formally became the twenty sixth</a> EU state member involved in the enhanced cooperation on the Unitary Patent (UP). The next day, on October 1, seven EU member states <a href="https://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20151001.html">signed</a> the Protocol on the Provisional Application of the Agreement on the Unified Patent Court. This Protocol is a milestone towards the realization of a unitary patent for Europe. The European Union's "unitary patent package" legislation, introduced under the EU's legislative procedure of "enhanced co-operation" and <a href="http://www.epo.org/law-practice/unitary/unitary-patent.html">passed</a> by the European Parliament in 2012, is the most substantial change in European patent practice in over 40 years. This legislation fundamentally changes the way patents are granted and enforced in the European Union. The aim of the reform is to simplify the existing system and intensify a cost effective patent protection and dispute settlement.</p>

<p><strong>How does the European patent system work now?</strong><br />
Presently, patent protection can be granted through two separate legal channels; under the <a href="https://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/epc.html">European Patent Convention</a> and the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/pct/en/texts/pdf/pct.pdf">Patent Cooperation Treaty</a> [PDF]. The first option is to apply for a national patent protection through respective national patent offices. The downside of the "<a href="https://www.epo.org/applying/national.html">national path</a>" is the limitation of protection only to the respective granting member state. The alternative to the "national path" is the <a href="http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/8266ED0366190630C12575E10051F40E/$File/how_to_get_a_european_patent_052015_en.pdf">European Patent (EP)</a> [PDF]. This name might be misleading since the EP is not a uniform IP right. Thus, once the EP is granted through the European Office, it still must be validated by national patent offices. As a result, the EP is a package of national patents. Consequently, in case of patent infringement, the only available option is to bring a lawsuit before national courts in each of the relevant countries. This solution is as inefficient as it sounds. It not only incurs significant costs for the parties but also might result in conflicting decisions.</p>

<p><strong>What does the Unitary Patent System (UPS) bring to the table?</strong><br />
The "patent package" consists of a Regulation creating an <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012R1257">European patent with unitary effect</a>, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012R1260">a regulation on languages applicable to the unitary patent</a> and an <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:42013A0620(01)">Agreement on the Unified Patent Court</a>. The Unitary Patent (the full name the European patent with unitary effect) will be an option to national patents and to the current European patent. The major difference to the already existing European patent is that the UP is designed as one single right which will be effective and enforceable across the contracting countries (all EU members except Spain, Poland and Croatia). The UP will be managed by the European Patent Office ("EPO"). The applications are to be submitted in the same way as for classic EP, but an applicant is to elect whether the patent is to have unitary effect (<a href="http://www.unified-patent-court.org/images/documents/enhanced-european-patent-system.pdf">a request for unitary effect</a>) [PDF]. As a result, an applicant will be able to obtain patent protection in 25 Member States of the EU by one single request.</p>

<p><strong>The Unified Patent Court.</strong><br />
Another significant change is the establishment of the <a href="https://www.epo.org/law-practice/unitary/patent-court.html">Unified Patent Court</a> (UPC), which will have the exclusive jurisdiction over disputes relating to the UP. Also, to some extent, the UPC will gain jurisdiction over the "classic" EP. The court will be comprised of the Court of Appeal (seated in Luxembourg) and a Court of First Instance, which will be divided into a Central Division (seated in Paris, London and Munich) and a Regional Division. The competence of the divisions is defined by the <a href="http://www.unified-patent-court.org/images/documents/upc-agreement.pdf">UPC Agreement</a> [PDF]. Article 33 of the agreement provides that the actions for or relating to "infringement, provisional and protective measures and injunctions, damages or compensation derived from provisional protection and/or prior use" shall be brought before the regional division where the infringement has occurred, or where the defendant has residence or place of business. As a rule, but with some exceptions, actions for revocation or non-infringement shall be brought before the central division. The UPC will be a court common to the contracting States and thus will be obligated to request for preliminary rulings on the interpretation and application of EU law to the European Court of Justice (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12008E267:EN:HTML">Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The transitional period and the "Opt-out" scheme.</strong><br />
The UPC Agreement (Article 83) establishes a seven-year transitional period for classical European patents (although it may be prolonged up to seven more years), during which the actions for patent infringement may still be brought before national courts. Farther along the transactional period, the patent holder may declare an "opt-out" from the jurisdiction of the UPC and thus direct the patent infringement to be decided by the national courts.</p>

<p><strong>Forum shopping during the transitional period.</strong><br />
Since the detailed rules governing the transactional period and the functioning of UPC are yet to be established, it is hard to predict how the new system will function in practice. However, some aspects of the unified patent system already raise speculation of possible practical application. One of the frequently raised issues is forum shopping during the transitional period; when the patentee may choose between exclusive jurisdiction of the UPC and jurisdiction of respective national courts (the "opt-out" scheme). Further, the use of one forum does not preclude the use of others, thus patents holders may use parallel national proceedings or opposition proceedings before the UPC. Hence forum shopping in the EU might have its role increased as a strategic legal tool in European patent litigation.</p>

<p><strong>When may we expect the new system to come into effect?</strong><br />
Since December 2012 the process of ratification of the Unitary Patent Package is ongoing. The package will come into effect when 13 countries ratify the Unified Court Agreement, including the UK, France and Germany. The current information about the signature of the agreement can be found <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/agreements-conventions/agreement/?aid=2013001">here</a>. It is hoped that the first unitary patent could be seen as early as the beginning of 2017 (according to the current <a href="http://www.unified-patent-court.org/news">timetable</a>).</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.ucla.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/e-tendayi-achiume/">Tendayi Achiume</a> of UCLA School of Law discusses how the media's disproportionate focus on the European dimensions of the plight of Syrian refugees...</p><strong>F</strong>or four years, much of the world has ignored the Syrian refugee crisis. In light of this, recent <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/germany-announces-border-controls-after-over-ten-thousand-immigrants-migrate-into-the-country.php">media </a><a href="/paperchase/2015/09/hungary-lawmakers-approve-emergency-laws-to-address-migration-crisis.php">attention</a> on the plight of Syrians seeking refuge in Europe is an important shift. Admittedly, the plight of Syrian refugees traveling to Europe, and the challenges this movement poses for Europe are complex and worthy of attention. However, <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/un-secretary-general-urges-global-community-to-address-migration-issues.php">without more</a>, the disproportionate focus on the European dimensions of the refugee crisis puts the cart before the horse. It does not do enough to bring closer the one thing that could meaningfully mitigate the refugee crisis&#8212;robust international cooperation to share the cost of and responsibility for protecting Syrian refugees.</p>

<p>There are now over four million Syrian refugees, the overwhelming majority of whom remain in Syria's vicinity and at risk of death from violence, grinding poverty or both. This refugee crisis has been a slow motion crisis&#8212;steadily destroying the lives of many since the conflict began in 2011. In addition to this humanitarian devastation, the refugee crisis threatens regional stability and international security. In <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2316562">a forthcoming law review article</a> I propose one possible approach to alleviating the refugee crisis within the governing international law and policy framework. I also document how for the past four years, powerful international actors have obsessed over military intervention and other coercive action in Syria, and at the same time largely neglected the plight of Syrians refugees and the global implications of their displacement. This neglect, which currently persists, is a humanitarian and moral travesty. It is also a very costly strategic mistake. My aim in this comment is to show how the recent international focus on European migration continues the troubling trend of neglecting the Syrian refugee crisis, to explain why this neglect is a problem, and to offer an alternative. </p>

<p><em>The Current Focus on Europe is Neglect of the Syrian Refugee Crisis</em></p>

<p>Though welcome, much of the recent Western media coverage and policy debate on Syrian refugees has unfortunately focused on the very tip of the iceberg&#8212;the so-called European Migration Crisis. By September 2015, <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/europe-migration-crisis-context-why-now-and-what-next">more than 487,000 refugees</a> and other forced migrants&#8212;the majority fleeing the crisis in Syria&#8212;sought refuge in Europe. The number of Syrians that have sought refuge in all of Europe are a mere 12 percent of the over four million refugees currently hosted by Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt ("the regional refugee hosts"). </p>

<p>Turkey, which hosts over <a href="http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=224">two million Syrians</a>, now has the highest population of refugees of any country in the world and has spent over <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/europe-migration-crisis-context-why-now-and-what-next">$6 billion</a> on Syrian refugees. Almost a quarter of Lebanon's population is now Syrian refugees and researchers find that "[m]ore than half of Syrians in Lebanon and one-sixth of refugees in Jordan are living in extreme poverty." For the most part, the law in regional host countries prohibits Syrian refugees from working. Many depend on humanitarian and other assistance administered under the UN-led relief effort for their survival. As of the second week of October, this relief effort was only 41 percent funded. This funding shortfall has life-threatening implications for refugees in the region. A vivid example is the <a href="http://www.trust.org/item/20151006140817-dw8ks/?source=leadCarousel">return of Syrian refugees</a> from Jordan back to Syria&#8212;they would rather face the war than die of starvation in Jordan, where the funding shortfall means many are forced to go without food. In short, the more pressing and fundamental refugee crisis is unquestionably in Syria's immediate vicinity and what we see in Europe is one narrow, if growing dimension of this crisis.</p>

<p><em>The High Price of the Current Focus on Europe</em></p>

<p>Myopic focus on Europe comes at a high price from the general perspective of ensuring the well-being of Syrians fleeing the conflict, and even from the narrow perspective of managing European migration. In addition to other factors, the increased media and public attention on refugee flows to the EU have pushed the EU to take some steps to reform its migration and refugee policy. In so far as the focus of this policy is refugees, it is largely refugees arriving in the EU. Although the EU has announced an increase in funding to the UN-led regional relief program, it has not sufficiently prioritized comprehensive engagement with the Syrian refugee crisis as a <em>whole</em>, along the lines I propose below. There are a number of reasons why this is the case, including the fact that the public pressure and other factors that have caused the recent shifts in EU policy are rooted in concern for what happens in the EU. These realities notwithstanding, focusing primarily on Europe is a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2316562">mistake</a>. It continues a trend of prioritizing the lives of the very small minority that make it to Europe, a minority that many argue systematically excludes the most vulnerable of the refugee population.</p>

<p>Even from the narrower EU migration perspective, subordinating the regional refugee crisis is also imprudent. The most significant recent change in EU refugee policy&#8212;<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-migration-crisis-refugees-move-faster-than-the-eu-1443127840">an agreement</a> to relocate 120,000 asylum seekers from frontier to interior EU countries&#8212;is akin to treating a bloody gash with a Band-Aid. Commentators agree that a more robust response it required, in part because researchers predict that the numbers of Syrians and others fleeing to Europe is only likely to increase. My point, however, is that even if Europe were to adopt more comprehensive measures to assist refugees entering the EU, treating the arrival of Syrian refugees on European soil as the priority is a disastrous approach. Among the key drivers of migration to the EU are push factors tied to conditions for Syrian refugees in the regional host countries. These include: (1) the dire circumstances confronting refugees in regional host countries, many of which are now restricting access to their territories on the grounds that they do not have the means to support more refugees, and (2) "<a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/europe-migration-crisis-context-why-now-and-what-next">the continued lack of opportunities to work</a> or enroll in schools for most refugees[.]" What this means is that neglecting the regional refugee crisis is neglecting the most substantial and explosive part of the problem and instead prioritizing one manifestation of it. Even where the priority is managing European migration, subordinating policy responses to the refugee crisis in Syria's neighbors is short-sighted.</p>

<p>To be clear, the EU is not alone in effectively relegating the regional refugee crisis in the Middle East to the status of subordinate, auxiliary concern notwithstanding its scale and ramifications. The UN Security Council, the world's most powerful nations, and even those nations at the center of the proxy war in Syria continue to do the same. And the current media framing of the refugee crisis does little to destabilize this dynamic&#8212;its focus on Europe points to the EU and its member states as primarily responsible for developing a response. This implicitly casts the rest of the international community in the role of supporting actors. Coincident with the recent shifts in Europe some non-European countries including the US, have announced marginal increases in the number of Syrian refugees they are willing to resettle. At the same time, however, the UN-led international effort to protect Syrians in the region remains severely underfunded. Thus although attention on Europe may have forced powerful international actors that are central to mitigating the Syrian refugee crisis to engage with a manifestation of this crisis to a greater extent than they did four months ago, there has been no real corresponding pressure on these actors to develop a comprehensive solution.</p>

<p>Before proposing an alternative approach I want to be clear that increased migration to Europe is a product of far more than Syrian displacement. Other factors include, for example, the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/09/opinions/west-migrant-crisis-tisdall/">US-led invasions</a> of Iraq and Afghanistan post 9/11, and the <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/europe-migration-crisis-context-why-now-and-what-next">Nato-led intervention</a> in Libya in 2011. Furthermore, the population of migrants comprises far more categories than refugees, which raises a host of other<a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/13/south-africas-tough-lessons-on-migrant-policy/"> challenges</a>. All this notwithstanding, the regional core of the Syrian refugee crisis must be a top priority for Europe, the Security Council and all the other UN member states with the capacity to assist.</p>

<p><em>An Alternative Approach</em></p>

<p>What the Syrian refugee crisis requires is robust international cooperation to share the responsibility and cost of protecting all Syrians fleeing the conflict, not just those that make it to Europe. UN member states must convene a Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) for the Syrian refugee crisis to develop a sustainable funding regime to assist regional refugee hosting countries. CPAs are platforms that international refugee protection and humanitarian actors&#8212;in collaboration with states&#8212;have used in the past to coordinate international cooperation for refugee protection. A CPA would prioritize an international commitment to mitigating the refugee crisis in the Middle East; this priority would then dictate the complementary strategies adopted by other regions such as Europe. This would be a change from the current European piecemeal approach that trains attention and policy-responses on symptoms in Europe, at the expense of the core crisis in the Middle East. </p>

<p>How would such cooperation be achieved? The international law regime that currently governs the refugee-specific obligations of states offers no basis for achieving the international cooperation required for an equitable and sustainable distribution of the responsibility and cost of protecting Syrian refugees. Thus even though states beyond the region such as Russia and the US continue to play significant roles in the armed conflict driving Syrian displacement, when Syria's neighbors request international assistance with refugee protection, there is no international legal obligation that these other states provide this assistance. There is no doubt that the international refugee law regime requires a complete overhaul, and there is equally no doubt that such an overhaul remains highly unlikely. In my<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2316562"> article</a> I propose that international actors use the international doctrine of the responsibility to protect (RtoP) to achieve a qualified, but important measure of cooperation to alleviate the Syrian refugee crisis. I make the case for RtoP as a basis for anchoring a CPA, providing a concrete alternative to the continuing international neglect of the largest refugee crisis since World War II.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="https://webapp4.asu.edu/directory/person/1436144">James G. Hodge Jr.</a> of the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at Arizona State University and <a href="https://publichealth.arizona.edu/directory/doug-campos-outcalt">Doug Campos-Outcalt</a> of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix discuss the potential to legally limit anti-vaccination messages widely disseminated by political candidates...</p><strong>H</strong>eard enough about the potential for childhood vaccines to cause autism or other harms? So have we. For decades, politicians have replayed over and over misbeliefs about the alleged risks of autism and other injuries from childhood vaccines. In the September 2015 Republican Presidential Debate, the one-time front-runner <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/09/17/the-gops-dangerous-debate-on-vaccines-and-autism/">Donald Trump</a> alleged he knew of a 2-year-old who was vaccinated, got a "tremendous fever" and "now is autistic."</p>

<p>Other Republican Presidential candidates, including medical doctors <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/02/2016-candidates-child-vaccinations_n_6598186.html">Rand Paul and Ben Carson</a>, support vaccines but suggest they should be spaced out over a longer period than a child's first three years. Previously <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/09/13/palin-calls-out-perry-on-hpv-vaccine/">Sarah Palin</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/michele-bachmann-continues-perry-attack-claims-hpv-vaccine-might-cause-mental-retardation/2011/09/13/gIQAbJBcPK_blog.html">Michelle Bachman</a> resonated their own anti-vaccination sentiments. In 2008 even President Obama acknowledged others' concerns about potential links between vaccines and autism.</p>

<p><strong>Separating Myth from Reality</strong><br />
Enough is enough. It is time to separate myth from reality. Anyone trained in public health will tell you about the significant impact of vaccines on reducing morbidity and mortality in the last century. Vaccines (1) prevent more illnesses (16 million per year on average in the US according to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6316.pdf#12">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC)); and (2) save more lives (2-3 million globally annually according to the <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs378/en/">World Health Organization</a> (WHO)) than virtually any other public health intervention. Childhood vaccines, most of which are relatively inexpensive, avert billions in health care costs and are extremely safe due to robust public and private testing and monitoring systems.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Vaccine-Studies-Examine-the-Evidence.aspx">Comprehensive reviews of vaccine safety</a> conducted by <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/index.html">CDC</a>, <a href="http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/communication/network/vaccine_safety_websites/en/">WHO</a>, the <a href="http://iom.nationalacademies.org/Activities/PublicHealth/ImmunizationSafety.aspx">Institute of Medicine</a>, and others overwhelmingly support their effectiveness based on the current distribution schedule. These assessments also disprove completely claims of vaccine-linked autism. Prior "research" suggesting a link in the medical journal, <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/abstract">The Lancet</a>, has been debunked entirely and <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/abstract">retracted</a> from its original publication.</p>

<p>Still, <a href="http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/90172759/denialism-adverse-effect-public-health">some fringe groups</a> genuinely believe vaccines are riskier than the diseases they prevent. These beliefs, based on junk science, rumor and fraud, imply that the timing of child vaccines and early onset autism (or other conditions) are related. They are not.</p>

<p><strong>Shutting Down Messengers of Vaccine Lies?</strong><br />
If dissemination of these false beliefs caused no societal harms, then so be it. Medical misstatements are exchanged all the time largely without incident. However, negative impacts arise when appreciable numbers of Americans avoid timely immunization of their children in fear of potential harms extending from the receipt of a substance foreign to the human body. Multiple outbreaks of preventable diseases, highlighted by the <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/measles-outbreak/measles-outbreak-traced-disneyland-declared-over-n343686">Disneyland measles outbreak</a> earlier this year, threaten thousands of kids and adults annually. Such consequences beg the question: can messengers of openly false statements that contravene the public's health be stopped?</p>

<p>The answer juxtaposes <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> freedoms of speech and constitutional protections of community health. Americans enjoy significant liberties to speak as they wish on topics of choice. Government prohibitions of specific content of speech are constitutionally disdained. Alternatively, government attempts to mandate speech contrary to one's beliefs or interests are routinely rejected based on infringements of the right not to speak.</p>

<p>Yet free speech has its limits, particularly when significant public health interests are at stake. In many instances legal ramifications, penalties or liabilities may stymie or derail specific messages. For example, if governmental health officials publicize false statements linking child vaccines and autism, they could lawfully be censored or fired from their positions. They have no constitutional right to spread false statements antithetical to the mission of their agency or office.</p>

<p>Politicians or others who incorrectly suggest that a specific pharmaceutical company's vaccines are known to cause autism could be sued for defaming the company. In multiple states, including <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/3/00113.htm&Title=3&DocType=ARS">Arizona</a> and <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-2/chapter-16/2-16-1">Georgia</a>, defaming perishable foods can give rise to litigation across an entire industry. Recall in 1998 when <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/US/9801/21/oprah.beef/">Oprah Winfrey</a> was sued, albeit <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V118/N8/doprah.8w.html">unsuccessfully</a>, under Texas state law for alleging the US beef industry was at risk of mad cow disease?  </p>

<p>Conversely, what if a company nationally advertised the following claim: "Unlike competitors' products, our vaccine has never been linked to autism?" The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/PrescriptionDrugAdvertising/ucm076768.htm#law_violation_how">lawfully fine</a> the company and require the retraction of its ads. Commercial speakers cannot spread falsehoods about their or others' products.</p>

<p>Doctors or other health providers who counsel parents to avoid child vaccines because of risks of autism could face potential licensure sanctions and malpractice claims should a patient suffer harm as a result. Of course, few doctors would make this practice mistake. In reality, up to <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_155476.html">20 percent</a> of pediatricians today opt to disassociate altogether from parents who refuse vaccinations for their kids.</p>

<p><strong>A Political "Free Pass"</strong><br />
In each of these examples (and multiple others), freedoms of speech do not absolve messengers from potential legal ramifications of disseminating false information contrary to the public's health. So why do politicians seem to enjoy a virtual "free pass" to spread such public health lies?</p>

<p>In part, their statements are overly general. If a candidate specified one vaccine was linked to autism, forthcoming defamation claims may convince them from ever saying it again. More importantly, political actors enjoy <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4150626?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">extensive First Amendment protections</a> to promote vigorous and open political processes. Political views, even those that outright lack truth, can be made without major, or sometimes any, legal implications. </p>

<p>For example, <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2012/08/21/legitimate-rape-todd-akin-and-other-politicians-who-confuse-science/">Missouri Rep. Todd Akin</a> stated in 2012 that "legitimate rape" does not lead to pregnancy, which is untrue. He later recanted the statement and apologized. During the 2015 Planned Parenthood investigations, <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4552966/rep-chaffetz-caught-lie">Utah Rep. Jason Chaffez</a> publicly posted a chart with patently false data. When called out on it he quickly changed the subject.</p>

<p>For politicians to intimate that kids' vaccines are the cause of autism is not just a lie, it is the public health equivalent of falsely yelling "gun fire" in a crowded theater. In both cases, people react in ways that harm them or others without justification. While anti-vaccination statements may still be "protected speech" when spoken by politicians, there is, of course, no legal requirement to listen to, or vote for, brokers of public health fabrications.</p>

		<title>The EU&#039;s Common Immigration &amp; Asylum Policy&#8212;Drowning Along with the Refugees?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Lawrence-Eaker/78528924">Larry Eaker</a>, former Professor at the American University of Paris, discusses the European Union's Immigration and Asylum Policy ... </p><em>"The challenge to the European project today is existential. The refugee crisis has brought that to light.  What was unimaginable before now becomes imaginable, namely the disintegration of the European project."</em><br />
Frans Timmermans, European Commission First Vice-President, before the Friends of Europe (22 October 2015)</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>ccording to recent figures released by the <a href="http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php#_ga=1.214775511.173058679.1446896302">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR), Europe is expected to receive in 2015 over 800,000 migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea, mostly aboard rickety ships and rafts. Of this total, Greece&#8212;after already having been torn asunder by the continuing debt and euro crisis&#8212;will have to initially provide for over 670,000 of these migrants. Tragically, as of September 2015, over 3,400 of these struggling and panicked people have either drowned or gone missing at sea. UNHCR statistics concerning this unprecedented flow of migrants to Europe indicate that most arrive from war-torn nations such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Eritrea. News reports continue to show this downtrodden mass making its way through what is referred to as the Western Balkans Route in order to enter the EU via Hungary and Croatia. While the vast majority of these migrants are merely transitory, with the intention to eventually resettle in Germany and other northern EU Member States, several of the Eastern European Members States have admitted to being overwhelmed by this flow and the associated humanitarian and social needs. As a result, Hungary and Slovenia felt compelled to temporarily impose border controls at their EU internal borders. More surprisingly, both Austria and Germany have now imposed internal border controls even though these nations had initially expressed a more welcoming position to the oncoming migrants than their neighbors to the south.  While the EU Commission has recently validated the right of Austria and Germany to reintroduce these border controls&#8212;under public security exceptions to the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32006R0562&from=EN">Schengen Borders Code</a>&#8212;the about-face by these Member States has now sent a sharp signal to the EU at large that this is indeed a very serious situation.</p>

<p>Many of these EU nations seem determined to push the migrants along&#8212;if they cannot keep them out altogether&#8212;in a not so well-concealed effort to avoid being designated as the "responsible state" under EU law for determining the grant or denial of international protection or return to a safe country pursuant to international law obligations. While this game of political and legal "hot potato" somehow made it through the summer (albeit with a tremendous international uproar), it seems clear that an effective regulatory and legal structure is going to have to be rapidly imposed in order to avoid a humanitarian disaster of biblical proportions with the onset of the European winter. But the question remains&#8212;does the EU enjoy sufficient legal competence to impose an orderly and fair immigration and asylum system under the circumstance? If not, are the individual Member States willing to continue to transfer sovereign legal powers in these fields to EU institutions? And, if not, will this pose an existential threat to the overall EU project as mentioned by <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-15-5754_en.htm">Commissioner Timmermans</a>?</p>

<p><strong>The EU Common Asylum Policy&#8212;Fatally Flawed in Face of Migration Crises</strong><br />
In accordance with the EU's so-called Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, as specified in <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&from=FR">Part 3, Title V of the Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union</a> (TFEU), the EU enjoys the competence to ensure the absence of internal border controls on persons and to frame a common policy on asylum, immigration and external border controls. This common policy is to be based on solidarity between Member States&#8212;including its financial implications&#8212;and is to be fair towards third-country nationals. <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&from=FR">Article 78(1) TFEU</a> then specifies a common EU policy on asylum, subsidiary protection and temporary protection, including the principle of non-refoulement in line with the provisions of the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html">1951 Geneva Refugees Convention and its 1967 Protocol</a>. But this is where things get sticky. While the EU has been successful in adopting a common policy on free movement of persons, immigration and asylum, with differentiated integration of such policy by the UK, Ireland and Denmark via protocols, the fact remains that this so-called "common" policy suffers from a fatal flaw. Unlike a true, federal nation-state such as the US (with exclusive power over such issues exercised by a central, federal government paying the bills on a collective basis), the agreed-to EU common immigration and asylum rules and procedures are left to the individual Member States to implement&#8212;along with most of the costs incurred in applying these EU rules. Thus, those Member States such as Greece and Italy that are the initial EU entry points for such mass immigration as at present are completely overwhelmed. And, to make matters even worse, these Member States then suffer another body blow under the EU's now famous <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:180:0031:0059:EN:PDF">Dublin Regulation III</a> [PDF] which usually requires the entry state to assume final responsibility for handling the single application for international protection, including the right of other Member States to return migrants to these entry states.</p>

<p><strong>The EU in Emergency Mode&#8212;Attempting to Ameliorate the Implementation of the Common Policy</strong><br />
Faced with this emergency situation, the EU has attempted to ameliorate the current Common European Asylum System (CEAS) by adoption in May 2015 of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/index_en.htm">European Agenda on Migration</a>, which calls for a more comprehensive approach to migration management. A number of <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-6021_en.htm">implementing measures</a> have been subsequently agreed to, including, inter alia:<br />
<strong>&#8212;</strong>adoption of two emergency schemes to relocate 160,000 people in clear need of international protection from the Member States most affected to other Member States;<br />
<strong>&#8212;</strong>deployment to designated "<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/background-information/docs/2_hotspots_en.pdf">hotspots</a>" [PDF] of EU Migration Management Support Teams, including augmented numbers of FRONTEX officials;<br />

<strong>&#8212;</strong> urging further Member State support (both financial and in-kind) for nations calling for assistance under the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/civil_protection_en.pdf">EU Civil Protection Mechanism</a>, which <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/press-material/docs/state_of_play_-_ucpm_support_en.pdf">Serbia, Slovenia and Croatia</a> [PDF] have done in light of the migrant crisis; and<br />
<strong>&#8212;</strong> increasing EU financing earmarked for this crisis (to <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-5730_en.htm">&#8364;9.2 billion for 2015/16</a>) and calling for matching Member State contributions.   </p>

<p>While all this EU legislating is well and good, the stumbling block remains the fact that all this effort is subject to individual Member State effective, good faith implementation. And it is on this point that the CEAS fails&#8212;and, it must be said in light of recent performance, to a disturbing degree.</p>

<p>There is, however, a small ray of sunshine on the horizon for both the refugees and true believers in the European project (which we can safely include Timmermans amongst). And that is the European Commission in its role as the guardian of the treaties and enforcer of EU law, along with the <a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice/index_en.htm">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ). The Commission has recently stepped up <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5699_en.htm">infringement actions</a> against Member States for alleged abuses of the Common Immigration and Asylum Policy. Since August, the Commission has sent administrative letters to five Member States for violations concerning the Eurodac Regulation on fingerprinting and ten complaints concerning the correct implementation of the Returns Directive. In addition, the Commission has recently announced the adoption of 40 infringement decisions against several Member States for their failure to transpose into national law the Asylum Procedures Directive, Reception Conditions Directive, and the Qualification Directive, and against Greece concerning "serious deficiencies in the Greek asylum system." The continued failure to follow EU law in these matters could result in a referral of the cases to the ECJ (<a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZLF6oRF9UwEJ:ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/news/docs/infringements/article_258.pdf+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=safari">Article 258 TFEU</a>), with the possibility of hefty fines being imposed upon the recalcitrant Member State (<a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vJN5-uKojc0J:ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/news/docs/infringements/article_260.pdf+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=safari">Article 260 TFEU</a>).   </p>

<p><strong>The EU's Regional and International Human Rights Obligations</strong><br />
The EU and its 28 Member States are, ultimately, subject to a higher authority than their own highest court ruling in matters concerning human rights law issues on the European continent. As members of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [PDF] (ECHR) they are individually bound to protect those within their boundaries from violations of the listed human rights. Failure to do such can result in the filing of individual petitions for relief to the <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/democracy/migration/bodies/echr_en.asp">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECtHR) and the obligation to follow the final decisions of the court. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the ECtHR, in its <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre-press?i=003-3407679-3824378">MSS v. Belgium & Greece</a> decision, ruled in 2011 that the involuntary return of an Afghan migrant to Greece caused him to suffer degrading treatment in light of the deficiencies in the Greek asylum system and detention conditions. Furthermore, the ECJ itself  then cited this ECtHR decision in the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62010CJ0411&from=EN">2011 NS Case</a> in justifying its refusal to permit the return to Greece by the United Kingdom of five asylum seekers.</p>

<p>Finally, 27 EU Member States are parties to <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20999/volume-999-I-14668-English.pdf">Protocol I to the UN ICCPR</a> [PDF] which grants to those on their respective territories the right to file complaints with the UN's 18-member Human Rights Committee. Although it would be expected that migrants to the EU who claim human rights abuses stemming from their asylum attempts would pursue remedies before European courts (i.e., the ECJ and ECtHR), the EU and Member States must remain cognizant of the protections afforded migrants under the ICCPR&#8212;especially in light of the recent ruling by the UN Human Rights Committee strongly <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13648&LangID=E">condemning Australia</a> for human rights abuses inherent in its asylum procedures.</p>

<p><strong>The Path Forward&#8212;Return to National Borders or Further Federalization?</strong><br />
As in past EU crises, this supranational organization is faced with the choice of leaving this vital, transnational matter to the individual Member States exercise of sovereignty (similar to defense issues) or to further centralize in EU hands the making of EU law and implementation of it (like the move to the euro currency). But the control over immigration and asylum is proving to be an even more divisive issue than defense or money issues.  While it makes sense for a union of states to federalize these legal powers (similar to the US model), it has to be remembered that the word "federal" in the European context is not only considered by British so-called "Europhobes" to be the unspeakable "F word." Anti-EU and extreme nationalist parties are gaining strength in Europe. But who knows? The extent of this crisis may convince the majority of voters in the EU that the best solution is to further solidify "federal," EU legal control over immigration and asylum issues. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.umassd.edu/law/faculty/dwightgduncan/">Dwight Duncan</a> of the <a href="http://www.umassd.edu/law/">University of Massachusetts School of Law</a> discusses the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act...</p><strong>I</strong>n 2012 Chief Justice John Roberts surprised the country with his creative jurisprudence in upholding the constitutionality of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3590enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr3590enr.pdf">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [PDF]. He joined the four conservative dissenters in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-393#writing-11-393_OPINION_3">NFIB v. Sebelius</a> to find the Act's individual mandate, which required individuals to either have adequate health insurance or pay a fine, to exceed Congress's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art1frag31_user.html">power to regulate commerce </a>among the several states. But then he joined the court's four liberal justices in holding the fine to actually be a tax and thus to be a constitutional exercise of Congress's power to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">"lay and collect taxes." </a> At the time, the four dissenters <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-393#writing-11-393_DISSENT_5">noted</a> that "the Constitution requires tax increases to originate in the House of Representatives. That is to say, they must originate in the body most accountable to the people, where legislators must weigh the need for the tax against the terrible price they might pay at their next election, which is never more than two years off." </p>

<p>Indeed, the Constitution, in what came to be known as the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art1frag23_user.html">Origination Clause</a>, is explicit about requiring that revenue measures originate in the House of Representatives: "All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills."</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court has never in its history invalidated an Act of Congress for violating the Origination Clause, which might lead one to think that it is a classic "political question" entrusted by the Constitution to the political branches rather than the courts. The leading court's case on the subject, however, opined differently. Written by Justice Thurgood Marshall in 1990 in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/495/385/case.html">US v. Munoz-Flores</a>, "A law passed in violation of the Origination Clause would ... be no more immune from judicial scrutiny because it was passed by both Houses and signed by the President than would be a law passed in violation of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>." That case, however, found that laws that "create[] a particular governmental program and ... raise[] revenue to support that program," are not subject to the Origination Clause. Crucially, the fines paid to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under Obamacare <a href="http://blog.pacificlegal.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SisselCertPet.pdf">are not earmarked for healthcare</a> [PDF] and become general revenue for the federal government. </p>

<p>Matt Sissel, a "self-employed artist and small-business owner" from Washington state, on October 28 <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/3/matt-sissel-taking-a-stand-against-obamacare/?page=1">filed a petition for <em>certiorari</em> </a> to the US Supreme Court raising this Origination Clause challenge to Obamacare.  </p>

<p>The issue is an important and interesting one because, as Sissel <a href="http://www.pacificlegal.org/file/SISSEL-PET-FOR-WRIT-OF-CERT.pdf.">argued</a>, the Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act originated in the Senate by gutting a House Bill which "did not increase taxes, levy any new tax, or relate in any way to health insurance," and entirely substituting it "with the 2,076 pages of what, along with a later 'reconciliation' bill, became the PPACA, Pub. Law 111-148, 124 Stat. 119-1025 (2010)."</p>

<p>However compelling the argument on the merits of whether the ACA violates the Origination Clause of Article 7, section 1, though, the court must first decide whether to take up the case on <em>certiorari</em>. Here, there are two problems, realistically speaking. One is that there is no clear and present split in the circuits on this question, as the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed this claim for <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/14/14-20039-CV0.pdf">want of standing</a>, and the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit's panel <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/0DAD4A1E3A868F6385257D24004FA91E/$file/13-5202-1504947.pdf">held</a> [PDF] that the overriding purpose of the law was not to raise revenue but rather to provide health insurance. Even though four judges of the DC Circuit, in dissenting from the denial for a rehearing <u>en banc</u>, would have preferred a different rationale for ruling against the challenge, namely that the Senate can amend revenue bills originating in the House, no judge was saying that Obamacare violated the Origination Clause.  <br />
	<br />
The other reason it seems unlikely that the Supreme Court will grant cert has to do with the rule of five. Five votes would be needed in order to prevail on the merits at the US Supreme Court, although four votes would be sufficient to get cert.  Given that Roberts has shown not just once but twice that he is willing to engage in creative statutory interpretation to save the Affordable Healthcare Act. He thus prevented a 5-4 court decision on partisan lines (Republican appointees versus Democratic appointees) that would strike down Obama's signature achievement in office. So it seems unlikely that the four dissenters in <span class="casename">NFIB v. Sebelius</span> would want to grant cert only to lose again on the merits. After all, just last term the court, with Roberts writing the majority decision, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-114_qol1.pdf">upheld</a> the granting of subsidies through federal exchanges rather than the state-established exchanges that the law seemed to call for.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the court did just grant <em>certiorari</em> in the seven cases, including <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/13/13-1540.pdf">Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell</a> [PDF], which challenge the adequacy of the accommodation for religious organizations disputing the contraceptive mandate under Obamacare. Those cases are along the lines of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a> [PDF], but these cases just nibble around the edges of the Affordable Healthcare Act, and do not put a dagger into its heart, which is what the Origination Clause challenge entails. </p>

<p>Some background of Matt Sissel's Origination Clause case is an order: his suit was originally brought by the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf">Pacific Legal Foundation</a>  in 2010 on Commerce Clause grounds. After the 2012 decision in <span class="casename">NFIB v. Sebelius</span>, he amended his complaint to include the Origination Clause claim. The US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="http://www.pacificlegal.org/old-site/document.doc?id=917">ruled against him</a> [PDF], dismissing the suit both because the ACA was not a "bill to raise revenue," but rather to expand healthcare insurance, and on the alternative grounds that the Senate's total substitution of its own bill for the House's was a constitutionally valid "amendment." On appeal, the panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/0DAD4A1E3A868F6385257D24004FA91E/$file/13-5202-1504947.pdf">affirmed</a> [PDF] the dismissal, relying on the overriding purpose to expand healthcare coverage and not addressing the alternative grounds. On the motion for rehearing <em>en banc</em>, four judges <a href="http://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=2012">dissented</a> from the denial of rehearing because they preferred the alternative rationale, writing that the panel's ruling on overriding purpose "sets a constitutional precedent that is too important to let linger and metastasize." Lyle Denniston, dean of Supreme Court reporters, wrote a superb <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/08/health-insurance-mandate-survives-again/">piece</a> for <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/">Scotusblog </a>analyzing the significance of the DC Circuit's denial of rehearing <em>en banc</em>. We await, then, the Solicitor General's <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/15-543.htm">response</a> to the cert petition due on November 27, 2015.  </p>

<p>Only time will tell whether the Supreme Court chooses to hear this case.</p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n September 11, 2001, a terrorist attack on our nation changed our lives forever. We watched in despair as New York City's World Trade Center fell to the ground in less than two hours, leaving all of us in a cloud of dust, smoke and hopelessness. Almost 10,000 casualties resulted, and close to 3,000 people died on that tragic day. Almost 14 years after the attack on 9/11, many of us continue to feel the effects of the tragedy. New York remembers that day with the <a href="http://www.911memorial.org/">National September 11 Memorial and Museum</a>, which stands where the <a href="https://www.wtc.com/">World Trade Center</a> was previously located. Here, families and friends of loved ones can pay their respects and come to remember. Among the many artifacts found in the museum, there stands a 17-foot <a href="http://www.911memorial.org/blog/wtc-cross-installed-911-memorial-museum-updated">crossbeam</a> in the shape of a Latin (or Christian) cross, in the exhibit marked Finding Meaning. This crossbeam, originally a symbol of hope for survivors and families, seems to be a problem for the <a href="https://atheists.org/">American Atheists Inc. of New York</a>.</p>

<p>The American Atheists, Inc. saw this crossbeam as a symbol of religion rather than hope, and felt that the cross did not belong in the museum. So, it started a <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1673839.html">lawsuit</a>. It sued the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, claiming that the crossbeam violated the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">First Amendment Establishment Clause</a> of the Constitution because the state displayed a religious artifact on public grounds. </p>

<p>The court, following precedent, used the test that American courts have been using for years in Establishment Clause cases: the Lemon test. The Lemon test, derived from the 1971 case <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/602">Lemon v. Kurtzman</a>, is used to determine whether a government or state action in displaying an artifact violates the Establishment Clause. Under the Lemon test, the state action or artifact is constitutional if (1) it has a secular purpose; (2) its primary principle effect neither enhances nor hinders religion; and (3) it does not foster excessive entanglement between government and religion. </p>

<p>But the court in <span class="casename">American Atheists</span> strays from precedent by also applying the Endorsement test. This test is also used to analyze the constitutionality of a government or state action displaying a religious artifact on public property. This test, derived from Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13271488269297440249">Lynch v. Donnelly</a>, focuses on whether the government's objective was to endorse or sponsor a specific religion, considering the reasonable observer's reaction to the artifact. The court in <span class="casename">American Atheists</span> ultimately held that the state government was not violating the Establishment Clause when it erected the crossbeam in the 9/11 museum.</p>

<p>Although the court in <span class="casename">American Atheists</span> reached the correct conclusion, it does not itself set good precedent for Establishment Clause jurisprudence in the long run. For future cases, the Endorsement test needs to be adopted and applied to avoid the confusion caused by commingling the two tests in this case. </p>

<p>There are two reasons why the court should abandon the Lemon test altogether: 1) it is inapplicable to passive monuments such as the 9/11 cross beam; and 2) it is too ambiguous to apply in general. First, <span class="casename">Lemon v. Kurtzman</span> is inapplicable in <span class="casename">American Atheists</span> because the former was dealing with active participation while the latter is dealing with a passive monument. <span class="casename">Lemon</span>  dealt with the issue of the government giving monetary support to teachers in religious schools, but <span class="casename">American Atheists</span> deals with a religious monument on government property. To use the same test for two very different state actions would result in confusing jurisprudence because active and passive monuments have different effects on people. The second reason the Lemon test is inapplicable in <span class="casename">American Atheists</span> is because the test itself is ambiguous. The Lemon test's three prongs are difficult to apply across the board to all Establishment Clause cases because as time passed, the test became too widely applied to too many different situations, which added to the confusing jurisprudence we have today. As Justice Scalia <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-2024.ZC.html">explains</a>, "Like some ghoul in a late night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its grave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed and buried, Lemon stalks our Establishment Clause jurisprudence once again." For passive monuments such as the cross beam, the Endorsement test is the best test to determine whether the government action violates the Constitution.</p>

<p>With the Endorsement test, all the court has to do is ask whether an objective observer would view this display as a message of endorsement. The only analysis the court has to do is consider the message received by the observer within the context of the display. Adopting the Endorsement test that focuses on the objective observer will set stronger precedent for future Establishment Clause cases. </p>

<p>Focusing on the objective observer in <span class="casename">American Atheists</span>, the court explains that the objective observer would realize that the cross, although having religious symbolism, also has a secular purpose of providing an accurate historical account of events relating to September 11. An observer, knowing the general purpose of the September 11 Memorial and Museum, the secular imagery of a cross, and the events of 9/11, would not think that the cross beam displayed was an endorsement of Christianity. The court would have reached the same conclusion with the simpler, more accurate Endorsement test analysis. Therefore, the court should abandon the Lemon test for future Establishment Clause jurisprudence and solely adopt the Endorsement test.</p>

		<title>France May Invoke NATO Article 5 In Wake of Paris ISIS Attacks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="https://law.creighton.edu/directory/michael-kelly">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law argues that France has the legal right to invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty following the Paris ISIS attacks...</p><strong>F</strong>ollowing the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War, Syria was a French mandate from 1923 to 1946. The deal struck between Paris and London, known as the Sykes-Picot Agreement, divided up power and influence in the Fertile Crescent region between France and Britain. The British basically got what is now Iraq and Kuwait, and France got Lebanon and Syria. The map to the right depicts "Zone A" under French control which forms the core of modern-day Syria. The French have long held fast to the prerogative to return to former French possessions via military incursion when necessary to "set things right." In recent times, this has included military intervention in Mali, Cote d'Ivoire,and the Central African Republic. Now, that list may include Syria.</p>

<p>But the French may not be going alone. In the wake of the November 13, 2015 ISIS-coordinated attacks in Paris that killed over 100 people in at least half a dozen sites, France has the legal right to invoke Article 5 of the <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm">North Atlantic Treaty</a>. This pivotal article describes the <em>casus foederis</em>, case for alliance, as coming into play when one of the allied states is attacked. Literally, it means that an attack against one of the NATO allies is considered an attack against all. The language of Article 5 is clear: <blockquote>The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.</blockquote></p>

<p>Article 5 has only been invoked once in NATO's 66-year history. The date was October 4, 2001. That was when NATO confirmed the request by the US for a collective NATO response after the September 11, 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the US homeland. Several operations were authorized in support of the invasion of Afghanistan that followed and NATO officially took control of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in 2003. France was in the forefront of these operations, providing ground troops and air support. </p>

<p>It is unclear if France will decide to trigger this legal obligation like the US did. President Hollande has put France on a war footing and declared in a joint session of the French parliament that he will <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34836439">"destroy" ISIS </a>as he requested an extension of his emergency powers. The terrorist attacks in Paris on November 13, like the terrorist attacks in the US on September 11, were executed by non-state entities. The US-led NATO response resulted in an extensive air campaign followed by a full-scale invasion, occupation and a decade-long semi-successful nation-building exercise. A French-led NATO response in Syria is not likely to follow that pattern, but it could. Intensified French airstrikes are already underway utilizing US targeting intelligence.</p>

<p>After the French went loyally with us into Afghanistan after September 11, it would be difficult for the US to avoid going into Syria with France if it so chose. NATO of course would be the ultimate arbiter of what actions it would take, but the reality is that while French military power is significant on its own, it is also significantly enhanced with NATO support&#8212;both in terms of force projection and support. France knows this, and could well decide that this moment, unlike the moment following the Charlie Hebdo ISIS attacks in January 2015, is the moment to trigger Article 5.</p>

<p>That said, while ISIS operates throughout large swaths of Syria and Iraq, it does not do so in isolation. Also on the ground are Kurdish forces friendly to the US that must be avoided as well as Syrian rebel forces seeking to topple the government of Bashar al-Assad&#8212;still clinging to power along the western coast. And there is Russia. Only recently inserted in this chaotic theatre of combat, Russia has secured bases in Assad-held territory and is actively bombing both the rebels and ISIS. Although Russia and the US have undertaken <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2015/10/deconfliction-russia-syria-sis/408532/">"de-confliction" measures</a> to stay out of one another's way in Syria, close encounters have occurred and Russian planes have repeatedly violated Turkish airspace. Turkey, also a NATO ally, has not yet suffered direct attacks sufficient enough to trigger a similar Article 5 invocation.</p>

<p> The US views Russian involvement in Syria with both suspicion and quiet alarm. The French, however, may not. Paris may in fact see this as a diplomatic and military opportunity to re-engage Russia and NATO in a positive manner. Since the second term of President George W. Bush, relations between Moscow and Washington soured. This affected the NATO-Russia relationship negatively. After the Cold War, Russia and NATO entered into a dialogue that lead to creation of the NATO-Russia Council, which began an institutionalized partnership of sorts that lead eventually to joint exercises. But the American pivot away from Russia by unilaterally abandoning the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty to pursue a strategic missile defense initiative provoked the slow unwinding that reached its nadir with the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. NATO military upgrades in Eastern Europe fed into President Putin's rhetoric about NATO encirclement of Russia, and the Russian annexation of Crimea and invasion of Ukraine in 2014 appeared to finally cement a permanent break.</p>

<p>On April 1, 2014, <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_108501.htm">NATO suspended</a> "all practical civilian and military cooperation between NATO and Russia." By opening a dialogue with Moscow, which announced last week its desire to begin a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34784276">constitutional conversation</a> among all non-terrorist parties in Syria, balancing its ongoing communication with Washington, and asserting its legal right of collective defense with Brussels under the North Atlantic Treaty, Paris could be in a unique position to restart the NATO-Russia engagement while simultaneously delivering a body blow to ISIS and brokering a peace process for Syria. Since Russia has discovered ISIS involvement in the bombing of its Metrojet Airbus A321 over the Sinai that killed all 224 people on board last month, it has decided to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/world/europe/russia-plane-crash-bomb.html?_r=1">coordinate Russian airstrikes against ISIS with France</a>. As a next diplomatic step, Paris could host the constitutional conference called for by Russia even as it helps lead the war effort in Syria as a joint NATO-Russia coordinated assault. To accomplish such a feat, the US would have to be persuaded to abandon its red-line of Assad's continuing involvement in a future Syria. Whether President Obama is persuadable on that point is an open question, but President Hollande and the French will never have more legitimacy than they do right now to try.</p>

		<title>Patent Ownership Disclosure and Real Party-In-Interest Regulation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Xiaoying Zhang of the University of Pittsburgh, School of Law discusses how patent ownership disclosure should be regulated... </j:header></p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n June 4, 2013, the White House issued five executive actions designed to increase the transparency of the patent system, ensure the highest-quality patents, reduce abusive patent litigation and level the playing field for innovators. The first of these <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/04/fact-sheet-white-house-task-force-high-tech-patent-issues">executive actions</a> is titled, "Making 'Real Party in Interest' the New Default." The <a href="http://www.uspto.gov">US Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) took on this rulemaking mission but proposed a new term, "<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-01-24/pdf/2014-01195.pdf">Attributable Owner</a>"[PDF] rather than, "real party-in-interest" to avoid confusion with other provisions in <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/consolidated_laws.pdf">Title 35</a> [PDF], <em>i.e.</em> §§ 118, 315, 317, 325, 327. However, the proposed rules did not become part of the final rules. Instead, the USPTO decided to continue implementing the volunteer assignment recording system with improved database searching functions. Most recently, on February 5, 2015, Representative Goodlatte reintroduced to Congress his patent reform bill, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3309">Innovation Act</a>. The Innovation Act in its section four addresses the "Transparency of Patent Ownership" with the focus on patent litigation. The proposed law would require patent owners to disclose "ultimate parent entity" as part of notice before a suit can be instituted. The Innovation Act is also facing significant oppositions in House that represented voices from different industries. To be able to actively and effectively regulate patent ownership disclosure, USPTO needs a  similar deference the one like the Security Exchange Committee has from the Congress. </p>

<p><strong>The AIA Provides No Guidance on Determination of Real Party In Interest's Role</strong><br />
Patent ownership disclosure will have a significant impact on patent law practice. First, the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/aia_implementation/aia-effective-dates.pdf">AIA</a> [PDF] gives a <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s717.html">special estoppel effect to the identification of real party-in-interest (RPI)</a>. Under AIA, the identification of a RPI helps to determine the scope of prior arts under the common <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/aia_implementation/FITF_card.pdf">ownership exception</a> [PDF]. Second, for both inter parties reviews (IPR) and post-grand reviews (PGR), the petitioner must identify all RPI. The final written decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), which resulted from IPR and PGR proceedings, estops the petitioner (or all RPI) from asserting in a district court proceeding, an International Trade Commission (ITC) proceeding or any other USPTO proceeding, that the claim is invalid or unpatentable on any ground that the petitioner "raised or reasonably could have raised" during the IPR or PGR proceedings. The AIA requires that a party filing IPR <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/312">identify all real parties of interest</a> to the board to consider instituting a petition. It further provides <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/315">one year statutory bar</a> for any IPR to be institute based on a petition "filed more than 1 year after the date on which the petitioner, real-party-in-interest, or privy of the petition is served with a complaint alleging infringement of the patent.</p>

<p>However, there is no bright line rule from PTAB for a clear definition on RPI. The USPTO had admitted that the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/aia_implementation/practice-guide_for_ptr.pdf">determination of a real party-in-interest is a "highly fact-dependent question"</a> [PDF] that cannot be compressed into a bright line rule. Chief Judge James Donald Smith of the BPAI admitted that the Proposed Rules from February of 2012 deliberately <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/patent/laws-and-regulations/america-invents-act-aia/message-chief-judge-james-donald-smith-board">declined to promulgate particular factors</a> as the future PTAB intends to consider each case on its specific facts. When <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1357-2">AIA was enacted</a>, Congress did not provide the USPTO with a mechanism to police the real parties-in-interest and had no intention of doing so.</p>

<p><strong>The New Ownership Disclosure Rules Development in USPTO Draw Criticizes</strong><br />
In responding to the White House's executive actions and the market pressure, the USPTO proposed "<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-01-24/pdf/2014-01195.pdf">Attributable Ownership</a>[PDF]."  The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-01-24/pdf/2014-01195.pdf">proposed definition of "attributable owner"</a> [PDF] reaches far beyond title holder (assignee). It includes parties with standing to enforce the patent (including exclusive licensees), ultimate parent entities as defined in 16 CFR § 801.1(a)(3) and hidden beneficial owners. What's more, failure to comply with the disclosure requirement leads to harsh penalties such as being forced to abandon the patent.</p>

<p>The "Attributable Ownership" rules was widely criticized for overreaching and its harsh penalties. The Intellectual Property Owners Association (IPO) in its <a href="http://www.ipo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IPO-Comments-on-Attributable-Owner-Proposed-Rules-4-24-14.pdf">comments</a> supports the USPTO's proposal to require identification of titleholders only upon the initial filing and allowance of a non-provisional application. The IPO does not support additional rules requiring disclosure of enforcement entities, ultimate parent entities, or hidden beneficial owners, because the compliance would be extremely burdensome and fraught with potential pitfalls. The <a href="http://www.aipla.org/advocacy/executive/Documents/AIPLA%20Comments%20to%20USPTO%20on%20Attributable%20Owner%204-24-14.pdf">American Intellectual Property law Association (AIPLA)'s comments</a> [PDF] echoed some of the IPO's concerns that the proposed rule is likely to be unduly burdensome and may not provide the intended information. The AIPLA also raised the concerns that the proposed rules have limited effect on NPEs. The overly harsh consequences (abandonment) and potentially high burdens on all users of the patent system, the complex legal determination of what is an "attributable owner" may be beyond the titleholder's interest, and the potential that the information will remain irreducibly vague. The AIPLA noted that the proposed rules seem to exceed the agency's rulemaking authority.</p>

<p>Facing all the criticizes, the USPTO eventually decided to stay with the volunteering disclosure system and focus on the improvement of current assignment recording system, while the PTAB continues using RPI in post grant proceedings. However, abusive patent litigations and transparency of ownership remain the focus of the discussion.</p>

<p><strong>The Stalled Congressional Actions on Patent Ownership Disclosure Issues</strong><br />
Congress continues the discussion by reintroducing <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/3/house-section/article/h7445-3?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%223309+December+2013%22%5D%7D&resultIndex=3">HR 3309: the Innovation Act</a>, with bipartisan support in February 5, 2015 by Goodlatte. HR 3309 contained provisions that in scope and impact rivaled those of the American Invents Act. It focused on patent litigation rules and addressed the transparency of patent ownership specifically by requiring a patent owner to disclose "the ultimate parent entity" of any assignee of the patent. Further, the patentee will be under an ongoing duty to update the USPTO of any change in ownership, including ultimate parent entity within 90-days of any change. The bill seems to limit penalty of non-compliance from abandonment of patent to no enhanced damages or attorney fees for the patentee in litigation and an award of attorney fees to the defendant who spent money researching the actual ownership information.</p>

<p>HR 3309 drew both support and opposition that were broad and strong. Major technology companies whose products and customers are prime targets of patent trolls abusive enforcement tactics, have been behind a push for broad reform. Lobbyists for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry have expressed opposition to the bill. The American Bar Association focused much of its statement of opposition on what it saw as the institutional assault on the ability of the federal judiciary to manage and conduct its Article III responsibilities, with particular concern expressed regarding the degree to which HR 3309 would override rule-making authority of the courts and replace it with highly detailed congressional prescriptions for the conduct of all patent infringement litigation. The leading Senate Patent Troll bill: S.1720 did not contain a number of the controversial provisions of HR 3309. But due to the lack of agreement between stakeholders on the problem of patent trolls, Congress ended its 113th session without an integrated legislation before January 2015. The oppositions for HR 3309 reduced to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crec/2015/06/09/CREC-2015-06-09-pt1-PgH3924.pdf">HR 3924 proposed in June 9</a> [PDF], 2015 bring the attention to HR 3309's potential on making it more difficult for the inventors to protect against theft of huge corporations and fear that the provisions in HR 3309 unreasonably included all American Universities and dramatically changes the value of the patent of all, not only the patent trolls'. The <a href="http://www.techpolicydaily.com/technology/innovation-act-stalled-in-house/">stalled legislative acts</a> present the controversial and sensitivity of the real party of interests in the patent system.    </p>

<p><strong>The USPTO Needs High Deference, Not Rigid Definition From Congress</strong><br />
Ownership disclosure regulation is not a unique challenge in intellectual property market. It has been an important subject for regulation in the security interest market. Like patent ownership disclosure, the security interest disclosure regulations also faced and may still face the delicate balancing issue on adequate disclosure and proper burden for owners of all kinds. Different from USPTO, which still does not have a clear delegation for its authority on the issue, SEC was authorized to interpret and apply the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf">Securities Exchange Act</a> [PDF]. SEC was able to do so on the basis that the "undisputed philosophy of securities law was to <a href="http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1620&context=wmlr">mandate full disclosure </a>of corporate information in order to promote a healthy market that is "fair" to all investors despite the absence of a specific legal definition of the practice. The high deference to the agency allows SEC to have high flexibility and to adapt to market changes. It also gives SEC flexibility to have exceptional treatment for <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.406">confidential business information</a> that otherwise ends up in public as the compliance with the SEC regulations. It also allows SEC to set up <a href="http://www.sec.gov/answers/rule504.htm">exemptions for small business's</a> burden of compliance. Similar issues could arise in patent ownership disclosure cases. The benefit of avoiding the rigid definition from Congress will give the USPTO a flexible position to adopt to the fast developing market and technologies just like the SEC has been enjoying so far.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.cwsl.edu/faculty-staff-and-campus-directories/faculty-and-staff-directory/g/glenn-c-smith">Glenn C. Smith</a> of the <a href="https://www.cwsl.edu">California Western School of Law</a> discusses the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act...</p><strong>A</strong>ll petitions to have a lower-court ruling reviewed by the US Supreme Court are long shots.  </p>

<p>Still, the recently-filed petition for certiorari in <a href="http://www.pacificlegal.org/file/SISSEL-PET-FOR-WRIT-OF-CERT.pdf">Sissel v. DHHS</a> [PDF] &#8212; contending that the <a href="http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf">Affordable Care Act<a/> (ACA) [PDF] violates the Constitution's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art1frag23_user.html">Origination Clause</a>, which requires that "[a]ll bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives" &#8212; is a longer shot than most. Challengers have twice sought to have the court deal judicial death blows to the act widely known as "Obamacare." And twice majorities led by Chief Justice John Roberts used generous statutory interpretations to save key provisions and, ultimately, the act as a whole. The message of these decisions and their defer-to-the-political-process rationales seems to be that the court is not interested in "repealing Obamacare" by judicial fiat.</p>

<p>If it didn't face these formidable barriers (and another difficulty explained below), the <span class="casename">Sissel</span> petition could have some attractions for the justices; it raises the kind of separation-of-powers issues they have recently and avidly taken on.</p>

<p><em>Why <span class="casename">Sissel</span> Swims Upstream </em></p>

<p>Anyone betting that <span class="casename">Sissel</span> will be the proverbial salmon swimming upstream against strong odds must account for the court's recent past rulings on the ACA's legal validity. Twice before &#8212; after lengthy litigation drama and much anticipation &#8212; the court decisively signaled that it did not want to be the venue in which Obamacare was in essence repealed.</p>

<p>In the first legal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-393">challenge</a> in 2012, Chief Justice Roberts surprised many court watchers &#8212; and annoyed many political conservatives &#8212 by leading a five-justice bloc to uphold the ACA's individual mandate (the controversial requirement for most Americans to obtain minimally adequate health insurance or pay a tax penalty). In <span class="casename">NFIB v. Sebelius</span>, Roberts provided the fifth vote to reject the mandate as an unconstitutional extension of Congress' power to regulate commerce. But the chief justice then reversed course and joined the court's four more pro-federal-regulation justices to uphold the mandate under the alternative source argued by the administration: Congress's taxing power. This decision came despite the unwillingness of officials from President Obama on down to call the mandate a "tax."  And it was contrary to what Roberts admitted was the "most natural interpretation of the mandate." Still, Roberts followed the judicial-restraint doctrine that "every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality." </p>

<p>Three years later, Chief Justice Roberts again deferred to elected policymakers and eschewed a literalist reading of another Obamacare provision. This time speaking for six justices, including Justice Kennedy, who had voted to invalidate the individual mandate in 2012, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-114_qol1.pdf">King v. Burwell</a> majority relied on the importance Congress attached to federal subsidies helping low-income Americans buy health insurance. The majority rejected a literal interpretation of language tying federal subsidies to exchanges "established by the State." The court legitimated federally run substitute exchanges on which millions of Americans had acquired health coverage. The Roberts majority tied this charitable statutory interpretation, which likely saved the act from large-scale economic dislocations threatening its viability, to the need to "respect the role of the Legislature, and take care not to undo what it has done."</p>

<p>Thus, the <span class="casename">Sissel</span> challenge seems significantly star-crossed, coming as it does after Obamacare was saved not once but twice by ideologically unlikely rescuers emphasizing judicial restraint. Worse, accepting the <span class="casename">Sissel</span> claim that the individual mandate is unconstitutional would require the Court to face daunting questions about how much of the rest of the Act must also fall because those provisions are dependent on the mandate. Arguments in 2012 about this "severability" question likely showed the justices just how messy the situation could get.   </p>

<p>A final difficulty is that <span class="casename">Sissel</span> lacks another key factor often enhancing the chances that the court will accept a dispute for review: conflicts among lower-court judges about who should win the underlying legal dispute. Unlike previous Obamacare challenges, the act's compatibility with the Origination Clause has not been a lively topic roiling among, and dividing, judges in different federal circuits. The conflict is within the D.C. Circuit.</p>

<p>And what divides the D.C. Circuit judges is not whether the individual-mandate "tax" complies with the Constitution, but why it does. The three-judge D.C. Circuit panel affirming the district court's dismissal of the <span class="casename">Sissel</span> challenge held that the Origination Clause did not apply to the act; its "paramount aim" is to increase health-insurance coverage and to decrease health-care costs, "not to raise revenue by means of" the individual mandate. The four D.C. Circuit judges disagreeing with these colleagues viewed the Origination Clause as applicable but satisfied because the Senate struck the entire text of an unrelated House-passed bill and replaced it with the ACA text.</p>

<p>To convince the court to review the D.C. Circuit's <span class="casename">Sissel</span> decision, then, challengers need to persuade four Supreme Court justices (including one of the six justices who stood with the ACA just a few months ago in <span class="casename">Burwell</span>) that the theories of all the D.C. Circuit judges are so dubious that it is again worth considering whether Obamacare should be found constitutionally wanting.  </p>

<p><em>Why <span class="casename">Sissel</span> Poses Questions Otherwise of Interest</em></p>

<p>On the plus side, <span class="casename">Sissel</span> appears to pose the kind of separation-of-powers questions the justices increasingly like to sink their teeth into.</p>

<p>In recent years, the court has overcome an earlier era's shyness about jumping into executive-versus-legislative fights over the meaning of the Constitution's structural provisions. Last term the court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-628_l5gm.pdf">refereed</a> [PDF] a dispute over whether Congress could constrain the president's foreign-relations and government-recognition powers by creating an option for US passports and other official documents to refer to Jerusalem as part of Israel, despite longstanding executive-branch insistence that the United States does not recognize any country's sovereignty over Jerusalem. And the year earlier, in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-1281_mc8p.pdf">NLRB v. Canning</a> [PDF], the justices devoted 62 pages in the Supreme Court Reporter to a pitched battle over the scope of the president's power to make time-limited "recess appointments" when the Senate is not in session.</p>

<p>The argument array in <span class="casename">Sissel</span> is especially reminiscent of the architecture of the <span class="casename">Canning</span> dispute. <span class="casename">Canning</span> posed a variety of contested questions about the meaning of the relevant constitutional text and just what the framers sought to achieve by including it in the brief constitutional provisions governing governmental appointments. The different sides in <span class="casename">Canning</span> also put forth plausible, yet different, characterizations about the proper way to read precedent cases and the significance of post-adoption understandings by the political branches.</p>

<p>The argumentative byplay among the <span class="casename">Sissel</span> judges shows similar patterns of disagreement. First, there are starkly different characterizations about what the framers intended "Bills ... for raising Revenue" to include. As noted above, the initial three-judge panel viewed the language as limited to bills whose "primary" purpose is revenue raising; the panel members viewed the successive narrowing of the Clause as it wended its way through Constitutional Convention deliberations as supporting this limited scope.  </p>

<p>By contrast, the disputing D.C. Circuit judges read the framers as viewing the Origination Clause as "an integral part" of a plan "for protecting the people from excessive federal taxation." Accordingly, the dissenters would apply the Origination Clause to any taxation provisions "that raise revenues paid into the general treasury," whatever the underlying purpose of the legislation.</p>

<p>Another similarity to the 2014 <span class="casename">Canning</span> dispute is that the judicial dustup in <span class="casename">Sissel</span> reflects marked disagreement about the proper way to read relevant Supreme Court decisions. In the precedents under dispute, the only modern one of which is <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/495/385/case.html">United States v. Munoz-Flores</a>, the court consistently rejected challenges based on the Origination Clause. But why the court did so is debatable.  Plausible arguments exist for reading the precedents narrowly or broadly. Finally, there is a similar non-meeting of circuit-judge minds on what significance to afford to how Congress has in practice applied the Origination Clause.</p>

<p><em>Never Say Never?</em></p>

<p>Veteran court watchers know that decisions about which cases to take occasionally can be quite unexpected. Cases that don't seem likely to attract court review do, and vice versa.</p>

<p>So, will the attractiveness of the separation-of-powers substance embedded in the <span class="casename">Sissel</span> challenge overcome the strong hydraulic pressure of the two previous Supreme Court saves of the ACA? Or, in a related variant of the question, is Justice Kennedy's enmity for the individual mandate so strong that it will overcome his seeming coming-to-terms with Obamacare in light of the passage of time and the public reliance on it? If so, Kennedy could be the fourth vote to grant <em>certiorari</em>.</p>

<p>It will be interesting &#8212; not to mention critically important to health-care policy and core judicial-role questions! &#8212; to see how these crosscurrents play out.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=" http://www.law.umaryland.edu/faculty/profiles/faculty.html?facultynum=757">Markus Rauschecker</a> of <a href=" http://www.law.umaryland.edu/">University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law</a> discusses the recent Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act...</p><strong>O</strong>ver the past few years, Congress made many attempts to pass cyber threat data sharing legislation. Until this year, these prior attempts had all been unsuccessful. However, in April 2015, the House of Representatives passed two versions of a threat data sharing bill, the <a href=" https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1560">Protecting Cyber Networks Act</a> (PCNA) and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1731">National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015</a> (NCPAA).  In October 2015, the Senate followed and passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754">Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act</a> (CISA). </p>

<p>The basic idea behind this legislation is that sharing cyber threat information between government and the private sector or between private sector organizations would improve cybersecurity for everyone. Rather than having everyone fight for themselves, information sharing would allow government and the private sector to have better situational awareness and be better prepared against cyber threats. </p>

<p>While this concept is simple, its implementation quickly becomes very complex. There are numerous legal issues that make data sharing difficult. Moreover, the greatest challenge, as was seen in the numerous prior attempts to pass legislation, is to ensure that civil liberties and privacy are protected.</p>

<p>Private sector entities have long voiced concerns about information sharing. Absent legislation that offers protections, businesses are hesitant to share information for a variety of reasons, including the fear that they would be running afoul of existing privacy laws and anti-trust laws, or that any disclosed information would be used against them in shareholder lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions.</p>

<p>CISA, as well as the House-passed PCNA and NCPAA, alleviate businesses' concerns by establishing legal liability protection for sharing or receiving cyber threat information for a cybersecurity purpose. Pursuant to CISA, "no cause of action shall lie or be maintained in any court against any entity, and such action shall be promptly dismissed, for the sharing or receipt of cyber threat indicators or defensive measures."</p>

<p>CISA also tries to alleviate concerns about civil liberties and individual privacy violations through multiple ways. CISA defines the type of information that may be shared and the purposes for which that information may be used. CISA also requires a sharing entity to assess whether the information it shares "contains any information that the entity knows at the time of sharing to be personal information or information that identifies a specific person not directly related to a cybersecurity threat and remove such information." Moreover, once passed into law, the Attorney General will have to issue guidelines on privacy and civil liberties that will govern the receipt, retention, use, and dissemination of cyber threat indicators by the Federal government. </p>

<p>Both the <a href=" http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll170.xml">House versions</a> and the <a href=" http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&session=1&vote=00291">Senate version</a> of the legislation passed with widespread support among lawmakers. In their view, these versions address the fundamental concerns about data sharing in a better way than any previous bills.  Nevertheless, staunch opposition to this legislation remains. Critics of the legislation say it still does not do enough to protect privacy due to its <a href=" https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/eff-opposes-cisa-final-vote-approaches">broad immunity clauses and vague definitions</a>. Furthermore, doubt exists about the ability of the legislation to protect against the kinds of data breaches it is intended to prevent.</p>

<p>Many critics of CISA not only cite liability and privacy concerns, but also say the legislation would not provide better cybersecurity. Some technologists argue CISA focuses on information that is beyond what is needed for cybersecurity. Indeed, greater information sharing would not have prevented data <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/us/politics/senate-approves-cybersecurity-bill-despite-flaws.html">breaches</a> like the ones experienced by Sony or the Office of Personnel Management.</p>

<p>Even if data sharing would be helpful in some cases, CISA is clear in that such sharing is voluntary. This means private sector organizations are not required to share information and may well opt not to do so. Some companies, such as <a href=" https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/10/20/apple-says-its-against-a-key-cybersecurity-bill-days-before-a-crucial-vote/">Apple, Inc.</a>, for example, oppose CISA on the basis that their customers are against it. Apple believes it has a competitive advantage by making customer privacy a top priority. If not everyone participates in data sharing, the efficacy of the law may be further eroded. </p>

<p>Some also see cyber threat sharing legislations as superfluous. Numerous <a href=" http://www.dhs.gov/topic/cybersecurity-information-sharing">information sharing programs</a> already exist. The <a href=" http://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> shares information with the private sector through the <a href=" http://www.dhs.gov/national-cybersecurity-communications-integration-center">National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center</a> (NCICC). There are also information sharing groups such as the <a href=" http://www.isaccouncil.org/aboutus.html ">Information Sharing and Analysis Centers</a> (ISACs) or the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/isao">Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations</a> (ISAOs) where members share cyber threat information. </p>

<p>Despite the enduring critiques of the PCNA, the NCPAA and CISA, it is expected that a conference committee will produce final legislation that will pass both the House and the Senate. Moreover, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/114/saps754s_20151022.pdf">White House has endorsed</a> [PDF] CISA, meaning that a cyber threat information sharing law is expected to be enacted relatively soon. Before it does become law, opponents of CISA are hopeful that some of their critiques may be addressed in conference committee. Furthermore, once the law passes, great care and attention must be given to the development of the guidelines for data sharing and civil liberties and privacy protections.</p>

<p>Given that cyber threat sharing legislation will pass, the question becomes: What will Congress do next? Even supporters of CISA already acknowledge that threat data sharing is only a first and relatively <a href="http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-cybersecurity/2015/10/after-the-finish-line-on-cyber-legislation-copyright-exemption-worries-for-technologists-trump-talks-chinese-hackers-210958">small step</a> towards better cybersecurity. Congress must turn its attention to other cybersecurity issues. Improving critical infrastructure protection would be a wise progression given the catastrophic effects a successful cyber-attack on the power grid or a water utility would have.</p>

<p>One major reason for the overwhelming lawmaker support of CISA is the increased sense of urgency to do something in light of the scope and frequency of cyber-attacks. Regardless of where Congress chooses to go next, it should not let up on this urgency of protecting against cyber threats. Congress and all other stakeholders must work hard to produce sensible and effective laws that will lead to greater cybersecurity. </p>

		<title>A Public Banking Model for the People</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Keith King of St. John's University School of Law Class of 2016 is the sixth author in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development. King discusses  the advantages of state-sponsored banking systems such as the Bank of North Dakota and the need to serve the economically under-served with the implementation of public-sector banks ... </j:header></p>

<p><strong>A</strong> review of US history demonstrates state and federal-level efforts to address financial issues affecting the poor, either by partnering with the private-sector or by encouraging the formation of non-profit entities designed to compete directly with the private-sector. Historically, such efforts have failed. A private-sector entity, for example, simply does not prioritize the needs of the poor since it does not see profit to be gained from that segment of the population. On the other hand, a non-profit entity may begin its banking efforts with good intentions, but because it must finally compete directly with a private-sector entity more financially powerful and influential than itself, the non-profit entity likely feels pressured to adopt private-sector-like methods. In both of these likely series of events, banking in the interests of the poor is ignored. However, it might surprise you that not all banks in the US follow the aforementioned examples: a banking system that both has a high approval rating from its citizens and serves the financial needs of all within the state already exists in the US in North Dakota. The banking model in North Dakota is a state sponsorship bank used by the <a href="http://banknd.nd.gov/">Bank of North Dakota (BND)</a>. The advantages of this banking model should be adopted and used by other states in the US.</p>

<p>If implemented across the US, the BND model would grant public-sector banking entities the leverage power to stand against private-sector entities, and thereby successfully see to it that working-class individuals have the opportunity to benefit in banking where previous systems have failed. In the past, the government tried to use or encourage non-profit entities like <a href="http://www.investorguide.com/article/11829/what-is-a-savings-and-loan-association-igu/">Savings and Loans</a> and <a href="http://www.mycreditunion.gov/about-credit-unions/Pages/How-is-a-Credit-Union-Different-than-a-Bank.aspx">Credit Unions</a> to fulfill this task. However, the private-sector historically had the upper hand against these non-profit entities because the government was merely tangentially involved in empowering the non-profits and did not economically back them. The non-profit entities largely had to fend for themselves without the economic or institutional power of private-sector banks, and hence experienced economic pressure from them. The non-profit entities felt that the best way to survive was to cater to the same clientele as the private-sector banks, which resulted directly in a frustration of the non-profit entities' mission to serve the economically under-served. In a state-sponsored bank system, however, the power of a state government would be a fair countervailing force to a private banking entity, because the state would have sufficient power and adequate economic funding to better match and resist pressure from the private banking entities.</p>

<p>Logistically under the <a href="https://ilsr.org/rule/bank-of-north-dakota-2/">BND model</a>, the state sets up the bank with initial funding, and then runs the bank by using the money of the initial funding in order to fund loans for small businesses, home ownership, and even student loans. This model has been successful in North Dakota. There, the state only allows the BND to lend money to small community banks, thereby funding banks with which the public has the most contact. Under my proposal, the BND model would be expanded to include a retail banking component to supplement the main feature.  </p>

<p>Unlike the majority of states with few banking options (due to typical and massive consolidations of private banking interests), North Dakota proves the exception: it has a <a href="https://ilsr.org/map-shows-how-well-the-bank-of-north-dakota-works/">thriving community banking sector</a>. A retail banking option within the state sponsorship model would serve and function as do the smaller community banks in North Dakota. Most states are dominated by five or six big private banks. If, however, the state-sponsored bank allowed those private banks to appropriate-out the money to the community, it is doubtful that the needs of the community would truly and effectively be served (as the banks would still be large, multi-national, serve a rich clientele, and therefore unable to serve the under-served).  </p>

<p>In contrast to the big multi-national banks, the community banker knows far better the needs of the community because he or she lives there. For the state to replicate the substance of the community banking system, it would have to set up community banking entities in various parts of the state, devolving power to a community-level. With power entrusted to the community-level, people may acquire a deeper confidence in simply feeling like the bank is on their side.</p>

<p>Past attempts to address the financial needs of the poor have bent to traditional market pressures, and have thus failed.  The BND model faces far less pressure because state governments are large and powerful enough to exert pressure on the banks, as opposed to the other way around. Because state budgets and income are high enough to compete with banks in their states, the financial backing of states gives BND-like banks the ability to operate with a long-term look in mind, and to not be fearful like the non-profit entities. This has proven to be the case with the state government in North Dakota for over 80 years. The state sponsorship bank with a retail banking component would truly be a solution for the people, fulfilling the mission of serving the under-served and the poor with enough backing and confidence to compete with big, private-sector banks.  </p>

Most notably it updates the methodology for determining the cap on third-party liability for licensees, includes spaceflight participants in the third-party liability insurance as well as in the mandatory cross-waiver of contractual liability and charges relevant government authorities to develop approaches towards authorization and supervision of new categories of private commercial space activities and orbital traffic management. It also determines that 'government astronauts' can not be flown by licensees merely on the condition of a formalized 'informed consent' on the part of the former. Further updates apply to the utilization of the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html">International Space Station</a>, the involvement of individual US states in the commercial launch sector and future US government space launch systems.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2262/text#toc-HB1B6C6919D034FC48A63E282791913A7">Title II</a> amends the <a href="http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/landsat/15USCch82.html">Land Remote Sensing Policy Act</a>, which allowed for the licensing of private commercial satellite remote sensing operations, and essentially requires the Secretary of Commerce to provide an overview of licensing practices in this sector so far and any perceived need to update the statutory regime in this respect.<br />
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2262/text#toc-H0EA7BCB5C0814808B8A0772D1E270FDF">Title III</a> re-labels the existing <a href="http://www.space.commerce.gov/">Office of Space Commercialization as Office of Space Commerce</a> and rephrases its purposes.</p>

<p>Without a doubt <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2262/text#toc-H0EA7BCB5C0814808B8A0772D1E270FDF">Title IV</a> the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114hrpt153/pdf/CRPT-114hrpt153.pdf">Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act (Chapter 513 of 51 USC)</a>[pdf], which addresses in a preliminary fashion space resource exploitation by that token is the most innovative and disputed part of the Act, certainly in an international context. Considerably shorter than various earlier versions, it consists of three parts. The first one provides the short title, while the last one ascertains that, at least from the US perspective, this Act does not violate the recognized obligation under <a href="http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/publications/ST_SPACE_061Rev01E.pdf">Article II of the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (also known as the Outer Space Treaty)</a> [pdf]. The middle part provides for the substantive amendments by way of three sections.</p>

<p>Section 51301 most notably provides for the definitions of 'space resource' and 'asteroid resource', the latter being a subset of the former. Beyond this definitional Section, the Act mainly aims to achieve two things.<br />
By way of Section 51303 it ensures that US citizens, which includes US commercial operators, will enjoy ownership (even though the terms 'ownership' or 'property' are not used) over space resources once harvested, "in accordance with applicable law, including the international obligations of the United States". This means firstly that the recognition of such ownership rights is only applied to the extent of US jurisdiction, essentially meaning US territory and/or US courts, as the US cannot dictate what other states should do or the extent to which non-US citizens outside of the US could be given such rights or be held to corresponding obligations.</p>

<p>Secondly the reference to "the international obligations of the US" refers to the aforementioned Article II of the Outer Space Treaty, which prohibits "national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means". Following inter alia the authoritative <a href="http://www.iislweb.org/docs/IISL_Outer_Space_Treaty_Statement.pdf">declarations</a> [pdf] on this issue of the International Institute of Space Law (IISL), this means that no private appropriation of parts of outer space is allowable either.</p>

<p>The question whether the prohibition of ownership of 'space estate' would also give rise to the prohibition of ownership of specific resources or even of commercial exploitation thereof as such, has not been addressed by the Outer Space Treaty, and essentially has not been conclusively settled at an international level.</p>

<p>Proponents of equation of the one prohibition to the other usually argue that (1) celestial bodies as part of the 'province of all mankind' (the term Article I of the Outer Space Treaty uses to define the legal status of outer space, including celestial bodies) could only be commercially exploited, if at all, under an international regime to be duly developed, as if it were a 'common heritage of mankind'; and/or (2) that the prohibition of national appropriation, provided for by Article II of the Outer Space Treaty in quite strict and all-inclusive terms, automatically would give rise to a prohibition to apply any national authorization regime regarding such intrusive activities unilaterally; and/or (3) that, following the general context of the Outer Space Treaty's drafting, the explicit freedom of "exploration and use" and scientific investigation does not refer to commercial use.</p>

<p>The better view is that the unequivocal prohibition of appropriation of celestial bodies as such does not give rise to a prohibition of commercial exploitation. This view is based on the following arguments. <br />
(1) The baseline approach to outer space is a general freedom, which can only be limited by international consensus (such as has occurred with respect to the high seas and Antarctica, the two other areas of human activity with which outer space is most commonly compared), and there is no explicit prohibition of commercial exploitation to start with. The only relevant requirement provided by the Outer Space Treaty is thus that of Article VI, obliging states to authorize and continuously supervise non-state activities falling within their jurisdiction - which also suggests that once that requirement is fulfilled such private space activities are in principle lawful unless specific other prohibitions or conditions apply. </p>

<p>(2) Reading the 'province of all mankind' provision as a ban on commercial use as long as not subject to any international regime effectively equates it to the 'common heritage of mankind' concept, which - at least originally, see hereunder sub <br />
(2-b) - indeed required an international regime including mandatory transfer of technology and mandatory sharing of harvested materials with non-investors. The <a href="http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/intromoon-agreement.html">1979 Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies</a> (also known as the Moon Agreement), however, did precisely try to do that - it declared the Moon and other celestial bodies to be the 'common heritage of mankind' and called for an international regime to be developed with regard to any commercial exploitation - and failed precisely for those reasons: none of the major spacefaring nations wanted to sign on to such a regime. Thus a contrario the 'province of all mankind' can not be seen as an equivalent to the 'common heritage of mankind' requiring such an international regime before commercial exploitation might be allowed. By contrast it should be equated to the regime applicable to the high seas, where the prohibition of appropriation by either nations or private citizens of any part thereof does not take away their rights to, for example, fish or otherwise commercially exploit resources, as long as within applicable international law (such as for instance regarding overfishing).</p>

<p>(3) The only area of international law where the 'common heritage of mankind' concept has been actually elaborated along the lines sketched concerned the ocean floor underneath the high seas, as per the <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf">1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> [pdf] . However this convention needed to be considerably modified in 1994 precisely in order for major industrialized countries to ratify it. It does now allow commercial exploitation of the ocean floor subject to national licenses under a fairly summary international regime - such as could be argued to exist today in outer space with reference to the Outer Space Treaty and other applicable legal principles of international space law.</p>

<p>(4) 'Use' has generally come to be acknowledged as including commercial use and exploitation. From the early 1960s onwards for instance outer space was used by commercial satellite communication operators.<br />
Thus the United States respecting the prohibition of Article II of the Outer Space Treaty, by way of the current Act provides for a first step towards compliance with the obligations of authorization and continuing supervision under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty. This is also where the other substantive clause, Section 51302, comes in: it calls upon the US President to ensure that such authorization and continuing supervision will actually be properly provided for in the near future - that is before such commercial resource harvesting activities will actually take off.</p>

<p>This section also and at the same time requires the President to work on the international level towards an appropriate regime for such activities, further elaborating the embryonic regime provided under the Outer Space Treaty, as the United States cannot obviously regulate this for other countries or their operators. In that sense, the Act is also an invitation to the international community to work together towards such an international regime, hopefully along the same lines as the US national one to be further developed.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=" http://law.huji.ac.il/eng/segel.asp?staff_id=114&cat=441">Robbie Sabel</a>, of the <a href="http://new.huji.ac.il/en">Hebrew University Jerusalem</a>, discusses the continued violence in Israel ... </p>

<p><strong>I</strong>n recent weeks Israel has been facing a <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-experts-express-concern-over-palestine-israel-conflict.php">wave of "individual" terrorism</a> and the Israel Authorities are in a dilemma as to how to combat it within existing legal restraints. In the past, terrorism in the West Bank consisted to a large extent of placing explosive devices in cafes, buses, youth-clubs and even in the cafeteria of the Hebrew University, where I teach. This was frequently carried out by suicide bombers acting on behalf of the Gaza based Hamas. Where "successful" they, at times, caused devastating civilian casualties. However to a large extent Israel security managed to thwart this terrorism by employing sophisticated electronic intelligence and human intelligence sources. </p>

<p>The new wave of terrorism in Israel differs from previous episodes in that it is composed to a large extent of young West Bank Palestinians indiscriminately knifing passers-by and Palestinian drivers deliberately running over pedestrians. These attacks have taken place both within Israel and in the West Bank and ironically some of the victims have been Palestinians themselves, presumably because the attackers mistook them for Israelis. Since the attackers are usually not a part of organized groups nor do they receive directions from Hamas in Gaza it is difficult for Israeli intelligence to forestall and prevent such attacks. These young Palestinians are often motivated by economic distress and a feeling of general frustration. Targeting Israelis turns them into local heroes and their photos will be plastered on wall posters. Just recently a teenager who stabbed two Israelis to death had a school football tournament named in his honor "The Ahmad Manasrah Football Tournament" <a href=" http://unitedwithisrael.org/palestinian-school-names-football-tournament-after-13-year-old-murderer/">(Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, Nov. 23, 2015)</a>. Like their counterparts in ISIS, these youngsters are to a large extent also influenced by radical Islamic Imams who preach hatred of Israelis and Jews and encourage martyrdom in the name of Jihad, holy war. The Palestinian Authority apparently plays no part in instigating such attacks but after the event the official Palestinian press praises the attackers as holy martyrs and the Palestinian authorities pay a monthly stipend to the families.</p>

<p>The dilemma as to how a democracy can deter such attacks and combat terrorism is not unique to Israel and, unhappily, in recent times most democracies have faced this problem. In one of his judgements <a href=" http://portal.idc.ac.il/faculty/en/pages/profile.aspx?username=barak">Aharon Barak</a>, former President of Israel's Supreme Court, wrote that "Democracies fight with one hand tied behind their backs." So be it.</p>

<p>Somebody once remarked that Israelis should carry on them a warning sign saying "Be careful these people are dangerous, when attacked they defend themselves." Israeli police carry firearms as do soldiers on leave and many Israeli civilians are licensed to carry small arms. This means that Palestinian knife wielders are likely to find themselves engaged by people with firearms. </p>

<p>The criminal code in Israel stipulates that there is no criminal liability for use of force in case of self defense however the onus is on a person accused of using force to prove that he acted in self defense and that, in the language of the Criminal Code, "no alternative act was available." Additionally the police authorities have a very real interest in wanting to interrogate such attackers. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the reality is that not every person finding himself about to be run over by a speeding car or assaulted by a knife necessarily takes into consideration the wording of the Criminal Code or police interests. There is no doubt that panicked individuals have at times killed attackers where careful deliberation might have allowed a less fatal outcome.</p>

<p>Other than by armed persons defending themselves, the question remains how such attackers can be deterred. Israel unlike all its neighboring states has no death penalty for murder or terrorism and it is not clear whether a death penalty would be an effective deterrent to potential suicide attackers. Since families of "martyrs" receive monthly stipend from Palestinian authorities, some of the attackers feel they are helping their families financially by carrying out such attacks. This economic incentive has led to Israel, very sparingly, using the controversial step of sealing or <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-officials-criticize-israel-for-unlawful-demolitions.php">blowing up the houses of the terrorist</a>. This is permitted in accordance with emergency regulations that were introduced by the British during the time of the British Mandate in Palestine and continue to be part of Israeli law. Israeli courts have limited the government's authority to seal or destroy houses only to cases where the persons living in the house were aware of and acquiesced with the terrorist's activity and provided that no neighboring houses would be harmed. The government claims that this has an effective deterrent value and has even reported the case of a father warning the police of his son's plans to carry out an attack, explaining that he, the father, feared his house would be destroyed or sealed. Nevertheless, this remains highly controversial in Israel as human rights organizations claim that it is a form of collective punishment as the principal sufferers are the family of the terrorist and not the terrorist himself. </p>

<p>In some cases, the young terrorists are juveniles who cannot be sentenced to prison. A proposed step is to enable courts to fine parents if their juvenile children carry out terrorist attacks. The reasoning is that the parents should have controlled their children. Such a step would require explicit Israeli parliamentary approval and at present it seems highly unlikely that the Israeli parliament would approve such legislation.</p>

<p>Israel emergency regulations allow for administrative detention for security reasons. This is done where the evidence against the person cannot be submitted in open court since it would mean disclosing an intelligence source. Although it is an administrative action such detention however is subject to the government providing convincing evidence to a president of a district court that leaving the individual at liberty presents a real and imminent threat and the evidence cannot be produced in open court. So clearly such detention is no answer to the spontaneous acts of mindless terror that Israel is undergoing.</p>

<p>Israel authorities always have to take into account the very active role the <a href=" https://www.court.gov.il/heb/home.htm ">Israeli Supreme Court</a> has taken in supervising administrative action and at times even parliamentary legislation to ensure that they are compatible with human rights. The president of the court has stated that the court will be open to everyone: "Objections based on extraterritoriality, political questions, and non-justiciability will not be heard." </p>

<p>This Supreme Court supervision was applied in regards to methods of interrogation. The Israel Security Services claimed in court that they never applied torture (such as water boarding) but in a "ticking bomb" situation requested permission to be allowed to apply intensive methods of interrogation such as were used by the British in Northern Ireland (and later prohibited by the European Court of Human Rights). The<a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/Files_ENG/94/000/051/A09/94051000.a09.pdf"> Israeli court</a> set out the background to the case </p>

<blockquote>A large number of those killed and injured were victims of harrowing suicide bombings in the heart of Israel's cities. Many attacks&#8212;including suicide bombings, attempts to detonate car bombs, kidnappings of citizens and soldiers, attempts to highjack buses, murders and the placing of explosives&#8212;were prevented due to daily measures taken by authorities responsible for fighting terrorist activities.</blockquote>

<p>The court then describes the dilemma: "On the one hand, lies the desire to uncover the truth in accord with the public interest in exposing crime and preventing it. On the other hand is the need to protect the dignity and liberty of the individual being interrogated."</p>

<p>The court however refused to grant such authority, explaining:<br />
<blockquote>A democratic, freedom-loving society does not accept that investigators may use any means for the purpose of uncovering the truth. "The interrogation practices of the police in a given regime," "are indicative of a regime's very character."</p>

<p>An illegal investigation harms the suspect's human dignity. It equally harms society's fabric.</p>

<p>A reasonable investigation is necessarily one free of torture, free of cruel, inhuman treatment and free of any degrading conduct whatsoever.  There is a prohibition on the use of "brutal or inhuman means" in the course of an investigation. Human dignity also includes the dignity of the suspect being interrogated. This conclusion is in accord with international treaties, to which Israel is a signatory, which prohibit the use of torture, "cruel, inhuman treatment" and "degrading treatment." These prohibitions are "absolute." </blockquote></p>

<p>The court summed up: "We live the life of this country. We are aware of the harsh reality of terrorism in which we are, at times, immersed. The possibility that this decision will hamper the ability to properly deal with terrorists and terrorism disturbs us. We are, however, judges."</p>

<p>However, the court also added a provison that has been criticized by human rights lawyers whereby "[i]ndeed, we are prepared to accept that, in the appropriate circumstances, GSS investigators may avail themselves of the "necessity defense" if criminally indicted." </p>

<p>The unhappy conclusion is that Israel like other democracies has no easy answer to terrorism. Israel has been subject to terrorist attacks since its creation and for this reason, perhaps, has been less quick than other democracies to enact draconic legislation in response to recent terrorist attacks. However Israel like other democracies has to find a balance between providing safety to its citizens and preserving human right of all including those of fanatical terrorist. </p>

<p>There is apparently no magic bullet, though perhaps that is not the most felicitous phrase to use in the circumstances. </p>

		<title>A Child-Centered View of Foster Parenting by Same-Sex Couples</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law2.wm.edu/faculty/bios/fulltime/jgdwye.php">James Dwyer</a> of the College of William & Mary School of Law discusses the controversy surrounding recent removal of a foster child from a same-sex couple...</p><strong>A</strong> November foster care review hearing in Utah captured national news attention because the foster parents are a lesbian couple, and, for that reason, the juvenile court judge ordered termination of the placement and transfer of the 9-month old child to heterosexual married foster parents. What is perhaps most surprising about the event is that many people are surprised by it, as if they assumed prejudice against sexual minorities would disappear when five US Supreme Court Justices ordered states to confer legal marital status on same-sex couples. Public support for LGBT persons had grown impressively before the decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=497090211360466192">Obergefell v. Hodges</a>, but that ruling might actually have the effect of ossifying the remaining antipathy, in the same way historians believe the court's desegregation decisions did with racism and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673">Roe v. Wade</a> did with opposition to abortion. With some prejudices, success in the long run in eliminating them is more likely with gradual, democratic change than with imperious judicial mandate. If <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> has in fact caused widespread resentment, negative attitudes toward sexual minorities might remain strong for many years and manifest in a great variety of legal settings, especially those involving children. </p>

<p>Utah's law governing foster care and adoption is similar to that of other states. It <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/utah/2010/title-78b/chapter-06/78b-6-117">establishes</a> placement <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/utah/2010/title78b/78b-6-102.html">priorities</a> for children removed from parental custody. Another parent naturally comes first, followed by relatives of the child, then friends of the family, unrelated persons who are married next, and lastly an unrelated single person (provided such person is not in a cohabiting intimate relationship). An over-arching "best interests" standard ostensibly applies to all foster care and adoptive placements. In practice, this does not mean the chosen placement must be the best available after examining all possible placements; it generally means simply that the placement satisfies some minimum standard of suitability and is better for the child than the status quo (of remaining in parental custody or in a non-family setting under state supervision). </p>

<p>When an agency placing a child in foster care or an adoptive home assesses whether a placement is in a child's best interests, it <a href="http://www.rules.utah.gov/publicat/code/r501/r501-12.htm">considers</a> numerous factors relating to the future welfare of the child. These include applicants' age, physical and mental health, health habits, diet, alcohol or drug use, maturity, financial means, relationship stability, flexibility, criminal and driving history, approach to discipline, home-safety precautions, neighborhood, integration into the community, extended-family support, and other children already in the household. A unique <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/utah/2010/title78b/78b-6-102.html">provision</a> in Utah law emphasizes "the moral climate of the potential adoptive placement" as something a court must take into consideration before approving an adoption. This provision would likely influence judges in approving foster care placements as well, as these are often a prelude to adoption. </p>

<p>"Moral climate" is an unfortunately vague term that might cause some judges to make decisions based on their personal view of right and wrong regardless of whether there is empirical evidence connecting that view to any aspect of a child's well-being. This danger exists even in states and legal contexts where there is no such explicit statutory direction. Whereas there would be little disagreement that it should count against any adoption applicants that they would teach a child the art of pick pocketing, the morality of many other aspects of a family's home life would be viewed very differently by different people and arguably is something the state should not dictate. The lesbian couple in this Utah case in fact asserted that the true basis of the juvenile court judge's order was solely personal ideology. But the judge himself alluded to (though without citing) scientific findings about child welfare&#8212;namely, supposed studies showing children do better in the custody of a heterosexual couple than in the custody of a same-sex couple.</p>

<p>However, even if the judge is correct that, all else being equal, it is better for children to be raised by a heterosexual couple than by a same-sex couple, the judge was clearly wrong to disrupt an existing relationship between foster parents and a child based solely on the fact that the foster parents were of the same sex. Utah law today does not make being in a same-sex marriage a categorically disqualifying factor for foster care applicants, and there is certainly no empirical basis for assuming that placement with any same-sex couple is worse than placement with any heterosexual couple. The judge's assumption that one type of parental relationship has advantages over another would at best support making it a relevant factor, to be weighed along with innumerable other factors relevant to a child's best interests&#8212;including, especially, the value for a child of placement stability once he or she has been in a particular foster home for a significant time. </p>

<p>A more difficult case for a judge who is truly focused on what is best for children removed from parental custody would be a decision about initial placement in a pre-adoptive foster home, when there is a choice between a same-sex couple and a heterosexual couple who are in other respects quite similar. Most liberal legal scholars and advocates for the LGBT community would say sexual orientation should not be considered at all. They might argue from an assumption that there is no factual difference whatsoever between the two home situations that is relevant to the child's welfare, or they might rest their position on an assumption that gays and lesbians have a moral or constitutional right not to be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation. Either assumption is, however, suspect.</p>

<p>I cannot here canvass the empirical literature and debates surrounding the studies. I will simply make three points: First, studies that look only for severely adverse outcomes cannot establish that being raised by a same-sex couple has no adverse effect on children. That a child does not commit suicide or end up in juvenile detention does not mean he or she has not suffered at all because of the nature of his or her home life. Second, acceptance by one's peers is significant to a child's psychological wellbeing, and in many communities in the US, especially those in religiously conservative states like Utah, being raised by a same-sex couple is still today likely to result in rejection by many, if not all, peers. Similarly, other parental characteristics can also hinder peer relations for children, and a child welfare agency or judge would ordinarily consider those. Third, we should listen to the voices of youths who have grown up in households headed by a same-sex couple, and instead of asking them questions impossible for them to answer (e.g., "Would you have been better off being raised by someone else?") or too vague to be helpful (e.g., "Did you have a good upbringing?"), we should seek specific information (e.g., "Were you ever ridiculed or excluded or beat up by classmates because of who your parents are?" or "Did you ever feel anxiety at public events entailing parental participation, because you have two moms/dads rather than one of each?"). </p>

<p>The television series "The Fosters" provides a nuanced and realistic look at daily life of offspring and foster children in a household headed by a lesbian couple, and it certainly includes some struggles, even in liberal California. Importantly, this is not to suggest that such struggles are so important they outweigh other considerations, nor that children need or are entitled to a life without struggles. Rather, it is to say that having to deal with those struggles on top of the very difficult struggles arising simply from being a foster child&#8212;that is, a child separated from biological parents because of maltreatment and now desperately needing permanence and peace, is a cost child-welfare agencies and judges might justifiably take into account in deciding among available foster care placements, just as a judge would consider other potential obstacles to foster children's comfort and successful integration in a community.</p>

<p>A normative assumption that sexual minorities possess an equality right against consideration of their sexual orientation in connection with foster care placements would also be false. If this consideration is factually relevant to children's wellbeing, then children have a right to its being considered, and the sole proper purpose of a state choice of foster care placements is to effectuate any right of the child. A child welfare agency or court should be viewed as an agent for the child, making in behalf of the child a kind of decision that autonomous individuals are entitled to make for themselves&#8212;that is, with whom they will live and form a family. We adults have an absolute legal right to decline to enter into a family relationship with someone else, based solely on our judgment that doing so would not be in our best interests, taking into account any and all characteristics or circumstances of the other person that could create any sort of difficulty for us, and available alternatives. Vulnerable children should possess that <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2172484">legal right</a> as well. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Alyssa Lebron of <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2016 is the seventh author in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development. Lebron discusses the long-term effects of concussions and the need for federal regulation in contact sports... </j:header><strong>O</strong>n February 17, 2011, Dave Duerson took his own life by a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his chest. Tactfully choosing to shoot himself in the chest rather than his head, Duerson left a note to his family requesting that his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/sports/football/03duerson.html?_r=0">brain be studied for trauma</a>. Dave Duerson was one of many former National Football League (NFL) players who killed themselves because of the severe brain trauma they sustained from their football careers. For decades the NFL lied to its players about these risks by denying any link between concussions on the field and long-term brain defects. That all changed when players and their families fought back and filed suit against the NFL. </p>

<p>In 2011, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/sports/football/retired-players-sue-nfl-over-treatment-of-concussions.html">seventy-five former NFL players</a>, including Dave Duerson's family on his behalf, alleged that the NFL failed to warn them of the risks of sustaining multiple concussions and repeatedly denied a known link between concussions and degenerative brain disease. The lawsuit was inspired by recent advances in medical knowledge about football and brain trauma. In 2002, <a href="https://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/pathology/our_team/faculty/OmaluB.html">Dr. Bennet Omalu</a> performed an autopsy on former NFL player Mike Webster, who died of a heart attack at the age of 50. Upon studying his brain, he noticed a degeneration of brain tissue and other markers of decline usually present only in people decades older. Over the next few years, he was able to study the brains of five other former NFL players and found the same markers of decline. In 2005, he <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-autopsy-that-changed-football/">published</a> his findings and suggested that the repeated concussions sustained while playing football caused irreversible brain damage.  </p>

<p>With new medical research linking repeated concussions to <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cte/about/what-is-cte/">Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy</a> (CTE), and the rise of suicide among NFL players, the NFL could no longer deny the link between brain injuries and CTE. The NFL realized that their long-time denial of this link was no longer tenable. In response to the lawsuit, the NFL <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/30/sports/football/judge-announces-settlement-in-nfl-concussion-suit.html">agreed</a> to settle in late 2013. This historic financial settlement was finally <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2039302/n-f-l-concussion-settlement-ruling.pdf">approved</a> [PDF] on April 22, 2015 and is projected to cost the NFL more than $1 billion dollars over 65 years. But will it have a long term impact? </p>

<p>Although it was a hard-fought battle, this lawsuit sadly may not bring about systemic change. More must be done. The use of litigation to seek damages is a tedious and prolonged process which primarily seeks to compensate former players and can take many years to produce a settlement or a trial. In contrast, federal regulation is an alternative strategy to inefficient litigation and to insufficient self-regulation. The objective here is to establish nationwide protocols pertaining to concussion based injuries and return to play guidelines, and thereby prevent long-term harm.  </p>

<p>I propose new regulations that will mandate that sporting entities abide by the slogan, "when in doubt, sit them out."  The new regulations would impose minimum protocols for concussion based injuries for not just the NFL, but any professional sports entity found to engage in interstate commerce because the risk of CTE in any contact sport. The new regulations would include baseline testing of all players during preseason. Once a player is suspected to have a concussion, that player must be removed from play and placed in a quiet setting to allow for testing to be conducted. That testing must then be compared to that player's pre-season baseline testing to gauge whether the player has actually sustained a concussion. The player must not return to play for 24-48 hours to allow for the onset of any symptoms to appear. After the 48 hour waiting period, if no symptoms manifest and the player has not been diagnosed with a concussion, the player will be allowed to return to play. If the player does show symptoms of a concussion, the player must then go through the <a href="http://www.riorapids.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CDC-Five-Step-Gradual-Return-Protocol.pdf">five gradual steps</a> [PDF] outlined by the US Centers for Disease Control.  </p>

<p>The new regulations would further mandate sporting entities to test players for CTE if they are suspected of having more than three concussions. The importance of earlier CTE diagnoses is the availability of earlier treatments that could eliminate or minimize the onset of CTE's debilitating side effects. Additionally, the new regulations could mandate that before signing a contract, professional and collegiate athletes are advised of the risks involved with concussions. The NFL teaches rookies how to manage their personal lives, inquiries from the media and their newly acquired income. They should also be required to disclose to players the long-term side effects of concussions. The need for regulation among inherently dangerous sports has been an issue throughout the history of sports. However, today no standardized protocols exist dictating the proper steps to take when dealing with a concussion-based injury.  Dave Duerson and his fellow players who have either committed suicide or continue to suffer daily, illustrate the need for standardized protocols for professional and collegiate sporting entities. Up to this point, the only regulator of the NFL's concussion based procedures has been the NFL themselves. The absence of government regulations enabled the NFL to manipulate and conceal important information for years that was crucial to the health of its players. </p>

<p>While government involvement is not always the solution, the need for government regulation concerning concussion-based injuries in professional and college sports is undeniable. In recent years, scores of athletes have faced severe neurological defects and death due to the negligent protocols that are currently in place. These new regulations would ensure that a uniform system of steps are taken before athletes are returned to play and thereby ensure the health of athletes during their season and also during their retirement. Compensating Dave Duerson's family for his untimely death is not enough. More must be done to prevent athletes from becoming the next Dave Duerson, and federal regulation is the solution. </p>

		<title>Here We Go Again: Another ACA Legal Challenge of Questionable Merit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist Robert Field of the <a href="http://drexel.edu/law/">Drexel University Kline School of Law</a> discusses the controversy surrounding the latest challenges to the Affordable Care Act ...</p><strong>T</strong>he barrage of lawsuits challenging the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/patient_protection_and_affordable_care_act_of_2010">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) shows no signs of abating, even in the wake of two major US Supreme Court decisions upholding key aspects of the law. The latest <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/epress/Affordable_Care_Act_Medicaid_Tax_Complaint.pdf">suit</a> [PDF], filed on October 22 by three states, targets a minor aspect of the ACA's legislative scheme, but it could produce another thorn in the side of the law's implementation. The plaintiffs see yet another constitutional infirmity with Obamacare, while supporters of the law see a politically motivation stunt.</p>

<p>The three states, Texas, Kansas and Louisiana, seek to invalidate an ACA fee on insurance companies as it applies to managed care plans that administer benefits under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/medicaid">Medicaid</a> and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The fee, known as the Health Insurance Provider fee, takes the form of a 1.5 percent tax on all health insurance premiums across the country to help offset the law's cost. It applies not only to premiums paid by employers and individuals for coverage under private plans but also to capitation payments made by states to managed care plans that administer coverage under Medicaid and CHIP. Nonprofit plans that primarily serve low-income, elderly and disabled beneficiaries are exempt. The <a href="http://www.actuarialstandardsboard.org/">Actuarial Standards Board</a> (ASB), a private organization that sets standards for actuarial accounting in the insurance industry, has determined that states must account for the fee in the capitation payments as a matter of sound actuarial practice.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs assert several grounds for challenging the fee and reimbursement rule based on the Constitution and on the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/part-I/chapter-5">Administrative Procedures Act</a> (APA). The constitutional claims are that the fee creates a new requirement for Medicaid programs for which the states did not receive proper notice, that it unconstitutionally coerces and taxes them, and that relying on the ASB to rule on reimbursement of the fee represents an unconstitutional delegation of authority to a private entity. The statutory claim is that the federal government failed to follow the APA's procedural requirements in implementing the reimbursement rule.</p>

<p>The constitutional claim concerning notice is of particular interest because it seeks to build on the growing body of ACA jurisprudence. In <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/11-393.pdf">NFIB v. Sebelius</a> [PDF], the Supreme Court ruled that states must have the option of rejecting the ACA's Medicaid expansion because it represents a new condition on the receipt of federal matching funds that they did not agree to, and did not have notice of, when they chose to participate in the program. The states argue that the ACA fee similarly imposes a new condition on receipt of federal Medicaid and CHIP matching funds for which "clear notice" was not provided.</p>

<p>The prospect of losing substantial federal funding for refusing to reimburse managed care plans for the fee, the states contend, leaves them with no realistic choice but to pay. In <span class="casename">NFIB</span>, the court found that putting states in this position concerning new Medicaid conditions amounts to coercion. In <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/257789-texas-opens-up-new-obamacare-lawsuit">announcing</a> the lawsuit, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton likened it to placing a "gun to the head" of the states, an analogy the court had used in striking down the mandatory nature of the Medicaid expansion.</p>

<p>To reach the "gun to the head" conclusion, the plaintiffs' argument builds on several steps. First, although the ACA imposes the fee, it is silent as to whether states must reimburse insurance companies for the cost. That determination was made by the ASB, which concluded that capitation rates that fail to account for the fee would not be actuarially sound. Capitation rates must be actuarially sound to be eligible for federal matching funds. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which must approve the rates, has accepted the ASB determination, and in doing so, has effectively delegated rulemaking authority to a private organization, the plaintiffs claim. This circumvents the APA's requirement for notice and comment before a regulation can be issued. Therefore, states must either pay capitation rates that have been calculated in an unlawful manner or risk losing substantial federal funds.</p>

<p>Based on this analysis, the plaintiffs ask the court to strike down the fee as it applies to Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans and to order the federal government to refund amounts they have already paid on account of it. They claim these amounts are substantial, totaling $85 million for Texas, $32 million for Louisiana and $33 million for Kansas in 2013.</p>

<p>When subjected to scrutiny, several weak links in this chain of argument are evident. First, reference to standards issued by private organizations in federal rules is hardly unusual. Private standards are <a href="http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1886&context=articles">routinely incorporated</a> into regulations in numerous contexts. Examples include workplace safety <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2008-title10-vol4/pdf/CFR-2008-title10-vol4-part851.pdf">rules</a> [PDF] issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and food safety <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FSMA/ucm361903.htm">rules</a> issued by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

<p>Nor is it unusual for regulatory bodies to rely on standards issued by the ASB. Certifications for small employer health plans that are required by several states must comply with an ASB <a href="http://www.actuarialstandardsboard.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/asop026_144.pdf">standard</a> [PDF] issued in 1996 for actuarial review. Another ASB <a href="http://www.actuarialstandardsboard.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/asop028_168.pdf">standard</a> [PDF] issued in 1997 and revised in 2011 prescribes guidelines for legally required actuarial assessments of the liabilities and assets of health insurance companies. The CMS <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title42-vol4/pdf/CFR-2011-title42-vol4-sec438-6.pdf">regulation</a> [PDF] at issue in the lawsuit calls for Medicaid capitation rates to be certified as "actuarially sound" by actuaries who meet the ASB's qualifications and follow the ASB's Actuarial Standard of Practice (ASOP) number <a href="http://www.actuarialstandardsboard.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/asop049_179.pdf">49</a> [PDF], issued in 2015. This reliance on an ASB standard is entirely consistent with the other <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/10/22/aca-litigation-yields-marketplace-data-access-precedent-states-challenge-fee/">instances</a> in which regulations have incorporated references to rules developed by private organizations.</p>

<p>Moreover, ASOP 49 was not issued in a vacuum. Consistent with customary ASB practice, a proposed version was published in December 2013 with a request for comments. Several <a href="http://host.actuarialstandardsboard.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/asop049_179_CommentsOnly.pdf">comments</a> [PDF] were submitted, but none addressed the standard's application to the ACA fee. Apparently, the plaintiffs did not feel the issue was important enough to raise their concerns when it first arose and a forum was available that was particularly well suited to consider their input. Their timing raises questions about their motives.</p>

<p>Similarly, CMS's development of the regulation permitted ample opportunity for notice and comment in accordance with the APA. The rule was first <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Regulations-and-Policies/QuarterlyProviderUpdates/downloads/cms2104f.pdf">issued</a> [PDF] as a final regulation in 2002, with the reference to ASB standards. It followed publication of a prior <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2001-01-19/pdf/01-1447.pdf">version</a> [PDF] in 2001 that included a request for comments. The plaintiffs complied with it for 14 years before bringing their suit. They chose to object only when the politically charged ACA became involved.</p>

<p>Moreover, the ACA fee changed none of the basic mechanics for calculating Medicaid capitation rates. Those rates have always accounted for the cost to insurers of state and federal taxes, such as payroll and income taxes, and of taxes on insurance premiums, such one that the state of Texas, itself, levies. The cost of those taxes can change over time, and new ones are often added. When federal or state governments change or add taxes, no legal principle requires notice to states of possible consequences for Medicaid managed care arrangements. The ACA is no different in this regard.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs' next line of argument is that the ACA fee as it applies to Medicaid managed care amounts to an unconstitutional tax imposed by the federal government on the states, since they serve as the ultimate source of payment. Once again, there is no reason to see the ACA fee as any different from other taxes and fees that are accounted for in capitation rates, and the plaintiffs have challenged none of them. It can be more accurately characterized as a pass-through of insurers' administrative expenses, which are part of their cost of doing business. This has always been factored into Medicaid capitation rates.</p>

<p>Where does this leave the "gun to the head" analogy of which Paxton spoke? It is left without much of a bang. State Medicaid costs have always been subject to change as medical costs and other expenses fluctuate. When states began using private managed care plans to administer their programs, they accepted the plans' administrative expenses as a new source of fluctuation. The ACA fee adds nothing novel to this cost equation.</p>

<p>Perhaps more importantly, states do have a realistic choice with regard to the fee. They can choose to provide Medicaid benefits through a traditional fee-for-service arrangement rather than through managed care. Managed care is an option for state Medicaid programs that came into widespread use in the 1990s. According to the complaint, Texas uses the option to provide benefits to 87 percent of its Medicaid population. For Louisiana, the figure is 43 percent, and for Kansas, it is 94 percent. To avoid the fee, the states need not suffer the loss of millions of dollars in federal matching funds. They can alter the manner in which they have chosen to administer their programs. </p>

<p>Paxton is known for suing the federal government. He brought 34 other <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/politics/texas/article/texas-medicaid-obamacar-lawsuit-kansas-louisiana-6584536.php">suits</a> prior to this one, so far winning only six. Nevertheless, he saw no need to challenge federal regulations that rely on ASB standards for setting Medicaid capitation rates until the ACA was involved. Political, rather than legal, considerations certainly seem to be at work.</p>

<p>Although this case seems particularly weak, the jurisprudence of the ACA has seen many unexpected developments since the first cases were brought in 2010. The suit was filed in federal court in Wichita Falls, Texas, where it will be heard by Judge, Reed O'Connor, a George W. Bust appointee, who has <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/10/22/aca-litigation-yields-marketplace-data-access-precedent-states-challenge-fee/">ruled</a> against federal regulations several times. There is no telling what surprises it may hold.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/law/faculty/maya-manian">Maya Manian</a> of the University of San Francisco School of Law discusses the debate over abortion laws and how the future of a woman's right to choose resides with the Supreme Court as they are set to rule on a monumental case out of Texas later this term...</p><strong>R</strong>ecently, the Oklahoma Supreme Court <a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2015/10/27/oklahoma-supreme-court-blocks-warrantless-searches-abortion-providers/">blocked</a> the implementation of yet <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2015/07/01/">another</a> abortion restriction. Oklahoma has some of the most <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/sfaa/oklahoma.html">restrictive</a> abortion laws in the nation and only three abortion clinics in the entire state. In September 2015, Dr. Larry Burns, one of Oklahoma's <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/01/22/inside-an-oklahoma-abortion-clinic.html">few</a> abortion providers, filed a challenge to <a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2015/09/25/lawsuit-asks-oklahoma-supreme-court-block-anti-choice-omnibus-bill/">SB 642</a> on the ground that it violates the Oklahoma Constitution's single subject rule. The challenged legislation contains four different <a href="https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB642/2015">provisions</a> targeting abortion, including warrantless searches of abortion clinics and expanded criminal and civil penalties for violations of a broad swath of abortion regulations.</p>

<p>The Oklahoma Supreme Court recently issued a <a href="http://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/oklahoma-supreme-court-blocks-state-law-aimed-at-criminalizing-womens-health-care-providers">stay</a> against SB 642. Although this particular challenge will be decided on state constitutional grounds, in the past the Oklahoma Supreme Court has relied on the US Supreme Court's abortion jurisprudence to strike down extreme abortion restrictions. For example, in 2013 the Oklahoma Supreme Court <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-lets-stand-oklahoma-court-ruling-against-part-of-new-abortion-law/2013/11/04/bbf6dbd4-455e-11e3-b6f8-3782ff6cb769_story.html">invalidated</a> a state law banning the provision of medication abortion&#8212;abortion care accomplished by drugs as opposed to a surgical procedure&#8212;for violating federal <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/2013/111939.html">constitutional law</a>. </p>

<p>Ultimately the fate of abortion rights in Oklahoma and around the country will depend on the US Supreme Court's ruling this term in a major abortion case out of Texas, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14192682821420050675&q=Womans+Health+v.+Cole&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33">Whole Woman's Health v. Cole</a>. State courts' reliance on federal constitutional abortion law makes <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span> crucial for abortion rights in Oklahoma and nationwide. There is little doubt that Justice Kennedy will cast the deciding <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/abortion-at-the-supreme-courts-door.html?emc=eta1&_r=0">vote</a> in the case. If he remains committed to the ideals of liberty and equality expressed in his prior opinions, Kennedy should uphold meaningful protection for women's right to decide whether and when to bear children. </p>

<p>Almost twenty-five years ago in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>, Kennedy co-authored the opinion reaffirming <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673">Roe v. Wade</a>. Although <span class="casename">Casey</span> allowed states more leeway to regulate abortion than <span class="casename">Roe</span>, the decision still protected women's constitutional right to choose abortion by prohibiting any abortion restrictions that act as an "<a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-744">undue burden</a>" on a woman's right to access abortion care. <span class="casename">Casey</span> defined an "undue burden" as a law that has the "purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion."</p>

<p><span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span> will require the Supreme Court to squarely address how courts should apply the undue burden test&#8212;which will determine whether or not women continue to have meaningful <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/11/kennedy_and_supreme_court_should_vote_against_texas_abortion_law_in_cole.html">access</a> to abortion care. The case challenges a Texas <a href="http://data.rhrealitycheck.org/law/texas-omnibus-abortion-bill-hb-2-2013/">law</a> that requires abortion providers to obtain "admitting privileges" at a local hospital and abortion clinics to transform themselves into mini-hospitals pursuant to ambulatory surgical center (ASC) rules. If the Supreme Court upholds the Texas law, the number of abortion clinics in the state could drop from over 40 to about 10, effectively leaving thousands of women in rural areas <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/shuttered">without access</a> to abortion care. Oklahoma has also passed an admitting privileges requirement, which is currently being <a href="http://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/oklahoma-supreme-court-blocks-two-unconstitutional-measures-designed-to-severely-restrict">challenged</a> in state court.</p>

<p>State legislators claim that admitting privileges and ASC requirements serve to protect women's health. Professional medical organizations disagree. The <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama">American Medical Association</a> (AMA), which usually stays out of abortion cases, filed a brief in the Texas case contending that admitting privileges requirements targeted at abortion not only fail to improve safety but in fact <a href="http://www.acog.org/-/media/News-Releases/20131220Release.pdf">impede</a> [PDF] it. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C14/14-50928-CV0.pdf">upheld</a> [PDF] the Texas law, holding that the undue burden test places a heavy burden on challengers to prove that an abortion restriction amounts to a "substantial obstacle" while at the same time requiring <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/opinion/greenhouse/CaseyClinic.pdf">minimal evidence</a> [PDF] from the government that the law actually serves the asserted <a href="http://harvardlawreview.org/2014/02/in-abortion-litigation-its-the-facts-that-matter/">state interest</a> in protecting women's health. </p>

<p>In contrast to the Fifth Circuit, several other federal courts applying <span class="casename">Casey's</span> undue burden standard have struck down laws similar to the law at issue in Texas. For example in cases from <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C13/13-60599-CV0.pdf">Mississippi</a> [PDF], <a href="https://ecf.almd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2013cv0405-238">Alabama</a> and <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2015/D11-23/C:15-1736:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1661222:S:0">Wisconsin</a>, federal courts have concluded that admitting privileges mandates are a pretext for shutting down abortion clinics and therefore amount to an undue burden. Judge Richard Posner, one of the most influential and widely cited jurists of our time, best defined the "undue burden" test in his <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2013/D12-20/C:13-2726:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1262114:S:0">decision</a> enjoining Wisconsin's admitting privileges mandate: "The feebler the [state's] medical grounds, the likelier the burden, even if slight, to be 'undue' in the sense of disproportionate or gratuitous. It is not a matter of the number of women likely to be affected." Kennedy should clarify that <span class="casename">Casey's</span> undue burden standard provides meaningful protection for women's right to access abortion care, as Judge Posner articulated. </p>

<p>Commentators <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/11/justice_anthony_kennedy_abortion_swing_vote.html">question</a> whether Kennedy will continue to protect abortion rights, in part based on his 2007 opinion upholding the federal "partial-birth" abortion ban in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7079370668659431881">Gonzales v. Carhart</a>. However, <span class="casename">Carhart</span> is easily distinguished from the types of restrictions at issue in the Texas case. <span class="casename">Carhart</span> dealt with one particular method of abortion used only later in pregnancy. In contrast the Texas law impedes women's access to abortion care even at the earliest stages of pregnancy by shutting down abortion clinics with no evidence of corresponding health benefit. Furthermore in <span class="casename">Carhart</span>, Kennedy specifically rejected the idea that the court should defer entirely to the government's factual assertions in support of abortion restrictions, and emphasized: "The Court retains an independent constitutional duty to review factual findings where constitutional rights are at stake." Kennedy should reject Texas' baseless assertion that its law serves to protect women's health and the Fifth Circuit's overly deferential approach to the undue burden test. </p>

<p>Perhaps all four of the liberal justices would argue for a return to stronger protections for abortion rights as established in <span class="casename">Roe</span>. And all four of the conservative justices may argue that the court should overturn <span class="casename">Roe</span> and jettison abortion rights entirely, as <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1420796">Justice Scalia</a> has repeatedly advocated. As the <a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2015/11/13/justice-kennedy-can-save-roe-will/">fulcrum</a> of the current Supreme Court, Justice Kennedy often paves a middle path. <span class="casename">Casey</span> exemplifies Kennedy's middle path on abortion rights.</p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Casey</span>, Kennedy and his colleagues famously wrote"The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives." Since shutting down the vast majority of a state's abortion clinics without proof of any health benefit to women clearly imposes an undue burden on women's constitutional right to access abortion care, <span class="casename">Casey</span> dictates that Texas' recent abortion restrictions be struck down. Kennedy should continue to protect liberty and equality for women in Texas, Oklahoma, and nationwide by reaffirming meaningful protection for women's right to decide whether and when to bear children.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/waters.cfm">Jessica L. Waters </a> of <a href="http://www.american.edu/spa/">American University</a> discusses the implications of the Supreme Court granting certiorari to hear consolidated ACA cases... </p><strong>I</strong>n early November the United States Supreme Court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-grants-cert-in-birth-control-mandate-cases.php">granted</a> certiorari in a group of consolidated cases challenging the applicability of the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/birth-control-benefits/">Affordable Care Act's (ACA) contraceptive mandate</a>. The challenges which come in the wake of the court's 2014 decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5322529599500468186">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a>, are brought by non-profit employers who have religious objections to providing health insurance coverage for contraception.    </p>

<p>First <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jessica-waters/hobby-lobby-redux-where-a_b_8617662.html">some</a> <a href="http://www.american.edu/spa/news/waters-carrasco-yale-publication-07312015.cfm">background</a>. The ACA requires most employers with 50 or more employees to provide their employees with health insurance plans that cover preventative health services, including FDA-approved prescription contraceptive methods such as the birth control pill and the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-07-02/pdf/2013-15866.pdf">IUD</a> [PDF]. However, the ACA contains both an "<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/13-354">exemption</a>" and an "accommodation" for certain religious employers. </p>

<p>The exemption for "religious employers" is a complete one: such employers do not have to provide contraceptive coverage.  However "religious employer" is narrowly defined as an organization that "1) [h]as the inculcation of religious values as its purpose; (2) primarily employs persons who share its religious tenets; (3) primarily serves persons who share its religious tenets; and (4) is a nonprofit organization [under federal law]". The exemption is further narrowed by the requirement that it only applies to "churches, their integrated auxiliaries and conventions or associations of churches, as well as to the exclusively religious activities of any religious order."   </p>

<p>The "accommodation" is available to some non-profit organizations. The accommodation allows a non-profit organization to self-certify to the government that it is a non-profit organization that has a religious objection to providing contraceptive coverage. If it so certifies the organization's employees can still receive contraceptive coverage but the objecting organization does not have to directly provide that coverage. </p>

<p>In 2014, two organizations&#8212;Hobby Lobby Stores and Conestoga Wood Specialties&#8212;challenged the contraceptive mandate. Hobby Lobby and Conestoga argued that they had religious objections to proving contraceptive coverage but because they did not fall under the exemption or the accommodation, they would be forced to pay monetary fines for non-compliance with the mandate. Having to choose between providing contraceptive coverage or paying the fines, they argued, would violate their religious beliefs under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)</a>. The court agreed. In a multi-step RFRA analysis the court first held that the organizations' religious liberty rights were substantially burdened because failure to comply with the mandate would "force[] them to pay an enormous sum of money" for noncompliance. </p>

<p>Given this burden, the court then turned to the questions of (1) whether the mandate furthered a compelling governmental interest; and (2) whether the mandate was the "least restrictive means" of furthering that interest. Holding that the mandate was not the least restrictive means, the court took note of the non-profit accommodation. The accommodation, the court said, was evidence that there was a way to provide women with contraceptive coverage while not requiring the employers to directly provide that coverage.  </p>

<p>That brings us to the current cases before the court. On November 6, 2015, the court granted cert in seven <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/11/court-to-hear-birth-control-challenges/">cases</a>; the petitioners are non-profit institutions such as religious orders (<a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/priests-for-life-v-burwell/">Priests for Life</a>, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/little-sisters-of-the-poor-home-for-the-aged-v-burwell/">Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged</a>) and colleges/universities (<a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/southern-nazarene-university-v-burwell/">Southern Narazene University</a>, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/geneva-college-v-burwell/">Geneva College</a>). Each case raises the question of whether the contraceptive mandate and the current accommodation for non-profit organizations violate RFRA. </p>

<p>The fact that each of the petitioners has religious objections to providing contraceptive coverage is not in dispute. Rather the controversy centers on the mechanics of the accommodation. When triggered the accommodation "exempts objecting employers from any obligation to provide contraceptive <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/priests.archdiocese.bio_.pdf">coverage</a>" [PDF]. However, given the government interest in "employees of these entities hav[ing] precisely the same access" to contraception as employees of non-religious organizations, the accommodation requires that third parties (such as the insurance provider, rather than the employer itself) pay for the contraceptive <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/priests.archdiocese.bio_.pdf">coverage</a> [PDF].  </p>

<p>The petitioners' basic argument is that by certifying to the government that they object to providing contraceptive coverage, they are in fact becoming complicit in the provision of that coverage. It is the act of filing the certification, they argue, that triggers the third party coverage of contraception. For example, Geneva College argues, "Upon executing an objection form or notice, Geneva's involvement in abortifacient coverage begins, rather than ends. The precise items that Geneva objects to causing coverage for, will, by operation of the accommodation, be covered for Geneva's own health plan participants with the health plan that Geneva <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Geneva-College-Cert.-Petition.pdf">provides</a> [PDF]." Priests for Life similarly argues "pursuant to this 'accommodation,' Petitioners will play a direct, central and indispensable role in facilitating the government's objective of promoting the use of contraceptive services required by the mandate, contrary to Petitioners' religious <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Priests-for-Life-PFC-Final-for-Filing-6-9-15-Petition-Only.pdf">beliefs</a> [PDF]."</p>

<p>Much as in <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span>, the court will be charged with determining, under RFRA, (1) whether the mandate and accommodation substantially burden the petitioners' religious liberty rights, and if so, (2) whether they further a compelling governmental interest and (3) are the least restrictive means of furthering that <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr1308/summary">interest</a>. </p>

<p>On the first question, the petitioners will likely face a tougher battle than <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> andConestoga did. Hobby Lobby and Conestoga, because they did not fall within the exemption or the accommodation, were able to point to the hefty fines they would incur for non-compliance. In contrast, the petitioners in the instant cases do fall squarely within the accommodation, so they will need to convince the court that the certification methods (which would remove the need for compliance or paying fines) are inherently burdensome. In order for the petitioners to prevail, the court would need to accept, at least on some level, that the certification itself renders the petitioners complicit in the provision of contraceptive coverage. </p>

<p>Regarding the government interest, <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> may prove instructive. There the government argued that the mandate served the government interests of promoting public health and gender equality. The court did not directly address the question of the strength of those interests but rather "assumed that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the ... contraceptive methods [was] compelling within the meaning of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5322529599500468186">RFRA</a>." It would be difficult for the court to backtrack from this "assumption."</p>

<p>Finally, on the third question, the petitioners will need to demonstrate that there are other less-restrictive means of accommodating religious non-profits. Two points deserve mention. First, while in <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span class="casename"> the court noted that the accommodation was one way to accommodate employers' religious beliefs, it was careful to note, "We do not decide today whether an approach of this type complies with RFRA for purposes of all religious claims." Second, shortly after <u>Hobby Lobby</u> was decided, Wheaton College <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2548992595087349577">filed</a> an emergency injunction petition with the court, arguing that one of the certification methods in the accommodation was impermissibly burdensome. </p>

<p>That case foreshadowed the claims currently before the court. While because of the emergency injunction posture, the court did not decide the merits of Wheaton College's claim, it did side with Wheaton&#8212;essentially permitting Wheaton to avoid filing the form it objected to. Tellingly, however, Justices Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Kagan sharply dissented from that order, noting "the accommodation is permissible under RFRA because it is the least restrictive means of furthering the Government's compelling interests in public health and women's well-being." Given this apparent divide at the court, it is likely that the court's decision in these cases will largely hinge on the question of whether the accommodation does indeed meet RFRA's demand that the government find the least restrictive means of meeting its professed interest in protecting public health and gender equality.</p>

		<title>Legally Censoring Speech on Vaccines and Autism: A Response</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/profile.cfm?personID=20675">Mary S. Holland</a> from the New York University School of Law discusses the legality of censoring speech on vaccines and autism...</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>n a recent guest column, Professors James G. Hodge, Jr. and Doug Campos-Outcalt explore <a href="/forum/2015/11/hodge-campos-vaccines-speech.php">ways to limit presidential candidates' speech about a link between vaccines and autism</a>. Noting recent comments by Trump, Carson and Paul associating vaccines and autism, the authors decry the politicians' "free pass" to "spread such public health lies." They even suggest that the candidates' statements are the equivalent of yelling "gun fire" in a crowded theater and accuse them of being "brokers of public health fabrications." Strong stuff! As the authors correctly note, however, the First Amendment offers little support for their proposed censorship. </p>

<p>As a threshold question, though, how do the authors know that the candidates' underlying assertions are false? Has a vaccine-autism link been "debunked," as they suggest? With the US autism rate among children continuing to skyrocket, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr087.pdf">having climbed from 1 in 110 children in 2011 to an estimated 1 in 45 children today</a>, the question is critical. Are those who make a connection between autism and vaccines yelling "fire" in a crowded theater? Or, alternatively, are those who seek to suppress free speech trying to restrict people from yelling "fire" in a theater when there is indeed a fire, thus escalating potential harm? Can we possibly hope to establish truth without robust public discourse? I for one do not think so. The US embraces free speech more fully than any other country in the world precisely to ensure that the marketplace of ideas, and not government censors, ultimately decide what constitutes truth.</p>

<p>Enormous bodies of evidence, including federal statutes and case law, link vaccines to brain injury, including autism. Let us start with US Vaccine Law 101: because federally recommended childhood vaccines carry risks of severe injury and death, Congress passed the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-6A/subchapter-XIX">National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act in 1986</a>, effectively shielding vaccine manufacturers and medical professionals from liability for vaccine-induced harm. Congress simultaneously created a <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/vaccinetable.html">compensation program in the Federal Court of Claims</a> to pay out children for vaccine-induced injuries, including brain damage (encephalopathy) and death. To date, the compensation program has <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/vicpmonthlyoctober15.pdf">paid over $3.2 billion to 3,300 individuals</a> for vaccine injuries and death. Since Congress granted industry and the medical profession a liability shield, the <a href="https://www.nvic.org/CMSTemplates/NVIC/pdf/49-Doses-PosterB.pdf">number of recommended childhood vaccine doses has approximately tripled</a>. </p>

<p>Just what is the difference between cases of brain damage that the US government has compensated as a vaccine injury and those of "autism" that the government has refused to compensate? Several co-authors and I asked that very question in 2011, publishing an article in the <em>Pace Environmental Law Review</em>, entitled "<a href="http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/pelr/vol28/iss2/6/">Unanswered Questions from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a>" which finds that many compensated brain injury cases feature autism. The program compensated the cases for brain damage and seizures, but autism was present in a high percentage of cases. Dr. Julie Gerberding, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and now a Vice President at Merck, Inc., <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0803/29/hcsg.01.html">acknowledged on CNN </a> in discussing a federally-compensated case featuring autism that "...if you're predisposed with the mitochondrial disorder, it [vaccination] can certainly set off some damage. Some of the symptoms can be symptoms that have characteristics of autism."  In plain English, Dr. Gerberding acknowledged that vaccines caused the child's autism, as there is no meaningful distinction between "characteristics of autism" and autism, because the diagnosis is based solely on characteristic symptoms.</p>

<p>Another decision from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=JT1gBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT289&lpg=PT289&dq=02-0738V&source=bl&ots=bG1xalZzKX&sig=WlJ-IAomrdlp9JJAyZps9O1vUqs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSsI37tLnJAhWCOD4KHTb1A3gQ6AEITzAJ#v=onepage&q=02-0738V&f=false">Banks v. HHS</a>, states the reality of vaccine-induced brain injury including autism more starkly: "Bailey's ADEM [acute disseminated encephalomyelitis] was severe enough to cause lasting, residual damage, and retarded his developmental progress, which fits under the generalized heading of Pervasive Developmental Delay, or PDD. Additionally, this chain of causation was not too remote, but was rather a <em>proximate sequence of cause and effect leading inexorably from vaccination to Pervasive Developmental Delay</em>," which is an autism spectrum disorder (italics added).</p>

<p>Why would we censor Presidential candidates who concur with what government officials and civil servants have already acknowledged? Why would we seek to deter politicians from discussing a national health disaster and its plausible causes?</p>

<p>The authors suggest that vaccine manufacturers should sue candidates for defamation if the candidates finger particular vaccines. Truth, however, is an absolute defense against defamation. The irony of the authors' statement is that certain vaccine manufacturers already acknowledge a vaccine-autism link. Sanofi Pasteur's product insert for its diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM101580.pdf">Tripedia</a> includes on page 11 that autism is a reported adverse event. GlaxoSmithKline, in a confidential 1271-page report on one of its infant vaccines disclosed in a European lawsuit that <a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2015/01/recent-italian-court-decisions-on-vaccines-and-autism.html">autism is a reported side effect of its hexavalent vaccine</a> at page 626. Surely, defamation suits would be impossible to win if corporations themselves report plausible vaccine-autism links.</p>

<p>While the authors suggest that medical authorities, including the CDC, WHO and Institute of Medicine "disprove completely" any vaccine-autism link, they fail to discuss the recent admissions of Dr. William Thompson, a CDC lead scientist on vaccines and autism whose work has figured prominently in official rebuttals of a vaccine-autism link. Dr. Thompson has acknowledged, as published in a recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Whistleblower-Exposing-Autism-Research/dp/1634509951">book</a>, that CDC scientists intentionally manipulated and falsified data showing a powerful statistical link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism in African-American males. Dr. Thompson has requested that Congress issue a subpoena for him to testify. Congrssman Bill Posey has <a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2015/will-cdc-whistleblower-on-vaccines-testify-before-congress/">called for hearings</a> on Thompson's allegations, but so far, Congress has failed to act on this issue, as it has on so many others. </p>

<p>It is perhaps unsurprising that the authors would prefer to muzzle the vaccine-autism debate. By all appearances, they have staked major part of their careers on the safety and efficacy of vaccines, working closely with government on vaccines. Presumably, anything that suggests that childhood vaccines are less than completely safe and effective is unwelcome. Nevertheless, what we know from science, medicine, statutes, case law, corporate statements and tens of thousands of case histories is that vaccines are neither completely safe nor completely effective. We know indisputably that for some children, vaccines cause brain injury and that in some cases, the brain injury manifests symptoms called "autism." </p>

<p>So, may the vaccine-autism debate rage on, at the Presidential level and elsewhere, until we know fully what has caused this unprecedented condition and until we have prevented its further rise. Then, let the debate die of its own accord, not because would-be censors attempt to silence it.</p>

<p>The First Amendment and former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the US Supreme Court, <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/502/105.html">stand squarely behind</a> free speech: <blockquote>The constitutional right of free expression is ... intended to remove governmental restraints from the arena of public discussion, putting the decision as to what views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us...in the belief that no other approach would comport with the premise of individual dignity and choice upon which our political system rests.

		<title>Can Technology Help the Middle Class Close the Justice Gap?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Naree Chan of <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/">Legal Templates LLC</a> discusses how technology can help with disparities in justice...</p><strong>T</strong>he rich are getting richer. The poor are getting poorer. This has major implications for how justice is defined. The rich can afford big law firm prices, while the poor can qualify for free or subsidized legal services. But what about those left in the middle between these two extremes?</p>

                <p>The average American makes <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t19.htm">$25.09 per hour</a> as of August 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics. In stark contrast, a lawyer with 1 to 3 years of experience charges a whopping $255 per hour based on the U.S. Attorney's Office Matrix for 2014-2015. In other words, a normal American would need to work a long 10-hour day to afford just one hour of legal services from a lawyer. </p>

                <p>With the rise of legal tech startups, technology may play a role in empowering people to close the justice gap themselves, providing cheaper alternatives to hefty lawyer fees. Web-based legal platforms are also radically reshaping how people view and implement justice in their daily lives.</p>

                <p><em>First, what is the justice gap?</em></p>

                <p>Conversations about the "justice gap" depict the wealth disparity between those who lack access to basic services and those who can easily afford expensive legal fees. <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/closing-justice-gap">Eighty percent of low income people</a> face difficulties securing legal help or accessing our nation's civil court system.  Legal aid clinics, however, usually serve only those who meet certain federal low income requirements, like an annual income of <a href="http://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/by-topics/eligibility/downloads/2015-federal-poverty-level-charts.pdf">$48,500 for a family of four.</a></p>

                <p>On the other end of the gap, if you want the help of a more senior attorney, you can expect to pay over $12 per minute for a large law firm partner who bills at an average <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/average_hourly_billing_rate_for_partners_last_year_was_727_in_largest_law_f/">$727 hourly rate</a>. In practice, only multi-million dollar companies can afford to pay these expensive rates for sophisticated deals and complex litigation.</p>

                <p>For both of these extremes, technology is not necessarily playing a role to alleviate their needs.  The reality is that technology and web-based services will many times not serve the poor who often lack access to the internet. A "quarter of poor households do not use the internet at all," according to an Economist article, "<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21663262-why-low-income-americans-often-have-pay-more-its-expensive-be-poor">It's Expensive to be Poor</a>."  Sadly, for these households, smartphones are not commonplace, and phone apps targeted at making legal services will be underutilized by those who need it most. </p>

                <p>For high-profile companies, executives are not resorting to technology and web-based services to lower their rising monthly bills for outsourced legal services. Instead, about <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-curb-use-of-outside-law-firms-1410735625">58%</a> of larger corporations are keeping legal work for their in-house staff attorneys who are often cheaper and more efficient.</p>

                <p><em>Can technology help the middle class access legal services?</em></p>

                <p>Technology can offer a number of money-saving solutions for all those in the middle, from lower income families above the federal poverty line to cash-strapped businesses. Legal tech startups are creating solutions that help them reduce legal fees. Instead of going to an attorney to prepare a residential lease agreement, people now have the ability to go online and download a customized legal template for free. </p>

                <p>Americans can even easily compare prices and find legal professionals at rates they can afford. Virtual law firms are cutting out high overhead costs associated with traditional brick and mortar legal establishments by connecting clients directly with attorneys who can work remotely on flexible schedules.  </p>

                <p>Furthermore, by providing access to knowledge, technology can help people understand the many facets of a complex situation and solve or prevent their own legal problems. Internet based legal platforms provide a forum for people to educate themselves and move beyond the underlying assumption that only lawyers can learn about the law. </p>

                <p>Today, Nolo and other web-based platforms like Legal Templates empower consumers to educate themselves about the law. Learning about simple transactional documents like nondisclosure agreements are an opportunity to have a much needed conversation about expectations and responsibilities that could prevent future legal battles. Instead of relying on a third-party attorney or judge, two normal Americans can learn to ask each other the right questions and craft their own legal forms with a little technical help. </p>

                <p><em>Reshaping our understanding of justice</em></p>

                <p>Although a gap in access to legal services does exist, it is also important to understand that access to legal services is not the same as access to justice. Instead of seeing justice as a commodity to be purchased and relying on an adversarial court process, we are seeing how technology and education can reshape the way in which Americans conceptualize justice and help them to enact it in their own lives without resorting to the help of a third party. </p>

                <p>The current practice of law is paternalistic and akin to two children&#8212;a plaintiff and defendant&#8212;turning to a parent or judge for a solution. For example, at an individual level, when one person injures someone or breaks the law, the injured person can turn to our court system to ask for money damages in the civil court system as a way of "punishing" the person who caused the injury or violated the law. </p>

                <p>These fact-intensive investigations and drawn-out lawsuits have led Americans to aptly earn the title of being a litigious society. Lawyers have often been called "hired guns," an allusion to the underlying assumption that justice is a commodity that can be purchased at the right price. Even large corporations embroiled in lengthy discovery battles know that the company with the deeper pockets usually wins by surviving the legal bills. In 2008, the average cost of litigation for a company was nearly <a href="www.uscourts.gov/file/document/litigation-cost-survey-major-companies">$115 million</a>.  </p>

                <p>If justice is redefined as an individual capacity that can be strengthened, perhaps more people would ask themselves the hard questions, acknowledge their own mistakes, and generate solutions that would bring them more closure than fighting it out in the courtroom. As we learn to see with our own eyes, perhaps there will be more glimmerings of a growing individual and collective capacity to be fair-minded and cooperative. As legal tech startups continue to disrupt the traditional legal market, technology can also reframe our prevailing understanding of justice as a commodity that can be purchased by only a few to an inherent quality that can be developed by all. </p>

		<title>Drastic Changes to Requirements for Registration of Foreign Companies in Kenya</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist James Tugee of the <a href="http://law.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> discusses the potential impact of major changes to foreign businesses registering in Kenya... </j:header><strong>K</strong>enya enacted the <a href="http://kenyalaw.org/kl/fileadmin/pdfdownloads/Acts/TheCompaniesAct_No17of2015_RevisedCompressed.pdf">Companies Act No. 17 of 2015</a> [PDF] on September 11, 2015, to replace the <a href="http://www.kenyalaw.org/kl/fileadmin/pdfdownloads/Acts/Companies%20Act.pdf">Companies Act Cap. 486 (1948)</a> [PDF]. Among the many changes that come with the 2015 Act are new requirements for registration of foreign companies in Kenya. The 2015 Act is, however, not fully operational yet. Pursuant to its section 1(3), the provisions of the Act will come into force at such time or different times as the cabinet secretary may, by notice in the <a href="http://kenyalaw.org/kenya_gazette/">Kenya Gazette</a>, appoint. </p>

<p>Part XXXVII of the 2015 Act, which deals with foreign companies, has not, at the time of this publication, come into force but is expected to come into force in due course. Registration of foreign companies in Kenya is, therefore, for the time being, still regulated by the 1948 Act. The requirements will, however, change drastically once Part XXXVII of the 2015 Act comes into operation.</p>

<p><strong>Current Requirements for Registration of a Foreign Company</strong></p>

<p>Part X of the 1948 Act provides for the establishment of a place of business in Kenya by companies incorporated outside the country (foreign companies). It requires a foreign company to apply for registration in Kenya within 30 days of establishing a place of business within Kenya. Nonetheless, a foreign company is not deemed to have a place of business in Kenya solely on account of its doing business through an agent in Kenya at the place of business of the agent.</p>

<p>The registration process under the 1948 Act involves the filing of the company's constitution (memorandum and articles of association) together with some statutory forms setting out the details of the foreign company's directors, such as the company secretary, the registered offices in Kenya and in the country in which the company is incorporated and the details of at least one person resident in Kenya who is authorized to accept service of process. There are no requirements for local shareholding of the foreign company.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements for Registration of a Foreign Company under the 2015 Act</strong></p>

<p>Pursuant to the 2015 Act, a foreign company shall not carry on business in Kenya unless it is registered in Kenya, or has applied for registration in Kenya but the application has not been dealt with within the prescribed period. Carrying on business, in this regard, is defined to include, but not limited to, offering debentures in Kenya or being a guarantor for debentures offered in Kenya. Thus, once the new law takes effect, for a foreign company to offer a debenture in Kenya or even be a guarantor for a debenture offered in Kenya, the foreign company must be registered in Kenya. This is particularly problematic considering the new local shareholding requirements for registration of a foreign company.</p>

<p>A foreign company desirous of being registered in Kenya must demonstrate that at least thirty percent of its shareholding is held by Kenyan citizens by birth. This is another major change and one without any clear justification.</p>

<p>An application for registration as a foreign company in Kenya under the 2015 Act is to be lodged with the <a href="http://www.attorney-general.go.ke">Registrar of Companies</a>. The application should contain information to be prescribed in yet to be published regulations, comply with the requirements with respect to the company's name and the appointment of a local representative and be accompanied by the prescribed fee and the required documents.</p>

<p><em>Requirements with Respect to Name and Appointment of a Local Representative</em></p>

<p>In its application for registration as a foreign company in Kenya, the company may specify the name under which it seeks to carry on business in Kenya. This may either be the name of the company under the law of the country or territory in which it is incorporated or an alternative name, other than its corporate name, which the company desires to be its corporate identity in Kenya.</p>

<p>A foreign company is also required to appoint a local representative in Kenya who not only receives <a href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Service+of+Process">service of process</a> but also ensures that the foreign company complies with the requirements of the law. The local representative is personally liable if a penalty is imposed on the company for a contravention or failure to comply with the Act, if the court hearing the matter is satisfied that the local representative should be so liable.</p>

<p><em>Documents Required to Accompany Application for Registration</em></p>

<p>An application for registration of a foreign company is to be accompanied by the following documents:</p>

<p>(i)	A certified copy of the foreign company's current certificate of incorporation or registration in the company's place of origin, or a document of similar effect;<br />
(ii)	A certified copy of the company's constitution  (memorandum and articles of association);<br />
(iii)	A list containing the names of the company's directors and shareholders, and their personal details;<br />
(iv)	A memorandum executed by or on behalf of the company stating the powers of directors, if any, who reside in Kenya and are members of a local board of directors; <br />
(v)	In relation to any existing charge on property of the foreign company that would be a registrable charge if the foreign company were a company incorporated in Kenya, the documents that would be required to be lodged for registration with the Registrar of Companies;<br />
(vi)	Notice of the address of the company's registered office in its place of origin, if any; otherwise, the address of its principal place of business in its place of origin; and<br />
(vii)	Notice of the address of the company's registered office in Kenya.</p>

<p><strong>Other Changes Affecting Foreign Companies</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the registration requirements, the 2015 Act introduces, <em>inter alia</em>, the following changes which affect foreign companies:</p>

<p>(i)	Safeguards against the disclosure of a natural person's residential address where this information is required to be provided by the company;<br />
(ii)	A mechanism for the appointment of a liquidator of a foreign company in respect of the foreign company's property in Kenya; and<br />
(iii)	The recognition that a foreign company may have a local board of directors with specific powers in addition to its foreign directors.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Consequences of the New Registration Requirements </strong></p>

<p>It will obviously be more difficult and burdensome for foreign companies to do business in Kenya in light of the new registration requirements. Indeed, if a foreign company carries on business in Kenya without registration, the company and each of its officers in default commit an offence and, on conviction, each of them is liable pay a fine of five million <a href="http://www.xe.com/currency/kes-kenyan-shilling">shillings</a>. </p>

<p>The new registration requirements &#8212; particularly the shareholding requirements &#8212; are likely to discourage foreign companies from doing business in Kenya or, at least, from registering as foreign companies. Most of the foreign companies that are still desirous of doing business in Kenya are now likely to incorporate subsidiaries in Kenya instead.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/bonnie-docherty">Bonnie Docherty</a> of Human Rights Watch discusses the need to strengthen existing international law on incendiary weapons ...</p>

                <p><strong>I</strong>ncendiary weapons inflict almost unrivaled cruelty on their victims. Photos taken after an incendiary weapon attack on a Syrian school show the charred bodies of children, who must have experienced unimaginable agony. The weapons cause excruciatingly painful burns, and treatment for survivors requires sloughing off dead skin, which has been likened to being flayed alive. While individuals often react to accounts of such suffering with horror, government efforts to minimize the harm from these weapons by strengthening international law have been unacceptably slow. </p>

                <p>Many countries have expressed outrage at the use of incendiary weapons over the past five years, including at meetings of the <a href= "http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/%28httpPages%29/4F0DEF093B4860B4C1257180004B1B30?OpenDocument">Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW)</a>, the treaty that regulates the weapons. The voices of these countries are crucial and they should continue to raise the issue. But it is time to move from condemnation to concrete action. A major disarmament conference scheduled for next year presents an excellent opportunity for progress. </p>

                <p>Incendiary weapons produce heat and fire through the chemical reaction of a flammable substance. They can be designed to burn people or materiel, serve as smokescreens or provide illumination. People who survive attacks with incendiary weapons not only experience physical injuries, but also frequently endure psychological trauma, permanent disfigurement and difficulties reintegrating into society.</p>

                <p>Over the past two years Human Rights Watch has documented new use of incendiary weapons in Syria and Ukraine, and it is investigating allegations of use in Libya and Yemen in 2015. A <a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/supporting_resources/incendiaries-5_year_review-final_0.pdf">report</a> [PDF] recently released by <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> and Harvard Law School's <a href="http://hrp.law.harvard.edu/">International Human Rights Clinic</a> provides evidence of these attacks, along with a five-year review of developments on the issue and recommendations for next steps. </p>

                <p>Existing international law has failed to prevent the harm caused by incendiary weapons. <a href="http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/%28httpAssets%29/B409BC0DCFA0171CC12571DE005BC1DD/$file/PROTOCOL+III.pdf">Protocol III</a> of the Convention on Conventional Weapons, adopted in 1980, restricts use of incendiary weapons in "concentrations of civilians." As of December 2015, 112 countries had joined the protocol. </p>

                <p>But two key shortcomings have limited its effectiveness. First, it defines "incendiary weapon" as being "primarily designed to set fires to objects or to cause burn injury to persons." As a result some countries maintain that it excludes munitions with incendiary effects, such as those containing white phosphorus. Although primarily designed to function as smokescreens these weapons inflict suffering comparable to other incendiary weapons. White phosphorus burns through flesh to the bone and can reignite when bandages are removed and the substance is exposed to oxygen. </p>

                <p>The protocol also makes an arbitrary distinction between air-dropped and ground-launched incendiary weapons, creating exceptions for certain uses of ground-launched weapons. The delivery system is irrelevant to the victims, however, and ground-launched models have become increasingly common and accessible even to non-state armed groups. </p>

                <p>The solution to these problems is legally, if not politically, quite simple. Protocol III should be amended to define the weapons based on their effects rather than their design. And it should at a minimum prohibit the use of all incendiary weapons in concentrations of civilians, regardless of their delivery system. An absolute ban would have the greatest humanitarian benefit. </p>

                <p>Over the past five years about three dozen countries, along with the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UN secretary-general and independent groups, have spoken out about this issue at meetings of the Convention on Conventional Weapons and other UN bodies, and in letters to Human Rights Watch. Most have highlighted the humanitarian impact of incendiary weapons in general or condemned recent use. Many have urged treaty members to strengthen Protocol III or said they are willing to discuss the adequacy of the protocol. </p>

                <p>At the most recent meeting of the states parties, held at the UN in Geneva in November, momentum continued to grow. About <a href="http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/%28httpPages%29/0D4B67A1E11A22BCC1257A410052DE38?OpenDocument">15 countries</a> publicly addressed the incendiary weapons issue, more than in previous years, and others privately expressed support for reviewing Protocol III. A majority of these countries called for closing the protocol's loopholes while others said they wanted to revisit existing rules. Six countries commented on incendiary weapons for the first time in this forum, demonstrating the increasing recognition of the problem and need to take action. The meeting's final report included a reference to concerns about incendiary weapons for the fifth consecutive year. Such developments are encouraging. </p>

                <p>But amending international law is a slow process and there will be hurdles to success. At the November meeting Russia said the proposal to pursue formal discussions on incendiary weapons would be "counterproductive." Given that the treaty's rules require decisions to be made by consensus, Russia alone could block further progress. Russia's statement on the issue was its first in a meeting of this treaty, however, meaning that at least it takes the calls for change seriously.</p>

                <p>The treaty's Fifth Review Conference&#8212;a meeting held every five years&#8212;is scheduled for next December and will be an important opportunity for countries to take action. There treaty members will reflect on developments since the last review conference in 2011 and make plans for the next five years. Review conferences have historically been pivotal in the evolution of the treaty and its protocols.</p>

                <p>In the coming months countries should ensure that incendiary weapons are placed on the agenda for the review conference. At the conference itself they should continue to express their concerns and agree to a new mandate that sets aside time to discuss the implementation and adequacy of Protocol III. The goal should be to negotiate the amendments needed to strengthen the protocol. <br />
                    <br />
                    When Protocol III was adopted in 1980, some countries criticized its regulations of incendiary weapons as inadequate. They contended that there had been strong support for a ban but that compromise had watered down the final product. Several held out hope that the protocol's failings would one day be addressed and recommended that the instrument be improved at a future review conference.</p>

                <p>Thirty-five years later that has yet to happen, but it is not too late. The horrendous suffering incendiary weapons have caused civilians in recent years and the growing international opposition mean that the time has come to act. Countries should seize the opportunity presented by the 2016 review conference and take tangible steps to increase the protection of civilians from incendiary weapons. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Duke M. Truong of the Valparaiso University School of Law, Class of 2017, discusses the issues the US is facing in accepting Syrian refugees in fear of terrorist attack... </j:header><strong>E</strong>ighty-one percent of Americans see a major terrorist <a href="http://bit.ly/1Yl0Nc1">attack as likely</a> following the Paris massacres on November 13, 2015. Overcome with fear, Americans are opposed to the Obama Administration's plan to resettle at least 10,000 Syrian refugees. A recent poll shows that 54 percent of Americans are opposed to taking in refugees from Syria and other countries of the Middle East. Governors from 31 states have opposed the resettlement plan.</p>

<p><a href="http://wapo.st/1N7m72K">Governor Mike Pence</a> of Indiana said, "In the wake of the horrific attacks in Paris, effective immediately, I am directing all state agencies to suspend the resettlement of additional Syrian refugees in the state of Indiana pending assurances from the federal government that proper security measures have been achieved."</p>

<p>Many argue that ISIS jihadists and other terrorists could infiltrate the US by posing as refugees. It is awfully rash to make such an assumption without careful consideration. Should we disregard the facts because we fear our security is threatened? Although fears of a terror strike on American soil is credible, we must know to distinguish fact from fiction.</p>

<p>Americans fear that terrorists may hide among the Syrian refugees who enter the US through the resettlement plan, but America's fear of viewing Syrian refugees as a security threat is a baseless knee-jerk reaction.</p>

<p><strong>How likely are terrorists to sneak into the US through the Refugee Resettlement Program?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1Tf0jkj">Refugee Resettlement Program</a> involves our nation's top security branches. It includes the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Department and national intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>Refugees must go through a <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1QCAcG4">multi-layered security</a> process. This can take between 18 to 24 months to complete. According to the <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1MYgoWS">Department of State</a>, the safeguards involves the use of biometrics or fingerprints, biographic checks and lengthy in-person interviews. Also, Syrian refugees must go through added forms of security screenings.  The process of which are so stringent that details remain classified. The US has the most rigorous refugee screening process in place. Our multi-layered security process is there to discourage terrorists from posing as refugees.</p>

<p>If we allow our fears to overcome our reasoning, then we are calling into question the security measures that have kept us safe and secured since 9/11. According to the <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/">Migration Policy</a> Institute, of the <a href="http://bit.ly/1I1Yz85">784,395 refugees</a> the US have welcomed since 9/11, three have been arrested on charges of terrorism. Two of the three arrestees planned to carry out their attacks overseas and the third had no credible plans.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that terrorists will slip into our country given the enhanced security we have in place. If terrorists are inclined on carrying out their attacks, then why would they risk being caught and jeopardize their clandestine enterprise while they wait for 24 months in a refugee camp? We need not fear the Syrian refugees but instead turn our attention to the porous <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1hkF0QW">Visa Waiver Program</a> (VWP). The VWP poses a greater threat to America's security.<br />
	<br />
<strong>Does the Visa Waiver Program pose a greater security threat to America?</strong></p>

<p>There are 38 countries who work in tandem with the US in the practice of waiving visas for short-term visits. France, Belgium and Germany are among the European countries under the visa waiver program. The <a href="http://bit.ly/1HgDjAI">Paris attackers</a> hailed from Belgium, France and Brussels. The VWP screening process is minimal compared to the Refugee Resettlement Program.</p>

<p>Citizens from the participating countries are permitted to travel to the US either for tourism or business for stays up to 90 days. Terrorists who may come from the participating countries and not yet on any watch list could easily travel to the US under the VWP.</p>

<p>Senators <a href="http://wapo.st/1LycIKc">Flake and Feinstein</a> from Arizona and California, respectively, have called for the tightening of the visa waiver program because of the high security threat. The two senators are working to introduce legislation that would prohibit entry for anyone who has visited Syria or Iraq in the past five years. Many lawmakers have agreed that the visa waiver program poses a greater security threat than refugee admissions.</p>

<p>Because some of the Paris attackers were not on a watch list or no-fly list, they could have entered the US with a visa waiver.</p>

<p>Foreign Affairs Chairman<a href="http://1.usa.gov/1PXO5Nr"> Bob Corker</a> declared, "The visa waiver program potentially is the place where there's greater gaps, possibly, than the refugee program itself." The visa waiver program is more porous than the refugee resettlement program and terrorists can easily exploit this to their advantage.</p>

<p>Besides tightening our security in the refugee resettlement and visa waiver programs, we must have better intelligence to stay steps ahead of the terrorists. With all the worries over security threats, are we to turn our backs on refugees who face legitimate fears for their lives and well-being?</p>

<p>Have we allowed our fears to engulf our sense of humanity?</p>

<p><a href="http://1.usa.gov/1UWeCj0">The Refugee Act of 1980 </a>authorizes the US to admit refugees. A refugee "is a person fleeing his or her country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion."</p>

<p>On November 17, 2015, Congressman <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1SquVPJ">Bradley Byrne</a> introduced <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1Q6Besj">H. R. 4031</a> to defund the Syrian resettlement program. H.R. 4031 explicitly singles out "any alien who is a national of Syria or whose last habitual residence was in Syria" to make it clear that Syrians are unwelcomed.</p>

<p>Syrian refugees are seeking liberty and safety from an oppressive government. These same refugees H.R. 4031 seeks to keep out share the same fears we harbor and that is the fear of being victims of terrorism. We must separate fact from fiction and not let our fears cloud our reasoning.</p>

<p>The resettlement program is not a conduit for terrorists. America has admitted <a href="http://bit.ly/1I1Yz85">2,174 </a>Syrian refugees since 9/11 and none have been involved in any charges relating to terrorism. Refugees are willing to embrace their new country and become <a href="http://bit.ly/1N664Mv">naturalized</a>, especially Syrians.</p>

<p>Many refugees in the past have and many in the future will integrate and add to America's distinct cultural fabric. The <a href="http://www.providenceforum.org/spiritoflibertyspeech">Honorable Learned Hand</a> once declared, "Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it; no constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it."</p>

<p>The US' resettlement program is the largest in the world. We must continue to help because welcoming others is the American way. The security threat we are faced with may never end, but we should not allow our fears to engulf our sense of humanity.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Kendra Julian of <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University School of Law</a>, Class of 2017, discusses the need for states to enact hate crime legislation...</j:header><strong>W</strong>e don't like you. Get out. You don't belong. We're superior to you. These phrases all lead to a common message&#8212;a message of fear and intimidation. Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/19/urban-league-religious-groups-back-democratic-push-hate-crime-law/74229640/">Indiana</a>, along with Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina and Wyoming, remains one of five states without hate crime laws. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.justice.gov/crs/hate-crime">Hate crimes</a> consist of the violence of intolerance and prejudice, intended to hurt and intimidate someone because of their race, ethnicity, national origin, religious, sexual orientation or disability. However, it was not until 2009 that the federal hate crime laws included acts against gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability. According to <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/19/urban-league-religious-groups-back-democratic-push-hate-crime-law/74229640/">Miriam Zeidman</a>, Midwest civil rights counsel for the Anti-Defamation League, "Hate crimes are meant to send a message of intimidation to the individual and to the community. We need to be able to send counter-messages...ones of equality, ones that say the community won't tolerate hate crimes."</p>

<p>For the past 15 years, Indiana State Representative, Gregory Porter has advocated for Indiana legislation to stiffen penalties for crimes motivated by biases. While he has consistently failed to pass previous motions, he is now being supported by Marion County Prosecutor, Terry Curry, the Indianapolis Urban League, and several religious groups, including the Indianapolis Jewish Community Relations Council. According to <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/19/urban-league-religious-groups-back-democratic-push-hate-crime-law/74229640/">Porter</a>, "We have a coalition of individuals saying enough is enough...these are issues we need to address." As crime, hate and violence continues to escalate in our country, Indiana must "catch-up" by implementing stiffer sentences for hate crimes because these types of crimes are the most likely to create or exacerbate tensions, which can trigger larger community-wide racial conflict, civil disturbances and even riots. The timely discussion can be aided by the attention on expanding anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Hoosiers, <a href=" http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/08/temporary-not-guilty-plea-entered-for-charleston-shooting-suspect.php">the church shooting</a> [JURIST report] in Charleston, South Carolina, the arrest of an Indiana University student accused of shouting "white power" as he attacked a Muslim woman, a Texan accused of murdering best friend's boyfriend and most recently the Planned Parenthood Shooting. </p>

<p>The future of imposing state hate crime laws could allow a judge to impose stiffer penalties when a crime is proved to be motivated by bias. Therefore, when a murder has been committed, a harsher sentence could be imposed contingent upon the intent of the murderer. For example, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marc-pourner-anti-gay-hate-crime_564e3715e4b00b7997f9f8f5">David James Brown</a>, a 22-year-old Texas man, was arrested on November 17, 2015, in Indiana for allegedly kidnapping and killing a gay man in Texas. While investigators are attempting to determine a potential motive, the victim's parents believe the murder was a hate crime. The disturbing fact of this case is that Brown was reported to be best friends with the victim's boyfriend. Under Texas Penal Code <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/docs/PE/htm/PE.12.htm">Section 12.47</a>, the sentencing for a crime involving bias or prejudice, other than a First Degree Felony or a Class A Misdemeanor, is increased to the next highest category of offense, with a minimum increased term of 180 days of confinement. Therefore, Brown is being charged with Capital Murder rather than First Degree Murder making him eligible for the death penalty. Under <a href=" http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CR/htm/CR.42.htm">Article 42.014</a> of the Texas Penal Code, the judge may also require the defendant to attend an educational program on tolerance. Chapter 12 of the Texas Penal Code provides that a Texas First Degree Felony is punishable by life imprisonment for not more than 99 years or less than 5 years and a fine not to exceed $10,000. Thus, states lacking state hate crime laws are allowing criminals motivated by biases to not serve their maximum sentence. Rather, the state virtually pardons the motive of the crime and allows ignorance to be acceptable amongst those wrong-doers. </p>

<p>Hate crimes include the use of explosives, arson, weapons, vandalism, physical violence and verbal threats of violence to instill fear in their victims, leaving them vulnerable to more attacks and feeling alienated, helpless, suspicious and fearful. Conversely, others may become frustrated and angry if they believe the local government and other groups in the community will not protect them. When perpetrators of hate are not prosecuted as criminals and their acts not publicly condemned, their crimes can weaken even those communities with the healthiest race relations. For example, the recent Planned Parenthood shooting in Colorado Springs has been <a href=" http://dailycaller.com/2015/11/29/ben-carson-calls-planned-parenthood-shooting-a-hate-crime-video/">called a hate crime</a> by presidential candidate Ben Carson, while witnesses say the gunman was motivated by his opposition to abortion. Currently, it is unclear whether the shooting was intended to send an ideological message; however, speculations continue to mount over what motivated the attack and how authorities will prosecute the suspect. Nevertheless, hate crimes ultimately put cities, towns, states and the nation at risk of serious social and economic consequences. Instantaneous costs of arising racial and civil conflicts consist of longer hours resulting in overtime for police officers, fire-fighters, doctors, and medical personnel, an increase in injury or death, loss of businesses and residential property and vehicle and equipment damage. Over time, recovery can be hindered by a decline in property values, due to lower tax revenues, scarcity of funds for rebuilding, and increased insurance rates. Unfortunately, both businesses and residential housing are left abandoned in neighborhoods due to the hate crimes committed which leaves empty buildings to attract higher rates of crime. The quality of education also declines in these areas due to the loss of tax revenue. A municipality is often left with no choice but to cut services, raise taxes or leave the area in its post-riot condition until the market forces the supply and demand of an area to rebuild. Thus, hate crime laws should be deterring criminals rather than allowing individuals or groups to continue to terrorize communities by pardoning hate, intimidation and fear.</p>

<p>Supporters of hate crime legislation should keep in mind an individual found guilty of a capital felony crime, where the state seeks the death penalty, is punishable by life imprisonment without parole or by death. By allowing stricter punishment, it could help to deter future hate crimes. While Indiana currently requires law enforcement agencies to report bias-motivated crimes to the state, they still go unreported due to the victim's fear of intimidation, embarrassment or distrust of law enforcement. Furthermore, Zeidman encourages communities to address incidents of bias, even when they don't rise to the level of being crimes. "The community can criticize the prejudiced message" to prevent biases from being normalized and acts of violence from being accepted. </p>

<p>While there is a lack of awareness and education about hate crimes, the FBI crime statistics report that Indiana logged 75 hate crime incidents of the 5,928 reported across the nation in 2013. Why not tackle the problem head-on before it becomes an epidemic? In a society where social media grants people the anonymity to freely express their biases without consequences, we have made it acceptable for people to say hateful things. "The more it becomes OK," says Toby Miller, director of the Greater Indianapolis Progress Committee's Race and Cultural Relations Leadership Network, "it breeds that next level." A stand must be taken, ignorance is not the new tolerance, and the purveyors of hate should no longer be a protected class in these five states.  </p>

<p>Enacting legislation to pass hate crime laws does not interfere with our first amendment right of free speech by criminalizing our thoughts and or beliefs. Thus, a crime still must be carried out. The legislation would allow for Indiana and the remaining states to hold intolerant criminals with some real accountability. We would be sending the counter-message that we should not fear to be someone we are not to fit into the majority; but rather, we must be accepting of all or pay the ultimate price. </p>

		<title>When in Doubt, Sit Them Out: Youth Sports Concussion Awareness</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Carrie Clodi of Valparaiso University School of Law Class of 2017 discusses legislation regulating youth and student athlete sport participation after concussion or head injury and the necessity of continued awareness of student athlete safety ... </j:header></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> estimates that as many as 3,900,000 sports-related and recreation-related <a href="http://concussionfoundation.org/">concussions </a>occur in the US each year. While this number is shocking, additional statistics indicate that only one in six concussions are actually diagnosed correctly. Therefore, 3.9 million could be a low estimate of the actual concussions seen per year.  </p>

<p>Some initial symptoms resulting from a concussion include a headache, short-term memory loss and dizziness. While some student athletes' symptoms include post-concussion syndrome (PCS) with symptoms lasting six weeks or less, others' symptoms last longer than this. </p>

<p>To address these alarming statistics, the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) created a formal concussion management policy in 2011 that included concussion and head injury information. On August 3, 2015, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner revised this <a href="http://wqad.com/2015/08/10/illinois-adds-changes-to-high-school-concussion-policy/">policy</a> by signing into law Senate Bill 7 (later becoming the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=099-0245">Youth Sports Concussion Safety Act</a>), requiring students who suffer a concussion to receive permission from a doctor or trainer before they are allowed to fully return to sports. This act pertains to any youth sports activity sponsored or sanctioned by a youth sports league, including, but not limited to school district and park district sporting teams. </p>

<p>With the passage of this significant <a href="http://ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=09900SB0007sam001&GA=99&SessionId=88&DocTypeId=SB&LegID=83721&DocNum=7&GAID=13&Session=">bill</a>, Congress recognized that continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to greater injury and even death. The General Assembly acknowledged that, despite having generally recognized return-to-play standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in actual or potential physical injury or death.</p>

<p><strong>Concussion Oversight Team</strong></p>

<p>First, the <a href="http://ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=09900SB0007sam001&GA=99&SessionId=88&DocTypeId=SB&LegID=83721&DocNum=7&GAID=13&Session=">Youth Sports Concussion Safety Act</a> requires appointment of a Concussion Oversight Team. Each team is charged with establishing a return-to-play protocol for a player's return to activity following a force or impact believed to have caused a concussion. This policy must be both based on peer-reviewed scientific evidence, and follow the Centers Disease Control and Prevention Guidelines. Participants on the team must include, to the extent practicable, at least one physician. In addition, if the youth sports league employs a personal trainer, that individual must be included as well.</p>

<p>While the presence of physicians and personal trainers would prove advantageous, including additional personnel is not a viable reality for most youth leagues in Illinois. Most school districts in Illinois do not have access to a personal trainer. In addition, due to current financial constraints, most districts do not have the ability to hire medical personnel. Such expertise, in theory, would be advantageous, but is just not a realistic option for most agencies. This consequently leaves the concussion teams without the medical guidance that it requires.  </p>

<p><strong>Return-to-play restrictions and procedures</strong></p>

<p>Secondly, the Youth Sports Concussion Safety Act requires the player's parent/guardian or another person with legal authority to make medical decisions for the player through use of written, informed consent. The consent must explain concussion prevention, symptoms, treatment and guidelines for safely resuming participation in an athletic activity following a concussion. The player shall be removed from a sponsored youth sports activity immediately if any of the participants feel the player might have sustained a concussion.  This includes a coach, physician, game official, athletic trainer, licensed healthcare professional, player's parent or guardian, or the player himself or herself.  </p>

<p>These guidelines are in effect during game situations and practices. According to a study published in May 2015 in the <a href="http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2281575">Journal of American Medical Association&#8212;Pediatrics</a>, 58 percent of concussions are suffered at practices. Often times, limited personnel are available to monitor for the potential of concussions during practices. It is crucial, then, to ensure appropriate training and awareness of all coaches who are involved.  </p>

<p>The Youth Sports Concussion Safety Act further stipulates that a player removed from a sponsored youth sports activity with the potential of a concussion is not permitted to practice or compete again until:</p>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> the player has been evaluated by a treating physician or by an athletic trainer under physician supervision;<br />
<strong>(2)</strong> the player has successfully completed each requirement of the return-to-play protocol established by the Youth Sports Concussion Safety Act; <br />
<strong>(3)</strong> the treating physician or athletic trainer has provided a written statement including that, in the physician's professional judgment, it is safe for the player to return to play; and,<br />
<strong>(4)</strong> the player and the player's parent/guardian have:<br />
          (a) acknowledged completion of the return-to-play requirements;<br />
          (b) provided the physician's release; and<br />
          (c) signed an informed consent.</p>

<p>While these new restrictions seem unrealistic, most high school coaches are not medically trained to recognize concussions. Within the initial guidelines from 2011, coaches were required to pass an on-line concussion training.  However, this "training" allowed for a 100 percent passage rate and did not educate coaches as intended.</p>

<p>Furthermore, parents are often removed from practices and game situations.  Parents have been given a substantial role within the Youth Sports Concussion Safety Act, as they should have. Sports are second only after motor vehicle crashes as the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2140075/">leading cause of traumatic brain injury</a> among people aged 15 to 24. We, as parents, should have the right and responsibility of making the crucial decision regarding our children's readiness to return to and continuation of sporting events under these critical situations. When it doubt, sit them out!</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/probability-competing-beyond-high-school">NCAA</a> statistics, of the nearly eight million students currently participating in high school athletics in the US, only 460,000 of them will compete at NCAA colleges. That is less than 6 percent. And of that group, only a fraction will realize their goal of becoming a professional athlete. These percentages confirm that participation in sports at the elementary and high school level is not to prepare children for a lifetime of competition, but rather to teach valuable life-lessons. With the potential of catastrophic long-term effects from concussions, it is just not worth the risk to continue playing when a concussion is potentially present!</p>

<p>The Youth Sports Concussion Safety Act certainly heightens community awareness about long-term effects for our children who experience concussions. While some portions of the Act are not feasible, awareness of the concerns should benefit those affected by concussions. The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> says it best: "When it doubt, sit them out!"</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Ashley Merritt of the <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University School of Law</a> discusses the effectiveness of mandatory minimum sentencing laws on deterring gun violence... </j:header><strong>I</strong>n response to a disturbing rise in homicides and violent gun crime, Indianapolis Mayor <a href="http://www.indy.gov/egov/mayor/Pages/home.aspx">Greg Ballard</a> has suggested a solution: harsher mandatory minimum sentences for charges involving firearms. Earlier this year, Mayor Ballard <a href="http://wishtv.com/2015/09/07/ballard-theres-a-pretty-obvious-way-to-reduce-gun-violence/">stated</a> that he believed stiffer punishments for gun crimes may help alleviate the city's gun violence epidemic. He even went so far as to say that he would like to see a mandatory sentence of at least 20 years imposed for gun crimes. </p>

<p>In Indianapolis, law enforcement officials are <a href="http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2015/04/28/indianapolis-murder-rate">struggling</a> to fight back against the recent upsurge in gun-related murders. Last year alone, there were at least 138 homicides&#8212;a 44 percent increase from 2012. And 2015 is not looking any better. To date, there have been 136 reported homicides <a href="http://wishtv.com/news/homicide-tracker/">this year</a>, and with over a month left in 2015, it seems as if Indianapolis is on track to break its previous record.</p>

<p>Other cities wounded by gun violence have also come forth in support of mandatory minimums for firearm crimes. Rather than wait for federal action to reduce shootings, cities such as <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/09/chicago-shooting-record-year/408070/">Chicago</a> have taken matters into their own hands and pushed for firmer sentences. In 2013, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel <a href="http://www.wbez.org/news/emanuel-pushes-mandatory-minimums-gun-crimes-research-shows-they-are-ineffective-106621">encouraged</a> a mandatory 3-year minimum sentence for those caught carrying an illegal firearm. </p>

<p>But the cities' cries for mandatory minimum gun legislation have not gone unheard at the national level. This past October, a group of bipartisan congressmen introduced the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr3713">Sentencing Reform Act of 2015</a>, aimed at bolstering sentences for federal gun crimes while simultaneously reducing mandatory minimum sentences for drug charges.</p>

<p>On both ends of the political spectrum, there seems to be an understanding that mandatory minimum sentencing has been a failure. Today, the US incarcerates more people than any other country in the world&#8212;and most of these individuals are incarcerated for non-violent crimes. Yet mandatory minimums have done nothing to fix the underlying problems in cities like Indianapolis or Chicago and across the nation. </p>

<p>The failure of mandatory minimum sentences can be directly attributed to the War on Drugs. Beginning in the 1980s, there was a mass movement to increase the number of mandatory minimum penalties for drug offenses, largely due to a rise in the use of crack cocaine. As a result of these efforts to combat widespread drug use, there are now more prisoners in America than any other country in the world. According to <a href="http://www.thehouseilivein.org/get-involved/drug-war-today/">statistics</a>, the US has less than 5 percent of the world's population, yet it accounts for almost 25 percent of the world's incarcerated population. </p>

<p>One of the problems with mandatory minimum sentencing is that it takes away all discretion from judges&#8212;the individuals who, ultimately, are best equipped to make these decisions. By limiting judicial discretion, people convicted of crimes may be unjustly punished with arbitrary and unreasonable sentences. Judges should be making these determinations, not the legislature. </p>

<p>Mandatory minimum sentences are also highly ineffective. According to a <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/legalclinic/cfjc/documents/Gun Violence Memo - Final.pdf">study</a> by Northwestern University School of Law, mandatory minimums have little to no effect on crime rates. It is hard to believe that sentencing criminals to a few extra years behind bars will deter them and others from committing crimes before they happen. Criminals will break the laws regardless of rules in place or the potential severity of a crime's punishment. Therefore, slapping mandatory minimum sentences on certain crimes does not make our society any safer.</p>

<p>Because mandatory minimum sentences are arbitrary and ineffective, they are becoming less and less popular among the public. But the mayors of cities plagued by gun violence have fallen into a familiar pattern of pushing mandatory minimums as the solution. Part of the reason why mandatory minimum sentencing continues, despite its failures, is due to a false sense of reality: by keeping gun offenders locked up, they think, fewer weapons will find their way into the hands of criminals, and thus fewer homicides will occur.</p>

<p>To be sure, mandatory minimum sentencing laws ensure that criminals will be incarcerated for an extended period, thus preventing them from committing further crimes during this time. However, this train of thought is costly: more prisoners mean more government spending and a strain on resources. There is also evidence that mandatory minimum schemes actually motivate defendants to go to trial. According to the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/news/congressional-testimony-and-reports/mandatory-minimum-penalties/20111031-rtc-pdf/Chapter_07.pdf">US Sentencing Commission</a>, 94.1percent of those convicted of an offense carrying a mandatory minimum pled guilty, while 97.5 percent of the offenders not facing a mandatory minimum pled guilty. The Commission also found that "the longer the mandatory minimum penalty an offender faces, the less likely he or she is to plead guilty." Proponents of mandatory minimum sentencing also argue that it adds a degree of consistency because under its approach, all offenders should receive the same punishment. But in reality, mandatory minimums hand out unduly harsh sentences for some offenders.</p>

<p>Despite evidence that mandatory minimum sentencing has not worked in the past, it seems as if Congress and mayors such as Greg Ballard have resorted to mandatory minimums as a quick-fix solution. But in regards to gun violence, one thing is for certain: before we implement more mandatory minimum sentences, we need to reevaluate the strategies that got us here in the first place.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.davidchristensenlaw.com/attorneys/david-e-christensen/">David Christensen</a> of <a href="https://www.davidchristensenlaw.com/">Christensen Law</a> discusses Michigan's legislation regarding no-fault regulations, and holding insurance companies to their lawful responsibilities ...</p>

                <p><strong>T</strong>he legal climate for Michigan medical providers has gotten bleak recently. Auto insurance companies have developed a practice of challenging almost every claim for no-fault benefits, throwing doctors' fees and hospital charges into question. But there is still hope. Recent <a href="http://courts.mi.gov/courts/coa/Pages/default.aspx">Michigan Court of Appeals</a> cases have offered a one-two punch in favor of medical provider claims.</p>

                <p>The Michigan No-Fault Act (<a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(dv3svh5y3xgq2anqx2pga4eu))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-500-3112">MCL 500.3112</a>) is <a href="/hotline/2015/07/david-christensen-no-fault.php">designed </a>to make sure motor vehicle accident victims can receive the medical care they need. To back up that guarantee, the law says: </p>

                <blockquote>Personal protection insurance benefits are payable to or for the benefit of an injured person or, in case of his death, to <em>or for the benefit of</em> his dependents. Payment by an insurer in good faith of personal protection insurance benefits, to or for the benefit of a person who it believes is entitled to the benefits, discharges the insurer's liability to the extent of the payments unless the insurer has been notified in writing of the claim of some other person ...  </blockquote>

                <p>MCL 500.3112 <em>(emphasis added)</em>. Michigan courts have long held that this gives medical provider an independent, derivative claim for no-fault benefits directly from auto insurance providers.</p>

                <p>In recent years, those insurance companies have stepped up their opposition to medical provider claims, contesting cases where the person was clearly injured as the result of an auto accident, and claiming that the medical provider's charges were not reasonable or necessary. They have even tried to enter settlements with injured motorists and then claim that settlement cut off the medical provider's claim in a separate lawsuit as well.</p>

                <p>Then recently, the Michigan Court of Appeals released two published cases, <a href="http://www.michbar.org/file/opinions/appeals/2015/102215/61070.pdf">Covenant Medical Center, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company</a> [PDF] and <a href="http://www.michbar.org/file/opinions/appeals/2015/102915/61167.pdf">Chiropractors Rehabilitation Group, P.C. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company</a> [PDF], which together reaffirm medical provider's right to bring their no-fault benefit claims to court, even in light of a settlement by the patient.</p>

                <p><strong>Covenant Medical Center, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company </strong></p>

                <p><span class="casename">Covenant</span> stands for medical providers' claims when a patient settles for too little to cover the provider's bill, assuming the medical provider had given the insurance company written notice of its claims ahead of time. </p>

                <p>In 2011 Jack Stockford was injured in a <a href="https://www.davidchristensenlaw.com/vehicular-trauma/">motor vehicle accident</a>. He was treated by Covenant Medical Center in 2012. In July, August and October 2012, the hospital sent written notice of a total of $43,000 in medical bills to the responsible insurance provider, State Farm. In 2013 Stockford settled his claim for little more than the outstanding medical bill, agreeing to indemnify State Farm from claims by medical providers including Covenant Medical Center.</p>

                <p>When Covenant Medical Center sued anyway, the court found that MCL 500.3112 protected its claim. Because Covenant Medical Center had sent its written notice of claim before the settlement was reached, it could still seek payment of reasonable medical expenses under the No-fault Act. The court ruled:</p>

                <blockquote>However, the plain text of the statute provides that if the insurer has notice in writing of a third party's claim, then the insurer cannot discharge its liability to the third party simply by settling with its insured. Such a payment is not in good faith because the insurer is aware of a third party's right and seeks to extinguish it without providing notice to the affected third party.</blockquote>

                <p>The court ruled that if State Farm had wanted to include Covenant Medical Center's claim in the settlement, it should have asked the trial court to apportion the funds. </p>

                <p><span class="casename">Covenant</span> promises medical providers' control over their own litigation and no-fault benefit claims by making sure their lawsuits are not resolved without their approval by an injured motorist's settlement. While insurance providers have already begun filing "<span class="casename">Covenant</span> motions" to apportion settlements, such motions still give medical provider attorneys an opportunity to object and preserve their doctors' claims.</p>

                <p><strong>Chiropractors Rehabilitation Group, P.C. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company </strong></p>

                <p>In <span class="casename">Chiropractors Rehab Group</span>, the court rejected the idea that a medical provider's claim dies when its patient becomes uncooperative. Michigan no-fault law requires injured parties to attend "independent medical examinations" in order to preserve their claims. Insurance providers like State Farm have claimed that this requirement extends to a medical provider's claim. They argue failure to appear makes a patient ineligible to receive no-fault benefits, and any medical provider claim requires an eligible patient.</p>

                <p>The court agreed that a patient must be eligible, but disagreed that his or her failure to appear for an examination could automatically negate a medical provider's claim. It said:</p>

                <blockquote>State Farm may reasonably suspend claims by the injured parties due to a failure to submit to MEs [medical examinations], and a suspension of benefits is not an 'irrevocable denial' of benefits; the eligibility for PIP [personal injury protection] benefits is simply suspended until compliance with the ME.</blockquote>

                <p>Automatic termination of a medical provider's claim would deprive the courts of their authority to compel patient cooperation through court orders, subpoenas and contempt of court proceedings, to preserve the treatment facility's interest. The court ruled that because a medical provider could still establish an injured party's eligibility before trial, the courts could not dismiss cases based solely on the patient's lack of cooperation.</p>

                <p>Taken together, <span class="casename">Covenant</span> and <span class="casename">Chiropractors Rehab Group</span> send a clear message to auto insurance companies and medical provider attorneys: doctors' and hospitals' right to payment of no-fault benefits is truly <em>independent</em> and must be litigated as such. Even though the claims are derived from the policy-holder's injury, that person's later settlement or lack of cooperation does not automatically relieve the insurance provider of its obligations to treatment facilities or doctors. With these decisions, the court has given medical providers the green light to take their cases forward and has delivered a one-two punch to insurance companies trying to dodge their responsibilities under the law.</p>

		<title>A Common Bond: How The Community and Existing Regulations Can Solve America&amp;apos;s Affordable Housing Shortage</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Azariah Jelks of Valparaiso University Law School of Class 2016 discusses the importance of coming together as a community in order to solve the problem of affordable housing in the US... </j:header> <strong>W</strong>ith the price of housing steadily rising, income levels largely remaining stagnant and an increase in the elderly, the need for affordable housing is more important than ever. <a href="http://www.enterprisecommunity.com/resources/ResourceDetails?ID=0100886">Over 11 million people spend half their income in rent</a> and that number is projected to rise to 13 million by 2025. Although state programs, federal law, tax credits and regulations have been created to create more affordable housing, gentrification is one of the major threats to these efforts. More emphasis should be placed on utilizing the resources and property that already exists in communities.</p>

<p>Private developers of market rate property can receive government subsidies for making 20 to 60 percent of its units affordable, meaning below the fair market rent in the area. These developers may also receive federal tax credits for doing so. The most popular tax incentive is the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). In exchange for setting aside units for at least 15 years, developers may receive a 4 or 9 percent tax credit towards the costs of building the real estate project. However, private developers and property owners, the main sources of affordable housing, are tempted to rent and sell their property to consumers who are able to pay market rate prices. It is not necessarily the poor who suffer at the expense of capitalism when this happens.</p>

<p>The connotations most people make with affordable housing are poor people and public housing. However, there is a distinction between affordable housing and low-income housing. The <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/comm_planning/affordablehousing/">US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)</a> has determined that spending over 30 percent of monthly income in housing is burdensome, and Americans who do so are eligible for affordable housing. This standard was mandated by the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1437f">US Housing Act of 1937</a>. However, one in five households making between $45,000 and $75,000 a year are spending more than 30 percent of their income in rent. So what does this mean? It means the middle class benefits from affordable housing. Senior citizens, the disabled and the chronically ill are also eligible for affordable housing. Low income housing on the other hand, is reserved for poor individuals and families who make 50 to 80 percent less than the median income in a metropolitan area. Public housing is usually reserved for those individuals, not affordable housing. Low-income housing is an entirely different subject with its own issues.</p>

<p><strong>Developer Pushback Has Increased With Affordable Housing Mandates</strong></p>

<p>A 2012 <a href="http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/jchs.harvard.edu/files/sonhr14-color-full.pdf">study</a> [PDF] indicated that although 11 million people were in need of affordable housing, there were only 3.3 million units available. With the changing landscape of neighborhoods and income levels, developers no doubt are wishing to cater to upwardly mobile residents without the extra conditions attached to federal funds and tax incentives. States and cities have also instituted their own regulations in order to preserve and increase affordable housing, but real estate developers often fight back. For instance, Chicago recently revised its <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20151010/ISSUE01/310109998/chicago-apartment-developers-scurry-to-beat-new-affordable-housing-law">affordable housing ordinance</a>. Developers wishing to build in downtown Chicago are required to set aside at least 10 percent of their units at below-market rates or pay a opt-out fee of $175,000 per unit to the city. The ordinance only applies to developments that have requested zoning changes from the city and the opt-out fee varies by area. However, one issue with the ordinance is that developers can simply abandon the zoning changes and sell the property at a lower rate. For other real estate developers with more disposable income and assets, it may be easier to pay the opt-out fee.</p>

<p>Developers in other cities and states have challenged the constitutionality of similar ordinances. In <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S212072.PDF">CBIA v. City of San Jose</a> [PDF], developers challenged an ordinance in San Jose that required them to allot at least 15 percent of their units to low or moderate income if the property contained a total of 20 or more units. They alleged it was a facial violation of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/takings#">Takings Clause</a>. The California Supreme Court disagreed with the argument because the ordinance did not deprive the developers of all economic use and the ordinance was reasonably related to decreasing adverse effects on the economy and the public.</p>

<p>Federal agencies such as HUD have also <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr_edge_research_081712.html">examined</a> whether the properties that are no longer under the 15-year compliance period are converting to market rate properties. It found that many of the properties continued participating in the LIHTC program by entering into another 15-year contract. It appears that many of the federal initiatives created by HUD, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other agencies are working. LIHTC is one of the most significant and critical tools to producing affordable housing. But does producing affordable housing solve the problem of community displacement? Only a small percentage of affordable housing units have to be reserved in private developments and this only applies to developers who accept government subsidies or tax incentives in exchange. As a result, current affordable housing initiatives will not prevent every family or individual from being displaced and priced out of their neighborhoods.</p>

<p><strong>Affordable Housing Preservation May be the Key</strong></p>

<p>Affordable housing is important for a number of reasons. It reduces the rate of homelessness and therefore cuts costs that taxpayers are left to bear. Property taxes increase overall, and perhaps many feel it is a social responsibility to help those in need. The economic disadvantages that the elderly and sick face are often uncontrollable, and considering that housing affordability largely affects the middle class, this is an issue that does not just affect the poor. Increasing the percentage range of incentives that LIHTC participants receive to 9 or 15 percent may be one solution to attract more developers and investors. Nevertheless, America is a free market society and regulating the private real estate sector too heavily may undermine this freedom. Also, increasing tax percentages for this program ultimately means increasing taxes on the public.</p>

<p>The real solution may lie in the community itself. State and the federal governments may be able to create more affordable housing and reduce displacement rates by preserving the affordable housing that already exists, and focusing more on renovating and restoring vacant properties. Many grants and public finance programs already exist such as <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/comm_planning/communitydevelopment/programs">Community Development Block Grants</a> (CDBG) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_increment_financing">Tax Increment Financing </a>(TIF), which finance the rehabilitation of blighted areas through grants or property tax revenues that will be generated from new real estate developments in those areas. Similar programs can be developed solely for affordable housing. In addition, although program participants abide by the compliance period, one of the issues they face is that they often have major renovation expenses at the end of the term. One of the incentives that could be included along with LIHTCs for example, could be additional funding to help maintain and renovate the rental property over the 15-year period.</p>

<p>The most important key to ensure the future of affordable housing is by working with the stakeholders, the community and all of society by reminding them that affordable housing is not about entitlement or providing handouts. It is about the common bond we share with those in need of low-cost housing: the circumstances that led their economic disadvantage can befall anyone of us.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.pacificlegal.org/staff/Brian-Hodges">Brian T. Hodges</a> and <a href="https://www.pacificlegal.org/staff/Schiff-Damien">Damien M. Schiff</a> of Pacific Legal Foundation discuss whether a landowner can seek judicial review of a jurisdictional determination under the Clean Water Act</em> ...</p><strong>T</strong>he US Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/chapter-26">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) case that will have broad ramifications for property owners across the nation. At issue in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-army-corps-of-engineers-v-hawkes-co-inc/">US Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., Inc.</a>, is whether a landowner can challenge a so-called &#8220;jurisdictional determination&#8221; in federal court without first having to obtain a CWA permit. A jurisdictional determination is an <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/33/320.1">administrative decision</a> issued by the Army Corps of Engineers as to whether the landowner&#8217;s property is subject to the Corps&#8217; jurisdiction under the CWA. According to <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil/Portals/2/docs/civilworks/RGLS/rgl08-02.pdf">the Corps</a>, the decision constitutes a &#8220;definitive, official determination that there are, or that there are not, jurisdictional &#8216;waters of the United States&#8217; on a site.&#8221; </p>

                <p>At first blush, it would seem obvious that a jurisdictional determination would qualify as an appealable final agency decision under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/part-I/chapter-5">Administrative Procedure Act </a>(APA). After all, as the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/LROXHawkes041015Decision8thCir.ashx_.pdf">held</a> in <u>Hawkes</u>, the determination is conclusive regarding the presence of jurisdictional waters on the land, and fixes the owner&#8217;s rights and obligations under the CWA. </p>

                <p>But it is never that easy, is it?&#8212;particularly when dealing with federal environmental regulations. Both the Fifth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals reached contrary conclusions in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8319171743612349884&q">Fairbanks N. Star Borough v. US Army Corps of Eng'rs </a>and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11390075518835124470&q">Belle Co., LLC v. US Army Corps. of Eng'rs</a>. In those cases, the courts held that the landowner would have to obtain a permit decision before challenging the underlying decision that the property was subject to CWA jurisdiction. </p>

                <p>Whether or not a parcel of land is subject to the CWA is more than just a regulatory hassle. It is an extremely expensive and time consuming process.  In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6892271506340161224&q">Rapanos v. US</a>, the Supreme Court estimated that the &#8220;average applicant for an individual permit spends 788 days and $271,596 in completing the process, and the average applicant for a nationwide permit spends 313 days and $28,915&#8212;not counting costs of mitigation or design changes.&#8221; What&#8217;s more, the <u>Rapanos</u> court noted that, if interpreted broadly, CWA jurisdiction could reach &#8220;every stream, ditch, and drain that can be considered a tributary of, and every wetland that is adjacent to, traditional navigable waters.&#8221;</p>

                <p>In December 2015, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-290.htm">granted review</a> of <u>Hawkes</u>. The Court is scheduled to hear the case in early Spring 2016.</p>

                <p><strong>Jurisdictional Determinations</strong></p>

                <p>The JD procedure is a helpful tool for the regulated public. Through this process, a landowner is informed early in the development process whether a CWA permit will be required. But what happens when the landowner disagrees with the JD? <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/33/part-331">Regulations</a> promulgated by the Corps provide an administrative appeal process for JDs. But the Corps rules only allow one level of appeal, usually to the Corps division engineer. And that determination is considered final and binding. Typically, judicial review of agency action is available under the APA so long as that action is &#8220;final.&#8221; The US Supreme Court, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17916430611727262660&q">Bennet v. Spear</a>, explained that the APA&#8217;s authorization of judicial review of &#8220;final agency action&#8221; is limited to an agency action that both marks the consummation of the agency&#8217;s decision-making process, and produces legal consequences: <blockquote>As a general matter, two conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be &#8220;final&#8221;: First, the action must mark the consummation of the agency&#8217;s decisionmaking process&#8212;it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature. And second, the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow. </blockquote>The second question will be at issue when the Supreme Court hears arguments in <u>Hawkes</u>.</p>

                <p>Until <u>Hawkes</u>, the consensus among the lower courts was that, although a JD does amount to the consummation of the agency decision making process, it does not constitute a final action by which obligations are determined or from which legal consequences flow. Likewise, the Corps itself has long said that a JD is not a final decision for the purpose of APA review, notwithstanding that the Corps&#8217; own regulations refer to a JD as &#8220;Corps final agency action.&#8221; The common rationale running among these decisions is that a JD&#8217;s issuance does not change the legal rights or obligations of either the landowner or the Corps, and therefore a JD cannot constitute final agency action. </p>

                <p><strong><em>Sackett</em> and APA Review</strong></p>

                <p>The US Supreme Court&#8217;s recent decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13663798285804514473&q">Sackett v. EPA</a> significantly changed the legal landscape for APA review. In that case, property owners Mike and Chantell Sackett bought a small parcel of property in a residential neighborhood. The Sacketts obtained a county permit to build their family home and started laying gravel. But then the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), without hearings or notice, claimed the property contained federal &#8220;wetlands&#8221;&#8212;and ordered them to restore the property under the threat of astronomical fines.</p>

                <p>With good reason to believe the land did not contain any wetlands, the Sacketts wanted to contest EPA&#8217;s claim. But EPA denied their request for a hearing&#8212;and the Ninth Circuit ruled they had no right to immediate judicial review. Instead, it held that they would first have to go through a years-long &#8220;wetlands&#8221; permit process, the cost of which could easily eclipse the value of their land. The court's decision was not surprising however. At that time, every circuit court to have addressed that question had held that landowners could not immediately appeal compliance orders. See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16869496543615641745&q">Laguna Gatuna, Inc. v. Browner</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15169153548089225972&q">S. Ohio Coal Co. v. Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation, & Enforcements</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6904632479775440650&q">Rueth v. EPA</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14522818930509389103&q">S. Pines Assocs. v. United States</a>.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Ninth Circuit and overturned decades of case law prohibiting judicial review of compliance orders. Relying on <u>Bennett</u>, the court explained the compliance order marked the consummation of the agency&#8217;s decision making process because it included a jurisdictional determination&#8212;which was the predicate for EPA&#8217;s finding of a violation&#8212;and subjected the Sacketts to potential fines in the tens of thousands of dollars per day if they did not comply with the EPA&#8217;s demands. And significantly, the order&#8217;s findings and conclusions were not subject to further agency review. Thus, the court held that a jurisdictional decision issued through a compliance order is &#8220;final&#8221; and subject to judicial review under the APA.</p>

                <p><strong>Background on <em>Hawkes</em></strong></p>

                <p>In <u>Hawkes</u>, Minnesota business owners sought permission to harvest 530 acres of swampland for peat moss used in landscaping. The owners conceded from the beginning that the swampland amounted to wetlands by definition. However, under the Supreme Court decision in <u>Rapanos</u>, only wetlands that are adjacent to a permanent water body, or which have a &#8220;significant nexus&#8221; with traditional navigable waters, are subject to federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. Since the nearest river sat 120 miles away, and no water bodies connected the swampland to the river, nobody could reasonably find these wetlands subject to federal jurisdiction.</p>

                <p>Regardless, the Corps issued a JD concluding that the swamp was a federal wetland subject to the CWA, without first demonstrating the requisite connection to traditional navigable waters. Hawkes sought to challenge the determination in court, arguing that, like the compliance order in <u>Sackett</u>, the JD represented the consummation of the Corps&#8217; decision making process and had immediate legal consequences.</p>

                <p>The <a href="http://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=943">trial court rejected</a> Hawkes&#8217; challenge, holding that the landowner had three options: 1) abandon the project and, perhaps, the business; 2) seek an arguably unnecessary federal permit at a cost of over $270,000; or 3) go forward without a permit risking civil fines of up to $37,500 per day and/or criminal sanctions including imprisonment. </p>

                <p>None of the trial court&#8217;s options was viable&#8212;let alone realistic&#8212;so, Hawkes appealed to the Eighth Circuit. Relying on <u>Sackett</u>, the Eighth Circuit held that JDs are final agency actions subject to immediate challenge in court. The court explained that each of the trial court&#8217;s three &#8220;alternatives&#8221; was, in actuality, a legal consequence of the agency&#8217;s decision that the property was subject to the CWA that could coerce landowners from exercising their lawful rights: <blockquote>Absent immediate judicial review, the impracticality of otherwise obtaining review, combined with the uncertain reach of the Clean Water Act and the draconian penalties imposed for the sort of violations alleged in this case  ... leaves most property owners with little practical alternative but to dance to the EPA&#8217;s [or to the Corps&#8217;] tune. In a nation that values due process, not to mention private property, such treatment is unthinkable. [citations and quotation marks omitted]</blockquote> Simply put, the Eighth Circuit held that fundamental concepts of due process require that landowners have the opportunity to challenge a JD before having to suffer the legal and financial consequences of such a determination.</p>

                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

                <p>Like <u>Sackett</u>, the resolution of the <u>Hawkes</u> case will likely turn on the &#8220;legal effect&#8221; prong of <u>Bennett</u> and an evaluation of the direct and immediate consequences of a JD upon the landowner. The JD in <u>Hawkes</u> is, in fact, an adjudicative decision that applies the law to the specific facts of this case and is legally binding on the agency and the landowner, thereby fixing a legal relationship. Questions of reviewability of EPA and Corps actions under the CWA have been in the federal courts for decades. For a host of reasons, before <u>Sackett</u>, and now <u>Hawkes</u>, the courts had consistently held that APA review is unavailable for these types of action. The Supreme Court in <u>Sackett</u>, however, changed the trajectory of administrative law. The decision in <u>Hawkes</u> will show whether the court will continue down a path that recognizes the need to protect due process and basic fairness, and to cabin the power of administrative agencies.</p>

                <p>Also weighing in favor of <u>Hawkes</u> is the court&#8217;s demonstrated pragmatism of late. Surely, both the regulated public and the Corps have strong interests in ascertaining the extent of CWA jurisdiction as early as possible. For the landowner, finding out whether jurisdiction is present helps to avoid the costs of litigating unnecessarily over jurisdiction. For the Corps, an early judicial determination regarding jurisdiction helps to focus the agency&#8217;s enforcement efforts. There is no reason to expend manpower and resources in a prolonged permit or enforcement proceeding if CWA jurisdiction is absent. Agency resources could instead be directed to those cases where jurisdiction has been judicially determined to be present. Moreover, because JDs are not typically issued within the context of an enforcement action, and are not a necessary prelude to such an action, judicial review would not hamper the Corps&#8217; administration of the CWA. </p>

                <p>Indeed, the question whether or not to allow review of a JD is reminiscent of the court&#8217;s recent discussion of administrative appeal rights in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12974949253475828848&q">Horne v. Department of Agriculture</a>. In that case, the government had argued that the courts lacked jurisdiction to hear a defense predicated in the Takings Clause on appeal from an administrative enforcement order (demanding that the Hornes pay the government the value of property it had demanded that the family surrender). The court rejected that argument, explaining that &#8220;when a party raises a constitutional defense to an assessed fine, it would make little sense to require the party to pay the fine in one proceeding and then turn around and sue for recovery of that same money in another proceeding.&#8221; The same pragmatism should compel the court to find a JD reviewable immediately, rather than requiring the owner to undergo an extremely costly and time consuming permit process that may be wholly unwarranted.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=" http://law.indianatech.edu/staff/faculty/luna/">Guadalupe T. Luna</a> of Indiana Tech Law School discusses Indiana Governor's refusal to accept Syrian refugees...</p><strong>F</strong>ederal law and its nexus with international humanitarian principles, agreements and commitments extend sanctuary to refugees fleeing war-torn countries, ethnic strife and other harm that precludes return to their countries of origin. Against this framework the governor of Indiana suspended the entry of Syrian refugees into the state. Lacking legal authority over the admission and exclusion of refugees, the governor renders at risk the federal rights of refugees and US international law obligations. Prohibiting Syrian refugee entry into Indiana is ultimately irreconcilable with federal constitutional constraints and with the international human rights instruments, principles and guidelines that protect refugees.</p>

<p><a href=" https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-94/pdf/STATUTE-94-Pg102.pdf ">Federal law</a> [PDF] incorporating human rights principles defines refugees as: </p>

<blockquote>any person who is outside any country of such person's nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.</blockquote>

<p>Tethered to the above is the fundamental <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html">international law</a> principle of non-refoulement. Substantively non-refoulement bars nation-states from expelling or returning ("refouler") "a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion."	</p>

<p>The League of Nations which adopted the 1951 International <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html">Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees</a> with subsequent protocols also adopted and agreed to it by its membership of over one hundred nations. The Convention extends humanitarian assistance to those fleeing persecution because of race, religion, nationality and membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The <a href=" http://www.hrcr.org/docs/OAS_Declaration/oasrights.html">American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man</a> encompasses declarations tethered to various nation states protecting refugees. Additional substantive human rights protections and guidelines extend from the <a href=" http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. Supplemental human rights principles and instruments additionally buttress these fundamental rights of protection and agreed to by membership states specific to refugees. The expansion of <a href=" http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CoreInstruments.aspx">core human rights instruments</a> encompasses the rights of women, the disabled and children with several conventions additionally constituting a basis of protection. Additionally the <a href=" http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> are also recognized in various human rights instruments. Article 20 reaches the governor's suspension when such measures are designed to create "incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence." The governor's order places the US at risk to litigation challenges from the international community over the nation's failed sovereignty obligations to protect refugees seeking humanitarian assistance. Nor are the rights of refugees limited to the international sphere.</p>

<p>Independent of the above, federal law underscores this as an "incident of sovereignty belonging to the government of the United States." The <a href=" https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> delineates that the United States Constitution, federal statues and treaties are the "Supreme law of the land." Attendant to federal authority expands to the federal preemption doctrine that stems from the supremacy clause. <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/350/497/case.html">Federal preemption</a> occurs when federal law "occupies" a "field" when "there is no room left for state" interferences. Conflicting orders and state statues for example yield to federal governance of an area "occupied" by federal law. </p>

<p>Tethered to the international procedural and substantive protection of refugees are the contractual agreements and commerce with foreign nations as authorized under the supremacy clause and commerce clause of the constitution. Precluding entry into Indiana oversteps moreover federal jurisdictional authority over the national uniformity of federal immigration law goals. Additionally constitutional provisions also demonstrate the governor's action curtails the ability of the US to engage in foreign commerce.</p>

<p>As authorized under the constitution requiring "a uniform Rule of Naturalization," Congress moreover enacted the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/iframe/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/act.html">Immigration and Nationality Act</a>. The INA governs the entry and exclusion of refugees into the US. Numerous supplementary protections under the INA accordingly extend to refugees, such as the Authorization for Programs for Domestic Resettlement and Assistance to Refugees. This provision enumerates the realm of services distributed in conjunction with state services. </p>

<p>Nor are the rights of refugees limited to international scrutiny and the INA. Supplemental to the above includes the <a href-" https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> that extends to refugees in the US. The Fourteenth Amendment, which is not limited strictly to only citizens, declares: "Nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." In sum not only thwarting state action but also risking the state to protracted challenges for its unequal treatment of Syrian refugees. </p>

<p>Further protection benefiting refugees extends to states in conjunction with federal funds and thereby bans discrimination against qualifying recipients. <a href=" http://www.justice.gov/crt/title-vi-civil-rights-act-1964-42-usc-2000d-et-seq">Title VI</a> of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example provides: "no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." Targeting Syrian refugees separate and apart from other refugees witnesses the governor's order directly violating the equal protection clause.</p>

<p>Further rights extend to state law and its contractual agreements with the federal government specific to refugee resettlement. Against the federal trajectory and constraints, Governor Pence's proclamation irreconcilably bars all state agencies from performing their federally contracted promises to provide shelter in the state. This order includes the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, which is situated within the state's Refugee Resettlement Office. The Refugee Resettlement Office is responsible for expediting the control of federally-funded resources to resettle refugees into the state. Prior to refugee settlement the agencies are contractually bound to adhere to federal law before funds are distributed and which the state had received prior to Syrian entry.</p>

<p>Federal funding subsequent to state contractual agreements entitles refugees to emergency assistance, with funds distributed through local state agencies for distribution. Federal assistance facilitate refugees qualifying for such programs as the Temporary Assistance For Needy Families, Medicaid and food supplement programs such as Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. To expedite their resettlement refugees qualify for employment and training services such as English language instruction. Refugees also can avail mental and health services through the State Department of Health, which is responsible for various health related screening and services.</p>

<p>Federal funds expended in preparation for the refugees have thus far been expended and the first family slated for resettlement in Indiana was redirected to another state. Any funds expended thus far in anticipation of the family will not be reimbursed. The governor's ban accordingly not only breaches the intent and goals of international law and principles, but also prohibits federally funded contractual obligations, objectives and goals. In contrast, the ban is otherwise promoting fear without cause and exposing the state to litigation expenses defending the indefensible.</p>

		<title>Gun Rights Trump Gun Control: Mass Shootings Are A Societal Issue, Not An Inanimate Object Issue</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Jeremy Schmidt of <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University School of Law</a>, Class of 2017, discusses gun rights in the United States...</j:header><strong>P</strong>resident Obama, without respect to those mourning lost loved ones, has gotten into a habit of always attacking law-abiding citizens' rights to bear arms whenever there is a highly publicized violent attack in the United States of America. President Obama always uses these highly publicized attacks to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/29/obama-colorado-springs-planned-parenthood-shooting/76493278/">call for more gun control</a> because he believes it will stop these attacks. However, there are no statistics or facts to support this claim by President Obama. In reality, the <a href="http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/il/chicago/crime/">areas with the strictest gun control laws</a> in the United States have the highest violent crime rates. In contrast, those places in the United States with the <a href="http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/in/valparaiso/crime/">least gun control laws</a> are the safest places to live. <br />
	<br />
Another problem with President Obama's call for gun control is he never adds any suggestions or ideas on what type of gun control should be created or how far it should go. The citizens are left to speculate on what type of gun control President Obama wants. Does he want to create a weapons registry, does he want more gun free zones or does he want to attempt an all-out weapon ban, such as the ones <a href="http://www.loc.gov/law/help/firearms-control/australia.php">Australia</a> and <a href="http://www.loc.gov/law/help/firearms-control/greatbritain.php">Great Britain</a> have enacted? This type of speculation is not helpful to any type of potential conversation that could lead to gun control the majority of the United States could agree on. <br />
	<br />
Do not take the title of this article to mean no gun control is the solution. There is a type of gun control that will work and at the same time it will not violate a law-abiding citizens' right to bear arms. Common-sense gun control is gun control the majority of United States citizens agree on. Common-sense gun control can include a few different things, such as universal background checks on all firearm purchases, mandatory training for those who have concealed carry licenses and getting rid of gun-free zones for law-abiding citizens. Those are just a couple of ideas most citizens could agree on. Making suggestions like these adds value to the conversation about <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment rights</a> and gun control. Adding value to any conversation is something President Obama and the rest of the politicians have tremendously failed at in the recent years. <br />
	<br />
Like most of the systems in the United States, the gun control system is a broken system with a lot of loopholes, inefficiency and backlog. The current gun control system and laws need to be discarded so a better system can be created by the people. A new system created by the people will make the majority of citizens believe in it because there will be input from everyone. There has to be input from all citizens of the United States to truly create an effective gun control system which does not intrude on a law-abiding citizens' rights. <br />
	<br />
Another problem President Obama and the rest of the politicians fail to address in their gun control solutions is the mental health problem. It is always widely publicized after a mass shooting if the shooter had a mental illness or not. This is almost a more important issue than gun control because mental health can affect anyone, whereas gun control only affects those who own or want to own a firearm. Mental health issues can affect anyone such as military personnel, doctors, CPAs, attorneys and even high school kids. Mental health issues are an epidemic in the United States, and yet you never hear President Obama or any of the Democrats blame the shooter's mental health. They instead blame the shooting on a firearm, which is an inanimate object. A gun will never go off by itself. A gun will only go off with some sort of human interaction with it. <br />
	<br />
If society wants to see a decrease in mass shootings, then society needs to change the conversation from blaming guns to finding a solution to help those with mental health issues. However, society has to have another conversation as well because not every mass shooting can be blamed on mental health problems. Society needs to have a conversation about how kids are being raised. Unfortunately, a lot of kids are growing up without parents or with parents who do not care to teach their kids respect, responsibility and accountability. Part of gun ownership and using a gun involves all three principles which many kids are growing up without knowing. A person should know respect, responsibility and accountability when owning and using a firearm. Since many kids today do not know these values, they believe it is acceptable to go out and kill innocent people. If kids were taught values, ethics and morals today, there would be a decrease in mass shootings. Unfortunately, the gun control laws being pushed by President Obama and the Democrats do nothing to solve any of these problems. They only infringe on the law-abiding citizens' rights to bear arms.<br />
	<br />
The United States would not exist today without firearms. The founding fathers of the United States ingrained the right to bear arms in the Constitution. It can be argued this is the most important right because without it, eventually citizens will see their other rights disappear. The right to bear arms should and will always trump gun control. However, the United States has a major problem with mass shootings taking place almost every month of the year. The citizens of the United States need to wake up and realize they can no longer rely on the President and the rest of the politicians to solve anything. Because of that, the citizens of the United States need to come together and change the conversation from blaming inanimate objects to a topic that will help find a solution to stop these mass shootings. There are many different conversations society needs to have because the world is really messed up. However, not everything can be solved in a day. So three possible starting points are common-sense gun control, finding help for those with mental health issues and teaching kids respect, responsibility and accountability. </p>
