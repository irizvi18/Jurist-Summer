		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hofstra.edu/Academics/Law/law_demleitner.cfm">Nora Demleitner</a>, former law clerk to Judge Samuel Alito and currently professor of law at Hofstra University School of Law, says that comments by senators on the first day of Judge Samuel Alito&#39;s Supreme Court confirmation hearings foreshadow a range of challenges the nominee will face in questioning on coming days...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/demleitner.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>Y</strong></font>esterday's opening statements by the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Judge Alito may not have surprised observers of the debate surrounding the Judge's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Still, they set the stage for the hearings that are taking place this week.  <br /><br />In light of his asserted independence Senator Arlen Specter focused his opening remarks on abortion and some aspects of executive power, highlighting the most important focal points of the hearings.  Most of the Democratic senators confirmed that their questioning will follow these lines.<br /><br />Most of the Senators' attacks on and defenses of Judge Alito and his record were predictable.  While the Republicans proclaimed Judge Alito's eminent qualifications and record &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; which nobody seems to seriously dispute &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; others highlighted his concern for judicial restraint, a codeword presumably for opposition to matters such as abortion and gay marriage and the defense of states' rights.  The Democrats, on the other hand, focused on Judge Alito's supposedly conservative record as a judge and voiced their distress about his perceived views on abortion, the right to privacy, and separation of powers.  <br /><br />Senator Russ Feingold also reiterated some concerns about the Judge's integrity, and deftly tied those to the abuses of corporate power.  Even though Judge Alito may not have handled his initial response to the Vanguard recusal issue particularly astutely, anyone who knows the Judge well has nothing but the highest regard for his integrity.  Not only is Judge Alito no Andrew Fastow, he had a roll of stamps in his office for his personal mail and paid for his personal phone calls from Chambers.<br /><br />More interesting has been Senator Charles Schumer's attack on Judge Alito.  He accused the Judge of reaching predictably conservative outcomes but hiding them behind judicial craftmanship.  This is a difficult line of argument to refute.  All of those of us who believe that Judge Alito decides each case on its merits may be just dupes -- duped by a super smart judge who has followed his personal ideology for decades.  It seems difficult to imagine that a person could have been hiding such strong personal beliefs from virtually everyone with whom he has worked for such a long time.  However, nothing is impossible if we believe that Judge Alito is Dr. No.  <br /><br />If Senator Schumer's line of attack were to succeed, non-ideological judges may face an uphill battle in confirmation hearings.  Our judicial system is designed, through procedural and evidentiary rules, burdens of proof, and even substantive law, to make certain outcomes more likely than others, to benefit certain groups of litigants over others.  For these reasons comparing one appellate judge's record against those of all other appellate judges is most difficult, if not impossible, in light of the vast number of cases in which Judge Alito participated.  The results of such a comparison may be downright misleading if done with an ideologically driven outcome in mind.<br /><br />To support a Schumer-type attack, Senator Ted Kennedy, in his opening remarks, referred to a study by Cass Sunstein which supposedly shows that Judge Alito sides largely with institutional interests and against individuals.  Interestingly, Sunstein himself acknowledges a host of problems with his methodology, and does not recommend against Judge Alito's elevation to the Supreme Court.<br /><br />Judge Alito's opening statement was the most interesting of all.  Diplomatically and sometimes subtly, he tried to blunt some of the criticism that has been directed against him.  He highlighted his father's experience as the immigrant child of poor parents, and his own upbringing in a blue collar neighborhood.  Not only will such stories humanize him in the eyes of the American public, they may also make it more difficult to believe that he is against individual rights and shortchanges the downtrodden.  Judge Alito also indicated that he grew up with strong, independent, professional women &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; his mother and his sister.  The latter is a trial lawyer, as he put it, she is "in a profession that has traditionally been dominated by men."  Clearly, so he implies, he has learned from that experience.<br /><br />Somewhat surprising was Judge Alito's description of his college and law school experiences.  While he calls those days "a time of great intellectual excitement," he also "saw some very smart people and very privileged people behaving irresponsibly."  This theme he continues later in his testimony when he indicates that nobody is above the power of the law.  <br /><br />The Senators' emphasis will be on Judge Alito's statement that his role &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; but not necessarily his personal beliefs &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; changed when he became an appellate judge.  Clearly this statement foreshadows his explanation of the memoranda and especially the job application he wrote during the 1980s when working for the Justice Department.  <br /><br />Curious might be his assertion that "[g]ood judges are always open to the possibility of changing their minds."  Conservatives and liberals alike may take comfort in this statement - or recoil in horror.  It may indicate that Judge Alito is open to new arguments even on issues where some have claimed that his mind has been made up already.  It supports the claim by those who know him &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; including myself - that he does not have a political agenda and that his opinion is being formed by the arguments presented by both sides and by his colleagues on the bench.  But it may trouble liberals (and some conservatives) since it could imply that he does not feel inevitably bound by precedent.  The question then is, which precedent would he be inclined to reconsider.<br /><br />What did not come up and should be asked?  Some of the issues most pressing to Congress will also be on the Court's agenda this term.  Among the topics not even mentioned by the Senators was sentencing, an area in which Supreme Court justices might benefit from the experience of a former prosecutor.  A long-time appellate judge whose Circuit put sentencing appeals on hold for months waiting for the Supreme Court's decision on the applicability of <em>Blakely</em> to the federal system, as did Judge Alito's Third Circuit, may be in a position to emphasize the importance of clear guidance to lower courts.  The Senators should ask him about prosecutorial power and abuses in plea bargaining and sentencing to give us a clearer perspective of how he views governmental power and the role of the federal judiciary vis-a-vis the executive.<br /><br />Another issue of great importance to 21st century jurisprudence is the use of foreign sources of law in Supreme Court decision making.  Despite Judge Alito's solely domestic legal experience, some of his background factors may make him open to considering foreign opinions in developing a reasoned decision on crucial legal issues confronting all Western countries.  This is a question of larger importance as it may foreshadow the role the Court can and will play internationally as a judicial leader, and may determine whether the Supreme Court is willing to recognize a set of Western norms.  Justice O'Connor was a forceful proponent of recognizing the valu
e of foreign sources in developing solutions to domestic issues facing comparable Western legal systems.  Inter-country judicial dialogue may become an even more pressing issue in the age of terror: British courts have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow for the judicial review of the detention of those held in Guantanamo.  European courts have faced the issue of abuse of executive power with regard to the detention of terrorist suspects.<br /><br />These hearings should be interesting.  Let's see what Judge Alito and the Senators make of Day 2.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Nora Demleitner is Vice Dean for Academic Affairs and Professor of Law at  Hofstra University School of Law.

		<title>Alito Day 3: Effective Equanimity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.quinnipiac.edu/x550.xml?School=&Dept=&Person=2974">Stephen Gilles</a> of Quinnipiac University School of Law says that after a third day of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, US Supreme Court nominee Judge Samuel Alito seems to be on his way towards confirmation given his performance thusfar, the current balance in the Senate and the fact that he&#39;s replacing Justice Sandra Day O&#39;Connor...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/gilles.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>ednesday's Alito hearings featured a second round of questioning by each of the Senate Judiciary Committee's eighteen members.  There were no big surprises.  <br /><br />The Democrats generally stuck to the themes they hammered away at on Tuesday:  Judge Alito won't pledge not to overrule <em>Roe v Wade</em>, favors an imperial President, tends to rule against the little guy and in favor of big business, broke a promise to the Judiciary Committee by failing to recuse himself in a <em>pro se</em> case in which Vanguard (a mutual fund he holds) was a party, and, when applying for a political job in the Reagan Justice Department in 1985, listed his membership in a "radical" organization called Concerned Alumni of Princeton ("CAP").  In response &#8212; sometimes with the help of friendly questioning from Republicans -- Judge Alito continued to call <em>Roe</em> (and <em>Casey</em>) "precedent" but not "settled law," distanced himself from sweeping versions of the unitary Executive, offered counterexamples in which he ruled for the little guy, explained that he could not possibly have had an improper motive in the penny-ante Vanguard case, and unequivocally condemned CAP's opposition to women and minorities at Princeton.  For their part, Republicans shot holes in some of the charges liberal interest groups have lodged against Judge Alito, reminded Democrats that many pro-life Senators voted for Ruth Bader Ginsburg even though everyone (correctly) suspected she would vote to uphold <em>Roe</em>, warned against litmus tests that could threaten judicial independence, castigated the politics of guilt by association, and invoked the overwhelming consensus among those who have worked with or appeared before Judge Alito that he is an open-minded, honest, and impartial jurist of the highest caliber.  <br /><br />By the end of another long, long, day, even Democratic Senators Leahy and Feinstein were complimenting Alito on his "equanimity."  And while the Democrats persuaded Chairman Arlen Specter to schedule a third and shorter round of questioning Thursday, there don't seem to be any fireworks in the offing.  Senator Kennedy, after a testy exchange with Specter on the subject, appears to be holding out hope that a fishing expedition into the records of <em>National Review</em> publisher William Rusher (one of CAP's founders) will inextricably entangle Judge Alito with CAP's Neanderthal positions on admissions at Princeton.  But the possibility that this particular "missing link" ever existed (let alone that it is conveniently fossilized in CAP's archives) seems far-fetched. <br /> <br />On balance, Judge Alito's performance so far has clearly helped his chances.  By the same token, however, Alito's chances have clearly helped his performance.  The President's party controls the Senate 55-45 &#8212; and, as a look at the confirmation hearings of the past three decades confirms, the composition of the Senate makes an enormous difference.  When the President's party controls the Senate, a reliably conservative (or reliably liberal) nominee is readily confirmable:  consider President Reagan's nomination of Justice Scalia, President Clinton's nominations of Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer, and President Bush's nomination of Chief Justice Roberts.  By contrast, when the President's party does not control the Senate, a reliably conservative nominee will face major problems.  (So, presumably, would a reliably liberal nominee if the tables were turned).  In 1986, not long after Scalia was easily confirmed, the Democrats retook control of the Senate by 54-46.  In 1987, they famously defeated the nomination of the highly conservative Robert Bork.  The seat eventually went to Justice Kennedy &#8212; like Justice O'Connor, a "moderate" conservative.  In 1991, with the Democrats in control 56-44, the staunchly conservative Clarence Thomas was barely confirmed (52-48).  Were he not African-America, his nomination might well have been defeated.  The reliably liberal Justice Souter (easily confirmed by a Democratic Senate) was a mistake &#8212; but it is widely believed that the first President Bush made that mistake in the belief that Souter was a stealth conservative.  An evident conservative would have been too risky.  The current Court's fourth reliable liberal &#8212; Justice Stevens &#8212; was arguably not a mistake.  A weak Republican President (Gerald Ford) nominated Stevens in the face of a post-Watergate Senate with 60 Democratic Senators. <br /> <br />Of course, the composition of the Senate is not the only relevant variable.  The President's popularity or unpopularity matters:  Reagan was badly weakened by Iran-Contra when he nominated Judge Bork.  So does the perceived gap between the ideological valence of the nominee and the Justice he or she is replacing.  As Senator Biden put it on Tuesday, "Roberts for Rehnquist, you know, what&#39;s the worst that can happen"?  By contrast, Biden warned Alito, he would face higher scrutiny because "You are replacing someone who has been the fulcrum on an otherwise evenly divided court."  <br /><br />In fact, if Justice O'Connor really was "the fulcrum on an otherwise evenly divided court," the Democrats would be fighting even harder than they already are to defeat Alito's nomination.  Contrary to Biden's spin, the existing lineup tilts the Court subtly but decisively to the left.  For the past decade, the Supreme Court has consisted of four reliable liberals (Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer), two moderates (Justices O'Connor and Kennedy), and three reliable conservatives (Justices Scalia and Thomas and Chief Justice Rehnquist).   When it comes to the divisive culture-war issues of constitutional law, where voting tends be most polarized, this pseudo-"balance" means that liberals have enjoyed a huge advantage:  they have needed only to persuade one of the moderates, whereas the conservatives have needed to persuade both. That, in a nutshell, is why conservatives have been the losers in so many of the blockbuster cases of recent years.  <br /><br />Nevertheless, Senator Biden and his colleagues are absolutely correct that Judge Alito could move the Court significantly to the right.  If Alito is confirmed &#8212; and if he and Chief Justice Roberts prove to be reliable conservatives, as seems likely -- Justice Kennedy will indeed be the "fulcrum" for an otherwise equally divided Court.  As the Democrats well know, that still leaves five votes to preserve <em>Roe</em>:  Kennedy (who co-authored the joint opinion in <em>Casey</em>), Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer.  On several other hot-button issues, however &#8212; including affirmative action, campaign finance, and partial-birth abortion &#8212; it was Justice O'Connor who provided the necessary fifth vote for a liberal victory.  No wonder the question "how much respect is due to precedent in constitutional law?" has figured so prominently in these hearings.  Given the balance of power in the Senate, Judge Alito is unlikely to say more than he already has:  if asked to overturn a precedent, he would first consider the issue of <em>stare decisis</em>, and "if [he] got beyond that," he would approach the underlying constitutional question with an open mind. <br /><br /><br /><em>Stephen G. Gilles, Professor of Law at Quinnipiac University School of Law in Hamden, Conne
cticut, clerked for Judge Robert Bork in 1984-85 and for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in 1985-86.</em><br />

		<title>Alito Day 4: A Steadfast Nominee and his Supporting Cast</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.bancroftassociates.net/prof_wkeefer.htm">Wendy J. Keefer</a>, former senior counsel and chief of staff in the US Department of Justice Office of Legal Policy and now with Bancroft Associates in Washington DC, says that Judge Samuel Alito&#39;s steadfast performance on the fourth day of his Senate hearings and the testimony of other witnesses, including a panel of Third Circuit appeals judges, have only solidified the case for his confirmation to the US Supreme Court ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wendykeefer.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>hough some modicum of civility crept back into the hearing room and no one was brought to tears, day four of the hearings on Samuel Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court had its own interesting moments.<br /><br /> First, today's testimony finally revealed a nominee who understands the independence he must protect and who refuses to be bullied into providing answers or statements that would endanger that independence.  Perhaps still trying to recover from the prior day's litany of implicit allegations of bigotry, Judge Alito repeatedly explained how he would approach &#8212; and has approached &#8212; the judicial decisionmaking process.  Though repeatedly asked his views and how he would rule on specific issues, he properly responded each time with a clear method for consideration of issues and legal interpretation.<br /> <br /> Second, today's hearings continued the inquiry into CAP &#8212; Concerned Alumni of Princeton.  CAP, an organization to which Alito apparently indicated membership in a 1985 application for a post with the Reagan Administration, took a hostile position toward the admission of minorities and women into Princeton University.  Judge Alito's opinions as a Third Circuit judge and his testimony in the hearings have made clear that he certainly harbors no such hostility.  Indeed, his only claimed recollection of the organization focused on that group's position on ROTC and had nothing to do with any admissions policy.  Most interestingly, some Senators seemed more interested in linking the group's position on admissions at Princeton to a revered and recently deceased President, rather than to the nominee or anything relevant to these hearings.<br /><br /> Third, some Senators again returned to their claim that Judge Alito had broken some sort of promise he made to them in 1990.  One Senator expressly stated that "the real shock is Judge Alito failed to take his sworn promise to this committee seriously."  Such a statement is extremely troubling.  Are we to understand from the statement that nominees are in a position to make, or perhaps could even be required to make, promises to the committee about future actions and decisions?  More importantly, does the fixation on broken promises as some sort of measuring stick of the suitability of the nominee for confirmation indicate a belief that any members of the judicial branch owe an allegiance to the committee or the Senate as a result of their confirmation?  Let us hope not.<br /><br /> Fourth, in support of an apparently new standard for confirmation to the Supreme Court, several Senators seem to be demanding that the nominee fit the mold of the Justice whose seat he would be occupying if confirmed.  Though certainly no mystery that those seeking a more activist Court would prefer the seat of Justice O'Connor not be filled by one who will aim to strictly construe the Constitution, such a requirement that a nominee be similar in philosophy to the person he or she is replacing improperly renders the President's constitutional appointment power of little significance.  It is highly unlikely that if it were Justice Scalia and not Justice O'Connor who had decided to step down, these same Senators would be requiring some assurance from the nominee that he fit the mold of that Justice.<br /><br /> Finally, today's hearings took an interesting turn in the form of third party witnesses.  Numerous witnesses from former Supreme Court law clerks to members of the American Bar Association committee that evaluated Judge Alito's qualifications and determined him well-qualified for the Supreme Court appeared before the Committee.  Certainly, not all witnesses were favorable.  But none provided any reason to reject this nominee.<br /><br />Notably, toward the end of the day we were presented with an entire panel of Judge Alito's colleagues from the Third Circuit.  Never before, to my knowledge, has such an esteemed panel of sitting judges come to attest before the committee on the qualifications of a Supreme Court nominee.  The reason for this new development is obvious.  Whether they agree with his decisions or not, most of them came to vouch for Judge Alito's superb qualifications and deserving nomination.  Today's hearings merely solidified that fact.  Hopefully confirmation is not far behind.<br />  <br /><br /><em>Wendy J. Keefer is a lawyer with Bancroft Associates in Washington DC.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.fcsl.edu/faculty/bio2.cfm?instructID=1039">Brian Foley</a> of Florida Coastal School of Law says that while senators are likely to query Judge Samuel Alito this week about his views on executive power, they themselves have dangerously indulged it without setting clear limitations, as recently evidenced by their approval of the &quot;compromise&quot; Graham-Levin amendment severely restricting access to federal courts by Guantanamo detainees...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/brianfoleyleft.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>f the pundits are right, this week&#39;s confirmation hearings for US Supreme Court nominee Samuel A. Alito, Jr. will involve much discussion of "Executive power."  Senators will express concern that the Bush Administration has, over the past four years, expanded that power to include, among other things, the power to torture people and imprison them indefinitely.  These are powers that most Americans would denounce as dictatorial if another country's government claimed them, much less exercised them. Senators will ask Judge Alito for assurance that he shares these concerns. <br /><br />The questions, however, will be largely moot and even hypocritical.  Late last year, the Senate overwhelmingly passed an amendment (by Senators Lindsey O. Graham (R-SC) and Carl M. Levin (D-MI)) to the 2006 defense appropriations bill that has resulted in legalizing the Executive's powers to imprison people indefinitely and torture them. <br /><br /><em>The Graham-Levin Amendment</em><br /><br />The new law (now section 1005 of the <a href="/gazette/2005/12/detainee-treatment-act-of-2005-white.php">Detainee Treatment Act</a> of 2005) repudiates the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <em>Rasul v. Bush</em>, 124 S. Ct. 2686 (2004), which held that non-U.S. prisoners at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanano Bay, Cuba (GTMO) could access the federal courts via claims based in habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. 2241, federal questions, 28 U.S.C. 1331, and the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. 1350.  Now, the prisoners' only access to U.S. courts is limited to appeals of the outcome of GTMO proceedings, and limited to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  The new law also specifically states that the military officers who sit in judgment may use evidence obtained by coercion, if they decide it has "probative value." <br /><br />Some Members of Congress may have believed they were simply enacting a law to reduce the number of cases going to federal court, or to streamline what may be seen as a messy process for GTMO cases, or as "tort reform" for GTMO.  But the effect of the law is to give the Executive unreviewable power.  Here's how: A person can be captured, shackled and sent to GTMO and never given a hearing before a Combatant Status Review Tribunal. He has no right to the hearing, because he cannot enforce that right in a court.  He can be tortured, because he cannot go to court to enforce a right not to be tortured.  (This law renders the McCain anti-torture amendment to the same defense appropriations bill a dead letter.) The avenues that the Supreme Court in <em>Rasul</em> said were open have been cut off. <br /><br />Let's assume a prisoner is given a CSRT hearing and is deemed an "enemy combatant." If he appeals under this new law, review will be limited: the Court of Appeals will not engage in fact-finding.  Review will be deferential to the government: the new law states that the CSRT process itself requires a rebuttable presumption in favor of the government's evidence, and that the burden of proof is by the preponderance of the evidence.<br /><br />Review likewise will be limited for those found to be "enemy combatants" who go on to be tried and convicted for specific crimes by a military commission.  Any sentence that is not a capital sentence, or is less than 10 years imprisonment, will be reviewed only at the court's discretion.  Review is not likely to be granted, nor is the appeal likely to succeed, if the Administration continues stacking the D.C. Circuit and Supreme Court with "Executive-friendly" judges.<br /><br />There is one possible saving grace to prevent the Court of Appeals from turning into a kangaroo court: the new law states that the court's appellate jurisdiction includes, "to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to make the determination [of enemy combatant status or a guilty finding by a military commission] is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States."  However, the court simply might decide that the Constitution doesn't apply to GTMO proceedings.  And such challenges may be raised only by prisoners who are given a hearing in the first place. The court lacks jurisdiction to address any other sorts of claims.  <br /><br /><em>Constitutional? Perhaps. Unwise? Definitely.</em><br /><br />Congress may not have exceeded its own powers in stripping the courts of jurisdiction and eliminating <em>habeas corpus</em>. Under Article III, Congress can control the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and can "ordain and establish" lower federal courts (and abolish them if it wished).  Under Article I (9), Congress can suspend the right to habeas corpus, "when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it."<br /><br />But Congress has acted unwisely.  The law violates the wisdom that has informed our democracy since its inception.  It disables the system of checks and balances, because now, the judiciary cannot conduct meaningful reviews of the military proceedings at GTMO.  Politicians from the Executive branch might assure us that they're convicting the real terrorists and protecting us from harm when in fact the convictions are based on unreliable evidence, including hearsay and coerced testimony.  These politicians can tell us they are developing investigative skills, but without more rigorous requirements concerning evidence of guilt, they will most likely just be creating goon squads.<br /><br />The law unwisely limits the longstanding right to <em>habeas corpus</em> forged in England.  <em>Habeas corpus</em> requires than the Executive can be forced to justify its detention of any person.  It is a check for preventing the Executive from becoming too powerful. After all, an Executive that can jail anyone it dislikes, for as long as it likes, is a formidable power indeed.<br /><br />Also, the law is an overreaction to 9/11.  Fear is understandable, but Congress should recognize that we are not really in a state of "rebellion or invasion," as the Constitution requires for the suspension of habeas corpus; nor is public safety clearly threatened. Repeated fears of "dirty bombs" and remote-controlled planes spraying anthrax make it easy to overlook that there have been no Al Qaeda attacks on U.S. soil since 9/11 &#8212; not a single bomb, not a single jihadist shooting up a shopping mall, not a single zealot ramming his car into a busy, pedestrian-crammed crosswalk.  No major political, sporting or entertainment event has been cancelled due to the threat of terrorism. The government has not required owners of dangerous facilities such as chemical plants to step up security. Even if we were attacked today, we should keep in mind that the peaceful period between 9/11 and now &#8212; more than four years &#8212; exceeds the entire length of the U.S. involvement in World War II, as well as the Civil War.<br /><br />One might argue that the new law doesn't decrease our civil liberties, as it applies only to foreigners, and the Executive thus cannot use it to squelch political dissent or crush political enemies.  The distinction between U.S. citizens and non-citizens is an arbitrary one, however, where national security is concerned, and it's not likely to stand.  If a man wants to nuke Ne
w York, does it really make a difference that he was born in Detroit, and not Dubai?  Indeed, a terrorist with U.S. citizenship is more dangerous than a foreign one in that he can move freely in and out of our borders, and blend in as he plots and plans.  It won't take long for both Congress and the Executive to realize this.<br /><br /><em>Playing With Fire</em><br /><br />Granting the Executive the power to torture people and jail them indefinitely, without meaningful judicial review, is like playing with fire. The flames can quickly spread out of control.  <br /><br />One person who now knows how swiftly this fire spreads is Senator Carl Levin, who helped start it by brokering the Senate amendment.  Now that a revised version has been signed into law, the Administration has announced that it will file motions to dismiss 186 "enemy combatant" cases from federal courts this week.  On January 4, Senator Levin released a press statement condemning the Administration's move. Levin said, "As I pointed out when we passed the bill, the provision says that it 'shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.' The meaning of these words is clear: the provision is prospective in its application, and does not apply to pending cases. The Administration is just plain wrong when it says otherwise." <br /><br />Plain wrong? As much as I'd like to agree with the good Senator, I'm not so sure. The language is vague at best. And for whatever its worth, Senator Levin's coauthor, Senator Lindsey Graham, told the <em>Washington Post</em> that he disagrees with him. The courts will have to decide.<br /><br />Senator Levin should know &#8212; as, indeed, every Member of Congress should know &#8212; that when drafting laws to increase the Executive's power, one should be excruciatingly clear about any limits that one thinks should exist.  To be any less vigilant is not just wrong.

		<title>Judging Alito: The US Supreme Court Selection System on Trial</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.mq.edu.au/html/staff/horriganb.htm">Bryan Horrigan</a> of Macquarie University Faculty of Law in Sydney, Australia, says that the upcoming confirmation hearings for Judge Samuel Alito are a trial not just of the nominee, but of the uniquely-American system of public judicial confirmations of high court judges...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/horrigan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s Judge Samuel Alito&#39;s confirmation hearing before the US Senate Judiciary Committee begins on January 9, more than his place on the US Supreme Court is up for grabs. The contemporary state of the US Supreme Court selection process is also on trial. <br /><br />How the USA selects its national judges neither matches exactly what happens in other common law countries like Australia, Canada, and the UK, nor necessarily represents international best practice, even if none of the other jurisdictions has a strangle-hold on that. The ways in which Alito, Republican and Democrat senators, and pro-Alito and anti-Alito lobby groups conduct themselves over coming weeks will either reinforce or dispel international and perhaps also some domestic skepticism about the effectiveness of public judicial confirmation hearings in their present form.<br /><br /><em>The US System of Supreme Court Appointments and Comparisons Elsewhere</em><br /><br />The US Constitution involves the other two branches of federal government in selecting Supreme Court judges by providing for presidential nomination and appointment of them 'with the advice and consent of the Senate'. This provides an institutional check and balance for judicial selections that is absent from constitutional arrangements in other countries, including a parliamentary democracy like Australia.<br /><br />One common weakness of the procedure in the USA, Australia, and elsewhere is that nomination of someone to fill a vacancy on each country's highest court happens with a minimum of public transparency and non-executive input. In the absence of bipartisan agreement on transparent criteria for assessing judicial merit, and internal checks and balances in the nomination process itself, scant non-partisan means are available to satisfy the people as the ultimate source of democratic authority that the best candidate is being nominated. For example, extensive previous judicial experience was publicly relied upon by President George W. Bush as a strong factor in favour of Alito's nomination. Yet, only a month earlier, being untainted by previous judicial experience was publicly relied upon by Bush as a strong advantage in nominating White House Counsel, Harriet Miers.<br /><br />Relying on media scrutiny, expert lawyerly rankings, and Senate Judiciary Committee questioning to test the suitability of judicial candidates for the Supreme Court is closing the door after the horse has bolted if the person nominated is not demonstrably the best candidate according to publicly known and assessable criteria of judicial merit. Even allowing for the wisdom of hindsight, will history's judgment be that Miers was clearly ahead of Alito and all other candidates as the demonstrably best nominee, in terms of strict legal merit, at the time of her nomination?<br /><br />Given the impact of judicial interpretation of the US Bill of Rights on American life, the judicial philosophy of a candidate is widely acknowledged politically and publicly as a relevant factor affecting their nomination and appointment. This element is present but not always with the same force in political debate in a country like Australia, with a common law heritage but without a national bill of rights. The Australian system leaves everything on national judicial selection in the hands of the prime minister and cabinet of the day. Australia has no constitutional requirement for the executive government to consult with anyone or to secure any legislative approval for whoever the executive government wants to appoint to Australia's equivalent of the US Supreme Court, the Australian High Court. Nobody from outside the executive government or those privileged enough to be consulted by it knows who is being actively considered for appointment to the High Court, for example, until the official appointment is announced.<br /><br />This results in the unsatisfactory position of the Australian public not really knowing anything until after the event (if ever) about who has been consulted and how, who has been considered and how, what criteria for merit have been used and applied, whether any candidate has been interviewed and what they were asked, and how the ultimate appointee views the task of judging under the Australian Constitution. After Justice Susan Crennan's appointment to Australia's High Court last year, for example, even retired High Court judges publicly criticized the Australian Government for the non-transparency of the nominating process, as well as the lack of information publicly available about that process and the basis of deciding judicial merit. As of now, both the USA and Australia have only ever appointed two women each to their highest national court.<br /><br />While Australia in the past has appointed former federal attorneys-general on both sides of politics to its High Court, a non-elected lawyer working inside the current executive government, like withdrawn Supreme Court nominee, Harriet Miers, would be an unlikely judicial appointee under the Australian system. But that is due less to any inherent institutional safeguards or publicly transparent judicial selection criteria and more to the predominate practice in Australia of appointing either existing judges or else barristers with regular practical experience arguing for governments or others in constitutional matters before the High Court.<br /><br />Other common law countries have recently introduced different measures for democratizing the judicial selection process, including greater non-executive input into the judicial selection process in Canada. All of this is occurring amidst modern transnational debates about the desirability of establishing independent judicial selection commissions, such as the recent innovation of the independent Judicial Appointments Commission in the UK. Where final constitutional responsibility for judicial appointment rests with the executive government, legislative and public input mechanisms as well as independent judicial appointment commissions can complement and inform that selection process.<br /><br />The political and legal cultures in parliamentary democracies like the UK and Australia have one thing in common on judicial selection processes. They remain resistant to the kind of public and media scrutiny and direct legislative questioning of nominees that is taken for granted under the US system for judicial appointments to the Supreme Court. This public process can lead to the political evisceration of nominees in Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, as it did most recently and famously in the Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings.<br /><br /><em>What the Senate Judiciary Committee Should Ask Judge Alito</em><br /><br />How should Judge Alito be questioned in light of this? As with past nominees, the written questionnaire answered by Alito queries him about judicial activism. This topic is a bee in the bonnet of many senators, who believe that the modern Supreme Court is insufficiently respectful of Congress and too quick to invalidate congressional exercises of power. Yet there are more telling questions to put to judicial nominees, especially since any good law student could answer that question by telling the examiner what the student thought they wanted to hear, without really revealing anything significant about their real views.<br /><br />Cherry-picking the judgments in Alito's judicial record is unlikel
y to be conclusive. After such a long period holding judicial office, Alito's record includes decisions whose outcomes favour those in positions of political and corporate power as well as decisions whose outcomes favour those vulnerable to the exercise of such power. At the same time, his judicial decisions and earlier work-related material as a government lawyer raise legitimate questions about what his personal and judicial philosophy might mean for the Supreme Court's future work on controversial civil rights matters like abortion, euthanasia, same-sex marriage, capital punishment, immigration, and labour and equality rights, as well as its equally important work on institutional responsibilities concerning the separation of church and state, constraints on executive power, and legislative environmental protection. <br /><br />The opponents of Judge Alito's nomination fear that, as more is revealed about his views in released documents and Senate questioning, it will become apparent that Judge Alito is neither within the mainstream nor a moderate conservative, but rather 'a hard-line right-winger, and not just on abortion rights', as one liberal commentator put it in December's <em>American Prospect</em>. Despite Alito receiving the American Bar Association's highest rating for Supreme Court nominees in the week preceding his confirmation hearing, public analyses of his judicial record by court-watchers such as the <em>Washington Post</em> portray him as a judge who is more deferential than some to governmental authority, and more restrictive than some in his view of individual rights in contentious areas of employee discrimination, immigration, and criminal justice, including the death penalty.<br /><br />Even allowing incumbent Presidents the political luxury of a margin of appreciation in nominating judges who they hope are broadly in line with their political and legal world-view, provided that they otherwise fit broadly within the mainstream, no longer defuses all objections to nominees who might hold the balance of judicial power on a divided bench. One obvious reason for this is because the mainstream is in flux. Professor Cass Sunstein describes the paradigm shift in judicial outlook in the last few decades in this way: 'The center has become the left. The right is now the center. The left no longer exists.' If the mainstream truly has shifted even momentarily to the right, those on the left or centre-left of politics are unlikely to be satisfied by calls to respect and confirm candidates within the right-leaning mainstream, especially if that puts currently recognized constitutional rights in jeopardy.<br /><br />The conventional wisdom about the confirmation hearing for Chief Justice John Roberts is that his performance made him the dream nominee and sets the modern benchmark for those nominees who follow him. While his performance was politically astute and his mastery of both the law and Senate questioning was evident, he revealed little of any great significance about his underlying judicial approach or his real view of the current state of constitutional jurisprudence, with limited exceptions. Those subjecting Alito to the famous 'murder boards' that help nominees to practice for confirmation hearings have no doubt absorbed the lessons of how Roberts handled some lines of questioning.<br /><br />However, it would be a mistake to think that giving Roberts-like answers to some controversial lines of questioning will work automatically for Alito too. The prevailing political circumstances and judicial stakes are different, given the Bush administration's current political troubles and the generational significance of what a swing seat on the Supreme Court represents. Moreover, in hindsight Roberts got off lightly with some of his answers.<br /><br />Roberts and perhaps earlier nominees were allowed too often to get away with non-answers to important questions going to their judicial approach. This can happen without sustained follow-up Senate questioning and the pressure of legitimate public, political, and legal expectations to reveal more about a nominee's judicial thinking. This culture of expectations needs to change. It might help if Professor Ronald Dworkin's <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18330">penetrating dissection of the Roberts 'Q &amp; A' sessions</a> before the Judiciary Committee in the 20 October 2005 edition of <em>New York Review of Books</em> was on the reading list for all Committee members and those assisting them in preparing questions for Alito.<br /><br />Roberts was allowed to rest on two basic points that, as Dworkin describes, warranted further prodding by Senate Judiciary Committee members. First, Roberts' public admission that the Supreme Court's abortion decision in <em>Roe v Wade</em> is 'settled as a precedent of the court', 'entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis' just 'like any other precedent of the court', and subject to future analysis on the terms outlined in the later abortion decision in Planned Parenthood v Casey revealed nothing of real significance about his starting approach to such questions or his overall view of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. As Dworkin pithily concludes about these and other answers going to his judicial philosophy, senators 'should have pressed him on the character of the more general constitutional philosophy he would employ finally to decide those issues when they arise', and they 'should not have accepted his reiterated banalities about being guided by the law, or deferring to the rule of law, or taking due account of precedent, or deciding legal issues in a practical, pragmatic way, or allowing the facts their "proper role"'.<br /><br />Secondly, Roberts resorted often to the formulaic response that he could not give specific answers on matters that could come before the Supreme Court. It is not justifiable for Roberts, Alito, or anyone else to deflect questions that go to a nominee's overall judicial philosophy and general judicial views on the Bill of Rights, and what the features of their own judicial mindset mean for how a candidate starts to think about particular Bill of Rights questions, simply on the basis that one of these particular questions might come before the Court. Such answers are not truly responsive to what is really being asked. Reasonable politicians and citizens alike understand that what is being asked and the response legitimately being sought are far from an advance commitment in the abstract to deciding a particular case with particular features in a particular way. Roberts, Alito, and other nominees should be called on this, where they seek refuge in such a tactic to avoid revealing anything of real but perhaps controversial significance about their judicial thinking, for fear of spoiling their chances of confirmation. The public interests truly at stake in public confirmation hearings are more important than any nominee's personal desire to avoid revealing what everyone really needs to know about what they really think.<br /><br />Deeper questioning about the judicial philosophy of anyone nominated to take Sandra Day O'Connor's swing position on the Supreme Court is the necessary price to pay for the benefit of being appointed to an official position where someone's approach to judging could affect people's rights and liberties for better or worse for decades to come. Senators must be more creative, persistent, and penetrating in their questions, and avoid framing questions in ways that afford Alito the easy option of saying that he cannot advance views on specific issues in cases that might come before him. Neither Democrat nor Republican judicial nominees should be allowed to rest so easily on that point anymore in deflecting questions about the make-up of their approach to judging or their assessment of the current constitutional landscape. So, if Alito tries to stall any senator's question with a Roberts-like deflection of the 'I cannot comment on specific issues that might come before the Court' kind, the senator should halt him in his tracks and counter-respond that Alito is not being
 asked to commit himself to a full and conclusive opinion on specific issues, but rather is being asked for a meaningful account of the various elements that inform how he would start approaching an answer to such important questions, especially in terms of how he sees the constitutional issues in play and how he would go about addressing them. A justified reluctance to avoid committing to the end of the story does not excuse a nominee from explaining how the story begins and how approaching the end should be framed.<br /><br />Alito needs to be questioned systematically and in detail about what kind of document he thinks the Constitution is, how he would approach interpreting it, what kinds of balances he thinks it strikes between governmental power and individual freedom, what concerns he might have about how it has been interpreted to date (given his criticisms of aspects of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in his work as a government lawyer, and his capacity to change that from the bench), and other aspects of what it means to be a judge engaged in legal interpretation of a constitutional framework in a liberal democracy governed by the rule of law. Given their contemporary importance, he should also be questioned on the constitutional reach of both executive power and the zone of privacy for personal moral choices. The latter includes but is not limited to abortion. Questioning in this area can be done without offending calls on all sides of politics not to make judicial views on abortion the singular litmus test for appointment to the Supreme Court. All of this can be done in ways that chart a course through the twin reefs of avoiding superficial and unresponsive answers to senators' questions, on one hand, and avoiding inappropriate comment on specific upcoming cases, on the other.<br /><br />Alito is also arguably in a worse position than Roberts in having so clearly aligned some of his work as a government lawyer with his personal views on the law, in matters of some controversy for any judicial nominee. In his 1985 application for advancement within the Reagan administration, Alito stated that 'I am and always have been a conservative and an adherent to the same philosophical views that I believe are central to this Administration'. He goes on to profess strong beliefs 'in limited government, federalism, free enterprise, the supremacy of the elected branches of government, the need for a strong defense and effective law enforcement, and the legitimacy of a government role in protecting traditional values', as well as strong disagreement 'with the usurpation by the judiciary of decisionmaking authority that should be exercised by the branches of government responsible to the electorate'.<br /><br />More controversially, he expresses great personal pride and satisfaction in being able through his work for the Reagan administration 'to help to advance legal positions in which I personally believe very strongly', especially 'my contributions in recent cases in which the government has argued in the Supreme Court that racial and ethnic quotas should not be allowed and that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion'. In these ways, Alito identifies his core legally relevant beliefs. In addition, he draws the connection between those beliefs and his legal work. The problem with now trying to compartmentalize these expressed views on abortion as merely personal views, and to distinguish them from Alito's obligation as a Supreme Court judge to decide according to the law, is that his own words associate him personally with the idea that the Constitution does not really protect a women's freedom to terminate a pregnancy, at least on one reading. He thereby puts his own specific beliefs about law and government on the record and hence in issue in his confirmation, and can be legitimately questioned more closely on what he really means by some of these beliefs, and how they might impact upon his judging if confirmed. Senators are entitled to ask him, for example, if he still holds to those beliefs and, if he says that they are personal rather than constitutional beliefs, they can ask how he reliably keeps his personal beliefs out of the way of his constitutional choices.<br /><br />There are other meaningful questions that senators can ask to probe how Alito would approach contributing to the Supreme Court's abortion jurisprudence, for example, beyond simply asking him absolute and hence justifiably deflectable questions like 'Does the Constitution contain a privacy right to an abortion?', 'Was <em>Roe v Wade</em> correctly decided?', and 'Will you vote as a Supreme Court judge to overturn or restrict <em>Roe v Wade</em>?'. They could ask him, for example, to explain what he sees as the legal boundaries and relevant factors in any future revisiting or application of <em>Roe v Wade</em> and, if his response amounts to little more than acknowledging that <em>Planned Parenthood v Casey</em> lays down the legal markers for how <em>Roe v Wade</em> is treated from here, they should ask him to explain more about what that really means, especially since his judgment was a dissenting view at lower levels in the <em>Casey</em> case.<br /><br />Both Alito and the Senate Judiciary Committee members can either reinforce the bad habits of Senate confirmation hearings or else play more statesmanlike roles in transforming and elevating what takes place to a new level of respectful but meaningful dialogue. If Alito rises to this challenge, his Senate interrogators should respond in kind, cut him some slack, and not play automatic 'gotcha!' with any off the cuff way in which he expresses a view. Statesmanship is desirable but, even if Alito is neither encouraged nor allowed to rise to this challenge, the same outcome can be achieved another way. What judicial nominees and their minders presently think are politically safe non-answers to senators' legitimate questions about their judicial mindsets must come to be seen as politically unsafe answers for judicial nominees of all political colours, on the basis that a nominee who reveals too little of what senators and the people really need to know about them as a judge runs the risk of disqualifying themselves from being confirmable. This requires bipartisan acknowledgement and enforcement of the higher common interest in having judicial nominees account to the people and their representatives meaningfully about their views on the Constitution and the matters to be decided under it. Telling the people's elected representatives little that is meaningful about a nominee's real judicial philosophy shortchanges the American people in the public confirmation process. Moreover, as Dworkin argues about Roberts in terms equally applicable to Alito, 'according to any plausible theory of democracy the public has a right to know his views on matters affecting their fundamental rights in some detail before their representatives award him lifetime power over those rights'.<br /><br />Looking ahead to the higher judicial stakes in appointing a replacement for Sandra Day O'Connor as the pivotal swing vote on the bench, Dworkin's injunction to the Judiciary Committee is that '(i)t should demand to know the new nominee's constitutional philosophy' and '(i)f he or she refuses to disclose it, or claims that it is only to respect the rule of law and adds nothing more helpful about what that means, then its constitutional duty is to advise the Senate to reject that nominee as either disingenuous or incompetent'. Whatever you might think of Dworkin's own brand of legal philosophy, his analysis here exposes cracks in the public questioning of judicial candidates for the Supreme Court that need closing, to justify the exposure of nominees to public questioning in the first place, and to counter-balance the undesirable impact of the more partisan aspects of this process.<br /><br />As Dworkin also notes, Roberts departed from his preferred strategy of not giving substantive answers to questions about his overall judicial approach when he judged it safe to do so, most notably in denouncing judicial reference to foreig
n judicial decisions as authorities for interpreting the US Constitution. Alito can expect Senate questions about that hot topic too. Given the sharply divided views on the current Supreme Court bench about this controversy, he should be pressed beyond the obvious response that foreign and international judicial decisions are not products of the US legal system and hence have no binding or even authoritative precedential effect domestically. The controversy goes deeper than this.<br /><br />If the Senate Judiciary Committee subjects Alito legitimately to the kind of skilful deeper probing that Roberts managed to deflect, and does so without also transforming his confirmation hearing into a partisan witch-hunt, personal crucifixion, or media feeding frenzy, the US system of judicial nomination and appointment will be well served. Its internationally uncommon reliance on public confirmation hearings for judicial nominees would then be on the way towards rehabilitation as a pre-eminent form of testing the suitability of candidates for a judicial position capable of affecting American lives as much as any elected president can.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Professor <a href="mailto:bryan.horrigan@law.mq.edu.au">Bryan Horrigan</a> completed a doctorate in law at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/shane.html">Peter Shane</a> of Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, says that the confirmation hearings for US Supreme Court nominee Judge Samuel Alito were a distressingly hollow ritual that reflected poorly on the nominee, the Senators questioning him, and the current state of the confirmation process...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petershane.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>o start candidly, I was opposed before the Alito hearings to the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, and I still am.  One would expect, given the apparent inevitability of his confirmation, that those dissatisfied with the hearings would come disproportionately from the anti-Alito camp.  But my reasons for dissatisfaction are only tangentially related to outcome, and I suspect many pro-Alito observers would share at least some of my qualms about the ritual we have just endured.  The easiest way of putting my reservations is that the hearings struck me, in a variety of ways, as deeply, distressingly hollow.<br /><br /> They were hollow, of course, to the extent that the ritual was staged as an exercise in educating open-minded Senators about how to vote.  There never seemed any likelihood that any Republican, including the pro-choice committee chairman, Senator Specter, would vote in opposition to the President&#39;s nominee.  It seems likely that most committee Democrats will vote against Alito, with the possible choice to support him dictated less by any new appreciation of the nominee&#39;s positions or qualifications than by the political fallout of voting one way or the other.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/alito.php">Samuel Alito</a> | Text: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/gazette/2006/01/alito-confirmation-hearings-transcript_13.php">Alito confirmation hearings transcript: Day 4</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2006/01/alito-confirmation-hearings-day-4-us.php">Alito confirmation hearings: Day 4</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /> They were hollow also in Republican claims for Alito and in Democrats&#39; hopes for a staggering gaffe.  The idea that Alito&#39;s personal values are irrelevant to his legal judgments and that he will serve simply as a distinguished neutral arbiter extracting objective results from unmediated readings of legal texts is just nonsense.  But so is the idea that he is nothing other than a well-domesticated monster, who might be tricked into finally revealing, &quot;I think anti-discrimination plaintiffs are crybabies,&quot; or, &quot;The Constitution allows government to compel pregnancy.&quot;<br /><br /> There are at least five reasons for the hollowness of the hearing ritual.  The first, of course, was Judge Alito&#39;s resolute determination to say relatively nothing that would shed light on his constitutional philosophy.  My personal favorite moment in this was his insistence that, after 15 years on the bench, he had not given sufficient thought to the question to opine whether Congress could eliminate all federal court jurisdiction over First Amendment cases.  <br /><br /> The second is that there was never a clear and open discussion about the relevance of personal and political values to judging, even though it was that very subject that lay at the heart of the hearings.  The Democrats and Republicans seemed, instead, to imply two implausible accounts of how Alito&#39;s conservatism might affect his performance.  In the Republican account, Alito is nothing but a fair and open-minded judgment machine without preconceptions; to the extent his conservatism matters, it matters only in that it counsels him to avoid the temptation of abandoning objective law for the pursuit of misguided liberal results.  In the Democratic account, Alito has a covert agenda.  No matter what he says, he probably has a list of legal outcomes he wants to achieve, and will use his tenure on the bench to consciously twist the law to those predetermined ends.<br /><br /> The Republican account is surely wrong, and one hopes that the Democrats&#39; account is also.  The reason why values matter to judging is because there is inevitably ambiguity in the resolution of hard legal cases.  In resolving those ambiguities, values matter not because judges approach cases with a predetermined agenda, but because the sifting of evidence and of contesting arguments will be shaped critically by the judge&#39;s value predispositions.   It is well known that people tend to accept evidence and argument too readily that conforms to their preconceptions, and to question disproportionately any evidence or argument that disconfirms their beliefs.  Judge Alito&#39;s starting points in judging are profoundly conservative, as any fair reading of his judicial record attests.  That&#39;s exactly why he was nominated.  That doesn&#39;t mean he will never reach a liberal result.  (Even Justice Scalia has opposed the criminalization of flag-burning and the incarceration of American citizens as enemy combatants.)  I would even imagine that, in approaching the next abortion case, Justice-to-be Alito will approach it with what he sincerely experiences as an open mind &#8212; just as I bet he is sincerely open-minded on the existence of unicorns.  Yet, I also know he will vote for a narrow reading of the right to privacy and, barring some radical life change, after 15 years on the Supreme Court, Samuel Alito will be known as a resolutely right-wing Justice.  That&#39;s because he will subconsciously prefer theories of interpretation and legal and evidentiary arguments that cohere with his conservative predispositions.  He won&#39;t even have to attend Federalist Society lunches to cement his reputation.<br /><br /> Because this discussion was never held, the hearings appeared hollow also because the Senators did not anchor their questioning in any clear criteria for accepting or rejecting judicial nominees.  If one agrees that values matter and a Senator believes that values provide good reasons for accepting or rejecting nominees, then questioning Judge Alito should have been easy.  He has stated his beliefs about hard legal questions on numerous occasions.  One would have expected Senators to say something like, &quot;Judge Alito, I cannot vote for you unless you affirm (repudiate) your prior statement, as follows:&quot;  If he tried to waffle, the Senator could just reiterate: &quot;Judge, I&#39;m asking you if you still stand behind your words.  Do you or don&#39;t you?&quot; Alternatively, if a Senator thinks only credentials matter, then questions along those lines would likewise have seemed easy.  What we got instead were pious pledges of open-mindedness and rambling recitations of the obvious.  Could I have been the only listener wondering if the next season of &quot;24&quot; could get an early s
tart?<br /><br /> A fourth reason for the hollowness of the hearings is that the Senators did not understand the law they were discussing.  This was most glaringly evident with respect to discussions of the unitary presidency.  The &quot;unitary presidency&quot; is an unfortunate label for this dispute because no one actually argues whether the presidency is unitary; there&#39;s only one.  Advocates of the unitary presidency argue from this, however, that the President is constitutionally entitled to supervise the exercise of any and all policy discretion vested in government officials outside Congress or the courts either by the Constitution or by statute.  Thus, to cite as one example an OLC opinion from the Alito era, if Congress authorizes the Center for Disease Control to circulate pamphlets on AIDS, the President is constitutionally entitled to edit them. The theory is also why Justice Scalia, for example, thought independent counsels were unconstitutional.<br /><br /> This theory has nothing to do with whether the President has implicit national security powers, which is an entirely different debate.  Advocates of an imperial presidency might be inclined to hold both beliefs, but they are analytically distinct, and many constitutional conservatives would vigorously deny the existence of unenumerated national security powers, even while defending the unitary presidency.  What is inconsistent with the unitary presidency is the notion of so-called &quot;independent&quot; agencies.  But no Senator asked Judge Alito to explain how he reconciles his support of the unitary presidency reading of the Constitution with his acknowledgment of the constitutionality of such agencies.  (A constitutional pluralist &#8212; unlike Judge Alito &#8212; could persuasively argue that, in delegating authority to administrative agencies that is not inherent in Article II, Congress is entitled to specify the degree to which the President may exercise policy supervision over the use of such authority.)  I am guessing the legal colloquies would have gone better had staff asked the legal questions.<br /><br /> Finally - and here, I expect pro-Alito observers are most likely to disagree - the hearings seemed hollow because a majority was willing to ignore autobiographical testimony that cannot possibly be viewed as candid.  There actually appears to be a growing tradition in confirmation hearings in favor of the acceptability of two kinds of obfuscation - the self-characterization that is plainly misleading, but technically accurate, and the implausible claim of amnesia.<br /><br /> In 1986, then-Judge Scalia perfectly crystallized the first strategy in uttering that, as he was &quot;embarrassed&quot; to admit, &quot;I cannot say that I have a fully framed omnibus view of the Constitution.&quot;  I, for one, readily concede that Judge Scalia probably had never given a moment&#39;s thought to how he would apply the Fugitive Slave Clause of Article IV.  But, if the point was to deny that he had a fully developed (even if not always observed) theory of constitutional interpretation that would almost invariably produce right-wing results, the statement was not true.<br /><br /> In 1991, then Judge Thomas most famously deployed the second strategy, claiming not to remember ever commenting on whether he thought <em>Roe v. Wade</em> was properly decided.<br /><br /> Now, we have Judge Alito seeming to blend the two approaches in his account of the Concerned Alumni of Princeton.  He has &quot;no specific recollection of that organization,&quot; and was &quot;rankled . . . for some time [about] the issue of ROTC&quot; at Princeton.  Note that Judge Alito does not deny remembering what CAP was.  He does not claim that he joined CAP because of ROTC.  He offers what presumably are technically accurate statements, rooted in improbable amnesia.<br /><br /> What&#39;s missing here, of course, is the central issue: The Office of Legal Counsel is supposed to be as close as the executive branch comes to having, within itself, the capacity for objective, dispassionate legal interpretation on behalf of the White House and other agencies.  Why did Judge Alito think his membership in CAP or the Federalist Society qualified him for that role?  (Hint: It&#39;s why he was nominated to the Supreme Court.)<br /><br /> Of course, one might say of all of this that we&#39;ve seen it before; at least the ritual is not getting worse.  But, actually, it is.  The deployment of a panel of sitting judges to attest to Judge Alito&#39;s qualifications may not have been technically unethical, but it is very disturbing.  What does this panel imply about Judge Alito&#39;s colleagues who did not testify?  About future sitting judges who might not call their colleagues in support?  The Republicans called their judges because, as is too often the case, they cared more about winning than about the possible negative impact on critical institutional norms &#8212; here, of judicial nonpartisanship.  The judges added nothing significant to the record, but their example threatens a new form of politicization of the judiciary, all for no good reason.<br /><br /> In short, I found it a dismaying five days.  But I&#39;m not an unhappy man.  A new season of &quot;24&quot; starts this week.    <br /><br /><em>Peter Shane is the Joseph S.

Rehnquist lobbied tirelessly during his two decades as<br />chief justice of the United States for pay increases for federal judges.  Rehnquist's replacement, John G. Roberts, Jr., is picking up where the late chief justice left off.  Roberts warns in his first report on the state of the federal judiciary that Congress's failure to raise judicial salaries beyond a modest cost-of-living increase represents a "direct threat to judicial independence." <br /><br />        The founding fathers certainly took judicial independence seriously. Not only did the Declaration of Independence criticize King George III for making "Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the Tenure of their Offices, and the Amount and Payment of their Salaries," but the Constitution itself endeavors to secure judicial independence by making the judiciary a separate branch of government, by awarding federal judges life tenure during good behavior, and by guaranteeing them a salary that cannot be diminished while they are in office. <br /><br />        Indeed, the framers said quite a bit about judicial compensation during the Constitutional Convention of 1787.  For example, the Virginia Plan introduced by Edmund Randolph on May 29, 1787, forbade both increases and decreases in federal judicial salaries. Pennsylvania's Gouverneur Morris quickly moved to permit periodic increases.  He made the obvious point in support of his motion that "the value of money" may fluctuate during a judge's tenure in office. He also suggested that likely changes in "the style of living" and in the volume of judicial business warranted a provision in the Constitution for periodic increases.  He added "that this would not create any improper dependence in the Judges." <br /><br />        James Madison, the author of the Virginia Plan, opposed Morris's motion, principally on the ground that judicial independence can be compromised as much by the lure of an increase in pay as by the threat of a decrease.  He informed the federal convention that "[w]henever an increase is wished by the Judges, or may be in agitation in the legislature, an undue complaisance in the former may be felt toward the latter" and that "it will be improper even so far to permit a dependence."  He recommended accounting for inflation "by taking for a standard [of compensation] wheat or some other thing of permanent value."  He also maintained that "[t]he increase of business will be provided for by an increase of the number who are able to do it" (in other words, by the appointment of more judges). <br /><br />        Madison's opposition proved ineffective, however.  On July 18, 1787, the convention passed Morris's motion to permit periodic increases&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;but not decreases&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;in the salary of federal judges.  Article III, section 1, provides:  "Judges . . . shall . . . receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office."<br /><br />        Although the preceding discussion might seem to support the Rehnquist/Roberts call for salary increases for federal judges, I don't think it does.  After all, federal district judges earn $165,200 a year, court of appeals judges receive $175,100, and associate justices of the Supreme Court make $203,000, with the chief justice earning an extra $9,100.  That's a more than livable wage, as the vast majority of American workers would attest.  It's certainly less money than many lawyers make in big-city law firms&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;a point emphasized by the chief justice&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;but lawyers in big-city law firms get paid too much.  Just ask their clients. . .<br /><br />        Moreover, many federal judges spent a large portion of their professional lives prior to being named to the bench politicking to be appointed.  It therefore rings a bit hollow, at least to me, for these same men and women to complain that making $165,200 to $212,100 a year is too much of a "sacrifice."  If it is, resign.  There are more than enough competent lawyers to replace them. <br /><br />        Last but far from least, although most federal judges will deny it to their dying days, they don't work very hard.  For example, the U.S. Supreme Court takes less than a hundred cases a year.  That workload is split among nine justices.  Each of the nine justices has a handful of extremely bright law clerks to help them with their work, and they also get the benefit of legal briefs submitted by lawyers who spent a lot of time and money researching and writing them.  To oversimplify a bit (but just a bit), all the justices need to do is pick the argument they like the best.  That's not difficult to do.  Certainly, anyone making six figures a year should be able to do it.  Again, if they can't, or if they don't want to, there are more than enough capable lawyers waiting in the wings who would be happy to switch places with them. <br /><br />        There may be a lot of problems with the state of the federal judiciary these days, but the adequacy of judicial compensation isn't one of them.<br /><br /> <br /><em>Scott D. Gerber is a law professor at Ohio Northern University.  He is currently writing a book on the origins of an independent judiciary.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist and <a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page1397.asp">UK Home Secretary Charles Clarke</a> says that as the British government&#39;s proposed Terrorism Bill proceeds through Parliament we should bear in mind that citizens of democracies expect not only the protection of individual rights, but also the protection of core democratic values such as safety and security...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/clarkeforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>M</strong></font>y foremost duty as the UK's Home Secretary is to provide security for Britain's citizens and its society. Without a basic level of protection from harm, the other social and economic advances the Government want to make for the benefit of all cannot be made.<br /><br />For more than 30 years the UK has fought domestic terrorism and as a result we have a formidable raft of legal tools which are at the disposal of law enforcement agencies. However, the new threat of international terrorism is a different beast &#8212; the motivation for these terrorists is not political, but ideological. <br /><br />Those who attacked America in 2001 and London in July this year don't come from a background of poverty or social exclusion, but from well educated and prosperous conditions. Furthermore, they are driven by an indiscriminate hatred which thinks nothing of killing large numbers of wholly innocent people, including genuine believers from religions the terrorists purport to be supporters of.<br /><br />This is the context in which the UK has had to develop new powers to defeat the new international terrorism which is now a very dangerous reality.<br /> <br />First, I think it's important to set out what we are seeking to defend through the laws we are proposing in the Terrorism Bill which is currently before Parliament. The UK, like the US, values a society with free speech and freedom of expression; believes all faiths, races and beliefs should be treated with respect; is grounded on the rule of law; gives every citizen a stake in our democracy; values a free economy and fully appreciates the fact that women can, and should, play a full role in our society.<br /><br />These values are not slight or passing. They are deeply rooted and profound &#8212; and they are worth protecting and fighting for. The Bill currently before Parliament seeks to build our democracy, alienate extremism and hatred and protect our citizens through three key proposals: making clear what is illegal in terms of acts preparatory to terrorism; tightening laws on terrorist training and outlawing encouragement to terrorism. The Bill also extends the maximum period of time the police can hold a suspect before charging them.<br /><br />We have seen time and again that modern terrorist outrages are often highly sophisticated attacks, highly planned and meticulously prepared. Often a great deal of time is spent on preparation and it's only a short while before the actual attack that the final target is known. It's therefore important the police and security service can intervene early to bring conspirators to justice before an attack takes place. The proposed offence of acts preparatory to terrorism would capture such activity. Prosecutors would have to show intent, but on conviction the maximum sentence is life.<br /><br />This desire to take a preventative approach to terrorism is continued in our proposals around terrorist training and training camps. Despite it already being an offence to give or receive training in firearms, explosives and chemical, biological or nuclear weapons there is a potential loophole where activity is not overtly linked to terrorism.  Our proposal closes this gap by making it an offence to provide or receive any type of training where the intention is that it be used for terrorist purposes, for example flying a plane).  This also allows us to be able to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism. We want further, to tighten the law so that those who attend terrorist training camps either here or abroad will be liable for prosecution.<br /><br />Clauses in the Bill which outlaw the encouragement of terrorism are an attempt to deal with those who incite terrorism obliquely but who nevertheless contribute to creating a climate in which impressionable people might believe that terrorism is acceptable (it is already an offence under UK law to directly encourage terrorist acts). This indirect incitement also includes glorifying terrorist acts where doing so could encourage others to emulate them. Concerns have been raised about the impact this clause would have on free speech. I recognise the genuine concerns here and am prepared to listen t them. But I maintain that it's not right when one value we hold dear as part of our society tramples on another value we hold equally close. So, that where free speech encourages a climate that makes communities of faiths, races or beliefs feel threatened, or where free speech is used to attack the democracy of our society and claim innocent lives it cannot be right. In such circumstances it is right to allow for a sanction against unadulterated free speech for the security and good of the whole society. This is not censorship, nor a desire to gag the voice of particular people, but if a society is to share values we all have to work within those to protect them.<br /><br />The pre-charge detention period for suspected terrorists is another element of the Bill which has attracted significant criticism. The Government proposed changing to a maximum of 90 days the period for which suspected terrorists could be held before charging, instead of the current 14. The Police made the case for 90 days believing that it would make the country more secure than we are at the moment. For example, following the London bombings in July, the police investigation involved painstaking examination of weeks of CCTV footage, fingertip searches of buildings and landfill sites, trawling through telephone and e-mail records and extensive queries overseas and cracking encrypted computer files. This resulted in tremendous amounts of information which needs to be sorted through. I can all too easily see a day when a suspect implicated in a terrorist plot is detained for 14 days, but then must be released onto the streets because there is insufficient evidence at that stage on which to bring charges. Put simply, 14 days isn't long enough to thwart today's terrorists and the police asked us to extend this to a maximum of 90 days for instances where this might be needed. I agreed with the police's expert analysis, but Parliament disagreed, preferring instead an extension to a maximum of 28 days.  <br /><br />Along with the glorification clause, the pre-charge detention period is another example where we have to reassess the rights we value in our society in the face of the threat we are presented with. I argue that the citizens I represent &#8212; and I believe the peoples of all democracies including America &#8212; expect not only the protection of individual rights, but also the protection of democratic  values such as safety and security. I say that the right to be protected from the death and destruction caused by indiscriminate terrorism is at least as important as the right of the terrorist to be held for the minimum period necessary for a police investigation <br /><br />Of course, none of this is being done without consulting all sectors of society, including all faith communities. Throughout the summer Ministers have been meeting with many people including representatives of the Muslim community and we've worked closely with them on a series of ideas that have resulted in a National Advisory Council of Imams and Mosques to advise Mosques on how to prevent extremists; a National Forum against Extremism and Islamophobia to develop a youth oriented theological count
er-narrative to Islamic justification for terrorism and a national roadshow of populist religious scholars who are highly influential with young Muslims and have the capacity to reach tens of thousands at a time, expounding the concepts of Islam in the West and condemning extremism.<br /><br />By holding on to our core values we can strengthen our democracy while also defeating the terrorists who want to destroy it &#8212; this is the prize we must fight for.<br />    <br /><br /><em>The Rt. Hon. Charles Clarke MP is the United Kingdom&#39;s Secretary of State for the Home Office</em><br />

		<title>Alito Day 4: Polarized Politics and Judicial Confirmations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/faculty_profile.asp?facultynum=055">Mark Graber</a> of the University of Maryland School of Law says that the Alito hearings have demonstrated yet again that political polarization has impoverished the judicial confirmation process...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/markgraber.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he fourth day of the Alito hearings highlighted the ongoing and complex role political polarization plays in the contemporary judicial confirmation process.  <br /><br />There are no liberal Republicans or conservative Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee.  Senator Arlen Specter remains the only member of the committee who appears at all ambivalent.  Remarkably, however, this highly polarized committee celebrates moderation.  Although most Republican senators champion constitutional visions similar to those articulated by Justices Scalia and Thomas and most Democrats champion constitutional visions similar to those articulated by Justices Breyer and Ginsberg, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was the one justice Alito was obligated to praise on Thursday, even though there is no evidence that he or any senator other than Specter shares in O'Connor's constitutional vision or understanding of the judicial function.  <br /><br />The vagarities of the confirmations process have everything to do with the contemporary state of American politics, and little to do with any commitment to constitutional minimalism on the left or the right. <br /><br />Politics in the United States is presently as polarized as at any previous time in American history.  Both parties consistently champion policies preferred by their activist base, rather than those favored by the fictional median voter.  Republican platforms call for bans on all abortions.  Democrats insist abortion should be legal and almost unregulated.  No party and few politicians insist that abortion should be legal and heavily regulated, even though that is the opinion of most Americans.  This strategy is often successful in electoral and legislative politics partly because activists contribute more money and participate more in primary elections than other Americans, and partly because the parties are often able to present policies as more centrist than they actually are.<br /><br />The Supreme Court is the one institution that reaches the centrist position on abortion and on issues as diverse as affirmative action, the death penalty, and federalism.  With a majority nominated by a president of one-party and confirmed by a Senate controlled by the other party, the Supreme Court for the past 20 years has had a far greater capacity to articulate moderate positions then the Congress, the White House, or the two major parties.  This centrism explains why the public consistently expresses more support for the Supreme Court than any other political institution and why Justice O'Connor is far more popular among the American people than the legal elite.  Her efforts to split the difference between contending constitutional visions may not have resulted in brilliant legal opinions admired by named chairs at top 10 law schools, but they reached conclusions supported by the average American.<br /><br />The challenge for Republican Senators during the Alito hearings has been how to remake the Supreme Court in the image of its activist base while presenting their judicial nominees in the image of Justice O'Connor.  <br /><br />The transcript of Thursday&#39;s hearings suggests that, like Judge Alito, Republican senators have no agenda at all other than to place a competent jurist on the supreme federal bench.  Several passed on opportunities to ask questions, Senator Sessions devoted some time to recounting when Alito and his sister were debate partners, and Senator Grassley made a speech about the Federal False Claims Act which he then concluded had nothing to do with the confirmation hearing.  Confident that Judge Alito is one of their own, conservative Republican felt no need to ask him to articulate and defend his distinctive constitutional vision.<br /><br />The challenge for Democratic senators is how to maintain the O'Connor Court, given they can expect no better in the present political and legal environment.  After spending the first three days focusing on matters that might mobilize their activist base, Democrats on Thursday raised issues aimed at the center.  Several suggested that Alito would not rein in the Bush administration on any war on terrorism related policy. Senator Durbin focused on a case where Alito found nothing constitutionally wrong with strip searching a 10-year old girl, and several Democrats continued to question whether Alito should have recused himself in cases involving Vanguard funds in which he had invested.  This last matter is typical of political behavior when parties are polarized and fairly evenly divided.  As Benjamin Ginsberg and Martin Shefter detail in <em>Politics by Other Means</em>, the best strategy for gaining votes when most people have made up their mind on the issues is to accuse the other side of corruption.  Besides, by debating whether Judge Alito is corrupt or has a "judicial temperament," senators from both parties could appeal to the middle without compromising the policies preferred by their activist base.<br /><br />The "Constitution-in-exile" is being repatriated.  The content of this constitutional vision is being determined in private executive sessions in which Democrats are absent and the general public unable to witness.  By identifying Judge Alito with Justice O'Connor, conservative Republicans avoid any public discussion about their constitutional vision for the justification for the new, conservative judicial activism.  Although Democrats on Thursday pointed out that the Rehnquist Court has declared more federal laws unconstitutional than any previous tribunal, Republicans will continue to score political points by condemning judicial activism while stacking the federal bench with judicial activists of a different bent.<br /><br />The new Constitution in exile today is championed by liberal constitutional scholars.  If yesterday's questions by Democratic senators are any indication, the political version of that "shadow constitution" is both reactionary and impoverished.  Liberal Senator after liberal Senator expressed powerful commitments to precedent that if adhered to by Justices in previous cases would have prevented the Supreme Court from handing down the rulings Democrats now insist Judge Alito respect.  Once upon a time, liberals talked about labor unions and liberal constitutional theorists talked about welfare rights.  Now abortion and vague support for the "little guy" seemed to exhaust the constitutional position of the political left in the Senate.<br /><br />President Bush and the Senate may be engaged in good politics, but the spectacle they have presented to us is bad constitutionalism.  Political coalitions are constitutionally authorized to pack the bench with justices they believe share their constitutional vision.  There is nothing wrong with a president declaring that a judicial nominee has been selected because that person will support the constitutional goals of the executive branch.  Wide-ranging public debate over constitutional visions is in line with a healthy constitutional policy.  This debate is best promoted when presidents articulate their constitutional vision when making judicial nominations and their judicial nominees defend that vision during the confirmation process, while opponents offer alternative vision.  We have not had such a debate recently, as the president, senators, and the latest judicial nominees have followed carefully prepared scripts designed to confuse or, perhaps, bore the general public.  If Thursday and the entire week are any indication, we are
 moving toward a confirmation process in which the only question liberal and conservative justices will answer differently is "What is your name?"<br /><br /><br /><em>Mark Graber is a professor at the University of Maryland School of Law with a joint appointment in the Department of Government and Politics.</em><br />

US Army (Ret.) and former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters, now a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that the McCain Amendment on the treatment of detainees has been largely undermined not only by Presidential reservations on its signing but by its very own terms, including the incorporation of an extensive &quot;obedience to orders&quot; defense favoring employees of US government agencies, including the CIA....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/cornforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he recent compromise inclusion of an "obedience to orders" defense (Section 1404(a)) in the McCain Amendment, now incorporated into the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, has effectively undermined the goal Senator John McCain fought so long to achieve.  Instead of sending a clear message to U.S. forces that cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of detainees is never permissible, the compromise has validated President Bush's belief that the necessities of war provide the ultimate "trump card" to justify "whatever it takes" in the war on terror.<br /><br /> In a <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB127/02.02.07.pdf">memorandum</a> [PDF] dated February 7, 2002 the President ordered that Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees would be treated humanely, "to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity."  The President's determination that these detainees were not entitled to the legal protections of the Geneva Conventions was certainly controversial.   However, it was the assertion that military necessity could "override" the principle of humane treatment that contradicted the most basic understanding of the law of war and prior U.S. policy.  This assertion struck many experts as eerily reminiscent of the German concept of <em>kriegsraison</em> &#8212; the proposition that the necessities of war can serve as an ultimate "trump card" to justify "whatever it takes."  Because this concept was categorically invalidated during the post World War II war crimes trials, military legal practitioners struggled to come to terms with its apparent resurrection.  <br /><br /> In the wake of Abu Ghraib and other detainee abuse investigations, the national debate focussed on this issue, exposing the tension inherent in the President's policy, and the dangerous consequences of resurrecting such an unlimited notion of the necessities of war.  Senator McCain and other members of Congress demanded that the obligation to treat all detainees humanely, and more specifically the prohibition against cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment, be codified in U.S. law, and thus become immune from any "military necessity" override.  Although the Bush Administration initially opposed this initiative, Senator McCain's efforts culminated in a December compromise agreement.  McCain's goal of establishing at statutory "humane treatment" standard for all detainees will be achieved.  However, in exchange for administration support, Senator McCain agreed to include a provision granting employees of the CIA and other government agencies the right to assert an "obedience to orders" defense to any charge alleging a violation of this new statutory prohibition.  <br /><br /> The purported rationale for this "obedience to orders" exception is to provide government employees the benefit of the same legal defense applicable to members of the armed forces.  While this may seem reasonable, it in fact reflects an unfortunate dilution of the McCain's important objective, because this "obedience to orders" defense is as inherently inconsistent with the humane treatment mandate as was the President's "military necessity" override.  As a result, one must ponder whether this provision has resulted in the desired unambiguous mandate for U.S. personnel, or has instead validated the original <em>kriegsraison</em> approach so manifest in the President's February 7th policy.<br /><br /> The entire purpose of the effort to codify the humane treatment obligation was to eliminate uncertainty related to this basic humanitarian standard, and thereby send a clear and unambiguous message to all U.S. personnel that "a detainee is a detainee" no matter where captured or who fighting for.  This was a direct response to the dangerous uncertainty that resulted from multifarious legal categorizations established for individuals captured by U.S. forces since 9/11, uncertainty that has been identified as a major factor in detainee abuse incidents.  By including an "obedience to orders" defense, the law will exacerbate this uncertainty.  Instead of a clear and unambiguous statement of legal obligation, the modified McCain amendment instead confirms that the line between legal and illegal treatment is often blurry, and therefore soldiers and civilians ordered to execute policies established by military or civilian superiors should not question the legality of these orders.  It is impossible to reconcile this with the original motive for the McCain Amendment, which was that the fundamental nature of the humane treatment obligation should not be subject to the type of uncertainty that would justify an "obedience to orders" defense. <br /><br /> If there was any doubt that the objective of the Bush administration in reaching this compromise was to preserve maximum flexibility and authority for the President to direct interrogation and detention procedures, that doubt was dispelled by the President's December 30 <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051230-8.html">signing statement</a> for the legislation indicating that he would construe it consistent with his Commander-in-Chief powers and national security interests. It now seems clear that the President has prevailed in his effort to preserve maximum authority in relation to the treatment of detainees, and preserved his ability to order interrogation techniques that cross the line into cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment.  In the future, he need only characterize such techniques or policies as "not clearly illegal."  Thus, instead of providing the armed forces and other government agents a clear statutory basis upon which to oppose such orders, the compromise provision will instead provide "top cover" for those individuals inclined to push our forces into uncertain territory, which is exactly what so many hoped the McCain Amendment would prevent.  Although the Amendment may be "better than nothing", one must truly wonder if Congress and the President have not collectively set their seal on a new American <em>kriegsraison</em>.<br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a TARGET="_blank" href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Geoffrey_Corn.htm">Geoffrey S. Corn</a>, Lt. Col. US Army (Ret.) and former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters, now a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that US claims of adherence to the &quot;principles&quot; of the Geneva Conventions in the &quot;war on terror&quot; may not mean as much as some might think....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/cornforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>D</strong></font>uring her December visit to Europe, Secretary of State Rice <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/rice-assures-nato-leaders-that-us.php">reassured her European counterparts</a> that the United States remains committed to compliance with the "principles" of the Geneva Conventions. <br /><br />While this might seem like a significant commitment coming from an administration that has since 9/11 demonstrated an apparent commitment to opting out of international legal obligations, it is - unfortunately - relatively meaningless.<br /><br />What Secretary Rice omitted to share with her audience was that within the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense, there is no agreed-upon content to the term "principles" as applied to the Geneva Conventions.  <br /><br />For the last two decades, the "principles" of the law of war have provided the foundation for Department of Defense law of war policy.  According to <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf2/d510077p.pdf">Department of Defense Directive 5100.77</a> [PDF], "The DOD Law of War Program", the armed forces of the United States are obligated to comply with the "spirit and principles" of the law of war during all military operations, no matter how characterized.  This mandate was specifically intended to establish a baseline standard for U.S. forces applicable to military operations that ran the spectrum from non-conflict peacekeeping to high intensity armed conflict.  <br /><br />The concept of requiring the armed forces to comply with such principles reflects the pragmatic reality that confusion, delay, or politicization of "conflict classification" will often result in uncertainty for conducting military operations.  For example, when the United States launched Operation Just Cause to remove Manuel Noriega from his position of control in Panama, the Executive Branch refused to acknowledge that the combat operations qualified as an international armed conflict (a determination that was later categorically rejected by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in the decision holding that General Noriega was a prisoner of war pursuant to the Third Geneva Convention).  Nor did the United States acknowledge the formal applicability of the law of war to subsequent operations in Somalia, Bosnia, or Kosovo.  This policy therefore provided an essential source of authority for military legal advisors called upon to guide commanders in the decision-making process associated with such operations.<br /><br />While the specific content of this mandate was never detailed by the Department of Defense (nor the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the implementing Instruction CJCSI 5810.01A), a customary understanding nonetheless evolved among the armed forces.  As virtually all operational legal advisors learned, this umbrella term encompassed, at a minimum, three bedrock principles of the law of war: humanity (as reflected in the provisions of Common Article 3 and Article 75 of Additional Protocol I); distinction (as reflected in the rules related to military objective and precautions in the attack contained in Additional Protocol I); and the historically understood concept of military necessity.  Accordingly, for years Judge Advocate officers have been taught that these principles provide the essential "azimuth points" for the "legality" compass they must use to perform their functions as legal advisers, and that whether applicable as a matter of law or policy, they were pragmatically obligatory under all circumstances.<br /><br />This customary understanding of the "principles" of the law of war proved both valuable and effective through a range of military operations conducted by U.S. forces ranging from Grenada through Kosovo.  However, the policies, directives, and decisions that began to flow from the highest levels of our government following 9/11 began to challenge this understanding.  Perhaps the most prominent example of this development came in the form of the President's February 7, 2002 memorandum addressing obligations towards Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees.  In that memorandum, the President concluded not only that these detainees were not entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions, but that even the policy mandate that they be treated humanely was qualified "to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity."  <br /><br />This apparent invocation of military necessity as an "override" authority to justify derogation from even the most basic obligation of humane treatment contradicted the longstanding understanding of the "principles" of the law of war.  Subsequent decisions by the Bush administration seemed to confirm that the customary understanding of the universally binding nature the principle of humane treatment had in fact been reassessed.  As a result, military commanders and the Judge Advocates who advised them were left with even more uncertainty, and the recipients of a "case by case" assessment of what this policy actually means.<br /><br /> Since that time, there have been efforts to provide more detail to the concept of "principles" of the law of war.  However, these efforts have failed to alter the nebulous meaning of this policy mandate.  In fact, although DOD Directive 5100.77 is currently pending revision, it is highly unlikely the armed forces will be provided any additional detail as to the meaning of this term, leading to a continued case by case approach to determining what this mandate requires.  While this will no doubt serve the interests of proponents of maximum legal flexibility, it will do little to provide a meaningful set of standards upon which to build legally sound operations.<br /><br /> Against this backdrop the Bush administration has now begun to tout the longstanding commitment of the United States to "principles" of the Geneva Conventions.  What, however, does this really mean?  Without even a cursory enunciation of the content of these principles, the answer is nothing more than the administration wants it to mean in any given situation.  Such an amorphous and malleable standard might offer some value in a climate of demonstrated commitment to good faith compliance with the "spirit" of the Geneva Conventions, but sadly this is not the climate that currently prevails.  Instead, touting this term seems like just another example of hyperbole by an administration that seems determined to interpret law and mold policy in any way necessary to achieve their designated objectives.  <br /><br />It seems more than a little ironic that on the same December trip on which Secretary Rice was publicly emphasizing commitment to the &quot;principles&quot; of Geneva, she was privately explaining why the United States abducted a German citizen and deprived him of his liberty in Afghanistan for months &#8212; a "mistake" that was determined justified by the necessities of war.  I wonder where the "principles" were during that incident?<br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S. Corn is a Professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston.

		<title>Alito Day 4: A Political Process</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://fhss.byu.edu/PolSci/DAVISR/index.html">Richard Davis</a> of Brigham Young University says that at the end of four days of Senate confirmation hearings, Judge Samuel Alito appears to have succeeded in his political task of securing enough swing votes to avoid a filibuster and assure his appointment to the US Supreme Court ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/richarddavis.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he fourth day of the Samuel Alito confirmation hearings lacked much of the drama that characterized Wednesday's session.   There was little tension, nor even verbal sparring among senators.  The excitement of the hearings &#8212; waiting for Alito to make a verbal gaffe that departed from the script and somehow revealed his true feelings &#8212; was over.<br /><br />The Specter-Kennedy battle that occurred Wednesday faded away Thursday when Senator Specter announced that an examination of CAP (Concerned Alumni of Princeton) leader William Rusher's personal papers concluded that there was no mention of Alito.    This finding suggests that Alito may have overstated his involvement in CAP in 1985 when it was potentially beneficial to him, but, similarly, is understating it today (not even remembering when he joined).<br /><br />Judge Alito testified for four hours.   During that time, Alito did give some mildly interesting answers.  One, for example, came during questioning by Senator Kohl about whether judges should be term limited.   Alito favored looking at how other nations have treated tenure on their courts and made reference to the fact that most state courts apply term limits.  He even suggested that had he been a Framer he would not have opposed a long term for judges rather than life tenure.   In an answer to Senator Schumer, Alito said he had no quarrel with post-New Deal interpretation of the commerce clause and acknowledged that interpretation of the clause had evolved over the nation's history.  He also admitted he felt that acts of Congress had a strong presumption of constitutionality and that information obtained through torture would be impermissible. <br /><br />But Alito refused to comment on a number of other issues.  Once again, he demurred on the <em>Kelo</em> case.  He did use the opportunity to state that the precedent set by the case would be important to him.   (In doing so, he was indirectly addressing the accusation that he is unwilling to follow precedent.)  He also would not speculate on whether Congress had the power to deny citizenship to someone born in the United States.<br /><br />Alito was not the only witness of the day.  Three panels followed him.  They included  representatives from the ABA, colleagues who had worked with him on the Third Circuit, and colleagues from the executive branch and academics.  <br /><br />But the main witness of any Senate confirmation hearing is the nominee.  According to Senator Specter, Judge Alito had fielded 700 questions over 18 hours of testimony. What do those 18 hours tell us about Samuel Alito's chances to win confirmation?<br /><br />In short, Samuel Alito didn't hurt himself.   He made no gaffes that provided ammunition to his opponents.  He avoided statements that would suggest he carried an ideological agenda or would willy-nilly attack precedents he disagreed with.  That isn't to say these things aren't true about him.  But he did not give that impression over 18 hours sitting at the witness table.  <br /><br />Some Democrats may have been sorely disappointed, and at least frustrated.  Their frustration speaks to the fiction that the purpose of the hearings is to understand the nominee's views so senators can make a judgment about whether to vote for confirmation.  That may be how the public views it.  It may be how current textbooks describe it.  Yet, when nearly all senators enter the hearings knowing how they will vote on a nominee, and when questions are predictably softball on one side of the horseshoe-shaped bench and aggressive on the other, it is easy to conclude, to paraphrase Mae West, that truth has nothing to do with it.<br /><br />The real objective is political.  Judge Alito's job was to maintain enough votes of swing senators like Lindsey Graham and Arlen Specter to secure a majority both on the committee and in the full Senate, as well as to make a filibuster seem nakedly political and therefore not a viable option for Democrats.  He did that.  In fact, unless some bombshell drops between now and the floor vote, Alito will probably get the support of at least two or three Democrats, maybe more. <br /><br />What Alito didn't do was turn this confirmation from a partisan conflict into a consensus vote.   Perhaps he could not have done so or, in line with the intense partisanship with which George W. Bush has governed since 2001, had no intention of doing so.  Nevertheless, the change is significant and suggests that, even absent a smoking gun, the minority party in the Senate will oppose a nominee who fits the president's intended judicial mold merely on the grounds that the nominee fits the president's intended judicial mold.<br /><br />With that goal, it is understandable why Alito performed the way he did.  He answered questions; in fact, nearly all of them.   But that doesn't mean his words necessarily were answers.  Sometimes he chose to say that he needed more specifics to answer a question.  And then, when more specifics were provided, he said he could not comment because it might be a pending case.  At other times, he would answer that he had not thought about an issue, as he did with the <em>Bush v. Gore</em> case or whether he would recuse himself in cases arising from the judges who testified on his behalf.  <br /><br />Admittedly, Alito, like other nominees, faced quandaries.  One involves ethics. As Justice Ginsburg testified, a nominee shouldn't give hints or previews. <br /><br />But the other is political: What to say that will help maintain, or perhaps win, support without simultaneously losing it.  Not only was the nominee facing a nearly divided Senate Judiciary Committee, but also a nearly divided nation.  Once on the Court, he will have more freedom to take sides.  But at this juncture, he is still dependent not only on the individuals sitting in front of them (as well as their Senate colleagues), but also on public opinion that could shift away from him and unleash a wave of nervousness on the part of swing senators.  <br /><br />With that pressure, one might think it would be best for a nominee to avoid saying anything at all.  Yet, Alito did take positions on issues.  He said he supported a right of privacy.  He said he had no quarrel with post New Deal commerce clause interpretation and a right of privacy, and the principle of one man-one vote.  These have become valence issues where a nominee is expected to mirror public thinking on the issue.  On other issues that don't fall in that category &#8212; such as abortion or the denial of citizenship rights to immigrant children &#8212; Alito ducked. As Senator Biden noted, the freedom with which a nominee takes issue positions is related to the popularity of the statement.  <br /><br />Biden also suggested Thursday that the Senate scrap the hearings and just move the nomination directly to the Senate floor.  If hearings really are all about courting public opinion with popular statements and ducking unpopular ones, he may have a point.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Richard Davis is a professor of political science at Brigham Young University  and the author of </em>Electing Justice:  Fixing the Supreme Court Nomination Process<em> (Oxford, 2005)</em><br />

		<title>AUMF and the Ever-Increasing Importance of Padilla</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.miami.edu/facadmin/faculty/svladeck.html">Stephen Vladeck</a> of the University of Miami School of Law says that for all the issues presented at various junctures by the Jose Padilla case, none is more important - nor, at this point, more politically sensitive - than that concerning the extent of Presidential power under the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/vladeck.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>t various points, the case of accused "dirty bomber" Jose Padilla has raised a veritable bevy of distinct and complicated legal questions, including next-friend standing, the identity of the proper respondent in a federal <em>habeas</em> petition, the scope of New York's long-arm statute, more general questions of procedural due process, mootness, and, most recently, a spirited debate over the meaning of the Supreme Court's seldom-invoked Rule 36 (resolved, it would appear, by the recent Supreme Court order transferring Padilla to civilian custody). From the beginning, however, the core of Padilla's legal challenge has been about a single threshold issue exceedingly simple in formulation: Does the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), signed into law just one week after September 11, authorize Padilla's military detention as an "enemy combatant"? The central question has remained the same since Padilla first filed his <em>habeas</em> petition in June 2002, but the stakes have increased considerably over time, particularly in the four months since the Fourth Circuit's September decision answering that question in the affirmative. <br /><br /> At the time it was initially filed, Padilla's was one of only two cases directly implicating the Bush Administration's broad reading of the AUMF. Only the already pending <em>habeas</em> petition of fellow U.S. citizen Yaser Esam Hamdi, also detained as an "enemy combatant," turned so directly on the meaning of the AUMF. The central role of the AUMF was guaranteed by the so-called Non-Detention Act, 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 4001(a), which provides that "[n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained except pursuant to an Act of Congress." With no other Act of Congress an obvious candidate for satisfying &Acirc;&#167; 4001, the scope and meaning of the AUMF was the key to both cases from the start.<br /><br /> Yet, notwithstanding the importance of the AUMF to <em>Hamdi</em> and <em>Padilla</em>, it was hardly surprising that Chief Judge Mukasey, presiding over Padilla's <em>habeas</em> petition in the Southern District of New York, wrote the following in early 2003:<blockquote> Those to whom images of catastrophe come that easily might take comfort in recalling that it is a year and a half since September 11, 2001, and Padilla's is not only the first, but also the only case of its kind. There is every reason not only to hope, but also to expect that this case will be just another of the isolated cases, like [Ex parte] Quirin, that deal with isolated events and have limited application.</blockquote>Time, however, has proven Judge Mukasey's optimism near-sighted. Although no other U.S. citizens have been detained as "enemy combatants" since (not yet, anyway), the AUMF <strong>has</strong> come to play an increasingly prominent (and far broader) legal role, especially in recent months. Specifically, the AUMF has been invoked by the Administration as providing congressional authorization for everything from domestic spying by the NSA to secret prisons abroad; from military tribunals for non-citizens to indefinite military detention in contravention of the Geneva Conventions. Put simply, the AUMF, an amorphous, ambiguous statute passed in the height of post-September 11 anxiety, has become <strong>the</strong> stated justification for virtually everything controversial that the President does, notwithstanding more specific congressional statutes purporting to foreclose the very authority that, according to the Administration, the AUMF provides (for example, consider <em>Padilla</em> and the Non-Detention Act).<br /><br />But what does the AUMF actually say? Here's the relevant part:<blockquote> the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.</blockquote>So, in all of these cases, as in <em>Padilla</em>, the question becomes what, exactly, the statute means by "necessary and appropriate force"? Writing for the <em>Hamdi</em> plurality in 2004, Justice O'Connor didn't really answer that question; she held only that it clearly encompassed the detention of combatants captured on the battlefield. In her words:<blockquote>The AUMF authorizes the President to use "all necessary and appropriate force" against "nations, organizations, or persons" associated with the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. There can be no doubt that individuals who fought against the United States in Afghanistan as part of the Taliban, an organization known to have supported the al Qaeda terrorist network responsible for those attacks, are individuals Congress sought to target in passing the AUMF. We conclude that detention of individuals falling into the limited category we are considering, for the duration of the particular conflict in which they were captured, is so fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an exercise of the "necessary and appropriate force" Congress has authorized the President to use.</blockquote>Pointedly, <em>Hamdi</em> declined to analyze what limits, if any, there were on the "necessary and appropriate force" authorized by the AUMF. But this is the very issue at stake in <em>Padilla</em>.<br /><br /> More to the point, in the nineteen months since the Court decided <em>Hamdi</em>, identifying substantive limits on the authority conferred by the AUMF has become that much more important. Every time that the Administration has been pressed to explain the source of its authority to undertake controversial activity in recent months, its argument has consistently reduced to one of two claims: Either Congress has authorized the President's actions through the AUMF, or the President has independent (and inherent) constitutional authority via the various powers conferred by Article II. If this sounds familiar, it should &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; this has been the Administration's position in <em>Padilla</em> from day one, and this is why it is so important that the Supreme Court grant certiorari when it considers <em>Padilla</em>'s second petition for <em>certiorari</em>.<br /><br />In an earlier <a href="/forumy/2005/10/jose-padilla-and-milligan-problem.php">JURIST column</a>, I described <em>Padilla</em> as "the ultimate litmus test in the war on terrorism." It has only become that much more so in the intervening months. More than any other case currently in the pipeline, <em>Padilla</em> (1) presents the Administration's theory of presidential power at its core; and (2) concerns an area where the inherent power argument has been the most heavily discredited. In short, <em>Padilla</em> is, or at least could be, the moment of truth for the government's interpretation of the AUMF, and, as such, for the contention that Congress has implicitly authorized counter-terrorism activities that more specific statutes &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and the American constitutional tradition &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; explicitly reject.<br /><br /><hr size=1><br />Also by Stephen Vladeck:<br /><ul><li><a href="/forumy/2005/11/charging-padilla-mootness-and-chief.php">Charging Padilla: Mootness and Chief Justice Re

All told, both sides accomplished much in front of the TV cameras: Alito came off as a smart, likeable fellow with conservative credentials, but he&#39;s done some strange things, and some of his decisions seem at least scary.<br /><br />Alito&#39;s supporters can&#39;t seem to make up their minds whether they like him because he decides cases irrespective of his personal values or because his decisions reflect personal values they like.  His detractors can&#39;t seem to decide whether he&#39;s dishonest or too honest.  For the most part, Alito skirted or evaded the hardest questions: whether he would overrule <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, or allow the president to do anything the president pleases.<br /><br />Senator Specter started off with long questions on abortion and President Bush&#39;s illegal eavesdropping on Americans, but he deferred to Alito - near the end asking mildly after a long question, &quot;Care to comment?&quot; - and accepted vague, noncommital responses.  <br /><br />Specter emphasized Justice Jackson&#39;s three-part formulation of executive power in foreign affairs set out in the <em>Steel Seizure Case</em> during the Korean War - actions authorized by Congress, actions repudiated by Congress, and a &quot;zone of twilight&quot; in-between (perhaps anticipating the popular Rod Serling TV series).  Alito and several senators liked the Jackson formulation as a general framework, and it became the hands-down winning judicial formulation of the second day of hearings.<br />        <br />It got scary when Senator Leahy, and later Senator Kennedy, pushed Alito on:<ul><li>President Bush&#39;s wiretapping without authorization in violation of a federal statute (and, though little discussed, the Fourth Amendment), and Bush&#39;s initial opposition to a congressional ban on torture followed by his signature on the act banning torture and a later disclaimer that it limited him at all.<br /><br /><li>Alito&#39;s approval, in a dissent criticized by Judge Michael Chertoff, now Secretary of Homeland Security, of an unauthorized strip search of a 10-year-old girl, and of an unauthorized gunpoint &quot;eviction&quot; of a farmer and ransacking of his home.<br /><br /><li>Alito&#39;s role in the Concerned Alumni of Princeton (CAP), which opposed admission of women and minorities to that once all white and male (and seldom Italian or Catholic) university.</ul>Alito conceded that the president must follow the law, but gave no concrete indication of what limits he sees on presidential power.  He had farfetched rationales - meaningful to few if any judges besides himself - for approving the searches.  And he tried to sidestep the CAP issue.<br /><br />His role in CAP, though it goes back to his student days, is quite troubling.  In his initial response, Alito claimed to hardly remember what CAP was or whether he played any part in it.  He said he was concerned about ROTC being on the campus, which CAP also was.  But CAP was most known for its opposition to women and minorities on campus - which led basketball player and later Senator Bill Bradley, and Senate Republican leader Bill Frist, to publicly repudiate CAP.  Alito, whose memory seems quite intact, couldn&#39;t remember why he boasted about his CAP membership on his application for a job in the Reagan Justice Department in 1985 - almost two decades later, by which time CAP was unambiguously known, and notorious, for its lament for the bygone days of Princeton&#39;s racial and gender exclusivity.  <br /> <br />The whole matter may be worse if he really played no significant role in CAP.  That would appear to mean that he exaggerated his participation in CAP to curry favor with the Reaganites by demonstrating an early opposition to the demands of minorities and women.<br /><br />An unexpectedly large portion of the questioning and answering was devoted to an ethical question.  Judge Alito had a substantial investment in Vanguard mutual funds, but he did not recuse himself in a case in which Vanguard was sued, and he ruled and wrote an opinion in favor of Vanguard.  When an accusatory motion to disqualify him was filed by the losing plaintiff, Alito recused himself and requested that the court re-hear the matter without him.  Ownership of mutual funds doesn&#39;t ordinarily require recusal, but Alito had made a sweeping commitment to the Judiciary Committee at his confirmation hearing for the Court of Appeals: he would go further than required by recusing himself in matters involving mutual funds he owned, and, specifically, in matters involving Vanguard.<br />  <br />Alito testified that he didn&#39;t realize Vanguard was a party.  This was unconvincing because Vanguard&#39;s name was all over the briefs - and the opinion written by Alito.  It didn&#39;t help that earlier he had offered another explanation.  <br /><br />There is still another possibility.  Perhaps - and this is speculative, not based on any inside or other information - he didn&#39;t read the opinion, though it bears his name.  The case was a <em>pro se</em> appeal, an appeal by a party without counsel representing himself.  The opinion could have been written, for Alito&#39;s signature, by his or a Third Circuit law clerk.  This sort of thing isn&#39;t supposed to happen, of course.  But I don&#39;t think he&#39;s corrupt, and there&#39;s no good reason for him to purposely disregard his promise to the Judiciary Committee.  Nor is it plausible that he wrote the opinion and missed Vanguard.  Not noticing Vanguard, though not helpful to his confirmation, may sound better than not reading opinions you wrote.<br /> <br />There wasn&#39;t any smoking gun - although Alito cast a strange lone vote to invalidate the decades old congressional ban on machine guns.  But the emerging image of his values, approaches and concrete decisions would, like Judge Robert Bork&#39;s in the 1980s, not be appealing if widely understood by the public.<br />  <br />In Alito&#39;s jurisprudence, the freedom, liberty and rights of individuals regularly pale in favor of the wishes of government, corporations and the most powerful and wealthiest among us.  His decisions very consistently make it near impossible to sue, for example, corporations that pollute, police who search, arrest, point guns and ransack at will and without authorization, and employers who discriminate based on race or gender.  His early writings yearn for undiluted executive power, and repudiate the most fundamental principle of a fair electoral process - one person, one vote.  <br /><br />He denies some of it, and has trouble remembering the rest.                   <br /><br /><br /><em>David Kairys, a law professor at Temple University, is editor of The Politics of Law (Basic Books 1998).</em><br />

		<title>Alito Day 2: Opinions Wanted</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.bancroftassociates.net/prof_wkeefer.htm">Wendy J. Keefer</a>, former senior counsel and chief of staff in the US Department of Justice Office of Legal Policy and now with Bancroft Associates in Washington DC, says that on the second day of the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Samuel Alito senators spent too much time trying to discover his opinions on policy rather than exploring his thoughts on judicial process...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wendykeefer.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>oday was America's first clear look at Samuel Alito.  Where yesterday's opening session of the confirmation proceedings was all about the Senators themselves and their thoughts on the state of the law, today we caught a glimpse into Judge Alito's legal thinking.  But through no fault of the nominee, we got only a glimpse.  <br /><br /> As predicted, too many questions went to the nominee's opinions about outcomes rather than process.  Where judges ought to be concerned merely with an objective method or process for applying the law to cases regardless of outcome, the hearings exposed a disturbing outcome determinative view of the law.  Where the hearings seek to commit the nominee to certain positions, unattached to the facts of any real dispute, they are sure to achieve nothing but risk the independence of the nominee and ultimately the judiciary as a whole.<br /><br /> No more evident was this fact than in the focus placed on Judge Alito's prior 1990 statement to the Committee, a statement made in answer to written questions relating to his confirmation to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, regarding interests he then held that might require possible future recusal from cases.  In responding to those questions, Judge Alito indicated that his holding of mutual funds with Vanguard might require recusal.  Then in 2002, some 12 years later, a case involving Vanguard did arise in the Third Circuit, but the outcome was one in which Judge Alito had no financial interest.  At that time, Judge Alito did not recuse himself from the decision.  <br /><br />Putting aside whether the decision by Judge Alito not to recuse himself was correct and ethical &#8212; as I believe it was &#8212; today's inquiry by several members of the Judiciary Committee sets a dangerous precedent.  For it is not the actual recusal decision that seemed to be problematic for these Senators, rather it was that Judge Alito had, as one Senator explained in his opening remarks on Monday, "broken his word" to the Committee.  Today Senators again focused on this issue, at least in one instance insinuating some dishonesty on the part of the nominee who "under oath" in 1990 indicated that at that time he had interests in Vanguard that might require recusal.  It is important to note that the questionnaire's inclusion about a nominee's interests that might require recusal is in large part simply a way for the President and the Senate to ensure that a nominee's interests are not so widely spread that recusal will be required from a large number of cases.  It is not a test for future performance.<br /><br />And it is not just questions of ethics or procedure on which some members of the Senate sought some sort of promised future performance.  Though often prefacing questions with the claim that the Senator had no interest in Judge Alito's personal opinions on abortion, the questions asked routinely did demand Judge Alito's opinion on just that topic &#8212; though admittedly disguised in most instances in the legalese of constitutional theory.  Similar questions were posed in connection with a Title VII employment discrimination case that came before Judge Alito in the Third Circuit.  There too it was not the process of reaching the decision but the outcome that drew the attention of the Senators.  <br /><br />Indeed, several times during today's proceedings viewers were treated to statistics on the number of times Judge Alito ruled against individuals and for the government or against employees asserting discrimination and for their employers.  But these statistics are meaningless without reference to the facts that gave rise to a given case.  None of us, as litigants, would want courts that decided cases based on whether the court needed a win for one type of litigant over another to better even out its numbers.  Nor should litigants desire judges who seek predetermined outcomes without reference to the unique facts of each case.<br /><br />From abortion, to employment discrimination, to the powers of the Executive Branch, today's hearings were little more than an attempt by the Committee to tie Judge Alito to certain predetermined positions.  Senators engaged in such a strategy regardless of the implications that strategy may have on his future ability to appear impartial should those issues come before him, whether he is confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice or remains on the Third Circuit.<br /><br />For Alito's part, as can be expected in an adversary position, he was at times noticeably flustered and he lacks the polished presentation of a John Roberts, now Chief Justice Roberts, but the answers he provided should comfort those watching and listening.  True to his opening statement that he had no agenda as a judge, he eloquently explained today that our system of separated powers provides a clear role for judges and that role does not include lawmaking.  Judges merely interpret the law.  And the law comes from the legislature; it is the legislature that is the policy maker, not the court.<br /><br />For those Senators who admittedly believe that judges have a role in making law and not merely applying it, questions on the outcome of future cases is understandable.  And though I disagree on the position of those Senators, they are truthful about the purpose of their questioning.  But let us not permit the rest to pretend they have no interest in the nominee's personal views or that they are not attempting to demand the nominee's commitment to a certain policy agenda.  To accept these attempts is to give up the ideal of an independent judiciary.<br /><br />This process is, to be sure, a political "kabuki dance" or "subtle minuet," as described by the Committee members themselves, but the significance of the dance will impact a generation.<br />  <br /><br /><em>Wendy J.

		<title>Alito Day 1: Of Kabuki Dances and Subtle Minuets</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wcl.american.edu/faculty/wermiel/">Stephen Wermiel</a> of American University Washington College of Law says that it is important to watch not only the posturing that began yesterday inside the hearing room for Judge Samuel Alito, but also to monitor the spin, polling and strategy that occurs outside...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wermiel.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he political ritual that Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.) has called "this Kabuki dance" began yesterday for the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court. And participants on both sides of the aisle quickly staked out so many positions, the hearing room in the Hart Senate Office Building could have resembled a land claims office during the California Gold Rush.<br /><br />But the opening statements on the first day shed little light on what may be a critical question for the Alito nomination: whether there is one nomination process or two. There is no question that for the rest of this week, legal and political scrutiny will be focused on what takes place inside the hearing room &#8212; how Senators ask, and how Alito answers questions on a broad range of controversial and lightening rod topics. <br /><br />It is also important to remember that there is a second, perhaps parallel track &#8212; how the nomination is playing outside the hearing room. Even before the hearings began yesterday, there was a flurry of activity outside the Senate's process. For example, the <em>Washington Post</em> reported yesterday morning the results of up-to-date polling showing that 53% believed Alito should be confirmed while 27% thought he should be rejected. Also before the hearings began, President Bush appeared at the White House after having breakfast with Alito to reaffirm his support and praise for the Supreme Court nominee. Ads from interest groups for and against Alito continued to air on television stations in states where Senators are considered pivotal. And during the course of the day, Alito was defended by conservatives at <em>National Review Online</em>, among other places, and treated skeptically at the liberal Alliance for Justice's <em>Supreme Court Watch</em>.<br /><br />How important will this parallel hearing be &#8212; operating in the world of spin, polling data and voting strategy? The first day of the hearing did nothing to illuminate this question. To be sure, with the Senate controlled by a 55-vote Republican majority, it seems unlikely anything will occur at the hearing that will cause the nomination to be "spun" out of control. However, the possibility for a filibuster led by Democrats still hangs as a wild card over the hearing, making control of the image of the hearings and of public opinion potentially important.<br /><br />It is possible to sit in the hearing room and have little or no sense of this parallel spin process that is swirling just beyond the doors. Listening to Alito's opening remarks, one could imagine that there was nothing controversial about the nomination. He did his best to sound like "everynominee," a kind of universal prototype for Supreme Court nominees: son of an immigrant family that worked their way out of poverty; childhood in an embracing, friendly New Jersey neighborhood that was not well-off; attended public schools but made it down the road to Princeton University; a believer in a role for judges that is agenda-free and considers each case on its merits.<br /><br />Who could disagree with his statement that, "A judge can't have any agenda, a judge can't have any preferred outcome in any particular case. . .The judge's only obligation &#8212; and it's a solemn obligation &#8212; is to the rule of law."<br /><br />Probably no one in the room disagreed, but there were certainly Senators who were skeptical about whether Alito really meant what he said or was simply posturing for purposes of the hearing. It is a process that Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA) described yesterday in his own metaphor, observing, "It has been my experience that the hearings are really, in effect, a subtle minuet, with the nominee answering as many questions as he thinks necessary in order to be confirmed."<br /><br />Kabuki dance or subtle minuet, the process begins in earnest today, and Senators made clear there are numerous issues and a range of different standards on the table. Republicans largely said that Alito should hold his ground and not be pressured to give detailed answers about controversial issues that may come before the Court. They attributed this approach to the way Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg answered &#8212; or more to the point did not answer &#8212; questions in her 1993 hearing. But then there were some, like Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK), who actually sounded like he wants detailed answers on abortion from his pro-life perch just as badly as Democrats may want insights from the pro-choice side. Republican Senators also made clear that Alito should not be held to some higher standard because he is replacing centrist swing-vote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.<br /><br />Democratic Senators raised a range of different issues and standards. Some made it seem that Alito bears a special burden for confirmation because of the nomination and then withdrawal of Harriet Miers, the White House counsel whose appointment was thwarted by conservative groups. The critics of Miers, said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), "demand judges who will guarantee the results that they want. And that's why the questions will be asked so specifically of you, Judge." Other Democrats, like Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA), questioned Alito's credibility and said he had a tough road to satisfy the concerns of liberals. Still other Senators made it clear that they will use the hearings to raise questions about the broad assertions of presidential power by President Bush in wiretapping citizens without court approval. Democrats asserted that Alito must talk about a broad range of legal issues because he has written what Specter described as 361 opinions and voted in 4800 cases as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit for 15 years. And not surprisingly, Democrats said the nomination to replace O'Connor creates an extra burden for Alito because he may shift the balance on the Court on a number of important issues.<br /><br />All of these different and seemingly conflicting standards and subjects for inquiry may become much clearer as the questioning gets underway today and continues tomorrow. The parallel process outside the hearing room is much harder to track; the spinning, polling and strategizing do not take place under the magnification of the television cameras. But to really understand the Alito confirmation process, it is important to remember that there may be critical activity both within and outside the hearing room.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Stephen Wermiel is adjunct professor and Associate Director of the Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project at American University Washington College of Law.

There were two tense moments.  Interestingly, neither involved Alito himself, and both concerned his admitted membership in the organization Concerned Alumni of Princeton, a group known to focus its principal efforts on restricting the admission of women and minorities to Princeton University. <br /> <br /> Many commentators (including me in a <a href="/forumy/2005/12/blind-ambition-civil-rights-and.php">previous JURIST op-ed</a>) predicted that Alito's identification of his involvement in CAP in his 1985 job application for a promotion in the Reagan Administration was among the most troubling things in his record.  Combined with positions he'd taken in the Reagan Administration seeking to restrict both voluntary and court-imposed affirmative action remedies, his questioning of Warren Court decisions and his record on the bench of pretty consistently ruling against victims in race discrimination cases, Judge Alito's involvement in CAP required some explanation. <br /><br />By now we all know that Judge Alito's answers to the questions about CAP have been weak.  He's repeated over and over that he just doesn't remember why he joined the organization, nor does he remember ever attending a meeting of CAP.  He does remember his concern that Princeton had, when Alito was a student and a member of the ROTC, kicked the ROTC off campus.  The ROTC had been well restored to the campus by 1985, but Alito insists that the ROTC issue is the only one he can imagine could explain his involvement in CAP. <br /> <br />    Yesterday Sen. Edward Kennedy made it clear to Judge Alito that in Kennedy's view, the nominee's answers about CAP "just don't add up."   The Senator also read statements written by prominent members of CAP &#8212; statements expressing hideously racist and homophobic views.  Judge Alito strongly disavowed any endorsement of the statements written by the CAP members. Kennedy reminded Committee Chair Sen. Arlen Specter, that Kennedy had sent a request on December 22nd asking Specter to subpoena the CAP records now held in the Library of Congress.  Kennedy pressed Specter to move the Committee to Executive Session in order to vote on whether to issue the subpoena. Angry at Kennedy's tone and Kennedy's threat to hold up the Committee proceedings until he received a ruling on the subpoena request, Specter sharply rebuked Kennedy.  Specter insisted that he had never received Kennedy's letter, and scolded:  "the fact that you sent it doesn't mean I received it."  <br /><br />Huh?  It was an amazing moment for the rest of us out here in America who live at the mercy of the postal service.  We just assumed that mail traveling in the same building of a branch of our government that has its own post office would make it to its destination in two weeks.  But apparently not.  To be honest, I first heard about Kennedy's letter to Specter seeking the subpoena a couple of weeks ago from a <em>Washington Post</em> article, so it was kind of an alarming moment when Specter insisted that today was the first time he'd heard about the subpoena request for CAP documents.   In any case, Specter dressed down Sen. Kennedy, announcing, "I'm the Chairman, and I'm not gonna let you run this Committee."  Specter agreed to consider Kennedy's request, but made it clear that he thought that Kennedy was out of line.  Kennedy seemed suddenly mollified, and the hearing proceeded.<br /><br />About an hour later, a somewhat mollified Specter announced that the records were being made available (no subpoena needed).  Turns out that Specter's office had received the letter, but it hadn't been noted in the Committee's mail log book &#8212; or something like that.  But Sen. Specter insisted that Sen. Kennedy should have mentioned the subpoena request to Specter directly, perhaps during the Senators' workouts in the Senate gym.  Kennedy confessed dryly that he hadn't visited the gym since before Christmas.  Too much information, fellas.  In any case, even as we speak, Sen. Kennedy's staffers are wading through CAP documents looking for information about when Alito joined the organization, and whether he was more involved than the nominee now recalls.<br /><br /> Questions about CAP created the other highly dramatic moment of the day.  Under friendly and rhetorical questioning by South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham, Judge Alito insisted that he was not a bigot.  Overcome by Judge Alito's impassioned response to what I'm sure she regarded as an accumulation of attacks on her husband, Mrs. Alito - Martha-Ann Bomgardner - was suddenly overcome by tears and left the hearing room.  She returned later, composed.  [Good grief!  Imagine how Virginia Lamp (Clarence Thomas' wife) felt at the hearings regarding Anita Hill!  I don't remember Lamp getting the vapors and fleeing the hearing room!]  To be fair, it was a long day.  By the end, Judge Alito himself sounded shaky, with exhaustion and exasperation, when New York Sen. Charles Schumer grilled him again about CAP, and tried to pin the nominee down on why he wouldn't concede that <em>Roe v. Wade</em> is "settled law."  <br /><br />Schumer's questioning in regard to the latter was pretty skillful.  Judge Alito had over the course of the day conceded that the principle of one-person, one vote of <em>Reynolds v. Sims</em>, of marital privacy in <em>Griswold v. Connecticut</em>, of Congress' power under the commerce clause in a series of cases, are "settled law."  Sen. Schumer asked why Judge Alito wouldn't use those same words for the Roe case.  Alito answered that he didn't want to say the same about Roe, because it presents an issue that may come before him on the Court.  Schumer was clearly unconvinced, but Judge Alito successfully carved out a rationale for why he responded to questions about different cases differently.<br /><br /> Wednesday was originally intended to be the last day that the nominee would be in the hot seat, but there will be another round Thursday.  At least some Democrats want to ask more questions.  No doubt, Republicans will want to do the same.  And depending on what the CAP documents reveal, today could provide some additional drama, and more importantly some more satisfactory answers as to why Judge Alito joined that offensive organization and proudly identified himself as a member in 1985.    <br />  <br /><em>Sherrilyn Ifill is a civil rights lawyer and law professor at the University of Maryland School of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.richmond.edu/faculty/tobias.htm">Carl Tobias</a> of the University of Richmond School of Law says that recent national security issues involving controversial exercises of executive power should encourage senators to carefully analyze Judge Samuel Alito's perspectives on executive authority, security and liberty in his upcoming confirmation hearings...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/carltobias.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>R</strong></font>ecent actions that overemphasize executive power and national security at the expense of legislative and judicial power and of civil liberties could substantially affect the Supreme Court confirmation process for Third Circuit Judge Samuel Alito.  One development is the mid-December revelation that President George W. Bush has invoked unilateral executive authority to conduct domestic surveillance since September 11, 2001.  Another is the Supreme Court's early November decision to review <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>.  In <em>Hamdan</em>, a D.C. Circuit panel, on which then-Judge John Roberts sat, overturned a district judge's ruling that discontinued a military tribunal trial in essence because the president lacked power to create the tribunal.  A third is the December 21 Fourth Circuit rebuke of the government for detaining Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen, over three years by designating him an "enemy combatant" and then indicting Padilla apparently to evade High Court review, an issue which the Justices will consider in mid-January.  Those developments mean that senators must carefully analyze Judge Alito's perspectives on executive authority, security and liberty when exercising advice and consent.<br /><br /> First, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has vigorously litigated Hamdan and Padilla and additional cases that involve enemy combatants, which are, or will soon be, on appeal to the Supreme Court, while defense counsel in past, present and future "war on terror" prosecutions may well challenge domestic surveillance of their clients.  In all the suits, DOJ argues for expansive views of executive power that overstate national security vis-&Atilde;&nbsp;-vis civil liberty.  The Justices, therefore, will face the government's controversial assertion of executive authority and how to balance security and liberty when they decide Hamdan and should the Court accept Padilla and any other appeals. <br /> <br /> Second, these considerations might elevate the stakes in Judge Alito's confirmation process, partly because Chief Justice Roberts will recuse himself from the <em>Hamdan</em> case.  For example, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who resigned on July 1, wrote the plurality opinion in <em>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</em>, which mandated that the government accord persons whom it denominates enemy combatants due process to challenge the designations.  Thus, Judge Alito's perspectives on the Hamdan and Padilla cases may give him the swing vote.<br /><br />Third, should Alito join with four other Justices and adopt the government views, this High Court resolution could sharply limit detainees' ability to contest imprisonment and any charges filed against them before military tribunals.  The Justices would do so mainly by restricting the procedural opportunities which detainees have to demonstrate that they were improperly labeled enemy combatants or incorrectly charged in tribunals.  The Court may even leave the habeas petitioners incarcerated until the ongoing conflict terminates.<br /><br />When Senate members assess Judge Alito's qualifications, they should remember certain ideas.  Some observers contend that his nomination accentuates their concerns about how the Justices will calibrate the delicate balances, which involve separated powers among the three federal branches as well as between national security and civil liberty.  They suggest that Alito, perhaps more than the new Chief Justice, both of whom worked for years in the executive branch, will be overly deferential to executive prerogatives and national security.  For instance, as a Justice Department lawyer, the nominee appeared rather solicitous of the Executive by contending that the Attorney General should enjoy immunity from suit for illegally wiretapping citizens.  Alito correspondingly sought to increase presidential authority when he recommended that the chief executive issue "signing statements" which explain legislation's meaning at the time the president signs it.  A striking, recent example is the December 30 "President's Statement on Signing of H.R. 2863."  This document instructs that the "executive branch shall construe section 1005 (governing detainee treatment) to preclude the Federal courts from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over any existing or future [habeas corpus] action," a presidential interpretation which directly contravenes Congress's intent.<br /><br />As the confirmation hearing for Judge Samuel Alito begins, senators must keep in mind the president's unilateral assertion of power to order domestic wiretaps, as well as the significant <em>Hamdan</em> and <em>Padilla</em> appeals and other important lower court decisions, which relate to executive authority, national security and civil liberty.  These cases will come before the Supreme Court this year and in future Terms, and the appeals should lead Senate members to scrutinize the jurist's perspectives on constitutional precedent, executive power, and the tension between security and liberty when they evaluate the nominee.     <br /><br /><em>Carl Tobias is the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.bancroftassociates.net/prof_wkeefer.htm">Wendy J. Keefer</a>, former senior counsel and chief of staff in the US Department of Justice Office of Legal Policy and now with Bancroft Associates in Washington DC, says that in keeping with their constitutional role of giving advice and consent, senators at the confirmation hearings for Judge Samuel Alito should resist the temptation to ask the President&#39;s nominee about his personal policy preferences, and should instead question him about the proper role of the judiciary and the proper method for evaluating cases...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wendykeefer.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n the eve of confirmation hearings on the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court, some Senators have said that they intend to question Judge Alito on, among other things, whether he would permit warrantless wiretapping like that recently revealed to be conducted by the NSA.  I am disappointed, but not surprised.  <br /><br />The announced line of questioning would be inappropriate.  But such questioning will not be the only inappropriate area of inquiry.  A careful observer of the upcoming proceedings will likely be able to identify numerous other instances during which Senators attempt improperly to gain the nominee's commitment to policy positions.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Senate all too often elevates its constitutional advice and consent role to one superior to the President's constitutional authority to nominate the individual of his choice.  Statements announcing the intent to question Judge Alito on the executive branch's authority to conduct warrantless wiretaps prove that this confirmation proceeding will be no different.  And it is the nominee who is caught in the middle.  The nominee, for his own sake, is left to determine what questions must be answered in order to be confirmed, and which questions are properly refused because they may later call into question objectivity when deciding future court cases.<br /><br />Confirmation hearings have become tests for the Senators to decide not whether a nominee is qualified for the position, but rather whether the Senator agrees with the personal policy positions of the nominee.  This is not the advice and consent provided for in the Constitution.  It is a usurpation of the President's primary authority to nominate, and a threat to the independence of our judiciary.  It is time to remind ourselves what the proper role of the Senate is in this process.  <br /><br />The Constitution places the appointment power primarily with the President.  No doubt the Senate plays a role as well, but that role was intended to be limited.  When the Senate reaches beyond its limited role in this process, the independence of the judiciary is sacrificed.  Thus, it falls too often on the nominee himself, during the confirmation process, to salvage that independence.<br /><br />Judicial independence is a crucial aspect of our legal system.  In part, the lifetime tenure of judges creates this environment of independence.  But when either of the other branches requires a nominee to commit to a certain position on a selected issue, an implicit promise or guarantee is created as to how the nominee will decide cases involving that issue, and the judge's independence is compromised.  Whether the nominee is asked his opinion on the legality of NSA surveillance activities or whether <em>Roe v. Wade</em> was properly decided, his answers will forever taint cases involving those issues that come before him.  He is no longer an unbiased arbiter of those issues; he has already committed to one side or the other.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Senate has been unable to control its desire to know the personal opinions and beliefs of nominees.  Those watching the confirmation hearings should pay careful attention to how often this desire enters this process and be aware of the dangers created.  Listen to the types of questions asked and ask yourself if it is worth the consequences for us to continue to tolerate this interference with the independence of the judiciary.<br /><br />Ask yourself whether you want judges for whom their personal opinions are an accepted factor in their judicial decision-making.  Do we want judges driven by their personal opinions or driven by the law?  It seems unlikely that many would readily admit it is desirable to have judges who decide cases on factors outside the law, arbitrary factors over which the people would have no control once the judge is appointed. <br /><br />Instead, what is claimed to justify inquiry into personal beliefs is that all judges are unable to separate these beliefs from their judicial decisions.  I refuse to believe this is the case.  If it is, we are not truly a democracy governed by laws enacted by those elected by the people.  Instead, we are a society governed by judges.  <br /><br />No doubt exists that there are judges who permit their personal opinions to impact their decisions, but so too are there judges who are driven by the dictates of the law and not by the outcome of a particular case or personal opinion.  Cases can certainly be identified in which judges have overstepped their constitutional role as neutral arbiters and imposed their own policy choices above the choices of the people and their elected officials.  But such judicial action is not desirable and the way to prevent it is not through an investigation of a nominee's personal beliefs, but by evaluating his approach to the business of judging.<br /><br />Questioning on specific issues is not necessary to evaluate a nominee.  And the nominee should not be forced into compromising his own objectivity and independence by answering such questions.   Instead, confirmation proceedings should focus on the process by which the nominee will make decisions, not the likely result of any decision.<br /><br />We all want to know what to expect from a Justice Alito.  But that knowledge is gained not through inquiry into issues, which absent the context of a particular case and its unique facts has little meaning, but through explanation of the nominee's legal qualifications and judicial philosophy.  <br /><br />It is a shame that what we will likely see during the Alito proceedings will not be questions on the proper role of the judiciary or the proper method for evaluating cases.  Instead, we will watch a constant game of cat and mouse in which Senators seek a commitment from Judge Alito on specific issues and seek to uncover his personal opinions about very controversial topics, while the nominee attempts politely to avoid answering those questions that if answered will merely serve to jeopardize his position as an unbiased judicial officer.<br /><br />President Bush has made it clear that it is superior legal qualifications and a proper view on the role of the judiciary, not a commitment to particular policies, that guide his nomination decisions.  The Senate should be similarly guided as they prepare for these confirmation hearings.  And we, as observers and constituents, should ensure that our elected officials honor the constitutional balance of powers and do not taint the independence of our judiciary.  <br /><br />What kind of judge is Samuel Alito?  His numerous years on the appellate courts prove that he is one driven by the law and not by his own policy preferences. That is good enough for me and it should be good enough for the Senate.<br />   <br /><br /><em>Wendy J. Keefer is a lawyer with Bancroft Associates in Washington DC.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that the memory and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) calls us from complacency and careerism to act against injustice and help the poor and the oppressed, both in this country and abroad...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavis.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font> thank JURIST for this opportunity to write on Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday. To remind me of the man, I watched vintage footage of MLK giving a <em>Meet the Press</em> interview on August 17, 1967.  Once again, I felt his commitment to social and economic justice for the poor and the negro &#8212; the &quot;bootless&quot; as he called them - who were asked even then to pick themselves up by their bootstraps.  I felt his commitment to and solidarity with the poor and the negro.<br /><br />I also remember a photo my father, Griffith J. Davis, took of MLK in Ghana at the first inauguration after independence of Kwame Nkrumah in 1957.  My father had known MLK since their days together at Morehouse College.  MLK had been invited by Nkrumah with the hope that a meeting would happen between MLK and then-Vice President Nixon.  That meeting did happen at a cocktail party, and in the wake of the Montgomery Bus Boycott Nixon invited King to Washington, D.C.  No picture of the meeting was never published in a stateside newspaper, but it exists.  MLK should be remembered not only as an actor on the domestic stage but as a prophet on the international plane even in the 1950's, preaching for social and economic justice.<br /><br />After listening to MLK&#39;s words and remembering his emphasis on direct action, I feel a call from him.  It is a call to direct action &#8212; to say what I sense and hope speaks a truth to others and encourage their direct action.<br /><br />First, for the law professors, MLK asks me to introduce the "my forefather was owned by a Founder" objection to originalism.  &quot;Barbary&quot;, born free in Africa in 1787 and sold into slavery in North Carolina in 1800, was owned by the Harrison family, source of one signer of the Declaration of Independence and two Presidents of the United States.  Knowing of Barbary gives me a personal reason to have skepticism about the &quot;timeless wisdom&quot; of those who enslaved her or compromised with those who enslaved her.  I invite an originalist to respond to that objection.<br /><br />Second, I look to the images we all saw of Hurricane Katrina.  They broke open a very old wound &#8212; a wound that MLK attempted to heal through his direct action.  I remember feeling that wound and having a hard time expressing what it was.  I then realized that the wound was a memory &#8212; a memory in the collective black unconscious of the slave block.  The powerlessness of the people &#8212; poor old and mostly black -  in such desperate straits reminded me of the powerlessness of the slave.  And the overseers &#8212; whether black or white - really did not care enough about them to save them (and by that save themselves).<br /><br />Third, I look at the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for now-Chief Justice John Roberts and Judge Samuel Alito.  I look at their resumes and see that when they were 30-35 they spent their time as young Reagan Administration lawyers arguing for restriction of affirmative action for minorities and women.  I think of them on the Supreme Court and I remember what my mother said to me, "When Thurgood Marshall was on the Supreme Court, I slept well at night."  <br /><br />I think of Thurgood Marshall at the same age - in his 30's and 40's - and I am called back to a picture my father took (now on the home page of <a href="http://www.griffdavis.com/">www.griffdavis.com</a>) in a courtroom in Norman, Oklahoma in the late 1940's.  Marshall was representing Ada Sipuel against the University of Oklahoma as she sought to live her dream of going to that law school.  At the same point in life when John Roberts and Samuel Alito were plotting strategies to keep women and minorities down, Thurgood Marshall was plotting strategies to lift women and minorities up.  And MLK makes me say that it is simply unacceptable to have an Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary that is structured to keep women and minorities down.  I remember President Lyndon Johnson's "We shall overcome" in the mid'60's and contrast that with President Bush' attack on affirmative action announced on MLK's 2003 birthday. I slept better with one Texan then rather than with the other now.  I do not sleep well at night.<br /><br />Fourth, I look at the way MLK's words are used by elitists to keep the disadvantaged out, rather than to bring them in.  Elitists focus on MLK's non-discrimination legacy but not on his direct action for integration legacy.  Day after day as I look around the United States I have this creeping feeling of a window closing &#8212; of more things having fewer blacks present, of a reversion to a kind of elitist tokenism, of an abandonment by too many of the kind of direct action social justice mission that is America at its best.  It permeates this society in a sickening fashion.  And MLK asks me to say that it is time to make the last first.<br /><br />Fifth, as I see women and minorities climb to the top in the professions, the corporate world, government and academia, acting both domestically and internationally, I ask myself whether MLK would be satisfied with where they are or concerned about what they do.  MLK's social justice legacy never seemed to be solely about getting ahead but also about doing what was right.  Diversity without a conscience smacks of a kind of opportunism &#8212; MLK asked for more than opportunism from those privileged enough to get through the door.  <br /><br />But maybe we are in a period when conscience is outmoded.  Witnesses the rationalizations &#8212; too frequently offered by some minorities and women in the professions, the corporate world, government and academia - for torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment, for warrantless eavesdropping, for wars that appear to have been more of choice than necessity.  If one wants to advance, one merely needs to support these efforts without conscience.  But MLK did not support equal rights so that black people could torture fellow human beings.  He did not support equal rights so that women could humiliate people of other cultures in dank detention centers in far away places.  And MLK reminds me of the need to respect human dignity:  to keep our honor clean, even in war.  And he calls on me to shun and seek to prosecute those who do not respect human dignity.<br /><br />Lastly, I look at my children and fear for the world they will have.  We will be in Iraq for the next 25 years in some way shape or form.  We will be in Afghanistan for the next 25 years in some way shape or form.  Where America once stood as a beacon for the rule of law, it appears to be willing now to resort to legal euphemism to return to the law of the jungle.  At home, we have come to a place where we cut the poor rather than those who have more.  And as what goes around will come around, I fear for the future of my children.  And MLK tells me to take action now to fight for their future.<br /><br />This is what I think MLK would want me to say.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to JURIST&#39;s <em>Hotline</em>, where you can publish your insights on legal news as it happens.<br /><br />We&#39;ve designed this service to do two things: <ol><li>to give lawyers, law professors, policy experts, and people caught up in legal events a platform where they can quickly and easily share legal news views with others without having to maintain their own weblogs or websites;<br /><br /><li>to provide JURIST&#39;s readers with expert legal commentary that might complement and even match the pace of our continuous <a href="/paperchase/">Paper Chase</a> legal news coverage</ol>Scholars who have their own blogs are welcome here too. We hope that <em>Hotline</em> can help those of you already blogging to bring some of your original perspectives on legal news to the attention of a new audience.<br /><br />If you have comments on a legal news development, just e-mail <a href="mailto:JURIST@law.pitt.edu">JURIST@law.pitt.edu</a> for passwords to this blog and you&#39;ll be online in minutes. You can say your piece and be on your way. Frame your remarks so that they can stand alone as independent contributions that can be easily understood and referenced later.<br /><br />The idea here is succinct analysis rather than continuous discussion - two or three off-the-cuff paragraphs, perhaps, that summarize your thinking or reaction for busy professionals. If some readers (or other contributors) want to discuss what you say, they can leave comments on your post, and of course you&#39;re welcome to comment on those comments or on other posts (by leaving comments on those) at any time. Otherwise we hope you&#39;ll keep your passwords and sign in again next time you have a few minutes and a perspective you&#39;d like to share. <br /><br />Publishing your insights on legal news on JURIST is a simple and efficient way to enhance the visibility of your ideas and your law school while contributing to public discourse and education. Tie the latest legal news development into an article or book you&#39;re writing or have just published (and cite it!). Pen a couple of paragraphs as a trial balloon for a talk, paper or a more formal op-ed down the line. Or use a local event, lecture or speech to lead into an analysis of a current issue making legal headlines. Be relevant, but be creative. <br /><br />And don&#39;t be shy. This is an open forum and a big tent - entire law school faculties can come in to show their stuff. If the University of Chicago law faculty by itself can power an <a href="http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/">excellent blog</a>, consider what we might do together.<br /><br />All <em>Hotline</em> posts will be clearly credited by the contributor&#39;s name and institution, and will be carried as they come in not only here, but on JURIST&#39;s heavily-trafficked <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu">front page</a>. Once we&#39;ve reached a critical mass they&#39;ll also be archived by category here and on our 100+ <a href="/currentawareness/">legal news topics</a> pages, where we hope they&#39;ll complement other permanent JURIST research resources like our <a href="/paperchase/indexarch.php">legal news archives</a>, legal <a href="/gazette/">documents</a> and <a href="/monitor/">video</a> collections, and our popular full-length <em>Forum</em> <a href="/forum/">op-eds</a>. What you contribute will be accessible there in context. <br /><br />One last reminder... <em>Hotline</em> is a serious legal news blog on a serious legal news website. Please stay on topic. Please be courteous and avoid vituperation. JURIST reserves the right to decline, edit or remove submissions.<br /><br />And now it&#39;s all yours. <a href="mailto:JURIST@law.pitt.edu">E-mail</a> JURIST for passwords and have your say on the latest legal news now.<br />

		<title>The judicial capacity to try Saddam</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26"><strong>Michael J. Kelly</strong></a> [Creighton University School of Law]: &quot;Each new session of the Iraqi High Criminal Court, convened last year to try Saddam Hussein and his henchmen for the massacre of over a hundred Shi&#39;a at Dujail in 1982, brings with it further evidence that the tribunal may simply not have the capacity to bring off a successful prosecution.  Saddam&#39;s courtroom antics, have thrown the court into disarray - insulting judges, defiantly proclaiming the court&#39;s illegitimacy, refusing to cooperate procedurally, walking out of the courtroom, boycotting trial sessions, and speaking over the heads of judges to score political points with Iraqis.<br /><br />   These are not new issues for those attempting to bring former despots to justice.  Indeed Slobodan Milosevic has engaged in such drama on a regular basis over the course of his four-year trial in The Hague before the war crimes tribunal there, and Hermann Goering, the former Nazi second-in-command, famously got the better of his prosecutors at Nuremberg on occassion.  But those tribunals were staffed with rather sophisticated international lawyers.  The Iraqi tribunal is staffed with well-meaning, but lower level judges who survived the de-Ba&#39;athification process during the U.S. occupation.  Their capacity to understand the intricacies of concepts like war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide were always in question - despite rigorous training by well-qualified experts in the field like Michael Scharf (Case Western) and assistance from international legal experts.  Now their capacity to control cagey defendants and move the trial along smoothly is equally in question.<br /><br />   Chief judge Amin resigned this month in direct response to criticism both from the public, press and Iraqi government over the chaotic situation in the courtroom and his inability to bring it under control.  Even the appointment of Amin&#39;s successor was bungled, initially going to judge al-Hammash - until his Ba&#39;athist connections became known, and then finally going to judge Abdel-Rhaman, a Kurd.  The court&#39;s inability to function has, unfortunately, played out in a public way, thereby undermining its legitimacy even further in the eyes of Iraqis and the international community.  One wonders if it can possibly recover.  Perhaps an international tribunal for Saddam and his gang would have been a better option?&quot;<TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><TR><td><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><TR><TD><COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><IMG src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&nbsp;News: <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/breaking-news-saddam-lawyers-to.php">Saddam, lawyers to boycott next trial session</a><br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD BGCOLOR=WHITE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><br />

		<title>Using nuclear weapons against Iran?</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/fulltime/damato/damato.html">Anthony D&#39;Amato</a> [Northwestern U. School of Law]: &quot;Today, February 4, 2006, Senator John McCain speaking in Munich said that military action against Iran must remain an option if it did not bow to international demands to halt its nuclear activities.  This is a major foreign policy statement, but why a person not in the Executive Branch was chosen to state it is anyone&#39;s guess.  In any event, what kind of &quot;military action against Iran&quot; would it be?  For the following reasons, it can only be an action involving the use of, nuclear weapons.  <br /><br />     A combined US-Israel strike against Iran would have to employ tactical nuclear weapons, and there were signs a month or two ago that the United States was gearing up its military specialists for just such an option.  As you will recall, the advance rhetoric was very hot: Iran was obtaining nuclear weapons technology, it broke the seals on yellowcake containers that had been sealed by the UN Inspection Team, it threatened to open a bourse for buying and selling oil in euros, and it announced that Israel should be wiped off the map. Unlike the case with Saddam in Iraq in 2003, Iran in 2006 has numerous long-range ballistic missiles positioned to fire at Israel, France, Germany, and American ships in the Persian Gulf, even after absorbing a surprise military attack.  Its missiles are mobile, usually mounted on trucks.  It would be impossible to take them out with conventional weapons.  The only way to disable amd destroy them would be by issing above-ground &quot;tactical&quot; nuclear weapons, which can of course reach a wide area and destroy everything in it, especially the electronics used in launching missiles.<br /><br />     The tense situation was considerably de-fused in January when President Putin offered to process Iran&#39;s nuclear enrichment program in Russia.  Iran did not refuse, commenting that the Russian plan was constructive.  The United States was apparently taken by surprise, but President Bush also praised Russia&#39;s plan.  <br /><br />     Although Russia seems to be increasing its ties with Iran, it is hard to imagine that Putin would be indifferent to Iran&#39;s becoming a nuclear power.  In fact, there are signs now that Russia and China may be re-prioritizing their foreign policy to place nuclear nonproliferation at the top of the list.  A nuclear strike against Iran would have a huge exemplary effect upon North Korea and all future would-be nuclear powers.  <br /><br />     I hope I&#39;m right in thinking that nonproliferation is number one on the foreign policy list of China and Russia.  I fear that it is only number two on America&#39;s list.  Our first priority, reading between the lines, is to safeguard the dollar as the world&#39;s reserve currency.  If so, our principal goal would be to stop Iran from opening its petro-euro bourse.  The bourse is scheduled to start business on March 31, 2006. Russia would like the bourse open so as to present a grave, maybe fatal, challenge to the US dollar.  China tends to side with the petro-euro plan, but China does not appear to be particularly sophisticated in its foreign financial policy. However the United States, with its massive foreign debt, is horrified at prospect of the euro replacing the dollar.<br /><br />     A military strike against Iran would involve the use of tactical nuclear weapons in the sparsely populated areas where the mobile missiles are located.  As for command-and-control, the military strike undoubtedly involves precision bombing of government and military headquarters.  I would predict a strike against the new bourse, perhaps on the theory that it might contain an underground military control center.  <br /><br />     Nuclear weapons have not been used in warfare since 1945, and again it may be the United States that first uses them.&quot;   <br />     <br />Anthony D&#39;Amato<br />Leighton Professor of Law<TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><TR><td><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><TR><TD><COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><IMG src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&nbsp;News: <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/iran-calls-iaea-referral-to-security.php">Iran calls IAEA referral to Security Council &#39;unlawful&#39;</a><br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD BGCOLOR=WHITE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.fcsl.edu/faculty/bio2.cfm?instructID=1039"><strong>Brian J. Foley</strong></a> [Florida Coastal School of Law]: &quot;In response to the revelations about presidential spying, several Administration officials, including President Bush and Attorney General Gonzales, have argued that the electronic surveillance program -- which appears to exceed the limits allowed by current law -- is &quot;necessary&quot; to prevent another terrorist attack.  They also say, as Vice President Cheney <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/cheney-says-domestic-surveillance.php">did last month</a>, that 9/11 itself might have been prevented if the government had been able to conduct this sort of surveillance.  &quot;If we&#39;d been able to do this before 9/11, we might have been able to pick up on two of the hijackers who flew a jet into the Pentagon,&quot; he said.<br /> <br />  Perhaps.  But the administration&#39;s response elides an important point: other, more direct, and less-burdensome-on-our-freedom methods could have prevented 9/11, too &#8212; and probably far more easily.<br />  <br />That this elision often goes unchallenged most likely results from a prevailing myth about 9/11, one that many of our leaders foster: that it was, at the time, inconceivable and unstoppable. That the mayhem of that day just happened, out of the clear blue sky, a total surprise that we could not have foreseen and therefore could not have prevented.<br /><br />Yet 9/11 was conceivable, well beforehand. In 1994 an Air France flight was hijacked; French authorities determined shortly afterward that the hijackers&#39; goal was to crash the airliner into the Eiffel Tower. There were also well-known fears in July, 2001 that planes would be hijacked and rammed into the G-8 summit in Italy. The Italian government set up anti-aircraft defenses, and President Bush reportedly slept on an aircraft carrier. <br /><br />9/11 was stoppable. Our government was warned about hijackings in the summer of 2001.  Why didn&#39;t it require airlines to lock cockpit doors?  (Terrorists still might have been able to blow up the plane or stab or shoot all the passengers, but they would not have been able to take control of the plane and fly it into a casualty-rich target.)  Why didn&#39;t the government provide air marshals, or require stepped-up weapons screening? And why, when the actual hijackings happened on 9/11, didn&#39;t the government scramble fighter planes pursuant to normal FAA and NORAD procedures?  The skies above the Pentagon remained undefended more than 30 minutes after the second plane hit the World Trade Center.<br /> <br />No spy program like the secret one the president created after 9/11 was required for our government to get these warnings, or to take these basic precautions.<br /><br />In response to 9/11, our government has chosen to wage wars (which have cost billions of dollars, killed thousands of innocent people, and arguably increase our chance of being attacked at home) and imposed widespread electronic eavesdropping, instead of less costly, less burdensome, more effective, measures.  We constantly hear from high levels that the country is not prepared for another terror attack. Targets, such as chemical plants, reportedly remain vulnerable. Our ability to respond to disaster, which can limit casualties, appears virtually nonexistent &#8212; as the local, state and federal &quot;response&quot; to Hurricane Katrina revealed.<br /><br />The reasonable response to the government&#39;s spy program, and officials&#39; claims that it is &quot;necessary&quot; after 9/11, is not that we should give the president such increased power. The reasonable response should be, &quot;Try harder.&quot;  We should tell our public servants to go back to the drawing board and look at other options legally available to them, and implement those. If our leaders think that those options are inadequate, they should tell us why.  No: they should be forced to convince us why. My Inner Founding Father says the burden of proof is on the government.<br /><br />In short, we should hold the government accountable for its failure to take reasonable precautions to stop 9/11 (why has no one been fired?) before we give it uncheck-able powers, and naively trust it to use them legitimately and wisely.&quot;<TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><TR><td><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><TR><TD><COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><IMG src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&nbsp;News: <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/bush-no-doubt-nsa-domestic.php">Bush: &#39;no doubt&#39; NSA domestic surveillance program legal</a><br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD BGCOLOR=WHITE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26"><strong>Michael J. Kelly</strong></a> [Creighton University School of Law]: &quot;President Truman used American involvement in the Korean War as justification for seizing privately owned U.S. steel mills when a labor strike threatened to cripple that industry and bring production to a halt - thereby threatening the country&#39;s continued ability to wage war.  In short, the president used an external threat as an excuse for an internal power grab.  The Supreme Court stopped him in his tracks.  The Youngstown case still stands today for the proposition that the president cannot increase his power at home by fighting abroad.<br /><br />   But President Bush is trying to do just that.  By using the external threat of more attacks from foreign terrorists, he believes that he has found an excuse to support his illegal, unwarranted domestic surveillance program.  In Youngstown, the Court found that Congress&#39; consideration of a strike-busting mechanism during the Taft-Hartley debates, and their subsequent rejection of this method, prohibited the president from seizing the mills - as this was a taking of property, which only Congress could do.  In the domestic surveillance case, Congress likewise considered a method for undertaking spying activity (amounting to search and seizure); but here they actually adopted legislation - the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which embodied the method in a statutory framework.<br />  <br />   Obviously, the teaching of Youngstown is lost on President Bush, or, more likely, he is betting that a new Supreme Court would not dare limit this latest expansion of his power.  Perhaps he is right, now that Roberts and Alito have joined the Court. We know how the Youngstown Court would have ruled, but we&#39;re not sure yet about this one.&quot;<TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><TR><td><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><TR><TD><COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><IMG src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&nbsp;News: <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/gonzales-defends-nsa-surveillance.php">Gonzales defends NSA surveillance program, says criticism misplaced</a><br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD BGCOLOR=WHITE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/facultyhome.htm"><strong>Geoffrey Corn</strong></a> [South Texas College of Law]: &quot;The domestic surveillance debate took center stage on Meet the Press (Sunday, February 12th), as Senator Pat Roberts, former Senator Tom Daschle, and Representatives Peter Hoekstra and Jane Harman participated in a debate on the legality of this program (see <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3032608/">here</a>).  Senator Roberts, a strong proponent of the program, reiterated the President&#39;s position that the FISA did not apply to the program because the objective is the neutralization of a threat &quot;in time of war&quot;. Of course, Daschle and Harman challenged this assertion, with Harman citing Youngstown for the proposition that the President is operating in &quot;the lowest ebb&quot; of his power.<br /><br />What seems almost inexplicable is that neither Daschle or Harman, the two voices of opposition in the discussion, noted what seems to be the section of FISA dispositive to this debate - the section that addresses wartime authority.  According to Section 1811:<br /><br />&quot;Notwithstanding any other law, the President, through the Attorney General, may authorize electronic surveillance without a court order under this subchapter to acquire foreign intelligence information for a period not to exceed fifteen calendar days following a declaration of war by the Congress.&quot;<br /><br />This section of FISA clearly indicates that Congress contemplated the need for extraordinary surveillance authority during time of war.  It also clearly indicates that Congress rejected any blanket exception to the FISA warrant requirement during time of war, and instead provided for a limited presidential authority.  It seems implausible that Congress would have provided for a limited exception in response to a declared war - the most significant manifestation of &quot;time of war&quot; by our Nation - and yet contemplated an unlimited exception to the warrant requirement during conflicts authorized by less than a declaration of war - the position asserted by the President and his supporters.<br /><br />This section of FISA also seems to suggest that it is not only Youngstown, but also Dames &amp; Moore v. Regan that provides the controlling precedent to analyze the President&#39;s  assertion of authority.  Pursuant to that precedent, it is virtually impossible to conclude that Congress, by &quot;legislating around&quot; the issue of FISA applicability in time of war, has invited an assertion of independent Executive authority.  Instead, this section clearly indicates that Congress has &quot;occupied the field&quot;, and thereby limited the authority of the President to ignore the FISA warrant requirements, even in response to a wartime threat.<br /><br />Of course, as Senator Roberts noted, it is possible that requiring compliance with   FISA in time of war to collect information on enemy operations is an unconstitutional encroachment on Executive power.  But this is a very different theory than the oft asserted suggestion that the Authorization for the Use of military Force provided a blanket exception FISA&#39;s requirements.  By addressing applicability during periods of declared war, Congress seems to have occupied the time of war field, leaving the President to either comply with FISA, or assert that the statute impermissibly intrudes on his vested authority and stand alone in Justice Jackson&#39;s lowest tier of constitutional power.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.miami.edu/facadmin/faculty/svladeck.html"><strong>Steve Vladeck</strong></a> [University of Miami School of Law]: &quot;Is torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment (CIDT) within the scope of government employment? At least somewhat surprisingly, according to <a href="http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/files/rasul_ddc_opinion.pdf">this decision</a> by Judge Urbina in the D.C. district court issued yesterday, the answer to that question is &quot;yes.&quot;<br /><br />At issue in the suit, <em>Rasul v. Rumsfeld</em>, are damages claims brought by a group of Guantanamo detainees based on various allegations, including that the detainees were tortured while in custody by, or under the watch of, various government officials, including Secretary Rumsfeld. Judge Urbina held that the government officials were entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiffs&#39; constitutional claims. More controversially, he also ruled that the government officials were entitled to substitute the government itself as defendants to the plaintiffs&#39; international law-based claims, based on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00002679----000-.html">Westfall Act</a>, 28 U.S.C. [sec.] 2679(d), which allows such substitution for torts committed within the scope of employment. Needless to say, the government itself has sovereign immunity from such claims.<br /><br />A necessary part of holding that the Westfall Act applied, though, was the court&#39;s determination that the plaintiffs&#39; allegations -- of torture and other CIDT -- were scope-of-employment torts... Given that, as I explained earlier today <a href="http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2006/02/damages_and_git.html">over at PrawfsBlawg</a>, the Westfall Act&#39;s legislative history is clear that egregious conduct can <em><strong>never</strong></em> be within the scope of governmental employment, at least for purposes of Section 2679, the district court&#39;s decision is tantamount to holding that torture and other CIDT, when committed by government officials, is <strong><em>not</em></strong> &quot;egregious conduct.&quot; <br /><br />There is surely an important, albeit separate, debate as to whether that&#39;s true. But given how quietly the court reaches the issue -- without truly confronting the implications of its holding -- its breadth is surprising. For a federal court, in the current climate, to hold that torture and other CIDT is not egregious conduct, and therefore is within the scope of government officials&#39; employment, strikes me as, at the very least, a very significant and newsworthy holding.&quot;<br />

It's worse if he's a nice guy.  Nasty or degenerate opponents are much easier to understand, and more fun.<br />   <br />How could a decent person like Judge Samuel Alito &#8212; who lived through the civil rights years as a student, and whose Italian-immigrant family suffered discrimination &#8212; be so hostile to discrimination claims of minorities and women, and to the claim of exclusion of African American jurors in a criminal trial?  And how could he in the 1980s boast about his earlier membership in a group that lamented the bygone days of racial and gender exclusivity at Princeton? <br /> <br /> Sure, Alito is conservative, very conservative, but supporting segregation, and being proud of it in the '80s?  How could this be? <br /><br /> The answer, my friend, is in the '60s.<br /><br />Alito didn't reveal much of himself that's personal or political at his confirmation hearings, and the senators didn't push him to do so.  But his opening statement, where he addressed what he finds important in his own words, is revealing in ways that have largely gone unnoticed.<br /><br />Alito described his student days at Princeton in the '60s and early '70s as a formative period.  In that time, others of Alito's generation found America's century-old racial segregation unacceptable and worked, often at personal risk, for equality.  They also convinced a majority of Americans to oppose the Vietnam War.<br />  <br />But there's no mention in his opening statement of Alito's playing any role in &#8212; or having any sympathy for &#8212; the downfall of racial segregation, nor of his taking any actions or position on the war.<br />  <br />The period had a major impact on him for another reason: there was &quot;turmoil" he blames on "irresponsible" students, whom he pointedly contrasts to "the decency of the people back in my own community." <br />         <br />Alito characterized the period exclusively in terms of turmoil, and he was oddly selective about the types and sources of turmoil that matter to him.  He didn't mention the turmoil arising from the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy while he was a student, from legally enforced racial segregation, or from the loss of over 50,000 Americans in the Vietnam War. <br /> <br />And he blames the messenger, the demonstrator &#8212; in legal terms, the plaintiff &#8212; who challenges the powers that be or the status quo, even a status quo so fraught with undeniable injustice and suffering.<br /><br />There certainly was turmoil, and some student excesses.  But that's a strange and revealing way to describe a difficult period of long-overdue transition of our institutions and way of life to what we now commonly view as a better America.<br />  <br />Then there's the matter of that group started in the early 1970s, referred to in the hearings as CAP, standing for Concerned Alumni of Princeton.  CAP led to the only real fireworks in the hearings because the major concern of these alumni was their opposition to the admission of minorities and women to that formerly all-white and all-male university.  <br /><br />At Princeton and most universities, admission of minorities and women in more than token numbers had begun in only the previous decade &#8212; the '60s.  These basic changes we're now used to are very recent &#8212; discrimination against women as jurors was upheld by the Supreme Court as late as 1961. <br /> <br />CAP opposed these changes, for which it and opposition to it gained considerable media attention.  Bill Frist, now Republican Senate majority leader, was among prominent Princeton alums who publicly repudiated CAP.  <br /><br /> This might be dismissible as an ambiguous and distant blip from Alito's student past had he not boasted about his role in CAP on his application for a job in the Reagan Justice Department in 1985 &#8212; almost two decades later, when CAP was a notorious symbol for resistance to racial and gender equality.<br /><br /> At the hearings, Alito said he remembered liking CAP's position in favor of the military's ROTC program, but no further details, although if he demonstrated anything by his long testimony, it was a topnotch memory.  He offered no explanation for why he couldn't find a way to express himself about ROTC without joining a group that favored discrimination against minorities and women, or why he boasted about CAP later when ROTC was no longer an issue.  He did not express any regret that he had been part of CAP, nor did he repudiate, even now, CAP's offensive positions.<br />  <br /> All this can seem puzzling.  But Alito's self-described formative experiences and values sound mainstream only because the history of '60s has been effectively re-written as if there was no mainstream opposition to integration.<br />  <br />In the 1960s and early 1970s, while the Ku Klux Klan often got the biggest headlines, &quot;conservative&quot; meant and was mostly defined by opposition to the civil rights acts and integration.  It didn't describe every conservative, anymore than support for integration described every liberal.  But racial equality, and later gender equality and the Vietnam War, were the defining issues.<br /><br /> The leading conservative in the law in recent times, the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, wrote a memo in the 1950s as a law clerk to Justice Robert Jackson that opposed what would become <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, which integrated public schools.  In another memo, Rehnquist advocated approval of the all-white Democratic primary system in Texas.  The "separate but equal principle," Rehnquist wrote, was "right and should be reaffirmed."  And a young moderate Republican congressman from Texas named George H.W. Bush voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of race in public accommodations like restaurants and gas stations. <br />         <br />Democratic President Lyndon Johnson, who presided over passage of the civil rights acts, saw the price liberals and Democrats would pay for leading the nation to finally deal with its racism.  He predicted the rightwing shift and the "southern strategy" that now dominate elections and politics.  It was and still is about the '60s.<br /><br /> But how could the son of Italian immigrants who experienced discrimination be so hostile to the earliest moves toward equality and later, as a judge, to the legal claims of people who experience race or sex discrimination?  Alito&#39;s family, his upbringing, the experiences of his early years appear to be, as he also said in his opening statement, prominent in the development of his values.<br /><br />The reaction of people who, or whose ancestors, have experienced discrimination or oppression is not as obvious or predictable as we often assume.  Some people respond with an abiding understanding and sympathy for others who suffer the same fate.  Martin Luther King, Jr. comes to mind as such a person &#8212; his movement for equality and justice embraced all here and abroad who were oppressed, including the Vietnamese. <br /> <br />Others respond by placing the highest priority on gaining acceptance for themselves; by identifying with the established, the elite, those who do things &#8212; and embody &#8212; th
e traditional, right way; and by distancing themselves from the oppressed &#8212; particularly those who complain about it &#8212; and from anyone who challenges the powers that be.  <br /><br />This is not unusual.  It includes decent folks of my ethnicity and religion, whose families had suffered discrimination and genocide, but in the 1960s couldn't understand why anyone but African Americans would care about discrimination against African Americans.<br />  <br />A family's encounters with discrimination aren't necessarily forgotten by such a person, but they take on a new meaning.  The family overcame without singing about overcoming at demonstrations or bringing a lawsuit.  The significance of different contexts and specific obstacles faced by various minorities fades.  The family's experience comes to represent what Alito called "the opportunities that our country offers," and complaining about discrimination becomes the sour grapes of those who aren't deserving.  Victims of discrimination become its apologists.  Some of them will also be nice guys.  <br />   <br />But liberty and justice &#8212; and the Constitution itself &#8212; don't mean much if they don't apply to everyone.  It took two centuries, a civil war and a successful civil rights movement for us to recognize that simple principle. <br /> <br />Have we really swung that far in the other direction?  This nominee participated in a group like CAP and boasted about it decades later.  At the hearings, he offered no explanation, no regrets, no hint of a change of heart, no repudiation of CAP's offensive positions &#8212; and in his decisions as a judge favored, often alone in dissent, evidentiary and procedural obstacles to race and sex discrimination claims, and to claims of racial exclusion from juries, that make them near impossible to succeed.  Can a nominee to the Supreme Court with that record get by because he's smart, lawyerly, and seems like a nice guy?  The Senate should fully examine the issue of race and gender discrimination before voting on cloture or confirmation.   <br /><hr size=1><br />Also by David Kairys:<ul><li><a href="/forumy/2006/01/legal-technicalities-weighing-alito.php">Legal Technicalities: Weighing the Alito Nomination</a></ul><hr size=1><em>David Kairys, a law professor at Temple University who has litigated leading civil rights cases, is the editor of </em>The Politics of Law<em> (Basic Books 1998).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.brooklaw.edu/faculty/profile/?page=66">Susan Herman</a> of Brooklyn Law School says that reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act is up for debate again in Congress just as revelations about the NSA domestic surveillance program remind us why executive power needs to be kept in check...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/susanherman.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he acronym USA PATRIOT turns out to be an apt name for the anti-terrorism legislation passed in October 2001: the Act has become a crucible for intense debate about what it means to be a patriot &#8212; i.e., how to protect and defend the Constitution in a time of turmoil.<br />  <br />Critics of the Act initially focused on the question of whether the Patriot Act sacrificed constitutional protections of liberty and privacy.  In a 2001 JURIST <em>Forum</em> essay, I argued that the real problem with the Patriot Act was its impact on the checks and balances among the branches of the federal government (<a href="/forum/forumnew40.htm">The USA Patriot Act and the USA Department of Justice: Losing Our Balances?</a>, JURIST, Dec. 4, 2001).  In a number of ways, the Act increased executive authority at the expense of judicial second opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable.   As is so often the case, what may appear to be questions about rights are, at bottom, questions about constitutional structures and powers.  Who are the patriots who get to decide how we should be striking the balance between the liberty we expect and the security we desire?  Is it the President alone, Congress, or some combination of the three branches of the federal government, including the courts?<br /><br />By creating a bicameral legislature, the Constitution created two different legislative voices. The House of Representatives is elected frequently, mirroring state population, and is expected to be close to the people. The Senate is more stable, equally divided among the states no matter what their population, and expected to be more deliberative because of its insulation from popular opinion. During the sunset debates, the House, true to its stereotype, was wildly partisan and raucous. At the end of July, the House passed a bill called the USA PATRIOT and Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2005, which lifted the sunsets from almost all of the controversial provisions and provided for only small amendments of a few provisions (like modifying the gag order on the custodians of records far enough to allow those individuals to consult counsel or go to court to challenge a demand for records). Some of the changes proposed, like the limit on the so-called "sneak and peek" authority sponsored by Republican Butch Otter of Idaho and the bill to protect library records endorsed by Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont, had previously garnered the support of a majority of the House. During the sunset debates, the House leadership used every partisan procedural maneuver at its disposal to prevent amendments like these from reaching a vote on the floor. Votes on what did reach the floor split the House down the middle. (A motion to recommit the bill to committee to reconsider some of the sunset provisions, for example, lost by a vote of 209 to 218.) <br /><br />The Senate showed greater decorum, taking the high, bipartisan road. On the same day the House passed its divisive bill, the Senate Judiciary Committee hashed out a compromise bill that included some amendments &#8212; more than the House bill; fewer than critics would have preferred. In contrast to the House bill, the Senate bill was called the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005. Evidently recognizing that it was likely to split just as evenly and noisily as the House if they debated the bill, the full Senate then adopted the committee's bipartisan proposal by unanimous consent. As its title suggests, the bill provided for more amendments than the House bill, and a few longer sunsets. <br /><br />It was not until the end of November that a draft conference report reconciled the two bills, which differed only on a handful of provisions. The differences, like whether the so-called "library provision" should be amended to allow a court to consider whether there is a basis for requiring a custodian to turn over records instead of allowing the government officials seeking records to decide for themselves whether information obtained might be "relevant" to a terrorism investigation, were narrow but of some significance. It remains to be seen whether the Patriot Act will survive in a version closer to that proposed by the House or by the Senate. But it does seem clear that the Patriot Act will survive: the House and Senate each had decided to extend and make permanent the great bulk of the Patriot Act provisions. <br /><br />And then the <em>New York Times</em> broke the news that the administration had been helping itself to surveillance powers beyond anything contemplated by the Patriot Act. This revelation led to a series of peculiar instances of individual legislators wielding the powers of Congress. The President had quietly notified some selected legislators about his National Security Agency program, perhaps hoping to deflect criticism for ignoring legislation that limited his surveillance powers, even though these individual conversations could not function as congressional approval. After the program and this selective notification process were made public, individual legislators then explained their acquiescence or objections in interviews with the press instead of in the Congressional Record. California Democrat Nancy Pelosi said that she had written a letter objecting to the program, but could not share the letter with her constituents unless the administration whose actions she was criticizing declassified it.<br /><br />A minority group of Senators took the gloves off and filibustered to prevent the enactment of a Patriot Act renewal bill until further debate. Before the <em>New York Times</em> story, the President and Republican congressional leaders had opposed the idea of a three month extension of the Act to allow the reconciliation process to play out; on December 21, after the story, the Senate voted to extend the Patriot Act for six months to allow further debate. This arrangement was single handedly derailed by Representative James Sensenbrenner. (Evidently approval would have had to be unanimous in the House.) A counterproposal for a five week extension was single handedly approved by Senator John Warner, evidently the only Senator who had not yet taken off to celebrate the holidays.<br /><br />So Congress enters the New Year with questions about whether to amend or sunset Patriot Act provisions unresolved. But more members of Congress may now be resolved to play their constitutional function of checking the Executive Branch instead of simply writing it a blank check allowing government surveillance. The Executive Branch has amply demonstrated why some check is needed. The administration has used its Patriot Act powers to the hilt, employing over 30,000 National Security Letters (which demand records without any court order) and increasing the pace of applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. But even that was not enough. Whether the President also has inherent constitutional authority to conduct surveillance beyond what Congress has authorized is a question that will be debated in Congress and in the press. <br /><br />But where are the courts? If the subject of current debate is the extent of the President's inherent Article II authority, might it not be time for another judicial decision like the <em>Steel Seizure Case</em> or <em>United States v. United States District Court</em> identifying the boundaries of Article II? It is notable that so few of the Patriot Ac
t surveillance provisions have been the subject of litigation. This is because the targets of the information the government seeks to obtain do not know that they are targets, and the custodians who are asked for information are under a gag order prohibiting them from telling anyone. With all the secrecy surrounding the government's surveillance activities, those who would have standing to challenge government actions don't know it. The administration has resisted releasing even the most skeletal numerical information about how it has used its Patriot Act powers. The courts considering Freedom of Information Act claims brought by the ACLU and other groups have yielded mixed results, sometimes ordering the government to release some rudimentary information, and sometimes accepting the government's claim that even statistical information about surveillance should be exempt for national security reasons. It is difficult to think of anyone who would have standing to challenge the President's recently revealed surveillance program in court, unless and until the government decides to use information obtained as evidence in a criminal prosecution. In other words, decisions about whether the legality of the executive branch use of its powers will be litigated, like the use of those powers and the flow of information about the use of those powers, are within the control of the executive branch.<br /><br />This is a dangerous lack of balance. The President is determined to take any actions he deems necessary, in his own unilateral judgment, to protect us from terrorist attacks.  His oath, however, is to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution." Congress has been distressingly passive; the courts remarkably uninvolved. So we the people have to be the patriots. None of our constitutional structures can work in the absence of political accountability, which requires an informed and active constituency. The Patriot Act debates show that we can influence our representatives through our actions as well as our votes. Bill of Rights Defense Committee resolutions expressing concern about various aspects of the Patriot Act have been enacted by seven states and about 400 cities, towns and villages. The sections of the Patriot Act the public has found most troubling (albeit sometimes on the basis of misinformation), like the "sneak and peek" and "library" provisions, are the very provisions Congress has considered amending. If we want to preserve our Constitution, which contemplates an Executive Branch operating as one of three coequal branches, we have to follow through on those resolutions, insisting that Congress take a more active role in checking the executive branch, and that the courts be afforded a proper role in evaluating the balance of legislative and executive power. The decisions we confront are difficult and require the balance and wisdom of all three branches as well as the attention of an informed public.<br /><br />Instead of talking about recent legislation in which Congress is considering narrowing the role of the courts even further (the Graham-Levin amendment, which is a frightening and terrible mistake in my view), I will end on a more personal note. I have been writing about the Patriot Act in a rather lengthy law review article (&quot;The USA PATRIOT Act and the Submajoritarian Fourth Amendment&quot;) scheduled to appear in the <em>Harvard Civil Rights Civil Liberties Law Review</em> in January. My article was accepted in the spring, and thus had to be rewritten after the summer sunset debates, and then reedited after the November draft conference report, as the content of the Act was a moving target. Along with everyone else, I had expected that the Patriot Act legislation would be settled by the end of the year, whatever its content. Instead, my article is going to press before the legislative process is complete. This is frustrating and might even qualify as living an academic nightmare. But if all this legislative activity means that Congress is in the process of waking up, I am certainly enough of a patriot to be glad. <br />    <br /><br /><em>Susan Herman is Centennial Professor of Law at Brooklyn Law School and General Counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.wayne.edu/faculty/profiles/henning_peter.html">Peter Henning</a> of Wayne State University Law School says that while lawmakers in Washington are floating new ethics regulations in the wake of the Abramoff lobbying scandal, they might do better to apply existing laws and work on developing a political culture that puts the burden on elected representatives and their staffs to act ethically and to disclose their contacts with lobbyists...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/peterhenning.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>hen Jack Abramoff entered a guilty plea to federal conspiracy and mail fraud charges, he acknowledged committing serious crimes that involved gifts &#8212; including the now famous Scottish golfing trip &#8212; to &quot;Representative #1&quot; in exchange for the Congressman performing certain &quot;official acts&quot; to assist Abramoff's Indian tribal clients.  The government's filing also outlines the truly sleazy side of Abramoff, that he, along with partner and fellow felon Michael Scanlon, happily ripped off the tribes by taking secret kickbacks from companies he directed his clients to use.  Abramoff exploited the system through campaign contributions and the perquisites of the high life of Washington, D.C., to ingratiate himself with senior leaders on Capitol Hill, and he surely represents the worst type of lobbyist who cares little about policy and everything about personal gain.<br /><br /> As is typical whenever a scandal touches Congress, the first reaction is to point fingers at others and demand a new law to keep our elected officials pure.  Even before word of Abramoff's deal broke, Republicans introduced legislation that largely copies bills offered by Democrats to "reform" lobbying to prevent the next Jack Abramoff.  The "Special Interest Lobbying and Ethics Accountability Act of 2005&quot; would require enhanced disclosure of lobbying activities, curbs on gifts and travel paid for by private concerns, and extending from one to two years the ban on lobbying by former Members of Congress and their staff (and senior administration personnel to boot).  Republican leaders in the House and Senate have launched a trial balloon proposing a complete ban on all privately-funded travel in an effort to show the commitment to "reform," as if free travel is the heart of the problem.<br /><br /> These so-called reforms focus primarily on lobbyists, with only minor tweaking of the disclosure rules for our Representatives and Senators.  A free-travel ban might make it harder for lobbyists to reach a Congressman or Senator, but it is largely cosmetic and will have no real effect on the more important issue of access to elected officials and their staff.  Will any of these changes stop a determined lobbyist from seeking to corrupt an Congressman who is willing to accept gifts?  While greater transparency is hard to oppose, it is not clear that more paperwork or banning certain types of perquisites will alter the ways of our elected officials when lobbying is such an accepted part of the legislative system.  One would hardly expect Congress to develop legislation without input from those who have an interest in the topic, and lobbyists can be an important source of information.  One could imagine separating lobbying from election fundraising by prohibiting lobbyists from contributing to political campaigns as a condition of representing clients before Congress.  Such a proposal would require a much more radical reworking of the campaign finance system than currently contemplated, undermining the benefits of incumbency that makes such a change unlikely.  Short of that, the system is at risk for another Jack Abramoff, who would surely not have been deterred by even the modest disclosure requirements imposed by the legislative proposals. <br /><br /> Abramoff was caught committing crimes, and it is likely he will serve a substantial term of imprisonment.  Federal criminal laws clearly are sufficient to deal with corruption at all levels of government, and the anti-bribery provisions will be applied again to Congressmen and members of their staff who joined Abramoff's corrupt spree.  For a person bent on acting improperly, it is unlikely that a form requiring disclosure or a ban on free travel will be much of a barrier if criminal laws already on the books prohibiting bribery and lobbying within one year of leaving office were insufficient to stop Abramoff.<br /><br /> Indeed, are we so concerned about the lack of ethics of our elected representatives that we need a ban on all gifts for fear that the Republic will be sold out to the person with courtside seats for a Washington Wizards game? What is more important than enacting a new law regulating lobbyists or prohibiting free travel is the creation of a new culture in the Congress that puts the burden on our elected representatives and their staff to act ethically and to disclose their contacts with lobbyists.  Instead of pointing the finger at Jack Abramoff and his cohort while protecting themselves from their own willingness to use lobbyists for personal and political gain,  it would be better to ensure that Congressmen and Senators disclose who they accept gifts from and who they have solicited for campaign contributions.  To the extent that there is a need for transparency, it should begin with Congressional disclosure of the dates of any contacts with lobbyists so that the timing of those meetings can be available for all to see.  Campaign contributions can be manipulated by funneling them through friendly front-organizations, but the face-to-face meetings &#8212; in the office or on the golf course &#8212; are much more important for understanding the role of special interests. <br /><br /> Congress is like any business that deals with vendors and suppliers who try to gain favor with those who decide how to apportion the company's budget.  The Federal Sentencing Guidelines set forth criteria for determining whether an organization has an "effective program to prevent and detect violations of the law."  Perhaps Congress should consider doing as corporate America has done and adopt measures that give its members and employees benchmarks for what is acceptable behavior and a means of reporting wrongdoing without fear of retaliation that will trigger internal investigations untainted by politics.  For example, the Commentary in the Guidelines chapter on Sentencing of Organizations states that a company must "communicate effectively its standards and procedures to all employees and other agents" through required training programs, and it must utilize " monitoring and auditing systems reasonably designed to detect criminal conduct by its employees and other agents and by having in place and publicizing a reporting system."  Something as simple as an ethics hotline monitored by an independent office unaffiliated with either party would be helpful in making Congress responsible for policing itself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the so-called "ethics" process in Congress, particularly in the House of Representatives, has been hopelessly politicized.  Ethics complaints against members are designed for political gain rather than as part of an effective compliance program.  Perhaps it is time that Congress treated itself to the same rules as corporate America by taking measures to ensure that it acts properly in its dealings with outsiders who have an interest in its business.  Ethics is not a means to gain political advantage, and the culture inside Congress needs to be reformed before we turn to regulating the enablers.  Lobbyists are not solely to blame for the problems in Congress, so any reform must come from within rather than by adopting a new law.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Peter Henning is a professor of law at Wayne State University Law School and editor of the </em><

		<title>Much Pain, Much Gain: Skeptical Ruminations on the Vioxx Litigation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.fordham.edu/ihtml/bio.ihtml?id=855&template=fac">Benjamin Zipursky</a> of Fordham University School of Law says that the ongoing Vioxx litigation is exposing serious shortcomings in America&#39;s  products liability system...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benzipursky.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n August, a jury in Texas arrived at a huge verdict of $253 million against Merck Pharmaceutical Company, reportedly aiming to "send a message" to Merck that it is wrong to put profits over human life.  The wife of Robert Ernst alleged that Merck's top-selling pain reliever, Vioxx, had killed her husband by causing him to have a heart attack.  Her lawyers presented evidence that Merck knew that Vioxx greatly increased the risk of blood-clotting and heart attacks, but concealed this information to maintain its lucrative share of the pain-killer market.  The jury, a fairly educated group from the suburbs of Houston who heard weeks of testimony and saw numerous Merck documents, was ultimately persuaded by the plaintiff's case and unimpressed by Merck's counterarguments.  Although more than 85% of the verdict will be thrown out because of a Texas statutory cap on punitive damages, Mrs. Ernst's verdict may still remain over $25 million.<br />   <br /> The <em>Ernst</em> case might therefore seem to be a vindication of American products liability law.  After all, a major company was found out, and the people of the community were permitted to see the evidence and then make their decision.  A widow was compensated and a big company called  to task.  There are many &#8212; perhaps thousands &#8212; of trials ahead, but Merck will not lose as resoundingly in all of them.  Indeed, in two recent cases Merck obtained a clean victory in one and a mistrial in the other.  So the Vioxx litigation &#8212; at least at the moment &#8212; might seem troubling for Merck, but not necessarily indicative of a product liability law that needs to be fixed.  In fact, one might argue that we are seeing the system in action, producing results, sending incentives to companies, and compensating victims.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, the Vioxx litigation does not merit such complacency.  On the contrary, it serves once again to expose numerous serious shortcomings in our system.<br /><br />First, and most importantly, products liability law is supposed to guide companies to make the safest products they can and, where significant risks remain, our legal system is designed to lead companies to warn and educate consumers of those risks.   Although not all of the evidence is in, it now appears that these critical safety and information disclosure goals of our system failed in the case of Vioxx.  Reporters and plaintiffs' lawyers have put forward broad and powerful allegations that Merck deliberately refrained from disclosing information that might have greatly benefited patients and physicians.  Merck had intelligent lawyers and business people who were aware that our products liability system expects companies to air concerns that reasonable physicians and patients would want to weigh in the balance.  Surely, Mercks' lawyers and executives knew what liability could look like if their fears played out the wrong way, and the evidence came in concretely against Vioxx.  Whether they were right or wrong, imprudent or prudent, Mercks' decision makers were not effectively guided by tort law's incentives.  In that sense, the very existence of this batch of cases is some evidence that our tort law &#8212; and the FDA regulatory system with which it works in tandem -- is not functioning well.<br /><br /> Second, those aspects of Merck's behavior that do appear to have been precipitated by the products liability system &#8212; their decision to pull the drug off the market for everyone &#8212; are troubling in the other direction.  It may be that there are patients and physicians who would reasonably select Vioxx, even when fully informed, because their constellation of health problems and risk factors is such that the increased risks of cardiovascular disease does not undermine the reasonableness of taking the drug, all considered. <br /><br />Third, the compensation of victims and the liability for Merck are rough justice in only the very roughest way.  Mrs. Ernst, the only successful plaintiff so far, had just over $450,000 in actual lost income but managed to receive $24 million in non-pecuniary damages.  Texas, unlike most jurisdictions, permits a surviving family member to ask the jury for two separate sums of money relating to non-pecuniary loss &#8212; one that supposedly represents the value of loss of companionship, and one that supposedly represents compensation for grief.  The jury conveniently awarded $12 million for each.  Mrs. Ernst had been married to her husband for less than one year.   There is nothing reasonable about this compensation, which will make Mrs. Ernst an extremely rich woman.  The very next plaintiff to go trial received 0. <br /> <br /> Perhaps more surprising than the amounts in the first two trials was the weakness of each case.  Both plaintiffs had taken the drug for much shorter periods of time than those which would support a strong causal connection between their cardiac events and the Vioxx.  So both were weak cases.   There are, of course, much stronger cases on causation out there, but they have not yet come to trial.  It appears, thus far, that we have had a gargantuan victory, a complete defeat, and a mistrial in three cases, all of which were weak on liability.  And the aforementioned concerns do not even address the social costs, industry costs, and ultimately consumer costs that this massive litigation generates, and its inefficiency as a system of indirect insurance.<br /><br /> In brief, while the Vioxx litigation is a splashy spectacle that importantly attracts the public's attention to dangers in pharmaceutical products and corporate concealment, our system gets lower grades on its capacity to achieve other values: deterrence-capacity, fair compensation, truth, and efficiency.   Which is not to say that we should diminish or eliminate such actions: on the contrary, it is the power of private parties to jar an entrenched regulatory structure that plays a critically important political role.   But we should be more sanguine about the need to look to other forms of law to accomplish what are usually seen as goals of products liability law: greater regulation, greater insurance, and more intelligent crafting our products liability doctrine.<br /><br /><em>Benjamin Zipursky is a professor at Fordham University School of Law.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.temple.edu/servlet/RetrievePage?site=TempleLaw&page=Faculty_Kairys">David Kairys</a> of Temple University School of Law says that senators weighing the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the US Supreme Court should be wary of endorsing his commitment to legal technicalities over core constitutional values...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kairys.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>J</strong></font>udge Samuel Alito is smart, fair, collegial, and independent.  He's qualified, and he calls &#39;em how he sees &#39;em.  But that&#39;s the problem - how he sees &#39;em.<br /><br />The Constitution consists of short, general phrases - freedom of speech, due process, commerce among the states - whose meaning at particular times and in particular circumstances is left to the justices of the Supreme Court.  The justices have broad discretion because the meaning of these phrases is open to a wide range of interpretations. <br /> <br />The discretion of judges, particularly Supreme Court justices, is not a deviation from the system - it is the system.  Supporters of the Alito nomination can&#39;t seem to make up their minds if they like him because he doesn&#39;t apply values or because he applies values they like.  But this (and every) Supreme Court nomination is about values, not the absence of values.<br />  <br />It&#39;s no accident that the framers of the Constitution placed the confirmation process in the hands of a political branch of government, the Senate.  They could have sent it to a credentials committee if the focus were simply on the kind of qualifications the American Bar Association considers in its recommendations. <br /> <br />The senators should think long and hard and go with the president if it&#39;s a close call.  But their mandate is to approve or disapprove a nomination based on what it means for the Supreme Court and the nation.<br /><br />Discussions of legal issues like executive and legislative power can seem abstract and unrelated to the lives of most Americans.  And the arcane discussions at the confirmation hearings can seem baffling, particularly since Alito had such intricate, technical &#8212; and long &#8212; explanations.  But it all matters.  <br />Alito's decisions as a judge, like his testimony, usually don't repudiate established laws or principles or make major pronouncements.  Rather, his method is the tedious, often trance-inducing interpretations and applications displayed at his confirmation hearings.  <br /><br />Like the rest of us, he's for a clean environment and corporate responsibility, but he interprets environmental laws so it&#39;s near impossible to make out a case against a polluter, and anti-trust laws so it's near impossible to make out a case of price fixing.   <br /> <br />He tells us about the importance of privacy and of limits on the government's power to intrude on individuals, which are the essence of liberty.  But he accepts farfetched rationales to justify most any intrusion &#8212; even the unauthorized strip search of a 10-year-old girl and the unauthorized holding of a farmer at gunpoint and ransacking of his home.<br />  <br />He's for balance among the three branches government, but he's taken every opportunity to strip Congress of the basic power to protect and serve the public.  He voted, based on lack of congressional power, to invalidate the decades-old ban on machine guns in spite of numerous decisions to the contrary, and to invalidate a provision on sick leave benefits approved even by Chief Justice Rehnquist. <br />        <br />He's for religious freedom, but used an obvious sham to get around decisions on the separation of church and state.<br /><br />His judicial opinions don&#39;t repudiate anti-discrimination laws, but they advocate evidentiary requirements and legal rules that would make it near impossible to make out a case of race or sex discrimination.<br />  <br />In many such decisions, he was a lone dissenter, and majorities on his own court, including then-judge and now Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, often expressed unusual displeasure with his dubious manipulations of rules and evidence.<br /><br />The far rightwing conservatives who for decades railed on about liberal legal technicalities &#8212; usually referring to the liberal decisions of the 1960s making the Bill of Rights meaningful &#8212; have brought us the ultimate conservative technocrat.<br />  <br />Alito's legalistic, super-technical methods can &#8212; and will &#8212; justify anything.  And there's no mistaking the striking themes and patterns throughout Alito&#39;s decisions as a judge and memos and applications as a government lawyer.<br />  <br />He has a deep allegiance to government, to corporations, and to the wealthy and elite &#8212; so deep that there is no way to know what, if any, limits he might find acceptable. <br /> <br />Alito's writings yearn for undiluted executive power and immunity of executive officials from all legal claims &#8212; immunity from the rule of law.  At the confirmation hearings, he wouldn't accept any concrete limits on presidential power, even in general terms.  Alito relied on the apple-pie platitude "the president must follow the law."  That doesn't mean much if one is willing, like Alito, to accept farfetched, technical manipulations of the law to make anything the president does seem legal.<br /><br />But he's very willing &#8212; eager &#8212; to limit the powers of Congress when they are used to protect the safety, health, jobs, environment or wellbeing of Americans throughout the country. <br /> <br />Executive and legislative power matter.  The Bush administration candidly claims the power to torture and to eavesdrop on Americans without authorization.  The latest of these unprecedented claims is perhaps the boldest &#8212; Bush asserts the power to sign a law passed by Congress and then to decide whether or what parts of it to abide by.<br /><br />Alito is a Bush kind of judge on a range of issues, including, of course, abortion.  But his acceptance of sweeping executive power and of legal manipulations and technicalities to rationalize it seems of primary concern to the administration, and should be to the rest of us.  This is an administration that claimed it doesn't allow torture by re-defining torture in a secret memo so it didn't include what international law and most people regard as torture.<br /> <br />  Alito believes in freedom, but it&#39;s the freedom of the most powerful and wealthiest among us and of the government to do as they please, with little or no concern for the effect on most Americans or the nation as a whole.<br /><br />Even with a strong Republican majority in control of Congress, they and Alito realize that they can't say what they really want.  It would be repulsive to Americans across the political spectrum, as it was when Robert Bork's nomination was defeated in the 1980s.  They are relying on the tedious rationalizations and legal technicalities, and the perception of Alito as a smart and decent, if overly lawyerly, fellow, to blunt the public's understanding of what's in store for American freedom, democracy and equality should this nomination succeed.             <br /><br /><br /><em>David Kairys, a law professor at Temple University who has litigated leading civil rights cases, is the editor of </em>The Politics of Law<em> (Basic Books 1998).  He's writing a book about civil rights lawyering in the 1960s and beyond.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.fcsl.edu/faculty/bio2.cfm?instructID=1039">Brian J. Foley</a> of Florida Coastal School of Law says that the greatest threat posed by President Bush&#39;s domestic surveillance program is not to the privacy of ordinary Americans but rather to the independence of potential political rivals, journalists, and activists who would balance, constrain or oppose executive power...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/brianfoleyleft.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>M</strong></font>ost of the complaints about President Bush authorizing NSA phone taps without a warrant focus on the ethereal right to privacy, such as when the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/011806K.shtml">editorialized</a> against spying on "ordinary Americans&quot;, and the ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/index.html">warned</a>, "Just knowing that the government is spying without cause on innocent Americans sends a chilling message to all of us that our conversations are not our own." The predominant fear seems to be that people who have nothing to do with terrorism might be mistaken for terrorists and subjected to intrusive surveillance.  This is the thrust of the lawsuits that the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/images/nsaspying/asset_upload_file137_23491.pdf">ACLU</a> [PDF complaint] and the <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/govt_misconduct/docs/NSAcomplaint_11706.pdf ">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [PDF complaint] have filed to stop the spying.  <br /><br />The most important issue is not, however, whether people feel comfortable talking on the phone or sending emails. The real danger is that electronic surveillance can be used to increase and solidify executive power.  A president can collect private information not simply about "ordinary Americans," but extra-ordinary ones &#8212; political rivals, journalists, and activists &#8212; and use this information against them. After all, if a president is convinced he is right, he may well view those who disagree with him as dangerous and believe it's legitimate to use any means available to stop them.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">Surveillance</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2006/01/legal-authorities-for-nsa-activities.php">Legal authorities for NSA activities</a> [US DOJ] | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2006/01/gore-rule-of-law-speech-acslc.php">Gore rule of law speech</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />Americans were treated to an extensive description of such abuse 30 years ago, in the aftermath of President Nixon's harassment of political enemies.  A Senate committee chaired by Senator Frank Church of Idaho focused on the activities of several administrations and revealed that officials spied to learn opponents' plans and to stay a step ahead, to feed opponents' private information to the press to discredit them, and to blackmail them.  <br /><br />The danger that information gathered through the Bush Administration's ongoing surveillance program could be used in this way was recently raised by former CIA analyst Ray McGovern in a recent <em>Counterpunch</em> <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/mcgovern01112006.html">article</a>. Unfortunately, this danger has not yet become a part of our national discussion.  It should be.  McGovern asks, for example, whether the president could hypothetically use private information to blackmail Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) into deciding not to hold Judiciary Committee hearings to investigate presidential spying.  <br /><br />The danger is even more frightening, however, than McGovern's brief example suggests.  Let's amplify his point and look at a few other scenarios showing how even a well-intentioned president, believing that he's acting in the national interest, could neutralize opponents:<ul><li>A Senate vote on a controversial presidential appointee is coming up.  Administration officials rummage through taped calls from the homes of the politicians who might vote against their nominee.  They discover that &#8212; take your pick &#8212; one of the opponents: has a serious health problem he's trying to hide; is having an extramarital affair; is in psychotherapy; has a spouse brokering less-than-kosher commercial deals; has a daughter who just had an abortion (perhaps unbeknownst to her parents). Someone from the Administration casually informs the opponent that this bombshell could be publicized if the opponent "pushes too hard" against the nominee.  The opponent might simply ask easy questions of the nominee at Senate hearings, or let him off the hook when the questioning gets intense.<br /><br /><li>An investigative reporter digs up controversial, perhaps even illegal, activities by the Administration.  Administration wiretapping reveals that the reporter has nothing to hide &#8212; but that one of the editors at the newspaper the reporter writes for does. A short phone call mentioning the private matter and asking for "cooperation" in dealing with the reporter works wonders. The story never runs.  Or, it runs long after it can do any serious harm, such as after an election.  <br /><br /><li>A candidate is running against the president in an election &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; Instead of publicly revealing anything scandalous and causing him to quit the race, the president simply lets him know that, well, he knows.  The president doesn't let the rival quit but keeps him in the race, hobbled, afraid of disclosure.  Result: He won't campaign very hard against the president. He won't challenge close election results.</ul>It would be almost impossible for the administration to get caught: it's doubtful that the targeted politician or editor would run to the police, or convene a press conference to announce, "The president has threatened to tell you all that I have a drug problem."  The public might wonder why its politicians and journalists aren't fighting harder or asking tougher questions, but people &#8212; if they notice at all &#8212; may simply dismiss the apparent lassitude as "spinelessness."  <br /><br />So why isn't the danger that the president could easily blackmail opponents part of our national discussion of the spy program? Perhaps it's too frightening to contemplate.  History, however, says that we must take a hard-nosed look at how people with particular motivations are likely to act when they have the means and opportunity.   The words of the Church Committee's report bear repeating:<blockquote>Electronic surveillance of persons involved in the domestic political process, such as Congressmen, lobbyists, and Congressional aides, also raises special problems. Information is often the key to power; and the ability of high executive officials to use electronic surveillance to obtain information about their political opponents can give the President and his aides enormous influence. Apart from violating the rights o
f the surveillance targets, wiretapping and bugging on behalf of the President&#39;s political interests destroys the Constitutional system of checks and balances designed to limit the exercise of arbitrary power.<br /> <br />Electronic surveillance has been used to serve the interests of Presidents in almost every political arena; it has been a resource for executive power that has tempted administrations of both political parties. Officials succumbed to the temptation with a consistency which demonstrates the immense danger of vesting authority over the use of such techniques solely within the Executive Branch.<br /> <br /><em>Senate Select Comm. to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities, Final Report: Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans</em>, S. Rep. No. 755, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., <a href="http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIIe.htm">Bk. III</a>, Pt. VII (A)(4) (1976)</blockquote>The virtually undetectable abuses that can result from presidential spying pose an enormous and immediate threat to the viability of our government.  Although the issue generally has been framed as a legal issue, perhaps to be decided ultimately by the Supreme Court &#8212; while the present administration continues surveillance under its more than four-year-old program &#8212; we must recognize that presidential spying is first and foremost a political issue.  Congress should not wait for the courts to determine whether the president has broken the law but should act immediately to stop the spying &#8212; before this or any future president renders his opponents too scared to do anything but submit to his will.<br /><br /><hr size=1><br />Also by Brian Foley:<br /><ul><li><a href="/forumy/2006/01/playing-with-fire-congress-and.php">Playing With Fire: Congress and Executive Power</a><li><a href="/forumy/2005/11/graham-levin-amendment-and-due-process.php">The Graham-Levin Amendment and Due Process at Guantanamo</a><li><a href="/forumy/2005/11/why-americans-dont-care-about-gtmo-and.php">Why Americans Don&#39;t Care About GTMO, and Why They Should</a><li><a href="/forumy/2005/10/guantanamo-process-as-public-danger.php">Guantanamo Process as a Public Danger</a></ul><hr size=1><em>Brian J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/C8513.aspx">Craig Etcheson</a>, author of <em>After the Killing Fields: Lessons from the Cambodian Genocide</em> (2005) and a Visiting Scholar at Johns Hopkins University&#39;s School of Advanced International Studies, says the time has come for the United States to throw its full diplomatic weight behind the new Cambodia-UN Khmer Rouge Tribunal finally being set up in Phnom Penh...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/craigetcheson.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n the late 1970s, Cambodia&#39;s Khmer Rouge murdered more than two million people, and enslaved the survivors in a brutal rural gulag.  The authors of these crimes still live freely, enjoying absolute impunity. It has been more than 27 years since the Khmer Rouge were driven from power, and nearly nine years since negotiations on an accountability process began between the Cambodian government and the United Nations.  Despite this shameful record of delay and dithering, in the next few days, Cambodians finally expect to see the first glimmerings of justice.   UN officials are to join Cambodian jurists in establishing a unique &quot;mixed&quot; national-international criminal tribunal to judge Khmer Rouge leaders responsible for those crimes. <br /><br />The <a href="http://www.cambodia.gov.kh/krt/english/law%20on%20establishment.htm">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a>, as the Khmer Rouge Tribunal is formally known, is an experimental form of internationalized justice that attempts to reconcile the principle of complementarity with international concerns for due process and judicial independence.  The two-chamber special court will have a majority of Cambodian judges at each level, working alongside a minority of international jurists nominated by the UN.  Decisions in chambers will be taken by a &quot;super-majority principle&quot;, which requires international jurists to concur in any judgment.  Cambodian and international co-prosecutors and co-investigating magistrates are to cooperate in trying a small group of surviving Khmer Rouge leaders, with the personal jurisdiction of the court defined as &quot;senior leaders&quot; and &quot;those most responsible for the most serious violations&quot;.  Temporal jurisdiction will be April 17, 1975 to January 6, 1979, the period when the Khmer Rouge occupied Cambodia&#39;s capital.  Subject matter jurisdiction encompasses war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes against internationally protected persons, and violations of Cambodia&#39;s 1956 Code Penal.  <br /><br />Negotiating the jurisdictional contours of the court was challenging in part because the Cambodia&#39;s ruling party is led by former low- and mid-level Khmer Rouge officers, and a few of them have what is euphemistically known as &quot;interesting resumes&quot;.  Moreover, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen is in the habit of using Cambodia&#39;s courts to harass his domestic political opponents.   Recent arrests of Cambodian politicians, labor leaders, journalists, and human rights activists on flimsy charges have only underscored this tendency.  Historically, Cambodia&#39;s court system has never exhibited a strong sense of judicial independence. <br /><br />This goes a long way toward explaining why some international human rights organizations remain wary of the proposed process.  Human Rights Watch <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/cambod12269.htm">recently suggested</a> it is &quot;increasingly doubtful that a tribunal established within the Cambodian court system would ensure fair and impartial trials.&quot; Cambodian human rights campaigners, however, take a more realistic view, aware that transitional justice processes are inherently political, and that politics is the art of the possible.  The Documentation Center of Cambodia&#39;s <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D12FB385B0C708EDDA80894DE404482">Youk Chhang</a>, for example, argues that &quot;some people want a perfect trial, but this is what we have.  Let&#39;s make the best of it.&quot;<br /><br />It is time to do just that, for the tribunal is fast approaching.  On January 18th, the tribunal&#39;s recently appointed chief administrator took possession of the <a href="http://www.cambodia.gov.kh/krt/english/premises.htm">court&#39;s premises</a> from Cambodia&#39;s Royal Armed Forces at Kambol outside Phnom Penh.  The UN and Cambodia have largely completed the process of selecting judges and prosecutors, and will soon be announcing those appointments.  They are now recruiting lower-level staff such as deputy legal officials, investigators, computer specialists and translators.  Some of the <a href="http://www.un.org/law/khmerrougetrials/">finalists</a> for the key international slots bring impressive credentials to the bench.  The court&#39;s nascent administration has also begun taking initial steps to organize the already-mammoth amount of potential evidentiary material for the projected three years of proceedings.  Much of that <a href="http://www.yale.edu/cgp/">material</a> was collected with funding from the United States government. <br /><br />From 1994 to 2000, the United States played a pivotal role in shepherding the Khmer Rouge Tribunal into being.  In 1994, the US adopted the <a href="http://www.cybercambodia.com/dachs/cgja.html">Cambodian Genocide Justice Act</a>, which made it &quot;the policy of the United States to support efforts to bring to justice members of the Khmer Rouge for their crimes against humanity.&quot;  In mid-1990s, the US funded the establishment of the <a href="http://welcome.to/dccam">Documentation Center of Cambodia</a>, which has become the premier repository of evidence on Khmer Rouge crimes.  In the late 1990s, US diplomats played a hands-on role in helping the Cambodian government devise the Extraordinary Chambers, creating the institutional structure for the coming proceedings.  The US also was a key player in crafting the compromise between Cambodia and the UN Secretariat that persuaded the world body to participate in the trials. <br /><br />With the election of George W. Bush in 2000, however, the US government dropped the ball, and has been largely silent on the issue ever since.  But with Condoleezza Rice&#39;s elevation to the post of Secretary of State, and the recent departure of Ambassador Pierre Prosper from State&#39;s <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/wci/">Office of War Crimes Issues</a>, officials in Foggy Bottom have begun to reassess the policy of benign neglect that has governed Cambodian genocide justice policy in Washington for the last five years.  This reassessment should result in a US re-engagement with the Khmer Rouge Tribunal. <br /><br />The State Department has hinted in recent months that the US might contribute financially to the Khmer Rouge Tribunal if it shows itself to be &quot;independent&quot; and up to &quot;international standards&quot;.  Rather than standing by and clucking as the proceeding unfolds, however, the US can do more to assure that the tribunal is as good as it can be by becoming actively engaged in the process.  The UN&#39;s expenses for the tribunal have already been largely subscribed by other international donors, but the US might consider contributing to the UNDP fund that is being established to defray Cambodia&#39;s tribunal costs.  This is newly possible because this year Congress dropped legislative <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.3057.enr:">restrictions</a> on US assistance to the tribunal.  Alternatively, the US could fund training programs for Cambodian and international officials of the tribunal, and direct resources to some of the many civil society organizations that are working to prepare for the trials.  These NGOs will need on-going support during the three-year duration o
f the trials as they engage in monitoring, outreach and other activities in conjunction with the tribunal. <br /><br />Most of all, however, the State Department could make a difference on the Khmer Rouge Tribunal simply by throwing its weight behind the process.  The tribunal should once again become a priority not only at the US Embassy in Phnom Penh, but also at the Office of War Crimes Issues, the Office of Legal Affairs, the Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization, the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, and the US mission at the United Nations.  Secretary Rice needs to get her people singing off the same sheet of music.  When US ambassadorial-rank diplomats join with those at the deputy and assistant secretary levels to consistently and coherently press their concerns, UN and Cambodian bureaucrats sit up and take notice.  The United States has exercised no leadership on the Khmer Rouge Tribunal for the last five years, and it is high time that it did. <br />    <br /><br /><em>Craig Etcheson is a Visiting Scholar at Johns Hopkins University&#39;s School of Advanced International Studies.

Have you looked at your university's nondiscrimination policy lately?  It is likely that your university policy is in opposition to discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, or sexual orientation, or at least most of these categories.  The lists have grown over the years, but what is missing?<br /><br /> One category of impermissible discrimination that is ominously missing from most lists is discrimination on the basis of political opinion.  Perhaps most lists of impermissible grounds for distinction are holdovers from the McCarthy era depicted in the movie when discrimination on the basis of political opinion was favored by some.  Judging by recent conservative agitation for an &quot;academic bill of rights&quot;, a few even favor such a form of discrimination today with respect to the hiring and retention of faculty and staff, promotion and tenure of faculty, student admissions, publication of materials in university-approved journals and books, or the selection of deans and other administrators.  Nonetheless, a change in university policies to prohibit discrimination on the basis of political opinion is overdue.<br /><br /> Discrimination on such grounds is undoubtedly unconstitutional.  It would also violate treaty-based and customary international law evident, for example, in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Article 2 of the treaty expressly mandates that rights protected therein (such as "the right to hold opinions without interference" and "freedom of expression") shall apply "without distinction of any kind, such as ... political or other opinion."  Article 26 also assures: "All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law.  In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as ... political or other opinion."  Further, Article 50 requires that "[t]he provisions of the present Covenant shall extend to all parts of federal States without any limitations of exceptions."  This treaty-based mandate is similar to that of the United States Constitution -- Article VI, clause 2 of which requires that "all" treaties of the United States "shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding."<br /><br /> It is useful to highlight a few points about what would and would not be prohibited under a university policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of political or other opinion.  Such a policy would not preclude a decision to deny tenure to an outspoken left-oriented law faculty member for various lawful reasons, including attention to a pattern of lying about the faculty member's military record, as long as discrimination on the ground of political opinion as such does not occur.  Similarly, distinctions based on regulative racist speech (which might otherwise raise issues concerning when such speech is properly regulative on a university campus) are not precluded.  For example, racist speech that will lead to imminent lawless violence would not be protected speech under the First Amendment.  Speech by students in a professor's class who are not members of the class and that is significantly disruptive of the educational process should also be subject to controls concerning time, place, and manner.  It happens that Article 20 of the International Covenant requires that "[a]ny advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law."  When the United States ratified the treaty, its instrument of ratification contained a content-neutral First Amendment reservation, that nothing in Article 20 shall "authorize or require legislation or other action ... that would restrict the right of free speech or association protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States."  Nonetheless, it is well-known that certain compelling time, place and manner restrictions on speech and association are not impermissible under the First Amendment.<br /><br />During the Iranian hostage crisis, a newspaper reporter asked for my opinion about the legality of certain forms of economic sanction against Iran in response to its violations of international law.  My statement that the use of food as a weapon often does not affect the elite of a country but hurts the poorest of the poor and is highly problematic under international law was printed in a newspaper.  Days later, the Dean of our law school called me into his office to explain that a local county chair of one of the two prominent political parties in our country had told the Dean that "as long as Jordan Paust is on the faculty" he would give no more money to the school.  The Dean assured me that I was a valuable member of the faculty and that the local party chair had only given $100 that year &#8212; a mixed message perhaps.  If there had been an effort to terminate my tenure at the university based on my public legal opinion, I'm sure that the effort would have been impermissible.  A different circumstance would arise if a law professor's tenure was denied or terminated because of his abetting of international crime through conduct that included the drafting of legal memoranda while in government service &#8212; not an unreal example of criminal conduct in view of the successful prosecution at Nuremberg of certain German lawyers who, while in the Ministry of Justice in the 1930s and 40s, had abetted international crime partly through their legal memoranda.  I assume that choice to deny or terminate tenure in such a circumstance would not be based on political or other opinion as such, but on the criminal conduct of the professor and in view of relevant consequences for an institution dedicated to professional legal education.<br /> <br /> I have seen the claim that since supreme laws of the United States already proscribe discrimination on the basis of political opinion, a university's anti-discrimination policy need not be rewritten.  This misses the point.  Since it is already proscribed, it is more than appropriate and seemingly timely to add the phrase "political opinion" to each university's list.<br /><br /><br /><em>Jordan Paust is the Mike &amp; Teresa Baker Law Center Professor at the University of Houston</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/wucl/faculty/vollmar.htm">Valerie Vollmar</a> of Willamette University College of Law says that the recent US Supreme Court ruling upholding Oregon's physician-assisted suicide law is a major step towards ensuring dignified choices to terminally ill Oregonians...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/valerievollmer.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n January 17, 2006, the United States Supreme Court issued a 6-to-3 decision in <em>Gonzales v. Oregon</em> upholding Oregon's physician-assisted suicide law against the latest in a series of challenges &acirc;&#8364;&#8226; an administrative rule issued by the U.S. Attorney General.  <br /><br />Although Oregon voters passed the Oregon Death With Dignity Act (ODWDA) more than 11 years ago, the opponents of physician-assisted suicide have been relentless in their efforts to overturn Oregon's law. A constitutional challenge in the federal courts delayed implementation of the ODWDA for three years. Just before the federal litigation ended, voters rejected a referendum measure from the Oregon legislature that would have repealed the new law.<br /> <br />Soon after, at the request of Congressional leaders, the director of the Drug Enforcement Administration ruled that physician-assisted suicide was not a "legitimate medical purpose" under the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA).  Thus, Oregon doctors and pharmacists who participated in physician-assisted suicide were at risk of losing their licenses to prescribe and dispense essential drugs such as morphine and barbiturates.  Six months later, however, Attorney General Janet Reno reversed the DEA director's ruling.<br /><br />Congress tried unsuccessfully in 1998 and 1999 to overturn the ODWDA by passing federal legislation.  Senator John Ashcroft supported both bills.  Within months after President Bush took office, Attorney General Ashcroft issued an interpretive rule (the Ashcroft Directive) declaring that physician-assisted suicide is not a "legitimate medical purpose" under the CSA.  The Oregon Attorney General sued, and the court permitted a physician, a pharmacist, and several terminally ill patients to intervene.<br /><br />The U.S. District Court (2002) and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (2004) enjoined enforcement of the Ashcroft Directive.  Both courts decided the case based on the CSA, finding it unnecessary to reach the parties' administrative and constitutional law arguments.<br /><br />On January 17 of this year the US Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts.  Justice Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, was joined by Justices Stevens, O'Connor, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer.  Justice Scalia was joined in his dissenting opinion by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas.  Justice Thomas also wrote a separate dissenting opinion, arguing that the Court's decision was inconsistent with its recent opinion in the California medical marijuana case.<br /><br />The majority and dissenting justices agreed that the question was whether the CSA allowed the Attorney General to prohibit doctors from prescribing regulated drugs for use in physician-assisted suicide, notwithstanding a state law permitting the practice.  The two sides disagreed about everything else.<br /><br />The opinions consist in large measure of a rather dry, technical discussion of the various levels of deference (Auer, Chevron, or Skidmore) that might be accorded to the Attorney General as an executive officer.  The majority concluded that Ashcroft was not entitled to any level of deference in his decision to issue the Ashcroft Directive; moreover, the CSA did not give Ashcroft authority to regulate the practice of medicine generally.  In contrast, the dissent concluded that the Ashcroft Directive was valid under both Auer and Chevron deference standards, was supported by the language of the CSA itself, and reflected the "overwhelming weight of authority" that physician-assisted suicide is not within the boundaries of medical practice.<br /><br />The analysis of these issues in the majority and dissenting opinions is likely to be of great interest to administrative law scholars.  The rest of us, though, may find other aspects of the opinions much more fascinating.<br /><br />The majority opinion does not simply say that Ashcroft was misguided in interpreting the extent of his authority.  Rather, the justices seem quite critical of Ashcroft's actions.<br /><br />For example, the majority opinion quotes the statement in <em>Washington v. Glucksberg</em> that "Americans are engaged in an earnest and profound debate about the morality, legality, and practicality of physician-assisted suicide," a debate that Ashcroft obviously tried to terminate.  The opinion also notes that Ashcroft supported efforts to curtail assisted suicide while he was a Senator and that he did not consult with Oregon or anyone outside the Justice Department before issuing the Directive, even though he had promised Oregon's Attorney General an opportunity to participate in any discussion of the issue.  The opinion further points out that the CSA places the responsibility for making medical judgments on the Secretary of Health and Human Services and not on the Attorney General, who "lacks medical expertise."  Indeed, the opinion suggests that the Attorney General's understanding of whether physician-assisted suicide constitutes proper medical practice is not the only reasonable understanding of medical practice.<br /><br />Other observations in the majority opinion are even more pointed.  The justices say that the Attorney General "claims extraordinary authority" that would in effect allow him to criminalize even the actions of registered physicians, whenever they "engage in conduct he deems illegitimate."  Moreover, according to the majority, Congress does not implicitly delegate such broad and unusual authority (Congress "does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes").<br /><br />Finally, the majority opinion cites the principles of federalism, which give the states great latitude under their police powers to regulate matters such as the practice of medicine.  The concluding language of the opinion is especially interesting in light of the current struggle over the extent of executive powers:<br />The Government, in the end, maintains that the [CSA] delegates to a single Executive officer the power to effect a radical shift of authority from the States to the Federal Government to define general standards of medical practice in every locality.  The text and structure of the CSA show that Congress did not have this far-reaching intent to alter the federal-state balance and the congressional role in maintaining it.<br /><br />As always, the dissenting opinion shows Justice Scalia's gift for using engaging language in support of a detailed legal analysis.  He criticizes the majority justices for their "unremitting failure to distinguish among [the] different propositions in the Directive," their creation of a new "parroting regulation" for Auer deference purposes, and their "demonstrably false," "irrelevant," and "manifestly erroneous" conclusions.<br /><br />On the broader question of physician-assisted suicide itself, Justice Scalia is scathing in his criticism of the majority's view that physician-assisted suicide could be a reasonable understanding of medicine's boundaries, arguing that virtually every relevant authoritative source confirms that intentionally assisting suicide is not a "legitimate medical purpose."  He acknowledges that the legitimacy of physician-assisted suicide ultimately rests on "a naked value judgment" but concludes that the federal government may use its powers for the purpose of "protecting public morality."  The fact that Chief Justice Roberts joined in his first dissenting opinion in this case may be especially significant given the d
issent's views on federalism and public morality. <br /><br />For more than eight years, the Oregon Death With Dignity Act has provided choices to terminally ill Oregonians and has made Oregon a national leader in end-of-life care.  The ODWDA is rarely used, but it has proven effective and safe for patients who choose physician-assisted suicide.  These patients are well-educated, have health insurance, have hospice care available to them, and want to ensure a dignified death when they no longer can enjoy life.  Congress may try yet again to overturn the Oregon law, but the current political climate may make it difficult to succeed in the attempt.  Even if <em>Gonzales v. Oregon</em> has not removed the final obstacle for the Oregon Death With Dignity Act, the decision goes a long way in that direction.<br /><br /><br /><em>Valerie J.

		<title>Reprimand for Iraqi Detainee Homicide: Is This Military Justice?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nimj.org/">Kathleen Duignan</a>, Executive Director of the National Institute of Military Justice, says that the ostensibly-light sentence for Chief Warrant Officer Lewis Welshofer Jr., the highest-ranking US soldier to face a court-martial for abusing an Iraqi detainee, may actually have been consistent with the military justice system&#39;s goals of encouraging clear guidance to soldiers and promoting accountability of superiors...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kathleenduigan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ast week, Chief Warrant Officer Lewis Welshofer Jr. was convicted at a general court-martial of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty for his part in the death of an Iraqi general during an interrogation, and was sentenced by a military jury of restriction to his place of work, worship, and barracks for 60 days, forfeiture of $6,000 salary, and a formal reprimand.  Immediately following the announcement of sentence, human rights groups, legal commentators, and press accounts have opined that Welshofer's sentence was too light.  But full agreement on this point does not exist.  Why?<br /><br />Human Rights Watch posted a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2004/usa0604/5.htm">report</a> on its website describing some of the events surrounding Iraqi General Mowhoush's death in June 2004, well before the Welshofer court-martial was convened:<ul><li>At the Al Qaim detention facility northwest of Baghdad, Iraqi Major General Abed Hamed Mowhoush is interrogated by two officers of the 66th Military Intelligence Company. They force him head-first into a sleeping bag and question him as they roll him back and forth. <br /><br /><li>One of the soldiers, Chief Warrant Officer Lewis Welshofer, sits on the Iraqi general&#39;s chest and covers his mouth. The prisoner dies of asphyxia due to smothering and chest compression. <br /><br /><li>The Pentagon first released a death certificate reporting that Mowhoush had died "of natural causes" -- a news release added that "he did not feel well and subsequently lost consciousness." <br /><br /><li>But following a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2004/usa0604/5.htm#_Toc74483701">report</a> in the <em>Denver Post</em> after the Abu Ghraib scandal erupted, the Pentagon acknowledged that, according to an autopsy report, Mowhoush died of "asphyxia due to smothering and chest compression" showing "evidence of blunt force trauma to the chest and legs" and said that a homicide investigation was underway.</ul>Media coverage of the court-martial suggests potentially mitigating circumstances.  For instance, Welshofer allegedly was told to "take the gloves off," and received advance permission from his chain of command to use the interrogation techniques used.  Welshofer also was interrogating a "high value" detainee &#8212; a senior member of the Iraqi Army and one suspected of facilitating insurgent attacks in Iraq.  Civilians or contractors from another government agency could have interrogated Mowhoush before Welshofer ever entered the picture.  Conflicting reports were filed in the days following General Mowhoush's death containing physical evidence of beatings administered within a day or so of his death, but Welshofer has not been definitively painted as the sole actor.  The facts, if depicted this way, may have influenced the sentencing decision.<br /><br />Additionally, it is also important to recognize that a court-martial is not constructed exactly like a federal civilian criminal trial, and its goals are not entirely the same.<br /><br />To better understand the sentencing process, one must understand differences between the systems.  The convening authority for a court-martial is responsible for all discretionary decisions that ultimately bring a case to trial.   The convening authority is not beholden to an electorate, like a prosecutor's office, and the goal of the system is to enforce "good order and discipline."  The military prosecutor's office essentially works for the convening authority.  Discretion as to how this is accomplished rests with the convening authority.<br /><br />The military accused can choose whether to be tried and sentenced by a military judge or by a panel of military members (the "jury" in civilian terms), as Welshofer chose in this case.  The convening authority chooses the military members for each individual court-martial on a case-by-case basis, using the criteria set out in Rules for Courts-Martial 502(a)(1) and selected those "best qualified" for service by reason of their "age, education, training, experience, length of service, and judicial temperament."  Moreover, sentencing guidelines do not exist in the military system.  Thus, there is no recommended minimum or maximum mandated for an offense, other than the range of all available punishments, which run from no punishment at all to the maximum permissible for each offense.<br /><br />Civilian observers tend to question how conduct as egregious as that depicted in photographs and elicited from testimony at courts-martial like Welshofer&#39;s have been allowed to occur, and when disciplined, why some sentences, like Welshofer's, seem rather light.  But military observers most likely wonder where the chain of command was during these interrogations.  The idea that there are dozens of rogue military actors might be an argument that has run its course.  And where is the accountability and culpability of those entrusted with formulating, communicating, training, and enforcing detainee treatment policy to be found?<br /><br />Not to be overlooked, why haven't more senior individuals been held accountable in addition to Welshofer?  Will this eventually occur?  There are very few examples of accountability at the higher ranks.  The most public example to date is Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, a reservist on active duty who was in charge of the Abu Ghraib facilities during its early days.  She was demoted from Brigadier General to Colonel and has since written a book published in October 2005 entitled, <em>One Woman's Army: The Commanding General of Abu Ghraib Tells her Story</em>.  In an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3806713.stm">interview</a> with the BBC in June 2004, she stated, "How it happened or why those photographs came to the Criminal Investigation Division&#39;s attention in January I think will probably come out very clearly at each individual&#39;s court martial." But it seems that many of these questions have yet to be answered in this forum.<br /><br />Looking at the situation in this light, Welshofer's sentence should be less of a surprise.  He was one of the first and few military members accused of mistreating detainees to demand a contested court-martial, thus rejecting any form of plea bargain that limited an inquiry into the full scope of surrounding events. <br /><br />Additionally, reports suggest Welshofer was a model soldier until this point in his career, which is a factor that greatly inures to the military accused's benefit at court-martial.  Finally, the jury had the full opportunity to consider the actions of non-military actors, including those responsible for setting clear policy, and is empowered to answer with its verdict and sentence.<br /><br />Some <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_3434628">observers</a> may think the sentence here "rather light," and some may think it "is about right," but if it was an outcome that cautions military members to ask for clear guidance, to be familiar with standing regulations, and to use their internal moral compasses, it was a sentence consistent with the goals of the system. Welshofer's civilian defense counsel, Frank Spinner, was <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/portlet/article/html/fragments/print_article.jsp?article=3430776">quoted</a> in a <em>Denver Post</em> article right aft
er sentence was announced and offered that, "When you send our men and women over there to fight, and to put their lives on the line, you've got to back them up, you've got to give them clear rules, and you've got to give them enough room to make mistakes without treating them like criminals."  This is the argument that most likely persuaded the military members in the end.<br /><br />Regardless of one's viewpoint about Welshofer's punishment, our military men and women deserve to be spared the task of creating their own guidance or being forced to make the Hobson's choice about which orders they should disobey.  It is an untenable position that will create more cases like this one.  Military and civilian leaders must set standards that can be clearly communicated to the troops.   This is necessary to reestablish the world's confidence in our military, our ability as a people and nation to set and enforce the rule of law and standards of humane conduct, and to guarantee basic human rights.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Kathleen A.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.richmond.edu/faculty/tobias.htm">Carl Tobias</a> of the University of Richmond School of Law says Merck faces new legal difficulties as a retrial of the first federal Vioxx case begins...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/carltobias.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he retrial of the first federal Vioxx case begins Monday with jury selection. In December a jury deadlocked after deliberating for two days over whether Vioxx caused the death of Richard Irvin, a 53 year-old Florida man.  This suit was closely watched, as it was the initial trial of some 4000 federal cases filed, which U.S. District Judge Eldon Fallon is handling, while Merck had lost the first, and won the second, trials among 5000 state court lawsuits.<br /><br />Numerous observers - including media and counsel who attended the three trials and stock analysts - thought Merck would handily win the Irvin suit.  First, drug companies, like other institutional defendants, enjoy greater success in federal court.  Most federal judges are stricter than state judges about rejecting marginal evidence.  Federal juries can also evince more solicitude for institutional defendants than state juries.  Second, many observers believed the plaintiff had a rather weak case.  Irvin took Vioxx for less than a month before his heart attack.  Short-term usage suits are challenging because Merck argues that Vioxx can lead to heart attacks only after 18 months' use.  The company also contended that Irvin experienced risk factors, namely somewhat older age and greater weight, which caused his heart attack.<br /><br />Certain observers apparently saw the first federal trial as critical because the plaintiff won the initial, and Merck the second, state trials.  However, ultimate winners and losers cannot be identified when 9000 more suits remain.  Some reporters and Merck have described the federal mistrial as a draw.  Because the verdict had to be unanimous and the jurors disagreed, a mistrial resulted.  Early reports indicated the jurors were sharply divided on Merck's liability, but most later stated that jurors opposed liability 8-1, when a mistrial was declared.<br /><br />On the day jury deliberations began, the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> (NEJM) editors published an "Expression of Concern" regarding a 2000 article which they printed on a major Vioxx study.  The editors were concerned that the study authors had omitted crucial data showing three more Vioxx users had heart attacks.  These assertions will be central to Irvin's retrial, and to later federal and state trials, many of which will proceed this spring.  Merck has heavily relied on the study and its co-author as a lead witness in the three early trials.  The "Expression of Concern" might also erode Merck's reputation and its witness's credibility.  Plaintiffs' lawyers have vowed to exploit those apparent weaknesses in upcoming trials.<br /><br />The Irvin trial, accordingly, seemed to be a tie.  However, closer analysis suggests Merck is more vulnerable, given these credibility issues and the fact that the first three suits implicated short-term users, who have more difficulty proving Vioxx caused their harm.  This spring, Judge Fallon's next few trials will involve longer-term usage, as will the next two New Jersey state trials before Judge Carol Higbee, who tried the second case and is managing 4000 Vioxx suits.  The judges may be sequencing longer-term usage trials next to determine whether this will foster verdict patterns which prompt settlements.  The jurists might think, and experience with analogous mass tort cases indicates, that this spring's trials could result in patterns which lead plaintiffs and Merck to settle.<br /><br />In the end, the first federal Vioxx case's mistrial has yielded no definitive conclusions, but the future appears clearer.  Merck must address the NEJM concerns, if it hopes to win the more difficult long-term usage suits.  The stakes remain high and the outcome inconclusive.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Carl Tobias is the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a TARGET="_blank" href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Geoffrey_Corn.htm">Geoffrey S. Corn</a>, Lt. Col. US Army (Ret.) and former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters, now a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that the limits of the law of war need to be respected by civilian policymakers not just out of deference to the general rule of law, to enhance the legitimacy of the American cause or to encourage reciprocity, but also because those limits preserve our soldiers&#39; own morality and human dignity even in the midst of mortal combat....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/cornforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he law of war has been the subject of intense interest and debate among policy makers, scholars, media, and even the general public since the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  This interest, perhaps greater than at any other time in our history, has resulted in large measure from decisions by the Bush administration.  These decisions - establishing when and how the United States will apply the law of war to operations associated with the "Global War on Terror" - were intended to achieve the President's stated objective of doing whatever he deemed necessary to protect the people of the nation and defeat the trans-national terrorist threat.  The aggressive philosophy reflected in these decisions spawned a proverbial cottage industry of scholarship, punditry, and commentary on applicability, content, and purposes of the law of war.<br /><br /> This course of events exposed competing interests underlying the question of when and to what extent this law should apply to constrain U.S. operations.  Proponents of the aggressive policies established by the Bush administration emphasize the unprecedented nature of the terrorist threat and the lawless nature of terrorism itself.  Opponents of the administration emphasize three primary objections: that the policies simply cannot be reconciled with the letter of the law; that they diminish the moral legitimacy of the U.S. effort; and that they jeopardize U.S. forces by encouraging future enemies to adopt an equally limited acknowledgment of the applicability of this law.<br /><br /> There is no question that respect for the rule of law, moral legitimacy, and encouraging reciprocity are all important rationales for broad application and good faith interpretation of the law of war.  However, it seems that advocates on both sides of this debate routinely overlook a subtle but essential purpose for accepting the limits imposed by this law: protecting the moral integrity and mental well-being of the servants of the nation called upon to prosecute this conflict.     <br /><br /> There are certain truisms in war that persist through time.  First, war involves the deliberate infliction of suffering upon warriors, and the inevitable incidental infliction of suffering on the people and property of an opponent.  Second, suffering is not inflicted for personal reasons, but because some national or organizational leadership entity directs such activity.  Third, those who engage in mortal combat do not do so for profit or personal vendetta, but because they have been called upon to do so by the authority they serve.  For the warriors who serve this nation, and many other nations, this results in an implied covenant between them and the nation under whose flag they fight, kill, destroy, and detain.  The essence of this covenant is a willingness to inflict the suffering associated with warfare based on the belief that doing so will be consistent with the inherent values of the cause for which they serve.  For most human beings, imbued with an inherent value for human life, preserving this covenant is essential to reconcile their innate sense of morality with the suffering their duty requires them to inflict.<br /><br /> Military professionals historically understood that preserving a sense of morality would be most severely stressed during armed conflict.  As a result, they were at the forefront of developing non-negotiable rules to limit the brutality of warfare, and in so doing limit the corrosive moral consequence of conflict.  Thus, another truism of war is that limitations imposed on the conduct of hostilities &#8212; limitations developed by warriors to limit the infliction of suffering to only that which is legitimately necessary &#8212; protect not just the adversary, but the moral and psychological integrity of the members of the force regulated by such constraints.<br /><br /> One of the most indelible images from the first Gulf War is that of the "highway of death", an image that illustrates the first truism of war &#8212; infliction of suffering.  However, for the thousands of military lawyers trained at the Judge Advocate General's School, a different image illustrates the truism that warriors rely on the law of war to preserve the line between their inherent sense of right and wrong: a photograph depicting a U.S. Marine offering comfort to a captured Iraqi soldier.  The Marine holds his pistol in one hand, pointed towards the ground, but ready to use on short notice with deadly consequence.  His other hand rests on the shoulder of the prisoner of war kneeling before him, hands bound.  This Marine, who moments before had almost certainly been engaged in mortal combat with this enemy, was reassuring the prisoner that he was not going to be the object of reprisal, but would instead be treated as a victim of a war he been compelled by his nation to fight.  This image beautifully illustrated that opponents do not by virtue of their participation in hostilities cease to be human beings, and that when no longer a threat they do not become the object of retribution, but instead become the subject of humanitarian protection.  Fidelity to this spirit enabled this Marine, like so many of his brothers and sisters in arms, to reconcile the brutality of warfare with the core value of respect for basic human dignity so indelibly linked to the pride of serving our nation. <br /> <br /> The law of war operates to preserve this distinction between "right and wrong".   History has demonstrated that armed conflict will virtually always trigger determination by policy makers to unleash every available means to defeat their enemies.  The limits imposed by the law of war operate to substantially mitigate the brutality of war.  In so doing, the law allows warriors to preserve their sense of morality and human dignity.  This is essential for an armed force composed of volunteers who accept the risks and burdens of military service based in large measure on a sense of commitment to the values of our democracy.  Our policies must not be defined by the image of an American soldier smiling demonically in the presence of a hooded detainee with wires connected to his hands, but instead to the image of that Marine, offering compassion to a prisoner he would have willingly killed only moments earlier.  Our warriors deserve nothing less.<br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S. Corn is a Professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston.  He is also a retired LTC from the Army JAG Corps.

See, e.g., 43 Columbia Journal of Transnat&#39;l Law 811, 852-53 n.154 (2005); see also id. at 855-61 &amp; esp. nn.192-196.  Neither he nor the President has any authority to violate relevant laws of war and human rights law.  Id. at 855-61, and the many cases cited.  Moreover, the judiciary clearly has the power and responsibility to review such violations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong>Elizabeth Seitz</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh School of Law 3L in New Orleans]: &quot;The Student Hurricane Network (SHN) is a national association of law students dedicated to providing long-term assistance to communities impacted by Hurricane Katrina (<a href="http://www.studenthurricanenetwork.org/">www.studenthurricanenetwork.org</a>). In December, SHN facilitated sending 240 students from about 50 schools to the Gulf coast region.  While the first wave of students was volunteering their time, I received an email from the ABA promoting involvement in the organization.  As I approached my final semester at the University of Pittsburgh Law School, I saw an opportunity to apply my education and to encourage my fellow Pitt law students to join in this worthy cause.<br /><br />16 Pitt Law students answered the call, and this week we will join hundreds of law students from across the country who are each dedicating their spring breaks to volunteer for pro bono legal and community organizations in the Gulf Coast.  The majority of Pitt Law students will be in New Orleans, with one student in Gulfport, Mississippi.  Specifically, our students will be working with Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) to provide physical aid and New Orleans Legal Assistance Center (NOLAC), Juvenile Court, Pro Bono Project, Justice Center &#8212; Louisiana Capital Assistance Center and Capital Appeals Project and the Mississippi Center for Justice to provide legal support.  We will be documenting our experiences on JURIST, making posts throughout the week.&quot;<br />

		<title>Pitt Law in New Orleans: ACORN team report</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu"><strong>Gordon Goldsmith</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh School of Law 2L, in New Orleans]: &quot;Greetings from the Bayou and the ACORN team, consisting of Hannah Burke, Gordon Goldsmith, Robert Lionel Hawkins, Marni Richman and Pete Vitelli, all 2L and 3L law students from the University of Pittsburgh. ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, is a national non-profit program designed to assist low-income families in a variety of ways. For additional information on ACORN, please visit <a href="http://www.acorn.org">www.acorn.org</a>.<br /><br />Our enthusiastic team of five has just completed the second day of a five-day program aimed to facilitate the renovation process for houses destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. Work days begin at 8am at the local ACORN office, located one mile south of the French Quarter. Dozens of students and local volunteers arrive, ready to be dispatched to different neighborhoods of New Orleans. The ACORN caravan hits each spot, dropping off an assortment of equipment consisting of hazardous-material &quot;suits&quot;, work-gloves, goggles, protective facial masks, shovels, crow-bars, hammers and various other construction items. Each house receives anywhere from 5-20 workers depending on the size of the project.<br /><br />The informational packets that each disaster relief volunteer received included instructions on obtaining tetnis shots, and it only took a few seconds upon entrance of our first house to realize why. The dilapidated exterior of the houses tell only part of the story. Inside each house this week, we&#39;ve been greeted to the overwhleming stench of rotting fecal matter, six-month old food, a cadre of spoiled beverages, soggy, dirty old clothing, and crumbling walls &quot;decorated&quot; with mold markings.<br /><br />The primary goal of an ACORN team is to clear the entire house of items (making sure to keep any salvageable items that may still have sentimental or monetary value to the owner) and then gut the interior of the house. Gutting consists of tearing down dry-wall and sheet rock, basically stripping the house to its foundational core.<br /><br />The importance of the haz-mat suit and other materials is quickly made apparent. An indescribable amount of thick dust swirls as walls are hammered down. Rusty old nails jut precariously out of splintered ply-wood. Large shards of plaster cascade from above, flying several feet in all directions at all times and threatening both workers and scurrying rats and mice alike.<br /><br />By the conclusion of the work day, which usually ends at 3pm, each worker is completely covered in dirt, filth and sweat. The haz-mat suit can be thanked for its protective purposes, but scolded for its ability to trap body heat within the suit. Suffice to say, it gets very, very hot by the end of the day. Goggles are virtually worthless thanks to a day&#39;s worth of dirt and sweat. The interior of the protective nose masks have transformed from pristine white to charcoal black. And you really don&#39;t want to know the results of a blown nose.<br /><br />While the physical toll on the body is obvious, the mental impact of tearing down someone&#39;s (former) dwelling is just as palpable. It&#39;s as if each extracted nail represents a further nail in the coffin of someone&#39;s home. We have been fortunate enought to encounter some of the home-owners of the houses we&#39;ve gutted, and their mixture of emotions is evident. To some, the house-gutting signifies the beginning of the recovery and rebuilding process. To others, seeing the house literally come apart from the seams serves as another overwhelmingly painful reminder of the hurricane&#39;s destruction. <br /><br />As &quot;rewarding&quot; as it has been to help people re-build their property (hard to call tearing down one&#39;s house as &quot;rewarding), our interactions with community members of New Orleans have been just as enriching and eye-opening. The anti-Bush/FEMA sentiment is strong. People cannot understand why miles upon miles of property are in the same condition as they were in September. Interestingly enough, President Bush, flanked by a quarter-mile long line of protective agents, drove past our job-site on Wednesday. However, he was hard to see and &quot;appreciate&quot; as his Ford SUV sped past at nearly 50 miles per hour.<br /><br />Some locals have claimed Katrina has actually helped the city, as some previously run-down areas (especially the Ninth Ward) are now forced to re-build, creating ample economic and real estate opportunities for those willing to take a chance on an as-of-now levee-less city. Others tearfully lament the fact that all of their friends and possessions are long gone. Everyone CAN agree on the fact that New Orleans is different somehow, though only time will tell how the differences will affect the city in the long run.<br /><br />Wrapping it up, I urge anyone considering lending a helping hand down here to jump on the opportunity. Volunteers are generally well-received, greeted with warm southern hospitatlity and the spirit of a city seeking re-birth. This truly is one of America&#39;s more unique and interesting cities, perhaps due to the lingering European influence and Katrina&#39;s aftermath. It is going to take years before this city truly rebuilds and the the area needs any helping hand it can receive.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/fulltime/damato/damato.html">Anthony D&#39;Amato</a> [Northwestern U. School of Law]: &quot;Lawyers in Denmark should investigate their criminal law of attempt, incitement to murder, conspiracy to murder, and procuring murder.  If any of these are available under Danish law, then there would be no impediment against indicting the Islamic cleric who has offered an immense reward to anyone who murders the Danish cartoonist for the recent highly publicized cartoons.  The Danish public prosecutor should be asked to investigate bringing an indictment under Danish law.<br /><br />     It seems to me intolerable that Denmark should not act decisively to protect one of its citizens from the threat of assassination.  A person who offers a bounty for murder is himself a felon under any legal system that I am familiar with.  The reason for offering the bounty is immaterial.  <br /><br />     Under customary international law, Denmark has jurisdiction to prosecute the cleric who has offered the bounty.  (See The Lotus Case, PCIJ, 1927.)  <br /><br />     If there is an indictment, the Danish prosecutor has two choices.  First, he or she may apply to Interpol for the arrest of the accused person.  Second, he or she may proceed with the trial in absentia.  Such a trial would require notifying the accused person of his right either to present himself in Denmark or to designate a lawyer who would represent his interests in a Danish criminal court.  There is no impediment in international law for a criminal trial in absentia given the jurisdictional basis that I mentioned above.&quot;<br /><br />     Anthony D&#39;Amato<br />     Leighton Professor of Law<TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><TR><td><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><TR><TD><COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><IMG src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&nbsp;News: <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/russian-prosecutors-probe-cartoons.php">Russian prosecutors probe cartoons republication as more die in world protests</a><br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD BGCOLOR=WHITE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.fcsl.edu/faculty/bio2.cfm?instructID=1039"><strong>Brian J. Foley</strong></a> [Florida Coastal School of Law]: &quot;Why should Congress <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/frist-says-changes-to-surveillance.php">revise FISA</a> to give the executive more power to spy? The main argument that AG Gonzales seemed to raise at the February 6 hearing was that it is too difficult/onerous/slow to get a warrant under FISA, even with FISA&#39;s giving the executive up to 72 hours after the tap has been implemented to apply for a warrant.  He appears to want no burden whatsoever. <br /><br />Regarding revising FISA, there are two issues that should be kept separate: Is Congress upset at the surveillance, or is Congress upset because the president did not come ask them first for authorization to conduct it? If Congress is considering legislation merely to give more spy power to the executive, to make legal what is illegal (or, quite apparently illegal), I&#39;d rather Congress not legislate at all.  Let the lawsuits and possible criminal prosecutions proceed in the courts.<br /><br />Another issue is whether the putative need for this surveillance outweighs the serious risks it poses, as I described in a recent <a href="/forumy/2006/01/real-danger-of-presidential-spying.php">JURIST commentary</a>.  It&#39;s highly likely that the executive branch will abuse these powers.<br /><br />It&#39;s not even clear that there is a need for such surveillance. As I wrote in an <a href="/hotline/2006/02/arguments-for-increased-government.php">earlier post</a> here, the 9/11 attacks could have been thwarted with the information the Administration already had.  Why give the Administration more power rather than holding it accountable for negligence or worse?<br /><br />Another issue is whether our government is overstating the threat of terrorism. There&#39;s been no attack in almost four and one half years. Not even a bus bomb, not even a car being rammed into a crowded crosswalk. Other countries have more attacks, more regularly, but people there seem less frightened. Also, I don&#39;t remember any government until ours talking regularly about fears of nuclear terrorist attacks, though it seems to me that it would have been easier for the IRA or ETA to get hold of a Soviet or Chinese nuke in the 1970s or 1980s or 1990s (especially a loose former Soviet nuke in the 90s) than it would be for Al Qaeda to get hold of a nuclear bomb from, say, Iran, which doesn&#39;t even have a nuclear bomb.  <br /><br />Last, the American people need to discuss how far we are willing to go for &#39;security.&#39; Sure, letting the government read all our emails and listen to all our phone calls MIGHT thwart an attack. But so might putting an FBI agent in everybody&#39;s household.  So might installing two-way televisions a la Orwell&#39;s <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/orwell/1984/">1984</a>. Just because a measure might work, however, doesn&#39;t mean that we should accept it.  It seems to me that much of the public discourse on the NSA spying (and torture and the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo, for that matter) lacks this perspective.&quot;<TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><TR><td><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><TR><TD><COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><IMG src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&nbsp;News: <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/frist-says-changes-to-surveillance.php">Frist says changes to surveillance legislation unnecessary</a><br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD BGCOLOR=WHITE><IMG src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.ijdh.org/">Brian Concannon Jr.</a>, Director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, says that Haitian President-elect Rene Preval faces a daunting if familiar series of legal obstacles involving parliament, the judiciary and the police as he attempts to move forward with economic and social reforms following his latest election victory...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/concannon.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>&quot;N</strong></font>aje pou soti&quot; in Haitian creole means "swim your way out." Haiti sits on an island, where rivers swell and rage after rain, few people know how to swim, and many die trying to flee the country in rickety boats.  So hard experience makes the saying less theoretical and more disconcerting than Americans' "sink or swim."<br /> <br />Haiti's President-Elect, Ren&Atilde;&copy; Preval, famously invoked the saying towards the end of his first term in office, which ran from 1996 to 2001. Preval had been elected to pursue progressive economic and social policies- building schools, roads and hospitals, reforming and supporting Haiti's agricultural base, developing a judiciary responsive to the majority of Haitians who are poor, etc. &#8212; but had struggled to implement the mandate.<br /><br /><em>Parliamentary Paralysis</em><br /><br />Preval's biggest obstacle was the Parliament, even though most legislators were elected on the same progressive platform. The OPL party, the largest party in the legislature, changed course after the election and opted for the policies championed by the international financial institutions and the U.S. - cutting government spending, allowing the private sector more control of the economy and reducing tariffs that protected Haitian agriculture. <br /><br />The policy dispute spilled beyond Parliament into the streets, where protests forced the resignation of the OPL Prime Minister in June, 1997. For the next nineteen months Parliament refused to confirm any of President Preval's nominations for a replacement Prime Minister. The international community took the legislators' side, and withheld urgently-needed development assistance to force the administration to give in to the opposition's demands.<br /><br />The dispute turned into an impasse, and for the next three years endless negotiations diverted the Administration's energy and paralyzed government operations. Even officials not involved in the talks were reluctant to initiate long-term projects, because they expected the negotiations would at any time replace them with a new team with new plans. The impasse was eventually broken not by talks, but by Parliamentary suicide- the legislators' intransigence led to their terms expiring without new elections being held. But in the meantime Haiti's poor became poorer and more numerous.<br /><br /><em>Desperate Measures For Desperate Times</em><br /><br />Mr. Preval invoked "naje pou soti" in a meeting with peasants who were complaining about the difficulty of their situation- complaints that the President was hearing everywhere he went. An agronomist by training, Preval knew how bad things were in the countryside, but as President he also knew that there was no easy solution. He invoked the saying to dispel any false hopes: the peasants needed to know that the government did not have the resources to elevate them out of their misery, and that the international community would not come through with the promised development assistance. But President Preval also wanted to instill a hope that was more limited and desperate, but more real- that Haitians could at least survive by relying on their own resources. <br /><br />The President turned out to be right on both counts.  No one did help- throughout the remaining time of his Administration, the international community increased its pressure and decreased its development assistance. But Haiti also did manage to swim- not out of danger, but enough to keep alive and fighting. President Preval found ways to build hundreds of miles of roads, dozens of schools and a few health centers. He transferred thousands of acres of land into peasants' hands and he organized the two best human rights trials in Haiti's history.<br /><br />It appears that Preval will once again be President, once again with a mandate to implement progressive policies. But despite the strength of his landslide election victory on February 7- he won 4 times more votes than his nearest competitor- President Preval and the citizens who elected him will need to start swimming from the very beginning. An impressive array of forces and obstacles has already assembled to delay, frustrate and block his implementation of progressive policies. <br /><br /><em>Parliamentary Paralysis II</em><br /><br />Preval may have even more trouble with Parliament this time around. Although the results of the legislative elections will not be decided until the second round (which is still not scheduled, a month after the first round), it is clear that Parliament will be fragmented, with many parties each having a few seats. Perhaps more important, a large percentage of legislators will be from conservative parties opposing Preval's progressive agenda.  <br /><br />Both the parliamentary fragmentation and the conservative success are the product of two years of repression against progressive political activists. Many top leaders, including the last Constitutional Prime Minister, were kept of politics by being kept in jail, illegally. Grassroots activists were arrested or killed, police routinely fired at peaceful, legal demonstrations and critical news outlets were closed or intimidated. Paramilitary groups, including groups of former soldiers who had led the 2004 coup d'&Atilde;&copy;tat, harassed, intimidated and even killed progressive activists with impunity. <br /><br />The repression was particularly focused against Haiti's largest political party, Fanmi Lavalas, which won large majorities in both the Senate and the Chambre des Deput&Atilde;&copy;s in Haiti's last election, in 2000. Fanmi Lavalas refused to participate because the Interim Government of Haiti (IGH) refused to free its political prisoners- including former Ministers and parliamentarians- or to stop the brutal repression of grassroots activists (some individual candidates claimed the Fanmi Lavalas banner, without the approval of the organization, or for the most part, the voters). As a result, the party with the best organization throughout the country, the most electoral support and the most legislative experience was removed from the contest.<br /><br />Other parties close to Fanmi Lavalas, including Preval's Espwa (Hope) party ran candidates in some races, but not all. They lacked Lavalas' organization and name recognition, and the repression forced them to run a very limited campaign. Even Preval, with the international spotlight on him, planned very few public campaign activities and was forced to curtail this limited schedule when mobs destroyed the podium for one appearance and attacked his supporters at another. <br /><br />The low-key campaign was adequate for the former President with universal name recognition and a five-year record. But it was not adequate for less experienced and prominent local candidates, who were unable to conduct the grassroots organizing work necessary to build a political base. Allies of the IGH, on the other hand, were able to organize freely at the local level, and often had the benefit of political patronage to attract campaign workers and supporters. <br /><br />Many areas that voted overwhelmingly for President Preval's progressive policies will be represented in Parliament by conservatives committed to opposing the policies. As a result, to have any of his program passed, Preval will need to compromise away from the platform he was elected on. Preval will not have
 much opportunity to increase Parliamentary support during his term either. There are legislative elections scheduled for late 2007, but only for 1/3 of the Senate. Broader elections for the entire House of Deputies and another third of the Senate are scheduled for 2009, but even if Preval's candidates win that one, they will take office with only a year left in the Presidential term.<br /><br />Fragmentation in the legislature will make it extremely difficult to assemble a majority on even uncontroversial legislation. The fragmentation is compounded by inexperience- only a tiny percentage of those in the second round have served in a legislature before. The Senators and Deputies will need to learn their jobs, choose leaders, find ways of working with people from across the political spectrum, and draft and pass the legislation that the Haitian people urgently need, all under extreme pressure.<br /><br />The fragmentation will almost certainly be compounded by yet another political crisis following the runoff elections. The first round on February 7 was plagued by poor organization and a vote count that was unruly, and by many accounts fraudulent. Thousands of ballots were missing, many of which turned up partially burned in a dump. Electoral officials and political parties claim the count was manipulated and information concealed.<br /><br />Many of the irregularities were rendered irrelevant in the Presidential contest by Preval's landslide, but they will loom larger in close legislative contests. The Electoral Council is also in disarray- its General Director, Jacques Bernard, fled to the U.S. ahead of fraud allegations, and spent two weeks on a lecture circuit sponsored by Lavalas opponents in the U.S., claiming that others were responsible for fraud, and that his farm was burned in retaliation for his work. He claimed he would return only after three members of the Electoral Council were fired, but he returned to Haiti in early March to the same Council (and according to an investigation, to an undamaged farm). <br /><br />Under these circumstances anyone who loses, especially in a close race, will have grounds to contest the results. So many first round candidates complained that the Electoral Council indefinitely postponed the runoffs scheduled for March 19. To effectively deal with these complaints, the Council should organize a transparent and precise retabulation of the results, and reconstitute results that were destroyed using the election code's backup systems. The Council declined to take these measures to resolve the dispute over the Presidential election, preferring a negotiated settlement that preserved everyone's right to complain. It is likely that the Council will take a similar path with the legislative results, planting the seeds for the next political crisis in fertile ground.  <br /><br /><em>Judicial Reform?</em><br /><br />The judicial branch may be equally problematic. Haiti's justice system has evolved for three centuries to serve the needs of dictatorships. As President Preval found out in his first administration, effective judicial reform is a long-term project. Substantial progress requires patiently training a new generation of judges, prosecutors and lawyers and persistently integrating them into the system with enough support for them to do their jobs honestly and well. <br /><br />But this time around President Preval will find the job harder than before. Many of the promising judges and prosecutors trained in his first term have been pushed out of the system, illegally, by the IGH. Some have been beaten, or their houses burned. Some may be lured back by renewed opportunities to build a democratic justice system, but many will be reluctant to stick their necks out a second time. The IGH has also packed the judiciary with officials whose main qualification was a willingness to comply with the IGH's orders, especially when the orders conflicted with the law's requirements. The most notorious court-packing incident came in December 2005, when Prime Minister Gerard Latortue illegally fired five Supreme Court Justices and replaced them with his henchmen. But the same process has been repeated more quietly throughout the judicial ranks for two years.<br /><br /><em>Cobbling Together A Government</em><br /><br />Preval's most difficult battle of all may be within his own Executive Branch. Haiti's Constitution grants the Prime Minister and the Ministers a large share of executive power. They hire most officials, run most government programs and manage the lion's share of the national budget. Although the President nominates the Prime Minister, he must choose someone from the majority party in Parliament (if there is no majority party, as is likely to be the case, the President chooses someone in consultation with Parliamentary leaders). Both the Prime Minister and his cabinet must be ratified by Parliament, and a legislative vote of no confidence will cause the government to fall. <br /><br />In order to cobble together enough votes for ratification, Preval will most likely be forced to assemble a cabinet from many disparate parts- political parties that have no common political vision, just a shared agreement to vote for ratification in return for the power of controlling a ministry. Just getting a government ratified by a fractured Parliament will take much effort, and perhaps more importantly, time. Organizing the government to advance a coherent policy will be extremely difficult. In the best case scenario, Ministers of good faith but diverse ideologies will struggle hard to find consensus on a few key issues. In a more likely scenario, broad agreement on anything will be impossible, and many Ministers will spend their time and energies implementing their own, often contradictory, policies and expanding their patronage base.<br /><br /><em>Controlling the Police</em><br /><br />Managing the cabinet may, however, be easy compared to getting a handle on the police force. Haiti's police have become highly politicized, corrupt and violent over the two years under the IGH. Many good officers have been forced out or killed; others have been turned into killers by the violence. Former soldiers, many of them violent, have been integrated into the force, bypassing normal recruitment and promotion regulations. The population, especially in poor neighborhoods, is deeply distrustful of the police, for good reason- police regularly conduct murderous raids in their areas and routinely make illegal warrantless arrests. Even the police force's General Director complains that at least a quarter of his officers are criminals.<br /><br />Reforming the police will take time, and money, both of which are in short supply. Reform will also need to be balanced with the urgent need to fight increasing common crime. Haiti's police force is already dangerously understaffed, which will be exacerbated in the short term by diverting human resources to reform efforts, and even by the process of removing crooked officers.<br /><br /><em>Demoting Democracy, Selling Sovereignty</em><br /><br />Preval's authority with the police was severely limited by a controversial and far-reaching agreement reached between Prime Minister Latortue and Juan Gabriel Valdes, the head of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). The agreement grants MINUSTAH extensive authority over the police and government, including a) a right of consultation before any police operation; b) veto power over police promotions; c) access to all files of any government official or entity relating to the police; and d) veto power over international agreements relating to the police.<br /><br />The deal has been controversial because it was reached quietly- it was signed in New York and not even the police chief or Justice Minister even knew about it until a week after the signing- and because it hands an immense amount of national sovereignty to MINUSTAH. But it should be equally controversial because it demonstrates a deep disrespect for Haiti's voters, its Constitution and its democracy. The deal was signed on February 22, a week after the announcement
of Preval's victory, and five weeks before his (then) scheduled inauguration. If the agreement was appropriate to negotiate at all, it would have been appropriate to negotiate it with the President who would have to abide by it, and who also had the electoral and constitutional legitimacy to bind his country.<br /><br />There was no reason why the deal could not have been negotiated with the elected President, other than a fear that the voters' choice would not agree to it. It is not hard to understand why Prime Minister Latortue, who was never elected and is on his way out after two disastrous and unconstitutional years in office, would be willing to pull a fast one on his country and his Constitution. But the UN should be above such underhanded stunts.<br /><br />MINUSTAH's bad faith is magnified by the fact that the agreement grants it extraordinary control over a police force under an elected President, when the Mission refused to exercise even ordinary oversight over the force under the unelected dictatorship. Time and again MINUSTAH forces stood by while the police massacred prisoners, invaded neighborhoods and made illegal political arrests, insisting that their mandate prevented them from interfering in the police force's internal affairs. The Mission that did not issue a single investigative report in almost two years of Mr. Latortue's reign will now have access to President Preval's personal diary if he writes in it about the police. <br /><br />The agreement is unconstitutional and illegal, as Mr. Latortue was forced to concede once it became public, so President Preval is not legally required to recognize it. But he may be politically required to do so- MINUSTAH currently intends to stay for at least half of Preval's term, and there is not much he can effectively do about it. With little money, a police force loyal to his unelected predecessor and the example of his predecessor flown to exile by the international community, Mr. Preval's bargaining position is weak.<br /><br /><em>More Desperate Times</em><br /><br />In the meantime, life will get harder for Haiti's poor. The life expectancy for men has dropped to 48 years, infant mortality and AIDS are by far the worst in the hemisphere. Most Haitians struggle to get by on little more than $1 a day, over half are malnourished.<br /><br />As before, President Preval will not be able to count on the international community to help fight Haiti's poverty with the necessary consistency. There will be some development assistance sent to Haiti, and much of it will have a positive impact on the ground. But this aid will, sooner rather than later, become contingent on the Preval administration implementing the international community's economic policies. The U.S. government, among others, has already declared that Preval must compromise with his political opponents, who the voters resoundingly rejected. Those pressures will increase with the disputes likely to arise from the legislative elections and the choice of ministers, with the international community consistently taking the side of Lavalas opponents.<br /><br />Right now President Preval does not even know when his new job starts. Although the Constitution called for the inauguration of a new President on February 7, and the latest electoral decree scheduled it for March 29, the inauguration is now held hostage to the second round of legislative elections. The Constitution requires the President to take his oath of office in front of Parliament. The IGH, which was itself installed without Parliament and which ignored constitutional election deadlines in June 2004 and November 2005 as well as the February 7 inauguration deadline, is insisting that it needs a parliament to hand over power. The best likely scenario has the inauguration in early May, three months late and 5% through the Constitutional term. <br /><br /><em>Elusive Victories</em><br /><br />February 7 was the fourth consecutive landslide victory for a Presidential candidate from the Lavalas movement. In any other country, such electoral success would translate into a long period of stability, and an opportunity for the victors to implement the policies they were elected on. Instead, for three of those terms, there have been two coup d'etats leading to five years of exile for the elected President, a nearly perpetual controversy over legislative elections and very little progress on the root causes of Haiti's misery. Time will tell whether President Preval can escape this cycle of instability in the fourth of these terms, but one thing is certain: he and the people who voted for him had better start swimming now.<br /><br /><br /><em>Brian Concannon Jr., Esquire, directs the <a href="http://www.ijdh.org">Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti</a>, and observed several elections in Haiti for the Organization of American States.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/concannon.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='70' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist H.A. Hellyer of the <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/CRER_RC/">Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations</a>, University of Warwick, UK, says that the worldwide controversy over the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad is symptomatic of a new type of tribalism in both East and West ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hishamhellyer.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>E</strong></font>very so often, a word that we all took for granted before as innocuous and innocent takes on a meaning totally unlike what we thought it meant before. Billions of people around the world thought the word &quot;cartoon&quot; was rather harmless until a few weeks ago: but as we will talk about later on, things in this modern world have a way of changing pretty drastically, pretty quickly.<br /><br />The cartoons were first published some months ago, and the jury is still out on two questions:<br /><br />1) Why were they published in the first place?<br />2) What was the impetus behind the protests, considering that for several months, there was virtually no reaction from the Muslim world?<br /><br />These two questions are not meant to be &quot;weapons of mass distraction&quot; from the essential issues, but they are important to note. Can we separate these issues from the socio-political context of Danish Muslims, and the different policies of the Danish government to &quot;integrate&quot; their non-indigenous communities? Can we ignore that there are equally, if not greater, offensive images around the world regarding the Prophet Muhammad, even in Muslim countries, and yet the response has yet to come? Quite apart, it should be pointed out, from the reality that other caricatures of Muslim prophets (such as those shared by Judaism and Christianity) in pictures and plays have become common place in the world today. <br /><br />Again, I bring these questions up not to reject that there are distinct details pertinent to this affair, but in the hope that the mere consideration of this affair will allow us to think more comprehensively on the matter. The real &quot;weapon of mass distraction&quot; in this episode has been the concerted effort by many commentatiors, willfully or otherwise, to over-simplify the topic to the point of no return. <br /><br />From my own vantage point as an academic from a legal and social science background, living in Europe, but with more than a passing familiarity with the resonances in Muslim community, I could not help but think &quot;this is nothing new&quot;. Very little has changed in the past few weeks and months; it&#39;s just another installment in the unending saga of &quot;The Cowardly and the Ugly: Europe and Muslims&quot;.  It&#39;s a re-run of episodes we&#39;ve all seen before.<br /><br />The script writers are really not talking about religion at all. It&#39;s deeper than that; yet again, religious imagery and symbolism has been used to cloak the real matter from our eyes. What is being espoused is symptomatic of an identity crisis, on a massive scale. <br /><br />How Muslims position themselves, vis-a-vis the &quot;West&quot; and Europe in particular. How the &quot;West&quot; positions itself, vis-a-vis the Muslim world, including those parts of the Muslim world that exist within it. <br /><br />None of it is about what Muslims as Muslims stand for, or what Westerners as Westerners stand for; its about what Muslims as contradistinguished from the &quot;West&quot; stand for, and what Westerners as contradistinguished from the Muslim world stand for. <br /><br />[If this is part of the saga about Muslims and Europe, that saga is being played out on a TV channel called &quot;Modernity: The Civilized World Strikes Back&quot;. But more on that later, maybe.]<br /><br />This is not a clash of civilizations, or some sort of &quot;East-West struggle&quot;. How could it be so? Where does the dividing line between the &quot;East&quot; and the &quot;West&quot; begin? Where does it end? How can these mythical constructs be really disparate from one another? The &quot;West&quot; would never have come into being without the &quot;East&quot;; historians have written so much on this that it does not bear going into here. <br /><br />What we might declare is that this is a clash of values. And indeed, that too would follow a common pattern in history. In the Victorian Era, Muslims were demonised by Western Europeans for (get ready for it) giving women too many rights. This was, in the context of the Victorian Era, seen as a bad thing. Now, the tables have turned; Muslims are still bad, but they are bad because they give women too few rights. In both cases, a type of contradistinction is going on. <br /><br />A new type of &quot;tribalism&quot;, where we constantly create ourselves (the &quot;Us&quot;) in contradistinction to someone else (the &quot;Other&quot;), just to promote our own &quot;tribe&quot;, whatever we base it on. And the tribe does not need to be racial; it can be based on any kind of manifestation, but its still a tribe.<br /><br />Our next tool in that regard? The idea of &quot;freedom of speech&quot;. That&#39;s our next one; that&#39;s &quot;our&quot; value, and &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t share it. <br /><br />The reality is, &quot;we&quot; are changing, &quot;they&quot; are in flux, and that sort of change and flux has been a part of history since the dawn of time. Unlike previous times, however, modernity really speeds it up.<br /><br />The cartoons provoked a lot of rage. What a surprise; they were gratuitous, insulting, and legitimately seen as provocation. Certainly the publishers did not envisage this sort of reaction, but while the rage might not have been predictable, the type of unwarranted attack certainly was. It follows a pattern of demonisation and bigotry that has a track record in many parts (albeit not all) of the European Union. Whereas in Europe&#39;s recent past, it was acceptable to be racist, it no longer is. But it is, however, still acceptable in many quarters to be Islamophobic, and now many people have switched. <br /><br />Abu Hamza, the radical Muslim demagogue in London, has recently been convicted of inciting to hatred. Nick Griffin, the leader of the far-right British National Party, on trial in a separate case, has not been convicted, although he called Islam a &quot;wicked and evil religion&quot;. If he had called Muslims a wicked and evil race, he would have been convicted. He&#39;s smarter than that.<br /><br />But that&#39;s by the by. The reality is, none of this was about some mythical value of &quot;freedom of speech&quot;: in every European country, there are laws limiting certain types of freedom of expression. In every European country, there are civic limits imposed by society (in other non-legal measures) that limit freedom of expression, depending on the cultural history of that place. We may disagree with some parts of the taboo, but the undeniable fact is: we do have taboos. And in the 21st century, the European Union, a Europe that has always been changing and continues to change, will change what it considers to be taboo again, taking into account its new citizenry, as well it should. <br /><br />In terms of this particular case, it may be that the publisher did not break any Danish law. He did not. But he broke higher civic conduct; to act responsibly and not needlessly offend people&#39;s sensitivities. This was never about &quot;freedom of speech&quot;; it was about what we, as a people, define as &quot;sacred&quot;. <br /><br />There may be no law about showing mutilated soldiers on TV; but British television networks knew that to screen such events in Iraq would be incredibly insensitive, not least of all to the families of those involved. They declined to break that civic trust. <br /><br />In this specific episode, the hypocrisy is most evident when one co
nsiders that in the past, the same publisher rejected publishing cartoons about Christ on the basis that it would cause uproar, and rejected recently publishing cartoons demeaning the Holocaust for the same reason.<br /><br />So where are we now?<br /><br />We have a Muslim world that is enraged. These cartoons were, as mentioned above, not just pictures, but insults. Pictures of the prophet alone are taboo in the Muslim mind; for most, it is seen as one step closer to idolatry, and the Muslims are nothing if not monotheistic. Professor Yahya Michot from Oxford points out that it is the absence of the depiction of the sacred that is most important to the Muslim, whilst it is presence of the depiction of the sacred that is most important to other communities. <br /><br />Nevertheless, it is hard to reconcile the reaction with their stated purpose. &quot;Hands off our Prophet! We will uphold his honor!&quot; I certainly have no standing as some sort of religious authority, whether in Islam or otherwise. Yet, it struck me that as the rioters attacked embassies, the Prophet honored ambassadors. Whilst the rioters were enraged, the Prophet typically responded to attacks with kindness and forbearance, whether he was in a position of outward weakness (such as the Meccan period) or in a position of political authority (such as the conquest of Mecca). <br /><br />This is the man who, it must be said, had garbage thrown at him in Mecca regularly by one particular lady. Nevertheless, his response was to call on her when she ceased to throw rubbish at him, out of concern for her health. <br /><br />This is the man who made supplication for the people of Ta&#39;if, when they had turned their children on him to stone him. <br /><br />This is the man whose uncle was assassinated and mutilated in a horrific way by one individual in Mecca: but an individual whom he pardoned when he conquered that city in one bloodless victory.<br /><br />That was the law of the Prophet, and that was the way he upheld his own honor; how have the rioters upheld the law he brought, let alone his honor?<br /><br />This is what I mean when I insist that these responses have more to do with tribalism than faith. Faith-based responses are not without example; the Birmingham based remembrance of the life of the Prophet went without any violence whatsoever. The celebrations of the Prophet&#39;s life in Zanzibar in East Africa; the massive demonstration in London on the 18th of February; the imminent commemoration of the birth of the Prophet in different parts of Scandinavia; all of these bringing to bear on the Muslims the nature of the Prophetic character. Perhaps not one but two steps ahead of the game was the declaration in connection with one of the marches of a campaign for &quot;Global Civility&quot;: bringing a sense of decorum back to discourse. Whatever took us so long? <br /><br />In this modern world where identity and tribalism are extreme under other names, these sorts of approaches that defy the illogic of such tomfoolery need to be considered very carefully. The beginning of any type of tribalism, and hence, the beginning of the end, is when someone believes &quot;I am better than him&quot;. <br /><br />That kind of wicked and mischievous logic is not going to be rejected by everyone, but it has to be transcended by more people if we have a hope in this world. The perennial truths of Western civilization and the truth of the Prophetic message demand no less.<br />   <br /><br /><em>Dr. H.A.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/staff/academic/joyner/">Daniel Joyner</a> of the University of Warwick School of Law in the United Kingdom says that now that Iran has been referred to the UN Security Council over its nuclear program, some Council action under Chapter VII of the UN Charter seems likely, but it&#39;s difficult to see what would come of that use of authority other than international armed conflict...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/danieljoyner.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n February 4, 2006 the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors decided to refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council, escalating the crisis over Iran's nuclear program, and opening the possibility of an authorization of economic sanctions or even of military force by the Security Council.  <br /><br />How have we gotten to this point, and why? This essay will attempt to provide a brief procedural history of the Iranian nuclear standoff with the IAEA and the West, and a review of international legal issues in the current crisis.  It will also briefly discuss what is likely to happen procedurally from here.<br /><br />In late 2002, the world learned from Iranian opposition groups that Iran had concealed from the IAEA for 18 years the existence of facilities at Natanz and Arak engaged in work on the nuclear fuel cycle. <br /><br />The IAEA Board of Governors reached the conclusion in a Resolution passed November 26, 2003 that, due to this concealment and to other reporting omissions, Iran had "in a number of instances" failed to meet its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA, which it is obligated to maintain pursuant to Article III of the 1968 Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT).  <br /><br />However, Iran has maintained that all of its work with fissile materials and related technologies, including work at these hidden sites, has been aimed at furthering its capacity to produce nuclear energy.  Therefore, they argue, notwithstanding these procedural reporting requirements they have always been in fundamental compliance with their substantive obligations under the NPT.  <br /><br />In this argument, they rely on Article IV(1) of the NPT which provides that<blockquote>Nothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes...</blockquote>And indeed, Article IV(2) goes on to provide that <blockquote>All the Parties to the Treaty undertake to facilitate, and have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Parties to the Treaty in a position to do so shall also cooperate in contributing alone or together with other States or international organizations to the further development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in the territories of Non-Nuclear-Weapon States Party to the Treaty, with due consideration for the needs of the developing areas of the world.</blockquote>In terms of the "Grand Bargain" codified by the NPT, this obligation on the part of all NPT member states to assist particularly Non-Nuclear-Weapon States (NNWS) in developing nuclear energy production capacity, forms the fundamental consideration in exchange for which NNWS promise in Article II not to develop or accept assistance in developing nuclear weapons.<br /><br />However, suspicions have become widespread particularly among Western states, that Iran does indeed have nuclear weapons ambitions, and that particularly the uranium enrichment work which Iran has carried out is intended not solely for use in peaceful energy production, but for the creation of nuclear weapons.  <br /><br />This suspicion has been made more poignant in recent months due to the accession of Mahmoud Ahmedinejad to the Iranian Presidency. His radical reforms of government policy and personnel, along with his repeated threatening remarks toward Israel, have understandably raised concerns among the governments of the West regarding the potential of a nuclear-armed Iran.<br /><br />However, IAEA inspectors have found no conclusive evidence to support allegations of a clandestine nuclear weapons program in Iran.<br /><br />Despite this lack of evidence of a weapons program, the IAEA Board of Governors took the decision on February 4 to refer Iran's case to the U.N. Security Council.  This referral, without a supporting report by IAEA inspectors providing evidence that Iran is in breach of its substantive NPT obligations, or that it is in continuing breach of its IAEA Safeguards Agreement, has led to criticism of the Board's decision as premature, as well as to some speculation that this decision of the IAEA Board is <em>ultra vires</em> its authority under Article XII(7)(c) of the IAEA Statute.<br /><br />Iran had insisted previous to this decision that it would cease all voluntary cooperation with the IAEA if it was referred to the Security Council.  This had reference to a cessation of compliance with its commitments under the IAEA Additional Protocol, which allows for unscheduled inspections of nuclear facilities and more comprehensive surveillance of facilities.  Commitments under the IAEA Additional Protocol are voluntary in the sense that maintenance of an Additional Protocol with the IAEA is not a legal requirement under the NPT. <br /><br />Since February 4th, Iran has taken concrete steps toward this end, asking the IAEA in a letter to remove all of its surveillance equipment from Iran's nuclear facilities by mid-February, and stating that all IAEA inspections must be scheduled, per the general Safeguards Agreement standards. On February 14, it was reported that Iran had resumed uranium enrichment.  <br /><br />Also worryingly, on February 11, Iranian President Ahmadinejad reportedly stated that if compulsory measures against Iran were pursued, a revision of Iran's commitment to the NPT itself would be considered.<br /><br />Now that the matter has been referred to the U.N. Security Council, next steps are unclear.  It has been agreed that the Security Council will take no action on the Iran case until IAEA Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei presents a "detailed" report on Iran's compliance with its Safeguards Agreement to the IAEA Board on March 6.<br /><br />After that, the Security Council may begin discussions regarding what steps, if any, it will authorize to address the situation.  In terms of its own powers to authorize action, pursuant to the U.N. Charter, Chapter VII, Article 39 the Security Council may "determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken . . . to maintain or restore international peace and security."<br /><br />Once the Security Council has made the determination that a threat to international peace and security exists under Article 39, it may authorize non-forceful action by U.N. member states under Article 41, most notably including economic sanctions. <br /><br />It is unclear whether there will be sufficient political will among members of the Security Council to take this step, however.  Russia and China particularly have in their official statements, been reluctant to discuss the possibility of sanctions, leading some to suggest that, while both Russia and China supported the IAEA decision to refer Iran to the Security Council, they will be unwilling for the Council to impose sanctions under Chapter VII. Both Russia and China are permanent members of the Security Council, and have an effective veto over any decision of the Council.<br /><br />It is noteworthy to recall in this context also that Iran has warned th
at if sanctions are imposed by that the Council, Iran will take steps to significantly increase world oil prices.<br /><br />If the Security Council decides that measures authorized under Article 41 of Chapter VII are "inadequate" to restore international peace and security, it may under Article 42 of Chapter VII authorize U.N. members to take collective military action.<br /><br />The prospect of U.N. authorized military action against Iran does seem quite remote at this stage.  Not only would further evidence of a nuclear weapons program, or some other act of hostility first need to be presented to members of the Council to garner enough votes for passage of such a resolution, but there are also significant questions regarding the capacity of Western militaries to devote resources already stretched, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, to another major military operation in Iran.<br /><br />However, with the defiant posture of the Iranian government regarding the institutional escalation of the situation to the Security Council, it is difficult to foresee a resolution to the current crisis which does not include the Council exercising its authority under Chapter VII.  It is also, however, difficult to predict that any outcome short of international armed conflict would result from such an exercise of authority.  The Iranian nuclear crisis, indeed, presents the most critical threat to international peace and security since the Iraq WMD crisis of 2002-2003.<br /><br /><br /><em>Daniel Joyner is a Lecturer in Law at the University of Warwick School of Law in the United Kingdom, where he writes and researches in the area of proliferation studies.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wallachlegal.com/">Ian Wallach</a>, habeas counsel for several Guantanamo Bay detainees, says that the US Executive Branch may have engaged in questionable acts and disseminated inaccurate information to encourage Senate passage of provisions in the Detainee Treatment Act preventing federal judges from seeing problematic evidence on why detainees are being held...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/ianwallach.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>H</strong></font>abeas actions are getting a lot of media attention lately.  The unfortunate American military conduct in Abu Ghraib has begun to raise questions about the treatment of prisoners at the US Navy detention facility in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay, Cuba, where incidents of torture and abuse have been reported and largely ignored over the past four years.  The habeas question looms large on the heels of two recently-published case studies (by the <em>National Journal</em> and the Seton Hall University School of Law) that suggest that the majority of people held in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo are innocent, and the report by the United Nations seeking the closure of the facility.  Americans seem split on whether federal judges should be involved at all.  Some people want judges to be able to investigate whether the military is holding people for valid reasons, while others think that -- in a time of war -- how the military conducts itself is a matter for the President only, and judges' interference might impair the President's ability to protect America. <br /><br />  On the litigation front the dispute is largely the same, with <em>pro bono</em> habeas counsel on one side, and the Department of Justice, counsel to the Executive Branch, on the other.  But in Congress, the dispute embodied itself in the passage and potential application of the Detainee Treatment Act (the "DTA") -- a part of the defense spending bill signed into law on December 30, 2005.  Detainees' counsel (such as me) thought the DTA was only going to stop future cases.  The Executive Branch now maintains that the DTA knocks out pending cases too.  The matter is before both the United States Supreme Court and the DC Circuit Court (argument is currently scheduled to take place before the Circuit Court on March 22nd).  <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/12/detainee-treatment-act-of-2005-white.php">Detainee Treatment Act of 2005</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /> This article will examine the timing and language used in Congress by those in support of, and against, the DTA, and try to answer three questions:  <ol><li>Was the timing of the events regarding, and coinciding with, the passage the DTA significant?  <br /><br /><li>Were representations made in support of the DTA accurate, and why were some representations repeated with such frequency? and;<br /> <br /><li>When Congress voted on the DTA, did most members believe they were voting to dismiss not only future habeas actions, but also those pending?</ol>At this juncture, brief explanations of key terms might be helpful for some readers.<ul><li>"Habeas" is short for habeas corpus -- Latin for "you have the body."  It is a rule that emerged in the 13th Century and one that has been written into the Magna Carta.  In essence, it means that if a government holds someone, it must state why, and can't hold a person indefinitely and without charge.  Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) provided a concise, clear definition of habeas to the Senate:<blockquote>All we are saying is if a court receives a petition from an individual who is being held prisoner and determines that there is a problem or a potential problem, that court does have authority to go ahead and issue an order which is a writ saying bring that individual here and justify the imprisonment of this individual.</blockquote><li>"Right to habeas" is a misleading phrase.  Habeas is not a "right" that one acquires by being an American citizen.  It is a right that one acquires by being held by American citizens.  In the Constitution, "habeas" is not mentioned in the Bill of Rights, or in any of the later amendments that clarify the rights of US citizens.  It is written into the Suspension Clause -- and is a limitation on congressional power.  Under the Constitution, Congress can only remove habeas in times of "rebellion" or "invasion".  And there is also a qualifier -- when there is a rebellion or invasion, Congress can only remove habeas if "the public safety may require it." <br /><br /><li>"Habeas action" means an action brought on behalf of someone in the custody of a government.  In this article, "habeas action" refers to one or more of the approximately 180 habeas actions pending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  It is important to clarify that a Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo habeas action does not involve defending people accused of committing acts of terrorism.  Instead, these actions seek to have a presidentially-appointed federal judge see the reasons why the military is holding someone.  The parties in habeas actions are asking a judge to tell a government to either charge someone in their custody or let that person go.  A habeas action seeks to stop a government from holding someone indefinitely without explanation.<br /><br /><li>"Habeas counsel" means, in this article, the approximately 500 attorneys from firms across the nation who are donating their time and expense ("pro bono" which means "for the good") to bring habeas actions, in cooperation with the <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>.  <br /><br /><li>"Rasul" refers to <em>Rasul v. Bush</em>, the 2004 Supreme Court ruling that those in the custody of the United States and being detained in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay have a right to bring a habeas action.</ul><center>*          *          *</center><br />Friday, November 11, 2005, was a National Holiday -- Veterans Day.  On the previous morning of November 10, the Executive Branch brought motions in the detainee habeas actions pending in DC District Court seeking to stay (temporarily stop) them until certain allegedly-related procedural issues were resolved on appeal. <br /><br /> Later that evening, near the end of the Senate session and before the Senate retired for the holiday weekend, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced a proposed amendment that explicitly stated that all pending and future Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo habeas actions would be dismissed.  No committee meetings were held and the vote took place late in the day.  Senator Bingaman twice noted what he perceived as the impropriety of vanquishing a fundamental right, without hearings, on a Thursday evening before a holiday weekend:<blockquote>This is an extremely serious issue.  There have been no hearings on this issue in the Judiciary Committee.  I s
ee the chairman of the Judiciary Committee on the Senate floor this afternoon.  If we are going to seriously consider suspending the privilege of habeas corpus, of filing a petition for habeas corpus, the Judiciary Committee should be the committee that considers that type of a proposal and has hearings on it.<br /><br />There have been no hearings in the Armed Services Committee. It would be a terrible mistake for us to do this sort of as a by-the-way kind of amendment on a Thursday afternoon as we are preparing to leave for the weekend&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;.<br /><br />It is an extraordinary step for this Congress to be taking as an amendment to the Defense bill.  This is an issue that should be dealt with in the Judiciary Committee.  Senator Specter has spoken against the amendment.  Senator Levin has spoken against the amendment. Senator Leahy has spoken against the amendment.  It is something that requires hearings. It is a very important issue, and we should not be dealing with it here on a late evening on Thursday as part of this authorization bill.</blockquote>Still, the amendment passed by a vote of 49 - 42.<br /><br /> During the three-day Veterans Day weekend that followed, opposition to the amendment gathered steam.  And so did an opposition to that opposition.   On Monday, November 14, Senator Bingaman introduced an amendment that expressly allowed all pending and future Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo actions to go forward.  And Senator Graham introduced an amendment -- called "In the Nature of a Substitute" -- that was intended to replace the amendment that passed the previous Thursday.  Senator Graham's new amendment, now endorsed by senior Democrat Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), was very different.  Notably, the new "Effective Date" section removed the language that called for the dismissal of pending habeas actions.  <br /><br /> Senator Bingaman's amendment lost.  A few minutes before the vote on Senator Graham's substituted amendment, Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) described his understanding of it:<blockquote>As a supporter of the Graham-Levin amendment, let me state my understanding of several important issues.  First, I agree with Senator Levin that his amendment does not divest the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to hear the pending case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.  I believe the Effective Date provision of the amendment is properly understood to leave pending Supreme Court cases unaffected.  It would be highly irregular for the Congress to interfere in the work of the Supreme Court in this fashion, and the amendment should not be read to do so.</blockquote>Senator Graham's substituted amendment passed, this time with a vote of 84 - 14.<br /><br /> The amendment went to the House for approval where it was "held at the desk", which means the House could use it to further a bill already pending.  And there was.  H.R. 2863 would eventually become the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, and would eventually incorporate parts of this amendment.  <br /><br /> In the House, the amendment was revised and changes were made primarily regarding the judicial review of determinations by "Combatant Status Review Tribunals" -- tribunals where the military decides if someone is an "enemy combatant".  But the "Effective Date" language stayed the same.  The amendment became Section 1005(e) of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, and part of what is now known as the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA).  The vote on the entire Appropriations Act was scheduled for December 21, 2005.  Minutes before the vote took place, Senator Durbin (D-IL) said this:<blockquote>A critical feature of this amendment is that it is forward looking.  A law purporting to require a Federal Court to give up its jurisdiction over a case that is submitted and awaiting decision would raise grave constitutional questions.  The amendment's jurisdiction-stripping provisions clearly do not apply to pending cases, including the <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> case, which is currently pending before the Supreme Court.  In accordance with our traditions, this amendment does not apply retroactively to revoke the jurisdiction of the courts to consider pending claims invoking the Great Writ of Habeas Corpus challenging past enemy combatant determinations reached without the safeguards this amendment requires for future determinations.  The amendment alters the original language introduced by Senator Graham so that those pending cases are not affected by this provision.</blockquote>The Act (and the DTA it contained) passed with a vote of 93 - 0.  <br /><br /> The President signed the bill into law on December 30, 2005.  On January 4, 2006, the Executive Branch notified the DC District Court that it intended to move to dismiss all the pending habeas actions based on the DTA.<br /><br /> The chronology raises questions.  Normally, a motion to stay an action -- on the grounds of potentially-related procedural issues on appeal -- is of no great import.  But in this case, the original motion to stay was filed by the Executive Branch, in apparently every pending case, on the same day - November 10 - that Senator Graham introduced legislation seeking to stop those pending cases.  Perhaps this was coincidental.  Or perhaps it was part of a coordinated effort to nullify the Supreme Court's ruling in <em>Rasul</em>, and stop courts from seeing the evidence, or lack of it, regarding why people are being kept in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.<br /><br /> Consider the abundance of recent case studies revealing that the majority of people being held in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo are innocent.  The Seton Hall study found, among other conclusions, that 55% of those being detained have not been determined by the Executive Branch to have committed any hostile acts against the US or its allies, that only 8% have been characterized by the Executive Branch as having ties to al Queda, and 18% have been characterized by the Executive Branch has having no ties to either al Qaeda or the Taliban.  The Seton Hall study also found that only 5% of detainees were captured by US forces (the rest being captured by Pakistani and Afghani forces that were paid by the US to bring in anyone with suspected al Qaeda or Taliban ties).  The study also found that several deemed "not enemy combatants" had more serious charges against them than many later deemed enemy combatants.  And many are being kept merely on grounds of affiliation with groups that even the Department of Homeland Security has not placed on its watch-list.  <br /><br />  If these facts and studies are correct, the Executive Branch faced a "lose big versus gain little" scenario with regard to habeas actions.  If a judge was to see evidence against a detainee, and the evidence was strong, then detention would continue.  The only upside for the Executive Branch would be affirmation for doing its job.  But what if the judges were to see the information and it was weak (as the Seton Hall and <em>National Journal</em> case studies have shown to be true in most cases)?  Then the Executive Branch would look irresponsible and malevolent, and would likely need to release the detainee.  And if the Executive Branch's concerns later proved true -- and the detainee, once released, actually became a threat -- then the Executive Branch would be responsible.  <br /><br /> So, knowing this battle was coming, and standing in the shoes of the Executive Branch, the best program -- as unsettling as it may be -- might have been to orchestrate and pursue a plan to keep judges away from the evidence.  <br /><br /> If we accept the possibility that these events were coordinated, then that possibility becomes stronger in light of the timing:  The motions to stay were filed in the morning of November 10.  The original amendment was introduced that evening, right before the Senate adjourned for a three-day holiday.  As we shall see below, the terms "suing our troops" was used throughout the effort to pass the amendment (although, again as discussed below, no troops have ever been sued or could be sued under <em>Rasul</em> or the habeas statute).  "Keeping our troops free from lawsuits" sounds like
 a good way to support them.  And what could possibly be the best day to show support for our troops?  Perhaps the day before Veterans Day.    <br /><br /> The timing in which the Act was executed may be suspect, and reveals an eagerness on the part of the Executive Branch to try to dismiss pending cases.  The President signed the bill into law on Friday, December 30, 2005.  The next business day was Tuesday, January 4.  And the Department of Justice filed papers in the pending habeas actions -- informing the Court of its intent to dismiss them -- on Wednesday, January 5.  The Department of Justice's document used to dismiss is 11 pages long and its substantive text is a single paragraph.  But formatting the document, which lists every pending action, would normally take at least a day, if not more, to prepare and approve (however, the Department of Justice was aware that the bill had passed as of December 21, 2005, and would be signed, and may very well have had the documents ready).<br /><br /> On one hand, it's possible that the Executive Branch's request the morning of November 10, asking the Court to stand back until procedural issues are resolved on appeal, and Senator Graham's introduction of legislation to stop those same habeas actions made that evening, were separate incidents that occurred on the same day by coincidence.  And maybe it is irrelevant that it happened the day before Veterans Day.  Or perhaps the chronology of these events, and the quickness in which the Department of Justice sought to dismiss the actions, suggests that there is a plan underway to keep the Executive Branch from ever having to show what evidence, if any, it has.<br /><br /> Throughout the efforts to pass the DTA, some questionable representations were made to the Senate, including, for example, that the press has access to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo (while a limited number of special visits to certain areas of Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay have been allowed, the author is not aware of any press interviews of detainees or the soldiers in charge of their detention).  <br /><br /> But three separate phrases, or paraphrases thereof, appeared repeatedly.  These were (1) [Don't give terrorists] "the same rights as U.S. citizens"; (2) [Stop allowing terrorists to] "sue our troops"; and (3) [Don't open up] "floodgates of litigation".  The accuracy of these statements leaves room for doubt.  But their effectiveness does not.  <br /><br /> I hear the phrase "terrorists shouldn't have the same rights as U.S. citizens" from colleagues and clients.  It's become part of our parlance.  Versions of this statement were used repeatedly throughout the passage of the DTA, and here are some examples:<ul><li>"If you want to give a Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay detainee habeas corpus rights as a US citizen&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;. (Sen. Graham, Nov. 10, 2006).<br /><br /><li> "Of all the people in the world who should enjoy the same rights of an American citizen in Federal Court, the people at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay are the last we should confer it on" (Sen. Graham, Nov. 10, 2006).<br /><br /><li>"So let's be very clear about this Great Writ.  It does not apply to terrorists, and it should not apply to terrorists, and nothing in this amendment goes any further than to say it applies to US citizens.  It does not apply to terrorists." (Sen. Kyl, Nov. 10, 2006)<br /><br /><li>"But the Writ of habeas corpus, which was never intended to apply to prisoners of war, much less terrorists, does not apply in this case" (Sen. Kyl, Nov. 10, 2006).</ul>I agree that terrorists should not have the same rights as U.S. citizens.  But citizenship and habeas are unrelated concepts.  <br /><br /> Habeas is not a right one acquires by virtue of being a US citizen -- it is a right one acquires when held by US citizens.  Unless you are reading this from a prison cell, or in a squad car, or in any other detention facility, you do not have a right to habeas.  Even if you are a US citizen. <br /><br /> What makes this the above sound-bite even more troubling is that it presumes that those held in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo are terrorists, even though they have not been tried, or charged, or told why they are being held.  And the majority of information available suggests that most detainees are completely innocent.  Even the Department of Defense concedes it has locked up innocent individuals (according to a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article, "American Commanders acknowledge that many of the prisoners shouldn't have been locked up here in the first place because they weren't dangerous and didn't know anything of value.  'Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks,' says Brig. Gen. Jay Hood." Christopher Cooper, Detention Plan:  In Guantanamo, Prisoners Languish in a Sea of Red Tape, <em>Wall St. J.</em>, Jan. 26, 2005).  The argument that "those terrorists shouldn't have the same rights as U.S. citizens" is circular and irrelevant to the issue.  But it was effective.<br /><br />Another repeated sound-bite was "protecting our troops from frivolous lawsuits".  The idea that troops could be sued was repeatedly presented to the Senate.  Senator Graham made the following statements to the Senate on Nov. 10, 2005 (and similar ones later):<ul><li>"What I am concerned about is that an enemy prisoner, not someone charged with a crime, is having access to Federal courts to sue our own troops about the food, about the mail, about whether they should have Internet access, about whether they should get DVDs."<br /><br /><li>"Here is the question I will ask every Member of this body:  Does the Senate want enemy terrorists, al-Qaida members being detained at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay, to have unlimited access to our Federal courts to sue our troops about the following&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;."<br /><br /><li>"But I will not now or ever sit on the sidelines and give rights to enemy combatants who have been caught on the battlefield in the war of terror the unending, endless right to think of every reason in the world to take our own troops into court."<br /><br /><li>"I do not want everyone to have habeas rights.  I do not want the enemy combatant al-Qaeda terrorist to be able to go in our courts and start to sue our own troops.  I don&#39;t want it.  I don&#39;t think people in this body want it."<br /><br /><li>"[if] the American value system [is one] that [allows] people who are trying to kill you unfettered access to the Federal courts to sue your own troops, if that becomes our value, we are going to lose this war."</ul>But the "sue the troops" representation is completely false.  A habeas action is not brought against an individual soldier -- it is brought against an entity holding someone.  A troop cannot be sued in a habeas action.  Nothing in <em>Rasul</em> or in the habeas statute allows a soldier to be sued.  And to this author's knowledge, no soldier has ever been called as a witness in a habeas action.  Even the abominable acts that occurred in Abu Ghraib -- which were photographed -- have not (to my knowledge) resulted in federal court civil actions against the perpetrators, and the same holds true for documented abuses in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo (see Jane Mayer, &quot;The Memo, how an internal effort to ban the abuse and torture of detainees was thwarted,&quot; <em>The New Yorker</em>, February 27, 2006).<br />  <br /> However, the idea that there is a connection between habeas and suing troops sounds good and believable.  Every American supports the troops.  And everyone hates lawsuits.  Combining those two contemporary sentiments may have been a clever means to raise support for a bill designed to protect the Executive Branch from showing its evidence.<br /> <br /> In addition, the term "floodgates of litigation", or a nearly-identical substitute, was used at least ten times to get the amendment passed.   One example is a collection of letters introduced by Senator Graham to combat letters introduced by Senator Bingaman.<br /><br />To challenge the jurisdiction-stripping parts of Senator Graham's amendment, Senator Bingaman introduced five well-reasoned independent letters gathered over the
 weekend from educational groups and current and former members of the military and judiciary.  The majority of these letters were independently drafted and -- while sharing a common theme (i.e., don't deprive habeas) and common concerns -- did not share identical language.  And one letter was jointly signed by 10 current and former members of the military who shared a singular opinion. <br /><br /> By contrast, Senator Graham also introduced a collection of eight letters.  However, seven of these letters contained virtually identical language.

First, these letters were from military officials commenting on the civilian legal system.  Military officials' interests are not affected by habeas actions.  One wouldn't ask military leaders about what makes civilian hospitals more or less efficient, so why is the Senate listening to military leaders talk about what makes civilian courts more or less efficient?  Military leaders don't have expertise on how the laws or the courts function.  <br /><br />  The letters introduced by Senator Bingaman from military leaders talked about the importance of habeas to the military -- an issue with which military leaders clearly have familiarity.  But the letters introduced by Senator Graham from military leaders talked about the efficiency of the federal court system, an issue with which military leaders have no expertise.<br /><br />  The other -- more apparent -- problem with these letters is the clear "cut and paste" circulation of the content, a common practice perhaps, but in this instance, one that demonstrates a party line that is simply inaccurate.  Allowing habeas will not, by any means, generate a "floodgate of litigation".  As of February 17, 2006, there were approximately 5,287 cases pending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  And approximately 180 of those were Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo habeas actions.  The cases that amount to the alleged "floodgates" comprise point zero three four percent (.034%) of the cases pending in that Court.  <br /><br />But more appropriate math would take into consideration Senator Graham's statement that "there are 160 habeas corpus petitions in Federal Courts throughout the United States."  To my knowledge, there are about 180 habeas petitions, all of which were filed in one court -- the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  If we assume that Senator Graham is correct and cases could be brought "throughout the United States", then the math gets even less "floodgate" like. The DC District Court is a busy court.  If we assume every District Court in the nation is half as active as the DC District Court and has only 2,643 cases, and if there are 94 District Courts, then there would be a total of about 248,442 (2,643 times 94) cases in federal courts.  The 180 habeas actions would comprise about point zero zero zero seven two four five percent (.0007245%) of the Courts' cases.<br /><br /> Another issue is whether the Senators thought the DTA stopped pending habeas actions when they voted for it.  For the majority, it seems the short answer is no.  The amendment that the Senate voted on, on November 15, contained the "Effective Date" language that removed the "pending actions" language from the earlier version.  Right before the vote, Senator Reid clarified that the amendment was not intended to nullify pending actions.  No one said otherwise, and the amendment passed with a vote of 84 - 14.  In December, the Act containing the DTA was before the Senate, and contained the identical "Effective Date" language regarding habeas petitions.  Just before the vote, Senator Durbin clarified that it was not intended to apply to pending habeas petitions.  No one said otherwise.  And the bill passed.  <br /><br /> Later, aft
er the vote, Senators Graham and Kyl made statements that the bill was intended to shut down pending habeas actions (Senator Levin has repeatedly gone on record -- before and after the vote -- stating that the DTA was not intended to apply to actions that were pending when the bill was signed into law). <br /><br /> But the Executive Branch recently argued to the US Supreme Court that it doesn't matter whether the Senators believed, or did not believe, that the DTA was intended to apply to pending actions.  The Executive Branch argues that the DTA's "Effective Date" section is irrelevant, and what matters is the blanket statement in the DTA that courts lack jurisdiction to hear habeas actions brought by Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees.<br /><br /> It is hard to figure out what any of this means.  Will detainees -- who have been held for four years -- ever get the right of judicial review promised in the <em>Rasul</em> case?  That depends on so many factors, including how or if the Supreme Court decides the issue on the DTA and how the DC Circuit Court addresses it.  And even if the judiciary determines that habeas still exists for Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay detainees, past experience shows that the Executive Branch may be unwilling to give effect to what the judiciary says.<br /><br /> If there are lessons to be learned, they are difficult ones.  For example, consider the misinformation disseminated and the tactics used by those who don't want judicial involvement in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.  Irrelevant, untruthful, yet catchy sound-bites were repeated.  Silence was used when appropriate -- there were brief moments of time between the statements made to the Senate that the DTA was not intended to apply to pending actions (by Senator Reid and in November and Senator Durbin in December) and the Senate votes.  Yet Senators Graham and Kyl said nothing after these statements were made, let the bill pass, and then later argued that it applied to pending actions.  And the introduction of the legislation appears to have been coordinated with the filing of allegedly-unrelated papers in the pending habeas actions.  <br /><br /> These factors suggest that an effective plan may be underway to stop judges, and American citizens, from learning what our leaders are doing in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, and what they are doing to those held there.  <br /><br /> On the other hand, Senator Bingaman's approach of presenting factually-accurate logical arguments proved ineffective.  But what if Senator Bingaman had used irrelevant, untruthful, yet catchy sound-bites to accomplish his goal?  What if Senator Bingaman -- instead of detailing the historical proof that establishes that denying habeas is bad practice (like the Japanese Internment), and instead of trying to show that denying habeas can hurt, and not help, soldiers -- he had instead said things like "the Nazis persecuted men of a single faith.  Slobodan Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; did the same.  Do we want to act like Nazis?  Do we want to act like Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225;?", and then repeated "I think not.  I think we are better than Nazis!  I think we are better than Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225;!"  Or what if Senator Bingaman quoted the Bible, and said something like "the Gospel of St. Matthew contains God's mandate that we visit and care for those imprisoned, and the Constitution itself gives Americans the obligation to give habeas to those in our custody and control.  Are we just going to ignore the words of God and our founding fathers?"<br /><br />Or what if Senator Bingaman had stretched the truth, like those supporting the amendment had done in the Senate?    For a while, 8-year olds were being detained in Guantanamo (though, to my knowledge, the children have been released).  And we know that some detainees died as a result of the conduct of US soldiers.  One could combine these truths and make a stretched but plausible statement that the US was responsible for the deaths of children in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.  What if Senator Bingaman had said "Eight year old boys!  This amendment allows American Soldiers to kill eight-year old boys in their custody, and not be held accountable!  Are we going stand idly by while our brothers kill and torture children?  Is that what America is about?  Is that what any Senator in this room wants?  Should we let American soldiers commit crimes that would put American citizens in jail?  I don't think so."<br /><br /> I hope those who see the importance of habeas never need to stoop to using unrelated, irrelevant, but potentially-motivating catch-phrases to protect fundamental civil liberties.  Thankfully, we still have a lot to lose.  But maybe those who truly value these rights can learn from how this legislation was passed and how it is being used, and use similar tools, if necessary, the next time that such a right is in jeopardy.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Ian Wallach of <a href="http://www.wallachlegal.com/">Wallach Law Offices, P.C.</a> is an attorney with a private practice in California and New York.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=35">Nancy Rapoport</a>, dean of the University of Houston Law Center, says that as we watch witnesses at the trial of former Enron executives Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling continue to testify about Enron&#39;s earnings management, we should ask ourselves if we&#39;re really all that different from the defendants when we &quot;manage&quot; numbers in other contexts....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/nancyrapoport.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he criminal trial of Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling continues this week, and once again, I find myself enjoying the role of a &quot;talking head&quot; on such disparate programs as our local public radio station and AlJazeera (an out-of-body experience if ever there was one).  I&#39;ve been following the testimony obsessively, and the latest round of witnesses have been spending a lot of time talking about Skilling&#39;s directives to &quot;hit the numbers&quot; in order to keep Enron afloat.  I&#39;m not sure what the jury is thinking, but I do know that &quot;hitting the numbers&quot; is hardly a novel idea for corporations - or for law schools, for that matter.<br /><br />            What exactly does &quot;hitting the numbers&quot; mean?  In its benign form, &quot;hitting the numbers&quot; should mean that a company does what it&#39;s supposed to do:  make a profitable product, provide a profitable service, etc., so that customers keep the company comfortably in the black.  Unfortunately, not all companies hit the numbers by (and forgive the mixed metaphor) sticking to their knitting.  Others tie the truth up in knots in order to hit their numbers - and Enron was one such company.  <br /><br />            People forget that Enron&#39;s &quot;black box&quot; approach to the numbers fooled some of the people all of the time, and some of the people not at all.  In researching an article that my husband and I wrote [<a href="#1">1</a>], we discovered that certain analysts and reporters were not impressed by Enron&#39;s habit of rescuing itself from financial disaster at the end of quarters or fiscal years [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Bethany McLean, of <em>Smartest Guys in the Room</em> fame [<a href="#3">3</a>], reported on Enron&#39;s end-of-quarter/end-of-fiscal-year game long before Enron started to spiral toward bankruptcy [<a href="#4">4</a>].  In essence, McLean observed that Enron&#39;s cash flow was flowing the wrong direction (downward, and fast) for the timing of the deals to be coincidental [<a href="#5">5</a>].<br /><br />            The pressure to make the numbers at Enron was likely a direct link to the departure of Rich Kinder, who left the Enron presidency and formed Kinder Morgan.  While Kinder was Enron&#39;s president, he paid attention to cash flow - he minded the numbers the old-fashioned way, by making sure that input exceeded outflow.  After he left, Enron&#39;s extravagant spending went way up, and no one was monitoring whether there was enough money in the bank to pay for those expenses.  <br /><br />            Not only was no one minding Enron&#39;s cash flow, but Enron was rewarding its employees on paper profits booked when the deals were signed - not on actual profits over the life of the deals.  So &quot;money out&quot; (including bonuses) bore less and less relationship to &quot;money in.&quot;  Is it any surprise that Enron needed to &quot;manage&quot; its numbers in the less-benign sense?<br /><br />            Sure, it would have been better to manage the numbers by managing the business:  to stop doing the deals that were bad ideas from the start, such as the brokering of &quot;unused&quot; broadband space and the building of a power plant in India so expensive that neither the government nor the citizens could ever pay for the electricity generated there.  It would have been better to stick to Enron&#39;s original business as an energy company, rather than trying to make it into an asset-lite, new-economy company.  It would have been better not to cut side deals with investment banks and analysts.  But Enron went for the quick fix, the fast buck, the gamble on large returns when (if?) a new business idea actually worked.  And, in the end, the quick fix didn&#39;t take, the fast buck never happened, and the gamble failed.  Thousands of former Enron shareholders have been reminded of the old saw, &quot;if it looks too good to be true, it usually is.&quot;<br /><br />As we watch the witnesses continue to testify about Enron&#39;s earnings management, let&#39;s ask ourselves if we&#39;re really all that different from many of the folks at Enron.  Do we do the right things, and for the right reasons?<br /><br />            Two points hit home for me.  One is something I&#39;ve written about before: the effect of cognitive dissonance on decision-making [<a href="#6">6</a>]. Humans are very, very good at fooling themselves into thinking that they can be good people while doing very bad things.  The second point is one that a friend of mine recently raised in a different context.<br /><br />            On February 16, 2006, Professor Christine Hurt made a <a href="http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2006/02/the_aba_affirma.html">post</a> on the <em>Concurring Opinions</em> blog that reminded me of Enron&#39;s earnings management.  In her post, she talks about how law schools have managed the &quot;numbers&quot; for admissions purposes:<blockquote>I teach corporate law, so I follow the recent white-collar prosecutions. Bernard Ebbers was criticized, and eventually punished, for blithely telling subordinates to &quot;hit the numbers&quot; without regard to the consequences.  The ABA is also blithely telling law schools to do something without regard to the realities of numbers.</blockquote>Deans are painfully aware of <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>&#39;s ranking system [<a href="#7">7</a>], and every year involves a balance of watching the numbers (LSAT, undergraduate GPA, placement rate, and bar passage scores) and taking reasonable actions to influence the numbers.  Not every action is reasonable, and some actions are too close to earnings management for comfort [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Apocryphal stories of rankings manipulation abound:  tales of law schools hiring their own graduates for duty at copiers and of deans directing admissions officers to select half of the class on LSATs and half on undergraduate GPAs.  <br /><br />Are we really so different from the earnings managers at Enron when we, too, stray from our core businesses of educating law students and learning more about law and legal systems?  Are we so focused on moving up the <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> rankings system that we would be willing to play games with our numbers in the (typically ill-fated) attempt to move higher on the pecking order?  If so, then we&#39;re not really as different from Enron as we might think.<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'><br />* (c) 2006 Nancy B. Rapoport.  All rights reserved.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wallachlegal.com/">Ian Wallach</a>, habeas counsel for several Guantanamo Bay detainees, says that the US Executive Branch may have engaged in questionable acts and disseminated inaccurate information to encourage Senate passage of provisions in the Detainee Treatment Act preventing federal judges from seeing problematic evidence on why detainees are being held...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/ianwallach.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>H</strong></font>abeas actions are getting a lot of media attention lately.  The unfortunate American military conduct in Abu Ghraib has begun to raise questions about the treatment of prisoners at the US Navy detention facility in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay, Cuba, where incidents of torture and abuse have been reported and largely ignored over the past four years.  The habeas question looms large on the heels of two recently-published case studies (by the <em>National Journal</em> and the Seton Hall University School of Law) that suggest that the majority of people held in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo are innocent, and the report by the United Nations seeking the closure of the facility.  Americans seem split on whether federal judges should be involved at all.  Some people want judges to be able to investigate whether the military is holding people for valid reasons, while others think that -- in a time of war -- how the military conducts itself is a matter for the President only, and judges' interference might impair the President's ability to protect America. <br /><br />  On the litigation front the dispute is largely the same, with <em>pro bono</em> habeas counsel on one side, and the Department of Justice, counsel to the Executive Branch, on the other.  But in Congress, the dispute embodied itself in the passage and potential application of the Detainee Treatment Act (the "DTA") -- a part of the defense spending bill signed into law on December 30, 2005.  Detainees' counsel (such as me) thought the DTA was only going to stop future cases.  The Executive Branch now maintains that the DTA knocks out pending cases too.  The matter is before both the United States Supreme Court and the DC Circuit Court (argument is currently scheduled to take place before the Circuit Court on March 22nd).  <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/12/detainee-treatment-act-of-2005-white.php">Detainee Treatment Act of 2005</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /> This article will examine the timing and language used in Congress by those in support of, and against, the DTA, and try to answer three questions:  <ol><li>Was the timing of the events regarding, and coinciding with, the passage the DTA significant?  <br /><br /><li>Were representations made in support of the DTA accurate, and why were some representations repeated with such frequency? and;<br /> <br /><li>When Congress voted on the DTA, did most members believe they were voting to dismiss not only future habeas actions, but also those pending?</ol>At this juncture, brief explanations of key terms might be helpful for some readers.<ul><li>"Habeas" is short for habeas corpus -- Latin for "you have the body."  It is a rule that emerged in the 13th Century and one that has been written into the Magna Carta.  In essence, it means that if a government holds someone, it must state why, and can't hold a person indefinitely and without charge.  Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) provided a concise, clear definition of habeas to the Senate:<blockquote>All we are saying is if a court receives a petition from an individual who is being held prisoner and determines that there is a problem or a potential problem, that court does have authority to go ahead and issue an order which is a writ saying bring that individual here and justify the imprisonment of this individual.</blockquote><li>"Right to habeas" is a misleading phrase.  Habeas is not a "right" that one acquires by being an American citizen.  It is a right that one acquires by being held by American citizens.  In the Constitution, "habeas" is not mentioned in the Bill of Rights, or in any of the later amendments that clarify the rights of US citizens.  It is written into the Suspension Clause -- and is a limitation on congressional power.  Under the Constitution, Congress can only remove habeas in times of "rebellion" or "invasion".  And there is also a qualifier -- when there is a rebellion or invasion, Congress can only remove habeas if "the public safety may require it." <br /><br /><li>"Habeas action" means an action brought on behalf of someone in the custody of a government.  In this article, "habeas action" refers to one or more of the approximately 180 habeas actions pending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  It is important to clarify that a Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo habeas action does not involve defending people accused of committing acts of terrorism.  Instead, these actions seek to have a presidentially-appointed federal judge see the reasons why the military is holding someone.  The parties in habeas actions are asking a judge to tell a government to either charge someone in their custody or let that person go.  A habeas action seeks to stop a government from holding someone indefinitely without explanation.<br /><br /><li>"Habeas counsel" means, in this article, the approximately 500 attorneys from firms across the nation who are donating their time and expense ("pro bono" which means "for the good") to bring habeas actions, in cooperation with the <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>.  <br /><br /><li>"Rasul" refers to <em>Rasul v. Bush</em>, the 2004 Supreme Court ruling that those in the custody of the United States and being detained in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay have a right to bring a habeas action.</ul><center>*          *          *</center><br />Friday, November 11, 2005, was a National Holiday -- Veterans Day.  On the previous morning of November 10, the Executive Branch brought motions in the detainee habeas actions pending in DC District Court seeking to stay (temporarily stop) them until certain allegedly-related procedural issues were resolved on appeal. <br /><br /> Later that evening, near the end of the Senate session and before the Senate retired for the holiday weekend, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced a proposed amendment that explicitly stated that all pending and future Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo habeas actions would be dismissed.  No committee meetings were held and the vote took place late in the day.  Senator Bingaman twice noted what he perceived as the impropriety of vanquishing a fundamental right, without hearings, on a Thursday evening before a holiday weekend:<blockquote>This is an extremely serious issue.  There have been no hearings on this issue in the Judiciary Committee.  I s
ee the chairman of the Judiciary Committee on the Senate floor this afternoon.  If we are going to seriously consider suspending the privilege of habeas corpus, of filing a petition for habeas corpus, the Judiciary Committee should be the committee that considers that type of a proposal and has hearings on it.<br /><br />There have been no hearings in the Armed Services Committee. It would be a terrible mistake for us to do this sort of as a by-the-way kind of amendment on a Thursday afternoon as we are preparing to leave for the weekend&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;.<br /><br />It is an extraordinary step for this Congress to be taking as an amendment to the Defense bill.  This is an issue that should be dealt with in the Judiciary Committee.  Senator Specter has spoken against the amendment.  Senator Levin has spoken against the amendment. Senator Leahy has spoken against the amendment.  It is something that requires hearings. It is a very important issue, and we should not be dealing with it here on a late evening on Thursday as part of this authorization bill.</blockquote>Still, the amendment passed by a vote of 49 - 42.<br /><br /> During the three-day Veterans Day weekend that followed, opposition to the amendment gathered steam.  And so did an opposition to that opposition.   On Monday, November 14, Senator Bingaman introduced an amendment that expressly allowed all pending and future Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo actions to go forward.  And Senator Graham introduced an amendment -- called "In the Nature of a Substitute" -- that was intended to replace the amendment that passed the previous Thursday.  Senator Graham's new amendment, now endorsed by senior Democrat Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), was very different.  Notably, the new "Effective Date" section removed the language that called for the dismissal of pending habeas actions.  <br /><br /> Senator Bingaman's amendment lost.  A few minutes before the vote on Senator Graham's substituted amendment, Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) described his understanding of it:<blockquote>As a supporter of the Graham-Levin amendment, let me state my understanding of several important issues.  First, I agree with Senator Levin that his amendment does not divest the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to hear the pending case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.  I believe the Effective Date provision of the amendment is properly understood to leave pending Supreme Court cases unaffected.  It would be highly irregular for the Congress to interfere in the work of the Supreme Court in this fashion, and the amendment should not be read to do so.</blockquote>Senator Graham's substituted amendment passed, this time with a vote of 84 - 14.<br /><br /> The amendment went to the House for approval where it was "held at the desk", which means the House could use it to further a bill already pending.  And there was.  H.R. 2863 would eventually become the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, and would eventually incorporate parts of this amendment.  <br /><br /> In the House, the amendment was revised and changes were made primarily regarding the judicial review of determinations by "Combatant Status Review Tribunals" -- tribunals where the military decides if someone is an "enemy combatant".  But the "Effective Date" language stayed the same.  The amendment became Section 1005(e) of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, and part of what is now known as the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA).  The vote on the entire Appropriations Act was scheduled for December 21, 2005.  Minutes before the vote took place, Senator Durbin (D-IL) said this:<blockquote>A critical feature of this amendment is that it is forward looking.  A law purporting to require a Federal Court to give up its jurisdiction over a case that is submitted and awaiting decision would raise grave constitutional questions.  The amendment's jurisdiction-stripping provisions clearly do not apply to pending cases, including the <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> case, which is currently pending before the Supreme Court.  In accordance with our traditions, this amendment does not apply retroactively to revoke the jurisdiction of the courts to consider pending claims invoking the Great Writ of Habeas Corpus challenging past enemy combatant determinations reached without the safeguards this amendment requires for future determinations.  The amendment alters the original language introduced by Senator Graham so that those pending cases are not affected by this provision.</blockquote>The Act (and the DTA it contained) passed with a vote of 93 - 0.  <br /><br /> The President signed the bill into law on December 30, 2005.  On January 4, 2006, the Executive Branch notified the DC District Court that it intended to move to dismiss all the pending habeas actions based on the DTA.<br /><br /> The chronology raises questions.  Normally, a motion to stay an action -- on the grounds of potentially-related procedural issues on appeal -- is of no great import.  But in this case, the original motion to stay was filed by the Executive Branch, in apparently every pending case, on the same day - November 10 - that Senator Graham introduced legislation seeking to stop those pending cases.  Perhaps this was coincidental.  Or perhaps it was part of a coordinated effort to nullify the Supreme Court's ruling in <em>Rasul</em>, and stop courts from seeing the evidence, or lack of it, regarding why people are being kept in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.<br /><br /> Consider the abundance of recent case studies revealing that the majority of people being held in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo are innocent.  The Seton Hall study found, among other conclusions, that 55% of those being detained have not been determined by the Executive Branch to have committed any hostile acts against the US or its allies, that only 8% have been characterized by the Executive Branch as having ties to al Queda, and 18% have been characterized by the Executive Branch has having no ties to either al Qaeda or the Taliban.  The Seton Hall study also found that only 5% of detainees were captured by US forces (the rest being captured by Pakistani and Afghani forces that were paid by the US to bring in anyone with suspected al Qaeda or Taliban ties).  The study also found that several deemed "not enemy combatants" had more serious charges against them than many later deemed enemy combatants.  And many are being kept merely on grounds of affiliation with groups that even the Department of Homeland Security has not placed on its watch-list.  <br /><br />  If these facts and studies are correct, the Executive Branch faced a "lose big versus gain little" scenario with regard to habeas actions.  If a judge was to see evidence against a detainee, and the evidence was strong, then detention would continue.  The only upside for the Executive Branch would be affirmation for doing its job.  But what if the judges were to see the information and it was weak (as the Seton Hall and <em>National Journal</em> case studies have shown to be true in most cases)?  Then the Executive Branch would look irresponsible and malevolent, and would likely need to release the detainee.  And if the Executive Branch's concerns later proved true -- and the detainee, once released, actually became a threat -- then the Executive Branch would be responsible.  <br /><br /> So, knowing this battle was coming, and standing in the shoes of the Executive Branch, the best program -- as unsettling as it may be -- might have been to orchestrate and pursue a plan to keep judges away from the evidence.  <br /><br /> If we accept the possibility that these events were coordinated, then that possibility becomes stronger in light of the timing:  The motions to stay were filed in the morning of November 10.  The original amendment was introduced that evening, right before the Senate adjourned for a three-day holiday.  As we shall see below, the terms "suing our troops" was used throughout the effort to pass the amendment (although, again as discussed below, no troops have ever been sued or could be sued under <em>Rasul</em> or the habeas statute).  "Keeping our troops free from lawsuits" sounds like
 a good way to support them.  And what could possibly be the best day to show support for our troops?  Perhaps the day before Veterans Day.    <br /><br /> The timing in which the Act was executed may be suspect, and reveals an eagerness on the part of the Executive Branch to try to dismiss pending cases.  The President signed the bill into law on Friday, December 30, 2005.  The next business day was Tuesday, January 4.  And the Department of Justice filed papers in the pending habeas actions -- informing the Court of its intent to dismiss them -- on Wednesday, January 5.  The Department of Justice's document used to dismiss is 11 pages long and its substantive text is a single paragraph.  But formatting the document, which lists every pending action, would normally take at least a day, if not more, to prepare and approve (however, the Department of Justice was aware that the bill had passed as of December 21, 2005, and would be signed, and may very well have had the documents ready).<br /><br /> On one hand, it's possible that the Executive Branch's request the morning of November 10, asking the Court to stand back until procedural issues are resolved on appeal, and Senator Graham's introduction of legislation to stop those same habeas actions made that evening, were separate incidents that occurred on the same day by coincidence.  And maybe it is irrelevant that it happened the day before Veterans Day.  Or perhaps the chronology of these events, and the quickness in which the Department of Justice sought to dismiss the actions, suggests that there is a plan underway to keep the Executive Branch from ever having to show what evidence, if any, it has.<br /><br /> Throughout the efforts to pass the DTA, some questionable representations were made to the Senate, including, for example, that the press has access to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo (while a limited number of special visits to certain areas of Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay have been allowed, the author is not aware of any press interviews of detainees or the soldiers in charge of their detention).  <br /><br /> But three separate phrases, or paraphrases thereof, appeared repeatedly.  These were (1) [Don't give terrorists] "the same rights as U.S. citizens"; (2) [Stop allowing terrorists to] "sue our troops"; and (3) [Don't open up] "floodgates of litigation".  The accuracy of these statements leaves room for doubt.  But their effectiveness does not.  <br /><br /> I hear the phrase "terrorists shouldn't have the same rights as U.S. citizens" from colleagues and clients.  It's become part of our parlance.  Versions of this statement were used repeatedly throughout the passage of the DTA, and here are some examples:<ul><li>"If you want to give a Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay detainee habeas corpus rights as a US citizen&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;. (Sen. Graham, Nov. 10, 2006).<br /><br /><li> "Of all the people in the world who should enjoy the same rights of an American citizen in Federal Court, the people at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay are the last we should confer it on" (Sen. Graham, Nov. 10, 2006).<br /><br /><li>"So let's be very clear about this Great Writ.  It does not apply to terrorists, and it should not apply to terrorists, and nothing in this amendment goes any further than to say it applies to US citizens.  It does not apply to terrorists." (Sen. Kyl, Nov. 10, 2006)<br /><br /><li>"But the Writ of habeas corpus, which was never intended to apply to prisoners of war, much less terrorists, does not apply in this case" (Sen. Kyl, Nov. 10, 2006).</ul>I agree that terrorists should not have the same rights as U.S. citizens.  But citizenship and habeas are unrelated concepts.  <br /><br /> Habeas is not a right one acquires by virtue of being a US citizen -- it is a right one acquires when held by US citizens.  Unless you are reading this from a prison cell, or in a squad car, or in any other detention facility, you do not have a right to habeas.  Even if you are a US citizen. <br /><br /> What makes this the above sound-bite even more troubling is that it presumes that those held in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo are terrorists, even though they have not been tried, or charged, or told why they are being held.  And the majority of information available suggests that most detainees are completely innocent.  Even the Department of Defense concedes it has locked up innocent individuals (according to a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article, "American Commanders acknowledge that many of the prisoners shouldn't have been locked up here in the first place because they weren't dangerous and didn't know anything of value.  'Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks,' says Brig. Gen. Jay Hood." Christopher Cooper, Detention Plan:  In Guantanamo, Prisoners Languish in a Sea of Red Tape, <em>Wall St. J.</em>, Jan. 26, 2005).  The argument that "those terrorists shouldn't have the same rights as U.S. citizens" is circular and irrelevant to the issue.  But it was effective.<br /><br />Another repeated sound-bite was "protecting our troops from frivolous lawsuits".  The idea that troops could be sued was repeatedly presented to the Senate.  Senator Graham made the following statements to the Senate on Nov. 10, 2005 (and similar ones later):<ul><li>"What I am concerned about is that an enemy prisoner, not someone charged with a crime, is having access to Federal courts to sue our own troops about the food, about the mail, about whether they should have Internet access, about whether they should get DVDs."<br /><br /><li>"Here is the question I will ask every Member of this body:  Does the Senate want enemy terrorists, al-Qaida members being detained at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay, to have unlimited access to our Federal courts to sue our troops about the following&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;."<br /><br /><li>"But I will not now or ever sit on the sidelines and give rights to enemy combatants who have been caught on the battlefield in the war of terror the unending, endless right to think of every reason in the world to take our own troops into court."<br /><br /><li>"I do not want everyone to have habeas rights.  I do not want the enemy combatant al-Qaeda terrorist to be able to go in our courts and start to sue our own troops.  I don&#39;t want it.  I don&#39;t think people in this body want it."<br /><br /><li>"[if] the American value system [is one] that [allows] people who are trying to kill you unfettered access to the Federal courts to sue your own troops, if that becomes our value, we are going to lose this war."</ul>But the "sue the troops" representation is completely false.  A habeas action is not brought against an individual soldier -- it is brought against an entity holding someone.  A troop cannot be sued in a habeas action.  Nothing in <em>Rasul</em> or in the habeas statute allows a soldier to be sued.  And to this author's knowledge, no soldier has ever been called as a witness in a habeas action.  Even the abominable acts that occurred in Abu Ghraib -- which were photographed -- have not (to my knowledge) resulted in federal court civil actions against the perpetrators, and the same holds true for documented abuses in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo (see Jane Mayer, &quot;The Memo, how an internal effort to ban the abuse and torture of detainees was thwarted,&quot; <em>The New Yorker</em>, February 27, 2006).<br />  <br /> However, the idea that there is a connection between habeas and suing troops sounds good and believable.  Every American supports the troops.  And everyone hates lawsuits.  Combining those two contemporary sentiments may have been a clever means to raise support for a bill designed to protect the Executive Branch from showing its evidence.<br /> <br /> In addition, the term "floodgates of litigation", or a nearly-identical substitute, was used at least ten times to get the amendment passed.   One example is a collection of letters introduced by Senator Graham to combat letters introduced by Senator Bingaman.<br /><br />To challenge the jurisdiction-stripping parts of Senator Graham's amendment, Senator Bingaman introduced five well-reasoned independent letters gathered over the
 weekend from educational groups and current and former members of the military and judiciary.  The majority of these letters were independently drafted and -- while sharing a common theme (i.e., don't deprive habeas) and common concerns -- did not share identical language.  And one letter was jointly signed by 10 current and former members of the military who shared a singular opinion. <br /><br /> By contrast, Senator Graham also introduced a collection of eight letters.  However, seven of these letters contained virtually identical language.

First, these letters were from military officials commenting on the civilian legal system.  Military officials' interests are not affected by habeas actions.  One wouldn't ask military leaders about what makes civilian hospitals more or less efficient, so why is the Senate listening to military leaders talk about what makes civilian courts more or less efficient?  Military leaders don't have expertise on how the laws or the courts function.  <br /><br />  The letters introduced by Senator Bingaman from military leaders talked about the importance of habeas to the military -- an issue with which military leaders clearly have familiarity.  But the letters introduced by Senator Graham from military leaders talked about the efficiency of the federal court system, an issue with which military leaders have no expertise.<br /><br />  The other -- more apparent -- problem with these letters is the clear "cut and paste" circulation of the content, a common practice perhaps, but in this instance, one that demonstrates a party line that is simply inaccurate.  Allowing habeas will not, by any means, generate a "floodgate of litigation".  As of February 17, 2006, there were approximately 5,287 cases pending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  And approximately 180 of those were Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo habeas actions.  The cases that amount to the alleged "floodgates" comprise point zero three four percent (.034%) of the cases pending in that Court.  <br /><br />But more appropriate math would take into consideration Senator Graham's statement that "there are 160 habeas corpus petitions in Federal Courts throughout the United States."  To my knowledge, there are about 180 habeas petitions, all of which were filed in one court -- the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  If we assume that Senator Graham is correct and cases could be brought "throughout the United States", then the math gets even less "floodgate" like. The DC District Court is a busy court.  If we assume every District Court in the nation is half as active as the DC District Court and has only 2,643 cases, and if there are 94 District Courts, then there would be a total of about 248,442 (2,643 times 94) cases in federal courts.  The 180 habeas actions would comprise about point zero zero zero seven two four five percent (.0007245%) of the Courts' cases.<br /><br /> Another issue is whether the Senators thought the DTA stopped pending habeas actions when they voted for it.  For the majority, it seems the short answer is no.  The amendment that the Senate voted on, on November 15, contained the "Effective Date" language that removed the "pending actions" language from the earlier version.  Right before the vote, Senator Reid clarified that the amendment was not intended to nullify pending actions.  No one said otherwise, and the amendment passed with a vote of 84 - 14.  In December, the Act containing the DTA was before the Senate, and contained the identical "Effective Date" language regarding habeas petitions.  Just before the vote, Senator Durbin clarified that it was not intended to apply to pending habeas petitions.  No one said otherwise.  And the bill passed.  <br /><br /> Later, aft
er the vote, Senators Graham and Kyl made statements that the bill was intended to shut down pending habeas actions (Senator Levin has repeatedly gone on record -- before and after the vote -- stating that the DTA was not intended to apply to actions that were pending when the bill was signed into law). <br /><br /> But the Executive Branch recently argued to the US Supreme Court that it doesn't matter whether the Senators believed, or did not believe, that the DTA was intended to apply to pending actions.  The Executive Branch argues that the DTA's "Effective Date" section is irrelevant, and what matters is the blanket statement in the DTA that courts lack jurisdiction to hear habeas actions brought by Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees.<br /><br /> It is hard to figure out what any of this means.  Will detainees -- who have been held for four years -- ever get the right of judicial review promised in the <em>Rasul</em> case?  That depends on so many factors, including how or if the Supreme Court decides the issue on the DTA and how the DC Circuit Court addresses it.  And even if the judiciary determines that habeas still exists for Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay detainees, past experience shows that the Executive Branch may be unwilling to give effect to what the judiciary says.<br /><br /> If there are lessons to be learned, they are difficult ones.  For example, consider the misinformation disseminated and the tactics used by those who don't want judicial involvement in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.  Irrelevant, untruthful, yet catchy sound-bites were repeated.  Silence was used when appropriate -- there were brief moments of time between the statements made to the Senate that the DTA was not intended to apply to pending actions (by Senator Reid and in November and Senator Durbin in December) and the Senate votes.  Yet Senators Graham and Kyl said nothing after these statements were made, let the bill pass, and then later argued that it applied to pending actions.  And the introduction of the legislation appears to have been coordinated with the filing of allegedly-unrelated papers in the pending habeas actions.  <br /><br /> These factors suggest that an effective plan may be underway to stop judges, and American citizens, from learning what our leaders are doing in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, and what they are doing to those held there.  <br /><br /> On the other hand, Senator Bingaman's approach of presenting factually-accurate logical arguments proved ineffective.  But what if Senator Bingaman had used irrelevant, untruthful, yet catchy sound-bites to accomplish his goal?  What if Senator Bingaman -- instead of detailing the historical proof that establishes that denying habeas is bad practice (like the Japanese Internment), and instead of trying to show that denying habeas can hurt, and not help, soldiers -- he had instead said things like "the Nazis persecuted men of a single faith.  Slobodan Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; did the same.  Do we want to act like Nazis?  Do we want to act like Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225;?", and then repeated "I think not.  I think we are better than Nazis!  I think we are better than Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225;!"  Or what if Senator Bingaman quoted the Bible, and said something like "the Gospel of St. Matthew contains God's mandate that we visit and care for those imprisoned, and the Constitution itself gives Americans the obligation to give habeas to those in our custody and control.  Are we just going to ignore the words of God and our founding fathers?"<br /><br />Or what if Senator Bingaman had stretched the truth, like those supporting the amendment had done in the Senate?    For a while, 8-year olds were being detained in Guantanamo (though, to my knowledge, the children have been released).  And we know that some detainees died as a result of the conduct of US soldiers.  One could combine these truths and make a stretched but plausible statement that the US was responsible for the deaths of children in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.  What if Senator Bingaman had said "Eight year old boys!  This amendment allows American Soldiers to kill eight-year old boys in their custody, and not be held accountable!  Are we going stand idly by while our brothers kill and torture children?  Is that what America is about?  Is that what any Senator in this room wants?  Should we let American soldiers commit crimes that would put American citizens in jail?  I don't think so."<br /><br /> I hope those who see the importance of habeas never need to stoop to using unrelated, irrelevant, but potentially-motivating catch-phrases to protect fundamental civil liberties.  Thankfully, we still have a lot to lose.  But maybe those who truly value these rights can learn from how this legislation was passed and how it is being used, and use similar tools, if necessary, the next time that such a right is in jeopardy.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Ian Wallach of <a href="http://www.wallachlegal.com/">Wallach Law Offices, P.C.</a> is an attorney with a private practice in California and New York.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.roanoke.edu/faculty/facultypage.asp?collid=0249114">Todd Peppers</a> of Roanoke College, author of the forthcoming book <a href="http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?book_id=5381%205382%20">Courtiers of the Marble Palace: The Rise and Influence of Supreme Court Law Clerks</a> (Stanford University Press, 2006) says that although Justice Samuel Alito&#39;s recent hiring of former John Ashcroft aide and Time Warner VP Adam G. Ciongoli as a law clerk has raised a flap about the desirability of a Justice hiring a clerk with such solidly conservative credentials, we should consider whether the duties of Supreme Court law clerks in general really permit the exercise of inappropriate influence over the judicial process...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/toddpeppers.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ast week the Supreme Court law clerk &#8212; not unlike groundhog Punxsutawney Phil - briefly emerged from the shadows of the Marble Palace and made a semi-annual appearance in the mainstream media.  The specific cause of the most recent sighting of the elusive law clerk: Justice Samuel Alito's hiring of Adam G. Ciongoli.  As reported by the <em>Washington Post</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>, Ciongoli formerly clerked for Samuel Alito on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals before working for John Ashcroft in the United States Senate and the Department of Justice and then as a Vice President at Time Warner.  The hiring of Ciongoli has been scrutinized and dissected as much as the shadow of the aforementioned Punxsutawney Phil, and the dire conclusions drawn by some legal observers and journalists show as much understanding of the role of the law clerk on the modern Supreme Court as weather predictions based on a groundhog's shadow demonstrate one's grasp of meteorology.<br /><br /> The flap over the hiring of Adam Ciongoli has nothing to do with fears about the legal competency of this Georgetown Law Center graduate.  Nor does it have to do with his advanced age (37), health, or ethnicity.  The flurry of articles commenting or criticizing his hiring has to do with perceptions about Mr. Ciongoli's political ideology.  In short, is it a good thing that a former Third Circuit law clerk who possesses impeccable conservative credentials &#8212; including being Attorney General John Ashcroft's daily lunch companion and assisting in preparing Justice Alito for his confirmation hearings &#8212; will be clerking on the Supreme Court?  <br /><br /> Law clerk ideology is not a new topic for Supreme Court observers. Concern over law clerk ideology was first sparked by an article written by then private attorney William Rehnquist in December of 1957.  In a <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> article titled &quot;Who Writes Decisions of the Supreme Court?,&quot; Rehnquist discussed his clerkship with the late Robert H. Jackson, summarized the basic duties performed by law clerks, and expressed his concern that substandard legal research as well as the &quot;unconscious slanting&quot; of cert. memoranda by legal law clerks might result in a justice&#39;s decision-making process being influenced.  Rehnquist's suggestion of improper influence ignited a firestorm of controversy, including stinging rebuttals from former Supreme Court law clerks Alexander Bickel and William D. Rogers (who found Rehnquist's claims of law clerk influence to be absurd), and prompted Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi to take to the Senate floor and argue that minimal professional competence requirements be established for these young, liberal, and incompetent legal assistants. <br /><br /> Although the controversy slowly died away, the proverbial genie was out of the bottle.  Since 1957 legal commentators, journalists, and politicians have returned again and again to the topic of law clerk influence &#8212; often after reading similar unsubstantiated claims of law clerk misadventures in such books as Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong's <em>The Brethren</em> (1979) and Edward Lazarus' <em>Closed Chambers</em> (1998).   Americans love a good conspiracy theory, and tales of elderly, disinterested justices being manipulated by rabid young law clerks from elite Ivy League law schools are too juicy to ignore. <br /><br /> What the influence debate has lacked, however, is (1) a commonly understood definition of the word "influence," (2) a thoughtful and thorough discussion of the institutional rules and norms surrounding the hiring and utilization of law clerks, (3) a delineation of the institutional conditions that must exist for the potential of law clerk influence, and (4) an examination of the personal motivations and preferences that must be present for the law clerks to want to seize the opportunity to wield influence.  Undoubtedly, the United States Supreme Court law clerks corps represents the best and brightest legal minds that our top law schools can produce.  At times in our history, the legal skills possessed by these law clerks have likely outstripped the intellectual firepower of a Fred Vinson or Joseph McKenna.  And undoubtedly each and every man and woman who has clerked on the Supreme Court has possessed their own personal political ideology.  Yet the fact that a law clerk may be a conservative, liberal, fascist, or communist is but one small piece of the influence puzzle.<br /><br /> Law clerks do not work in a vacuum.  They are surrounded with rules and norms regarding their job duties and their behavior.  The work assignments they receive are determined by the individual justice, and typically come with exacting instructions and guidelines.  Law clerks work with equally bright peers, who often monitor, edit and critique their work product.  And they are supervised by employers who possess not only their own substantial legal skills, but the institutional means and the personal motivations to craft intra- chamber rules designed to prevent law clerk misbehavior and defection.<br /><br /> Do law clerks affect judicial behavior? Of course they do.  Even time a law clerk makes a grammatical change to a draft opinion, prepares a cert. pool memo, or engages in a debate with his or her justice, he or she has influenced judicial behavior in some minor way.  The more critical question, however, revolves around the likelihood of inappropriate and pernicious influence.  In my research on Supreme Court law clerks, I have interviewed or surveyed approximately 140 former Supreme Court law clerks.  Moreover, I have reviewed the personal papers of such justices as Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Felix Frankfurter, William O. Douglas, Earl Warren, Thurgood Marshall, and Harry Blackmun.  I am not aware of any historical examples of justices who have permitted law clerks to decide which appeals to grant or deny or which litigants to find in favor of.   <br /><br /> I have found, however, that every member of the Rehnquist Court &#8212; save Justice John Paul Stevens &#8212; asked their law clerks to prepare opinion drafts, and all justices on Rehnquist Court &#8212; with the exception of Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. &#8212; routinely relied upon law clerks to review cert. petitions and prepare cert. memoranda.  Assuming that Justice Alito adopts this clerkship model, the important question to ask is whether these types of job duties permit the exercise of inappropriate influence and whether Supreme Court employment rules exist to limit or prevent such influence.  If a justice tells a law clerk the correct outcome but does not provide the law clerk with the underlying reasoning (Justice Abe Fortas was occasionally guilty of such practices, often reaching an outcome and then telling his law clerks to "decorate" an opinion with legal precedent), then perhaps the law clerk begins to unduly encroach upon functions granted to the justices themselves. Then, and only then, is the ideology of
law clerks relevant.  All law clerks.   <br /><br /><br /><em>Todd C. Peppers is an assistant professor in the Department of Public Affairs at Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.shu.edu/faculty/fulltime_faculty/freamobe/freamon.html">Bernard Freamon</a> of Seton Hall University Law School says that Danish prosecutors should revisit their decision not to charge the Danish newspaper editors responsible for the initial printing of the satirical Muhammad cartoons before the worldwide violence over their publication and republication gets even more out of hand...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/bernardfreamon.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><em>People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use</em><br /><br />-- Soren Kierkegaard<br /> <br /><font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>t is my duty as a Muslim African-American law professor to offer a brief comment on the Danish newspaper <em>Jyllands-Posten</em>'s publication of cartoons satirizing the Prophet Muhammad and the subsequent republication of those cartoons by other newspapers around the world. <br /><br />The incident and the furor it has created, including the violence and needless loss of life, raise profound questions about the continued viability of a liberal and universalist approach to free expression in our rapidly changing and increasingly pluralist world. Constitutional lawyers who want to blindly defend the action of the newspaper forget that the idea of freedom of expression evolves and deepens as history progresses; the issues surrounding free expression today are considerably different from the issues that confronted Justice Holmes when he penned his famous dissent in <em>Abrams v. United States</em> in 1919. <br />   <br />By the same token, Muslims should also be deeply concerned because, by their reaction to the events, Islam-bashers (and even some so-called Muslim governments) now see that much of the Islamic world suffers from a huge complex about its role in history; they are craftily using this sensitivity to provoke Muslims to commit senseless acts of violence that do not uphold or further the banner of Islam and the values that the Prophet Muhammad sought to inculcate in all of us. It is indeed frightening that in many ways both sides are acting unthinkingly. <br />    <br />Islam teaches that vilification of any religion, not just the Islamic religion, is reprehensible and must be condemned in the strongest terms. Those who want to scrub our public places clean with some sort of secular soap don't seem to understand this or they don't want to accept it. Muslim scholars assert that there are five primary purposes of the Shari&#39;a. The second most important purpose, after preservation of life, is the maintenance and protection of religion in people&#39;s lives.  Many Muslims, particularly Muslims in the Arab world, also don&#39;t understand this principle, as we frequently find all kinds of statements in the Arab press vilifying the Jewish religion and Jewish people. That must stop also. Two wrongs  certainly don&#39;t make a right however. The Shari'a  demands that we must condemn any statement that vilifies someone&#39;s religion, where the statement is made for no other purpose other than to vilify, ridicule, or foment hatred. <br /><br />Muslims are therefore very right to vigorously condemn the publication of the cartoons and to seek to punish the editors through the criminal law process. There is no room in the public square, it seems to me, for the race-baiter or religion-baiter who acts with the intention to injure or harm others. If these cartoons are in fact a Trojan Horse for such behavior the editors must be exposed and punished. We should remember that the Rwanda genocide was preceded by radio broadcasts that described Tutsis as "cockroaches" and supposedly innocently listed the names and addresses of people who were later murdered by Hutu mobs, simply because of their ethnic origin or association with the Tutsis. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda rightfully rejected the free expression defense offered by the radio broadcasters at their trial for genocide and crimes against humanity. <br />     <br />There seems to be some support for my position in Danish law governing the original publication of the cartoons in <em>Jyllands-Posten</em>. Denmark ensures freedom of expression through application of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Court of Human Rights, which interprets and enforces the Convention, has recognized that freedom of speech is "one of the essential foundations of a democratic society," and that the right "is applicable not only to 'information' or 'ideas' that are favorably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb."  This right of expression is particularly important for the media, which must "impart information and ideas on matters of public interest."  <br /><br />Freedom of expression under the convention is not, however, an absolute right. While section 1 of Article 10 of the convention broadly grants freedom of expression, section 2 imposes a number of important restrictions. For example, it allows restriction of freedom of expression when necessary "for the protection of the reputation or the rights of others." This would permit legal actions for libel and slander but it would also allow governments to criminalize hate speech. In fact, Denmark has such a criminal law, section 266b of the Danish Penal Code. That section authorizes criminal prosecution and conviction of any person "who publicly or with the intention of dissemination to a wide circle of people makes a statement or imparts other information threatening, insulting or degrading a group of persons on account of their race, color, national or ethnic origin, belief or sexual orientation&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;".<br /><br />A Danish district court in Herning has interpreted the phrase "dissemination to wide circle of people" to include an e-mail listserv of 47 people and convicted a member of the Danish People's Party for distributing an e-mail that contained degrading and insulting statements about Muslims. In addition, Danish courts have held that the statute covers both oral and written expressions, pictures, caricatures and also symbolic acts or objects.  As a result, they have interpreted Code 266b to prohibit cross burning. In the area of hate speech or speech implicating racial or group discrimination, Denmark further restricts freedom of expression by its ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965) ("ICEAFRD"). ICEAFRD obliges Denmark to "condemn racial discrimination and undertake to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating racial discrimination in all its forms and promoting understanding among all races."  Under this convention, Denmark may restrict hate speech when the circumstances, taken as a whole, show that such speech or expression promoted racial discrimination or hatred.<br /> <br />Under both these standards it appears to me that the <em>Jyllands-Posten</em> publication of cartoons satirizing the Prophet Muhammad with depictions and caricatures may very well be a violation of Danish Penal Code section 266b, if it can be shown that the editor knew that the religious sensibilities of Muslims would be deeply offended by the caricatures and that he intended to stir hatred and ridicule with their publication. <br /><br />In September, Danish prosecutors, acting on a complaint by Danish Muslim clerics, nonetheless refused to authorize a criminal prosecution of the newspaper editor under section 266b. In my view, this was a patent abuse of their discretion and a blatantly political decision. They ought to revisit it. The issue should be decided by a Danish court. Danish prosecutors certainly must know Denmark is becoming a hotbed of skinheadism and anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant violence. Do they
 want their newspapers to fan these flames? They should not wait until they have a situation like that in Rwanda before they act.   <br />        <br /><br /><em>Bernard K.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.richmond.edu/faculty/tobias.htm">Carl Tobias</a> of the University of Richmond School of Law says that regardless of the ruling in the wake of the much-anticipated BlackBerry injunction hearing, critical questions remain about the patent litigation process that may yet require Congressional intervention...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/carltobias.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>omorrow, the world will be watching a federal courtroom in Richmond, Virginia.  There, Judge James R. Spencer may provide a final resolution of the fiercely-contested, lengthy dispute between NTP Inc. and Research in Motion (RIM) that involves ongoing use of BlackBerry, the wireless messaging device which millions employ.  If NTP and RIM fail to reach accord and settle their disagreement before this hearing, NTP will request that Judge Spencer impose an injunction and halt BlackBerry usage across the United States.<br /><br />NTP is a corporation with headquarters located in Northern Virginia that was founded in 1992.  NTP sued RIM a half decade ago, asserting that the Canadian company's renowned device infringes upon NTP's patent rights.<br /><br /> A jury resolved this patent infringement allegation in a 2002 trial. Jurors found that RIM had infringed on NTP's patent rights. Judge Spencer then required RIM to pay NTP $54 million in cash and a royalty of 8.5 percent on all BlackBerry sales in the United States.  More relevant for BlackBerry owners today was that Judge Spencer imposed an injunction that would halt American service and sale of BlackBerries.  However, in 2002, Judge Spencer suspended the injunction, until RIM had exhausted appeals of the adverse determination in his court.<br /><br /> RIM appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which approved many of the district court rulings in December 2004. The next year, the Supreme Court denied RIM's petition for certiorari, thus returning the dispute to Judge Spencer's courtroom where he will hear arguments on the injunction.<br /><br /> While RIM pursued these appeals, the litigants engaged in additional machinations. RIM asked the federal Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to reassess the validity of NTP's patent rights, and the PTO has preliminarily rejected certain NTP patents and even finally rejected one this week.  Nevertheless, final PTO resolution may take years, and Judge Spencer suggested in late 2005 that he is not inclined to wait. RIM and NTP have also attempted to negotiate a settlement, and those efforts intensified last year after the Federal Circuit basically affirmed the district court.   In March 2005, the two corporations announced that they had reached accord and that RIM would pay $450 million to resolve the dispute, but the agreement unraveled last summer.<br /><br /> This prolonged litigation has dogged RIM since 2001 and has fueled growing concerns among its four million BlackBerry subscribers, who fear that their service will abruptly end.  The litigants will argue before Judge Spencer over whether the long-delayed injunction should now take effect.  The United States has intervened and asked for a special exception, should the injunction be imposed.  RIM has announced that it has developed a "workaround," thus allowing its service to continue without reliance on NTP's patented technology.  However, some observers question whether that fix will actually work, and NTP has pledged to challenge this strategy in court. The Supreme Court will soon hear an unrelated appeal which considers when injunctions are proper relief for patent infringement, but that decision will be too late for RIM and its BlackBerry addicts.<br /><br /> The tension is mounting, as the Friday hearing approaches.   RIM and NTP are continuing to battle, even as each is uncertain of the judicial resolution.  After Judge Spencer hears the arguments, he may rule from the bench or take the matter under advisement.  If the judge imposes an injunction, RIM will seek a stay pending appeal, thus starting the process again.<br /><br />          However Judge Spencer decides this seemingly interminable litigation, and despite his careful handling of the complex matter, the judge's determination will not resolve numerous difficult legal issues.  First, is whether juries are the best factfinders to resolve the complicated issues which patent litigation presents.  Second is how to reconcile the competing needs of parties to infringement litigation with the needs of the ongoing patent approval process.  Third is how to fashion appropriate remedies in patent litigation when injunctions would arguably harm thousands of innocent product owners.  Fourth is whether the Federal Circuit is the ideal "final" decisionmaker, as the tribunal with subject matter jurisdiction over patent disputes, and because the Supreme Court hears so few patent appeals. Given the apparently intractable nature of these questions, Congress may be required to legislate. <br />   <br /><br /><em>Carl Tobias is the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/tobias.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<title>Hear No Evil: Congress, FISA and NSA Surveillance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/shane.html">Peter Shane</a> of Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, says that decisions by the Republican leaders of two congressional committees not to launch probes into warrantless NSA surveillance of Americans contrary to FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, reflect a serious breakdown in the constitutional system of checks and balances between different branches of government...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petershane.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he apparent refusal of two congressional committee chairs to investigate the NSA's defiance of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in conducting warrantless electronic surveillance of Americans reveals once again the apparent breakdown in external checks and balances when it comes to the Bush Administration's ambitions for executive authority.  This is all the more alarming because conscientious legal interpretation, perhaps the primary internal check on the conduct of the executive, apparently broke down long ago.<br /><br />One of two Administration arguments for the legality of its program of warrantless electronic surveillance is that such spying was implicitly authorized by the 2001 resolution for the Authorization for the Use of Military Force in Afghanistan.  The AUMF supposedly provides the statutory authority for warrantless surveillance that is an express exemption from the requirements of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.<br /><br />Among the many problems with this argument is the fact that Congress, when it enacted FISA, actually thought about how to handle electronic surveillance during wartime.  Under FISA, the President is allowed to "authorize electronic surveillance . . . to acquire intelligence information for a period not to exceed fifteen days following a declaration of war by the Congress."  The obvious reason was to give Congress two weeks to decide what variations in the FISA regime ought be implemented in law to give the President continuing legal authority to conduct surveillance, but in circumstances appropriate to wartime.<br /><br />Of course, Congress did not intend the AUMF as a declaration of war, legally speaking.  And it did not change FISA to eliminate the warrant requirement for domestic spying.  So, in order to accept the Administration's argument, you have to believe something like this: In enacting the AUMF, which does not say a word about declaring war or expanding wiretapping, Congress implicitly authorized the President to conduct warrantless surveillance for an indefinite period of time, even though Congress, when it explicitly considered in 1978 the scope of presidential authority after a formal declaration of war, limited his authority to conduct warrantless surveillance to a period of 15 days.  Such an argument is logically and legally absurd.<br /><br />It follows in the footsteps, however, of the Administration's equally specious lawyering on the question of torture. In the now infamous "Torture Memo" of 2002, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel offered a preposterously narrow reading of the statute banning acts intended to provoke "severe physical or mental pain and suffering." With regard to physical harms, OLC would have limited the ban's purview to acts inflicting harms that "rise to the level of death, organ failure, or serious impairment of body functions."   The sole legal authority on which that fanciful reading is founded is a citation to an entirely unrelated statute describing the physical harms that entitle people to certain emergency medical health benefits.<br /><br />Executive branch lawyers will naturally be mindful of the interests of the Presidency in deciding how to interpret the constitutional and statutory law of the United States.  But there is a line between scrupulous attention to the legitimate interests of your client and what might be called pants-on-fire lawyering &#8212; taking positions so plainly at odds with legal judgment and common sense that their absurdity verges on downright dishonesty.  In many critical areas of foreign and military policy, the executive functions virtually free of public scrutiny.   In such sensitive areas, conscientious lawyering within the executive branch is pretty much our only institutional check to insure observance of the rule of law.  When Justice Department lawyers proffer incompetent legal positions in defense of the President's supposed discretion to do whatever he feels like, they are truly complicit in subverting the Constitution. <br /><br />A recurring question in the FISA-gate debate is why the executive branch, which actually has emergency authority under FISA to conduct warrantless surveillance, did not use it.  This seems especially mysterious given that the President and Attorney General insist the NSA has listened in only on conversations involving parties who belong to or are associated with al Qaeda.<br /><br />I actually have a guess about this, and I emphasize it is only a guess.  The question to ask is, how did the government know that it was listening on conversations of this kind.  My hypothesis is that they were using a technique called "pattern recognition."  That is, using computers to sift through data about thousands of telephone communications &#8212; things like call length, points of origin and reception, and so on &#8212; as well as word sampling from the conversations themselves, the NSA developed an algorithm for which patterns would likely be characteristic of al Qaeda-related phone calls.  If I am right, then the following two things would also be true:<br /><br />1.  The Administration can accurately say that it limited its "listening" to al Qaeda-related phone calls only if you don't count the original computer surveillance of the contents of phone calls as "listening."<br /><br />2.  The information that led to the identification of certain phone calls as al Qaeda-related did not include information specific to the actual parties to the phone call.  The information was only a "pattern," which, judging from the results, typically was not well designed to yield fruitful "hits."<br /><br />The reason I think this is a decent guess is that FISA would not permit the computerized "listening in" that I suspect has occurred, and it's not clear whether the FISA court would accept pattern evidence as the sole basis for establishing probable cause that a phone call would actually yield foreign intelligence information.  The court might also have rebelled against the process that yielded the pattern information in the first place.  That would explain why the Administration did not rely on the court.<br /><br />What it fails to explain &#8212; again, if my guess is right &#8212; is why the Administration did not ask for an amendment to FISA to allow this sort of program.  With Republican majorities in both Houses and the Administration's skill in the politics of national security, what were they afraid of? <br /><br />The Republican Intelligence Committee chairs are apparently willing to hold hearings into the potential need for amending FISA.  Perhaps the Administration's requests for amendments will offer some clue as to what is already happening.   <br /><br /><em>Peter Shane is the Joseph S.

		<title>Haiti&#039;s Election: Right Result, For the Wrong Reason</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.ijdh.org/">Brian Concannon Jr.</a>, Director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, says that the negotiated deal over the counting of disputed ballots which has made Rene Preval the president-elect of Haiti has correctly put the most popular candidate in office but has done so at considerable cost to his perceived legitimacy, and to the legitimacy of the Haitian electoral process...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/concannon.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n February 7, Haitian voters went to the polls to elect a President for the fourth time since 1990. Through great patience and determination they overcame official disorganization, incompetence and discrimination, and for the fourth time since 1990 handed their chosen candidate a landslide victory. And for the fourth time Haitian elites, with support from the international community, started immediately to undercut the victory, seeking at the negotiation table what they could not win at the voting booth.<br /><br />The foothold for the negotiation was an impasse over whether the successful candidate, Rene Preval, won the 50% of the vote necessary to avoid a runoff election against his nearest competitor. Although early official results and the unofficial tallies by the Preval campaign, international observers and journalists all showed Mr. Preval comfortably above the 50% bar, after 5 days of counting his official results crept 1.3% below it.<br /><br />The negotiations resulted in a deal that changes the way that the Electoral Council treats blank ballots, which, according to the Council's calculation, puts Mr. Preval back above 50%. By giving Mr. Preval the election, the agreement closes the book on serious charges that the Interim Government of Haiti (IGH) manipulated vote tabulations and discarded ballots to prevent him from winning. It also allows the international community to say, after two years under the brutal and undemocratic IGH, that there is now democracy in Haiti.<br /><br />The election deal gives a little something to everyone, and that's the problem. Elections are not supposed to make everyone happy; they are supposed to apportion political power according to majority vote, on the basis of set rules. In all likelihood, a correct tabulation of the votes would have given Mr. Preval a first round victory, as exit polls and unofficial tabulations had predicted. Although the negotiated agreement reaches the same result as a correct tabulation would have reached, it does so by changing the rules instead of correcting the violations of the rules.<br /><br />The deal provides leverage for those seeking to delegitimize Preval's presidency and block the progressive social and economic policies that he was elected to implement. The election's also-rans are already crying foul, and they will be joined by more voices from Haiti's elite and the international community. Soon enough, invoking "the contested elections of February 2006" will suffice to justify an array of economic and political coercion against Haiti's elected government. <br />    <br />Even Leslie Manigat, the second place finisher, wins with the deal. He earned less than 12% of the votes the first time around, and had no chance of winning a fair second round vote. There were 17,000 more mistakes - unmarked or improperly marked ballots - than Manigat votes.  Even if all 30 of the other losing candidates had thrown their support behind Mr. Manigat - and many had already declared for Preval - he still would have been far short of a victory.<br /><br />The deal spares Mr. Manigat a drubbing in the second round, and more importantly, allows him to claim, forever, that he was cheated out of a chance to win on the second round. He got this ball rolling by immediately calling a press conference to criticize the International Community and the IGH for caving into the threat of violence.<br /><br />Mr. Manigat is right that no one should have caved into the threat of violence. But they should have caved into the clear popular vote in favor of Mr. Preval.<br /><br /><strong>The Problem</strong><br /><br />The defective vote tabulation is just the latest in a long string of efforts to minimize the impact of the poor voters who backed Preval. The IGH engaged in a comprehensive program to suppress political activities of the Lavalas movement, where Mr. Preval drew most of his support, in the ten months before the elections. Several prominent politicians were not able to participate as candidates or activists because they were kept in jail illegally. Political prisoners included Haiti's last constitutional Prime Minister, a former member of the House of Deputies, the former Minister of the Interior, and dozens of local officials and grassroots activists. When Haiti's most prominent dissident, Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, was diagnosed  with leukemia, it took a massive campaign, including intervention of top U.S. Republicans, just to obtain his provisional release for desperately needed treatment.<br /><br /> <em>Making Registration Difficult</em><br /><br />The voting registration process systematically discouraged poor rural and urban voters from signing up. Where Haiti's democratic government provided over 10,000 voter registration centers for elections in 2000, the IGH installed less than 500. The offices would have been too few and far between for many voters even if they had been evenly distributed. But placement was heavily weighted in favor of areas likely to support the IGH and its allies. Halfway through the registration period, for example, there were three offices in the upscale suburb of Petionville, and the same number in the large and largely roadless Central Plateau Department. In cities, the poor neighborhoods were the last to get registration centers, and Cite Soleil, the largest poor neighborhood of all, never got one.<br /><br />Complaints and protests forced the IGH to extend the registration period three times and open additional registration facilities. Eventually over 3.5 million voters registered, about three-quarters of the estimated eligible voters. But we will never know how many voters could not get to a registration center, or gave up after losing too many precious work days in the effort. We do know that the registration difficulties disproportionately impacted the rural and urban poor, who voted overwhelmingly for Preval.<br /><br /> <em>Making Campaigning Difficult</em><br /><br />Neither the Lavalas movement nor the Preval campaign was able to effectively engage in pre-election campaigning. Police repeatedly fired guns at peaceful pro-Lavalas demonstrations throughout the two years of the IGH's reign. In January, a pro-government gang destroyed structures erected for a Preval campaign speech in the town of St. Marc, canceling the event. No arrests were made. Violence and threats of violence forced the cancellation of subsequent events, even the campaign's grand finale the week before the election.<br />  <br /><em>Election Day Vote Suppression</em><br /><br />The IGH had limited the voting centers to 807, which would have been inadequate even if the elections had run smoothly (Los Angeles County, with a slightly larger population but only 37% of Haiti's land area and infinitely better private and public transportation, had about 4,400 polling places in November 2005). But by 1 PM on election day, Reuters' headline read: "Chaos, fraud claims mar Haiti election." Most election offices opened late and lacked ballots or other materials; many did not become fully functional until mid-afternoon. Voters arrived at the designated centers to find the center had been moved at the last minute. Many who found the center identified on their voting card waited in line for hours only to be told they could not vote because their names were not on the list. At some centers, tens o
f thousands of voters were crammed into a single building, creating confusion, and in one case a deadly stampede.<br /><br />As with the registration deficiencies, the poor bore the lion's share of the election day problems. The two voting centers for Cite Soleil, both located well outside the neighborhood, saw the worst. One of the two, the Carrefour Aviation site, was transferred at the last minute to a single building where 32,000 voters had to find the right line to wait in without posted instructions, lists of names or an information center. Throughout the day, journalists and observers noted over and over that centers in Petionville and other wealthy areas were better organized and equipped.<br /><br />As with registration, many voters persevered despite the obstacles. After frustrated would-be voters took to the streets in spontaneous protests, the IGH made concessions, such as keeping the polls open later and allowing people with voting cards whose names were not on the local list to vote in some places. By the end of the day, most voting centers were operating at a minimal level, and over 60% of registered voters did vote. But we will never know how many people gave up, because they were sick or frustrated or needed to get back to their families.<br /><br /><em>Counting Some of the Votes</em><br /><br />After the problems with registration and voting, Mr. Preval's supporters were pleasantly surprised that the Provisional Electoral Council, or CEP, gave him a large lead in initial reports.  On Thursday, the CEP announced that with 22% of the votes counted, Preval had a commanding lead with 62% of the vote. Mr. Manigat trailed at 11%, and Charles Henri Baker, in third place, had 6%. Unofficial reports of the local results from international and Haitian observers and journalists consistently had Preval far over 50%. But by Saturday night the CEP had reduced Preval's official vote to 49.61%; by Monday it was at 48.7%, about 22,500 votes below 50%.<br /><br />The IGH claims that Preval's decrease was the result of more information coming in and better calculations. But many questions about the tabulation process, combined with the efforts to suppress the Lavalas vote before and during election day, raise doubts about those claims. On Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Preval claimed that he had proof that he won 54% of the vote and that the Electoral Council had fraudulently reduced his number. <br /><br />Shortly after Mr. Preval's announcement, Haitian television broadcast such proof: thousands of ballots, some burnt, most of them Preval votes, found in a dump near Cite Soleil, and not far from the CEP's tabulation center. Preval's opponents claim that his supporters dumped the ballots as a provocation after his speech. But that theory does not explain why witnesses report seeing the ballots at the dump for a day before the speech, nor how thousands of ballots were removed from CEP custody.<br /><br />A large number of tally sheets from polling centers are not being counted. 254 sheets were destroyed, reportedly by gangs from political parties opposed to Preval.  504 tally sheets reportedly lack the codes needed to enter them officially. The missing tally sheets probably represent about 190,000 votes- over 9% of the total votes cast- and according to the UN, disproportionately affect poor areas that support Preval. Mr. Preval would not have needed to win an overwhelming percentage of these 190,000 votes to increase his lead by the 22,500.<br /><br /> <em>Who's In Charge?</em><br /><br />The Electoral Council, which was named through a complicated process in 2004, is supposed to be running the tabulation of votes. In fact, Jacques Bernard, who was appointed "Executive Director" of the Council- a position not previously recognized in Haitian law- by the Prime Minister late last year, is running the Council's activities. Councilor Pierre Richard Duchemin charges Mr. Bernard with "manipulation" of the results, and "an effort to stop people from asking questions." Another Councilor, Patrick Fequiere, claims that Mr. Bernard is working without the Council and not telling them where his information is coming from. The UN Peacekeeping mission was forced to remove the doors to the tabulation center to prevent Mr. Bernard and his advisors from acting secretly.<br /><br /> <em>Null and Blank Votes</em><br /><br />Electoral officials have discarded 147,765 votes, over 7% of the total, as "null." Article 185 of the Electoral Code allows officials to nullify ballots if they "cannot recognize the intention or political will of the elector." As the U.S. experience with butterfly ballots and hanging chads demonstrated, voters are going to make mistakes even under the best conditions. Haiti's conditions were far from the best- Presidential ballots were complicated, with 33 candidates, each with a photo, an emblem and the names of the candidate and the party; voters were tired from walking and waiting; some voting was done in the dark by candlelight; and many voters are unused to filling out forms or writing. All these factors could lead to a high number of mistakes-like marking two boxes- that made determining the voters' choice impossible. <br /><br />But 147,765 voided votes is a high number, suspiciously high since the decision to nullify was made by local officials handpicked by an Electoral Council that had no representation from Preval's Lespwa party or Lavalas. Overly strict criterion (such as requiring an "x" to be completely within a candidate's box), even if neutrally applied, would have had a disproportionate impact on poor voters, who are more unused to filling out forms than their better-heeled compatriots, and therefore more likely to make mistakes.<br /><br />Another group of votes, 85,290, or 4.6% of he total valid votes, are classified as blank ballots.  These votes were actually counted against Preval, because under the election law they are included in the total number of valid votes that provides the baseline for the 50% threshold. This is a potentially reasonable system, just unreasonably applied to Haiti. In principle the system allows voters to show their displeasure with all the candidates by voting for no one, which can make sense in places where voting is easier. In practice the system makes no sense in Haiti- it is absurd to think that 85,000 people, many without enough to eat, would leave their babies, their fields and other work and spend hours walking or waiting in the tropical heat just to say they did not like any of the 33 candidates. A more likely explanation is that some voters got confused by the complicated ballots and marked nothing. Again, this problem would disproportionately affect poor voters likely to vote for Preval. <br /><br />The blank and null ballots combined exceeded Mr. Manigat's vote by 17,000. The rules for blank and null votes are consistent with previous Haitian elections, so it is hard to call the rules themselves fraudulent. But the scale of the distortion of the vote caused by these rules was both foreseeable and preventable. The same problem has arisen at every election since 1990, most of which were observed by the UN and the Organization of American States, which were active in preparing the elections this time around. The distortion could be sharply reduced with a simple voter education campaign: going into poor neighborhoods, demonstrating how to mark ballots and giving voters an opportunity to practice on sample ballots. <br /><br />There was money available for such a program - the election cost over $70 million dollars, more than $30 for every vote cast - most of it coming from abroad. The political parties, many of which represented a fraction of one percent of the electorate, received generous subsidies. But no concerted effort was made to help the much larger share of the voters who had demonstrated difficulty with filling out the ballots.<br /><br /><strong>The Best Solution</strong><br /><br />The remedy to the problems with the vote tabulation should have been to carefully redo the calculations, in the open. First, the math from all the calculations that were previously made should have b
een checked against the original tally sheets. Where the tally sheets lacked the codes, the local officials should have been tracked down to confirm that the results are correct.<br /><br />In the case of electoral materials intercepted on the way to the CEP, it is possible to reconstruct the result through the Electoral Code's backup systems. The actual counting of the ballots is done on site, immediately after the closing of the polls, by each Bureau de Vote (each Bureau serves 400 voters). The Bureau officials conduct the counting, but are observed by mandataires, or representatives of political parties. A report listing the results of the counting is prepared, and at least six copies are made. The Bureau officials and the mandataires all sign each of the copies if they agree with the report. The copies are then distributed widely: one is posted on the voting center door, one copy each is sent to the Communal Electoral Office, the Departmental Electoral Office, and the Electoral Council, and each mandataire is entitled to one. <br /><br />Presumably these copies will leave the Bureau in many different directions. It may be easy to intercept the official results in some areas, but it would be much harder to track down all the copies in the hands of mandataires. It would be difficult for a mandataire to introduce a fraudulent copy of the results that were intercepted, because that would require forging several signatures.<br /><br />The null votes could have been rechecked through a procedure that applied consistent rules across the country. The null ballots are supposed to be segregated in a separate envelope, so it would be easy to go through the envelopes from a few Bureaus, to ascertain whether there were enough improperly nullified ballots to justify a comprehensive review. If Preval could have added 22,500 votes to his lead from the 147,000 null votes, this alone would have put him over the top.<br /><br />The blank ballot rule is inappropriate, and it should be changed. But it should be changed for Haiti's next election, when it should be less of a problem anyway because of better voter education.<br /><br />The ballots found in the Cite Soleil dump could have been traced. All ballots are numbered, and each Bureau keeps a record of the numbers on the ballots it used and did not use. The chain of custody could have been followed, to see how the ballots left CEP custody.<br /><br />Following these procedures would have been time consuming, but it would have provided verifiable answers to the questions raised about the vote tabulation, and a clear answer as to whether Mr. Preval needed to face a second round. It also would have provided other answers- whether the charges of manipulation in the tabulations were justified, and who diverted the ballots to the Cite Soleil dump. <br /><br />In giving up his right to a correct tabulation of the vote, Mr. Preval probably calculated that the international community, which had not complained about the inadequate registration and voting facilities, and only lightly complained about the IGH's political prisoners, would show similar restraint when faced with tabulation irregularities. And he knew that if the first round could be stolen from him, the second round could as well.<br /><br /><strong>The Chosen Solution</strong><br /><br />The negotiators, instead of correcting the tabulation, decided to change the rules for the calculation of blank votes. They allotted blank votes to the candidates' totals proportionately to each one's existing vote share. So Preval got 48.7% of the blank votes, Manigat 12%, etc., which pushed Preval up over the 50% bar. This solution does make sense- it assumes, probably correctly, that the blank votes resulted from confusion, and allocates the votes accordingly. The result is the same as if the CEP simply discarded the blank votes, and treated them the same as null votes.<br /><br />But what is sensible is not always what is legal. Preval's opponents know that a regime that can be negotiated into power can be negotiated out of power. They have already staked out the position that Preval is illegitimate because the deal changed the rules of the game in the middle of the contest. They will keep saying it, and will soon enough be joined by the international community who will keep saying it.  In the not-too-distant future, the election's illegitimacy will be accepted as "fact" in the elite Haitian and international press, at the UN, the OAS and  international financial institutions. The "fact" will justify withholding money for schools and hospitals, and sending money to political parties with no electoral support. The fact that Mr. Manigat had no chance of winning a second round, widely acknowledged now, will be forgotten or never learned by the next rotation of diplomats and journalists to Haiti.<br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong><br /><br />An editorial in this Friday's <em>New York Times</em> proclaims that this future begins now. The <em>Times</em> declares that the election deal "tarnishes the democratic legitimacy" of Preval's landslide. It recommends that Preval remove the tarnish by "reaching out to his opponents" (e.g. pursuing policies that the voters rejected), and "reining in his violence-prone supporters." The editorial did not suggest that Mr. Preval's opponents, many of whom were key players in the violent overthrow of Haiti's democracy two years ago which led to thousands of deaths, rein in their supporters. Nor, when it declared that "Haiti will need international support for a long time," did the <em>Times</em> mention its own groundbreaking report of January 29 that the U.S., among other members of the international community, intentionally undermined and overthrew Haiti's elected government in 2004.<br /><br />Although the <em>Times</em> does not find the context of two weeks or two years ago relevant, it does catalogue Preval's sins from his first administration, and it is a fair bet that we will hear this list often over the next five years.  The police "remained brutal and corrupt" (by any account, the police have become much more brutal and much more corrupt under the IGH); "no progress was made toward creating a competent judiciary" (Preval's administration saw the two best human rights prosecutions in Haiti's history in 2000, both lauded by the UN, Amnesty International and, among others, the <em>New York Times</em>; Preval also made the Judges Academy, dismantled by the IGH, operational); "legislative elections were badly flawed;" "drug trafficking flourished;" etc.<br /><br />Last week's election was Haiti's fourth Presidential election since 1990.  The previous three - 1990, 1995 and 2000 - were all conducted without serious violence. Each time, the voters supported the candidate of the Lavalas political movement at levels unheard of in "mature democracies"-no runner-up ever topped 16% of the vote. But each time a minority in Haiti, with support from the international community, successfully limited this mandate. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the victor in the first and third of those elections, suffered two successful coup d'etats, and spent half of his two terms in exile. President Preval managed to spend his whole term in office and pass power to an elected successor (the first Haitian President to do so), but a manufactured political crisis and perpetual squabbling about the extent of the Lavalas landslides prevented the seating of a legislature. More important, the crisis successfully diverted President Preval's energies and attention away from the economic and social development policies he was elected to implement. <br /><br />Haiti's politics are not parlor games. Each coup d'etat leads to thousands of deaths, and many more times that are killed by diseases that would be prevented or treated by the programs of a less embattled government. The life expectancy for men in Haiti has dropped below 50. It is far past time for the international community to stop condemning Haiti to repeating this outrageously unjust history.<br /><br /><em>Brian Concannon Jr., Esquire, directs the <a href="http://www.ijdh.org">Institute for J

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.umn.edu/facultyprofiles/kitrosserh.htm">Heidi Kitrosser</a> of the University of Minnesota School of Law says that White House arguments in defense of the NSA domestic surveillance program are pushing the limits of Presidential secrecy beyond proper constitutional bounds...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/heidikitrosser.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>wo of the most frequent and most apt criticisms made about the secret Presidential order authorizing spying by the National Security Agency ("NSA") are:<blockquote>1) the order violates the Constitution's separation of powers by authorizing activity in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ("FISA") and by thus usurping legislative authority; and<br />2) the secrecy of the Presidential order violates principles of democratic accountability.</blockquote>While each point independently has merit, it also is important to understand the connection between the two points.  Presidential adherence to legislative mandates is so important in large part because of the protections that are built into the legislative process, including the relative openness of that process.  It is no accident that the Constitution both leaves room for the President to operate in secret and subjects the President to substantial legislative control.  This constitutional design suggests that while secrecy often is a legitimate tool for the President to use in executing legislative policy, the propriety of such usage itself must be subject to reconsideration and to checking by the legislature to prevent it from turning tyrannical.  White House arguments in defense of the secret spying program -- that a general military force authorization should be read so broadly as to encompass such a program and that such a program is within the President's inherent powers even absent legislative authorization -- fly in the face of a constitutional design meant to keep the President, and Presidential secrecy, under careful control.<br />  <br />This interpretation follows from the Constitution's text and structure.  The Constitution brilliantly provides for relatively public, dialogic, dual-branch review before legislation may be passed.  The Constitution also provides for substantial legislative control with respect to military and domestic matters.  Thus, while the President is the "Commander in Chief," it is for Congress to declare war in the first place, to provide for the common defense, to raise and support the army and navy, to "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces" and to make other laws "necessary and proper" to effectuate its own powers and those of the President.  And it is the legislative process through which new policy affecting citizens' rights generally must pass.  The arduous public and dialogic process through which policy must be made is among the Constitution's most important protections against government tyranny.  Among other things, it reflects the founding generation's well-known fear of monarchical power.  It would be antithetical to this careful system were the President permitted to formulate and to execute secret policies that are immune from public and legislative checking.<br /><br />Support for this essay's constitutional interpretation also can be drawn from the same historical sources often used to support a broad Presidential discretion to keep secrets.  Proponents of such discretion often cite to two statements from the Federalist Papers &#8212; one by Alexander Hamilton and one by John Jay &#8212; explaining that an advantage of a single President (as opposed to a council of co-Presidents) is the relative ability of a single person to operate with "secrecy" and "dispatch."  What typically goes unmentioned, however, is that these statements exist within the context of larger discussions extolling the virtues of a unitary President, including the relative transparency, upon investigation, of a single person's doings.  For example, in the same essay in which he explains that "[d]ecision, activity, secrecy, and dispatch will generally characterize the proceedings of one man," Alexander Hamilton approvingly cites the responsibility and potential transparency of a unitary President.  Hamilton argues that "multiplication of the executive adds to the difficulty of detection," including the "opportunity of discovering [misconduct] with facility and clearness."  One person "will be more narrowly watched and most readily suspected."  This suggests a compromise between the advantages of Presidential secrecy and the risk of tyranny that such secrecy poses: the President can use his unique capacity for secret-keeping but such use must remain on a relatively short political leash, subject to legislative checking and revision. <br /> <br />White House arguments in defense of the secret spying program are antithetical to the Constitution's protective balance of powers.  The White House argues, first, that the September 14, 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force ("AUMF") directly authorizes the program.  This argument fails absent deference to the broadest and most counterintuitive of statutory interpretations by the President.  Such deference would substantially undermine the separation of powers by making legislation largely superfluous to Presidential decision-making.  Indeed, the AUMF's text speaks almost entirely of military force.  Naturally, the use of military force will require some activities incidental to such use.  But such use in no way clearly or intuitively encompasses the power to intercept Americans' phone calls with persons overseas.  The counterintuitive nature of this association is exacerbated by the context in which the Joint Resolution was created &#8212; one in which the FISA already comprehensively addressed the monitoring of calls made by U.S. citizens.  The counterintuitive nature of this association also is evidenced by the AUMF's history, which includes a congressional rebuff of White House attempts to enact a more broadly worded AUMF.  If so broad and counterintuitive an interpretation of the AUMF is antithetical to separated powers, then surely there is no constitutional legitimacy in the White House's alternative claim that the President's secret spying order is justified by his inherent constitutional powers in the face of contrary legislative authority.  <br /><br />Finally, experience since discovery of the NSA spying program reflects the dangers of unchecked Presidential secrecy.  First, while the program eventually came to light due to leaks, the program took place for roughly three years without public or general congressional knowledge and thus with no opportunity for political oversight.  Second, while the White House apparently notified a handful of congressional leaders about the program while it was ongoing, reports indicate that the leaders were instructed that the information was classified and that they were to share it with no one, a situation hardly conducive to oversight.  Indeed, a striking aspect of Attorney General Gonzales' recent Senate testimony on the program is the tension between his claim that the notified congresspersons surely could have "done something about [the program]" were they concerned about it, and his repeated criticism of the leaking that led to the program's disclosure.  Third, in spite of public and congressional concern since the program came to light, the White House to date has refused to release key details necessary to understand and evaluate the basic parameters of the program, including precisely when the program began.  Fourth, a number of factors suggest that the White House's reticence to answer questions in the wake of the program's revelation is politically strategic.  These factors include the Attorney General's relative amenability to answering questions po
sed by senators friendly to the program and President Bush's sudden public disclosure of details of a terrorist plot against Los Angeles in the wake of the program's revelation.  These examples, by no means exhaustive, illustrate the President's special capacity for secrecy and the dangers that such capacity breeds.  Such illustration reveals the wisdom of the Constitution's structural protections against unchecked Presidential secrecy and the damage that can be done by erosion of those protections.<br /><br /><em>Heidi Kitrosser currently is a visiting associate professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and an assistant professor at Brooklyn Law School.

		<title>The Iraqi Special Tribunal: One Chance to Get It Right</title>

Not just for the victims and the restoration of the rule of law in Iraq, but for the continued respect by the citizens of Iraq for institutions in general.  We tend to forget that the Iraqi people are emerging from over three long decades of darkness and despair, repressed by a megalomaniac who ruled absolutely.  The rule of the gun was more powerful than the rule of law in Iraq.  Saddam&#39;s trial could reverse this and begin a process whereby the Iraqi people will begin to respect the rule of law.  Get it wrong and the fledgling democracy that is the new Iraq is in trouble. In that light I proffer three thoughts for the reader to consider related to the Iraqi Special Tribunal and getting it right.<br /><br />First, the cornerstone of any emerging democracy, such as Iraq, is the rule of law.  If there is no respect for the law, then much of what has been accomplished may be for naught. In the Middle East, where strength and power are an admired trait, the rule of law has to be seen as more powerful than the rule of the gun.  A shaken confidence in the due process of law and the citizens of Iraq will look for other ways to build their society and new government.  The results may not be what anyone wants.  The current actions in the courtroom by the presiding judge and the indictees may bring the power of the law into question by the Iraqi people.   <br /><br />Second, the process has to appear to be fair and efficient.  Part and parcel with establishing the rule of law and respect for the law comes the perception that the law itself is fair and efficient.  We in the West tend to take fairness and general efficiency in our legal process as a given. In this part of the world it is not, nor is that process understood.  The lingering concerns that the United States continues to manipulate the process, whether true of not, have made the IST snake-bitten in the eyes of the international community and the Iraqi people.  Coupled with the fact that the current presiding judge lived in a town that was destroyed by Saddam, one of the defendants, causes one to doubt the fairness of the process.<br /><br />Third, the Iraqi people are going to have to live with the result, regardless of how the process ends.  The rule of law, its fairness and efficiency, make it easier for the Iraqi people to live with the results, despite the outcome.  Thus, all three of these concepts have to merge in a relatively seamless way to allow for the transition process from anarchy to democracy to move forward under the rule of law.  <br /><br />Despite its reputation as a bastard among the various tribunals, the IST is still the only forum by which one of the 20th Century&#39;s mega-murderers will be held accountable for his misdeeds. The judges and prosecutor have to get it right from the very beginning or we lose a rare chance to face down the beast of impunity in the Middle East and show the Iraqi people that the law is fair, that no one is above the law, and that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of the gun.<br /><br />On the 60th anniversary of the end of mankind&#39;s first attempt to face down impunity at Nuremberg, in 1946, the trial of Saddaam Hussein and his henchmen must reflect those key principles established there of fairness, openness, and respect of international norms or we will see a step backwards.  Sadly what is currently happening in Baghdad regarding the appearance of fairness and efficiency is lacking.  It remains to be seen whether they have it right. I have my doubts.<br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

		<title>Pentagon Process Subverted? The Lost Battle of Alberto Mora</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a TARGET="_blank" href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Geoffrey_Corn.htm">Geoffrey S. Corn</a>, Lt. Col. US Army (Ret.) and former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters, now a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that the disclosure of former US Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora&#39;s lost battle within the US Defense Department against what he considered flawed legal analysis of US interrogation and detentions policy suggests that the Pentagon&#39;s internal legal process has been subverted in the interests of a controversial policy agenda....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/cornforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>his week the public learned of the unsuccessful battle waged by former US Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora within the US Department of Defense legal community against flawed analysis of US law and international legal obligations and consequent detainee interrogation policies exposing prisoners in US custody at Guantanamo and elsewhere to harsh treatment and abuse.  The <em>New Yorker</em> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060227fa_fact">article</a> disclosing this battle, published online with Mora&#39;s own <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/images/pdfs/moramemo.pdf">internal memo</a> [PDF] describing it, reads like a confirmation of the worst fears of many legal experts outside of government. It chronicles the existence of an objective-oriented legal agenda pursued by a small but powerful circle of politically-connected disciples advocating an interpretation of executive power that knows virtually no limit; the intense concern this agenda triggered among both politically-appointed and career legal experts within the Department of Defense; and the subsequent marginalization of anyone who was audacious enough to challenge these interpretations.  Prior to publication of the <em>New Yorker</em> article, there had been numerous "hints" that numerous civilian and uniformed lawyers within the Department had engaged in a valiant but ultimately futile struggle against opinions supporting policies ranging from the creation of the military commissions to interrogation and detention procedures.  Mora's story, however, is a direct and profound illustration of how the customary paradigm of intra and inter agency process has been fundamentally subverted in order to ensure that legal analysis serves the needs of emerging policy.<br /><br /> Within the government legal community, it is often said that it is better not to know "how the sausage is made."  This reflects the fact that the intra and inter agency dialogue related to complex legal issues is often heated, involving multiple participants who sometimes seem more concerned with protecting their individual Service or Department interests than with the obligation to reach consensus that serves the best interests of the nation.  The saying also, however, reflects the equally significant reality that normally this process does in fact produce results that effectively and legitimately serve the larger purpose.  Thus, so long as the product "tastes good", it is sometimes better not to know how it was produced.<br /><br /> Alberto Mora's experience within this "sausage making process" illustrates that it is no longer possible to accept on faith that while it may be "ugly", the process is working effectively.  Instead, his experience demonstrates that the process itself - so critical to ensuring an effective and legitimate legal foundation for the policies related to the planning an execution of military operations &#8212; has been tainted.  In short, not only has a small circle of "unlimited executive power" advocates set an agenda that is inconsistent with longstanding legal interpretations related to such operations, but they have also disabled the internal Department of Defense (and by implication the wider Executive Branch) mechanisms intended to ensure broad consensus derived from the contributions of key international and operational legal experts.  As a result, instead of meaningful dialogue related to the complex legal issues that implicate both operational and service chains of command, Mora&#39;s experience suggests that any dissent from policy-enabling interpretations was summarily dismissed and the proponents marginalized from future participation in the analytical process.<br /><br /> Some might attempt to defend the process reflected in Mora's experience by reference to the warfighting chain of authority established by the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act.  This statute established a streamlined operational chain of command running from the President, through the Secretary of Defense, to the warfighting commanders of the joint commands with designated responsibility for conducting operations in the different regions of the world.  Thus, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, General Tommy Franks, the Commander of US Central Command (with geographic responsibility for the Middle East and Central Asia), reported not through any of the Service Chiefs (such as the Chief of Staff of the Army, or the Chief of Naval Operations), but directly to the Secretary of Defense, normally through the Secretary's statutorily defined military adviser, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Accordingly, proponents of the centralized process Mora struggled against might note that it was not Mora's role to question analysis and opinions developed by the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, because only that legal adviser is directly linked to the operational chain of command.<br /><br />Such a defense would be specious, as it ignores the longstanding process relied on to develop effective and legitimate legal analysis related to military operations.  Initially, it is critical to note that although the Service Chiefs are technically not part of this operational chain of command, in the realm of legal analysis the Service Judge Advocate's General (the senior uniformed lawyers for each of the four Services) have historically played a critical role in the formulation of legal positions related to operational issues.  Furthermore, as a result of Senate hearings in July 2005, it is a matter of public record that these senior officers had also been raising serious concerns over the same issues that triggered Mora's alarm.  The focal point for the intra-agency process designed to leverage the international and operational law expertise of all Service Judge Advocates was the Department of Defense Law of War Working Group (LOWWG).  This intra agency forum was established pursuant to the Department of Defense Law of War Program (DOD Directive 5100.77), which mandates Service participation.  While the LOWWG is chaired by a representative of the DOD General Counsel's office, it includes the international and operational law experts from each Service's Judge Advocate General's Office, and the Legal Adviser to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  This composition was intended to not only leverage the expertise of attorneys specializing in the law of war and working on a daily basis with law of war related issues, but also to ensure the Service Judge Advocate's General were able to raise concerns through their agents, and, if necessary directly with the DOD General Counsel.  The composition of this forum reflects the simple reality that much of the expertise on legal issues related to military operations is located in the supporting, as opposed to the direct chain of operational command.<br /><br /> The conspicuous absence of any reference to Mora addressing his concerns to the LOWWG, along with the discussion in the <em>New Yorker</em> article related to the concentration of decision-making outside of DOD, with the DOD General Counsel merely implementing the dictates of White House lawyers, suggests that the LOWWG, and th
e highly effective intra-agency vetting process it traditionally spearheaded, was marginalized by the General Counsel.  The mere fact that Mora had to raise concerns related to interrogation policies is itself evidence that this traditional process had been discarded.  As Mora acknowledges in the article, he did not expect to become involved in operational issues.  As Navy General Counsel, his role was to provide legal advice for the Secretary of the Navy; whereas his uniformed counterpart, the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, provided advice to the Chief of Naval Operations.  These two distinct roles, which are mirrored for each service, have traditionally meant that the Judge Advocate's General were primarily responsible for operationally related issues, hence their representation on the LOWWG.  Thus, his perceived need to intervene on these issues suggests marginalization of the Service Judge Advocates and their international and operational law experts.<br /><br /> Alberto Mora's experience in attempting to break through the intransigence associated with policy-driven legal analysis is indicative of broader failure to leverage the traditionally respected sources of international law authority within DOD.  The results have been profoundly discouraging.  Most observers were already familiar with the highly suspect analysis that provided the foundation for detention and interrogation policies promulgated by the Executive Branch.  Although much of this analysis was discredited by Jack Goldsmith's reassessments, serious questions remain regarding the lingering taint of these legal opinions.  <br /><br />And apparently the cycle continues. We now learn of an initial rejection by the Secretary of Defense of the proposal to endorse Common Article 3 of the four Geneva Conventions as the touchstone of all detainee operations (although there is no indication this is the final DOD position on this subject).    Thus, the distorted process has once again manifested itself in a decision even the most inexperienced military attorney &#8212; not to mention the law of war experts within and outside of DOD &#8212; would find almost incomprehensible.  For literally decades, the proposal apparently so categorically rejected has been the understood standard for US forces.  To learn that the intra-agency proposal to confirm this traditional understanding was rejected because it might deprive the Executive of needed flexibility is the consequence of allowing policy to dictate legal opinion, and the marginalization of the traditional process for developing legitimate legal analysis.<br /><br /> Alberto Mora's story is both troubling and admirable.  He certainly struggled to ensure DOD policies complied with the baseline standards of humane treatment that have been long understood by US forces as non-derogable.  It is more troubling, however, to contemplate not only his apparent inability to achieve this goal, but how the process used to develop the policies he fought against required someone in his position to take such extraordinary measures.  Perhaps we really may not want to know how the sausage is made.  But when, as of late, the sausage is so badly tainted, it&#39;s time to take a look at the machine that makes it and assess whether it&#39;s in need of repair.<br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S.

		<title>Disaster relief compared: Sri Lanka and New Orleans</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu"><strong>Andrew Wood</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh School of Law 1L, in New Orleans]: &quot;Exactly one year ago I was in the southeastern Sri Lankan village of Kirinda wrapping up a three month stint of relief work following the Asian tsunami.  Now, as I reflect from New Orleans in the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina, I cannot help but compare the two situations. <br /><br />Though two completely different worlds, some of the problems that the relief and clean-up efforts face are remarkably similar.  In Sri Lanka and other developing nations in which international relief efforts are staged, liberal spending by governments and large organizations accomplishes incredible amounts of good, but also results in stories of corruption, an imbalance of the local economy, some people being taking advantage of, and others doing the taking.  As in Sri Lanka, everyone I talk to in New Orleans seems to be frustrated with the government and has a story &#8212; or at least a theory &#8212; regarding corruption at various levels.  In Sri Lanka the government has been trying to prevent people from building homes too close to the coastline for the safety of the people.  But if you ask any local fisherman, you would most likely hear an opinion that the government just wants to build resorts on the beach and make money.  In the U.S., you need only to open a newspaper to read of frustrations regarding the government&#39;s handling of the situation following <a href="/currentawareness/katrinadisaster.php">Hurricane Katrina</a> [continuing coverage on JURIST].<br /><br />Another similarity is the indiscriminate nature of each respective disaster.  In every tsunami- or hurricane-affected area, stores, restaurants, resorts, schools, places of worship, rich, poor &#8212; everyone was affected.  Photos from Phuket show locals and foreigners running side by side - the tsunami&#39;s victims ranged from a Thai prince to the poorest peasant and the damage stretched through a multitude of countries.  Likewise, Katrina affected the rich and the poor; it was oblivious to race, religion, wealth or status.  In New Orleans the 9th Ward, one of the poorer areas of the city, was devastated and is still uninhabitable.  Wealthy areas with million dollar homes such as Bellaire are also empty.  <br /><br />This week I have been assigned to work with <a href="http://www.nolac.org/">New Orleans Legal Assistance</a> (NOLAC) along with Elizabeth Seitz and Candace Stockney, two fellow Pitt Law students who were awesome to work with for the week.  We have each been assisting lawyers with their overwhelming caseloads.  I have spent most of the week helping Laura Tuggle, a talented NOLAC attorney in charge of clients with housing issues.  There is, of course, no shortage of clients, and I have been assisting by writing appeal letters on behalf of those clients to the <a href="http://www.fema.gov/">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA). <br /><br />From my perspective, one of the biggest similarities is the role I&#39;ve been able to play in assisting in relief efforts.  It is certainly a humbling experience to be faced with this unprecedented and massive challenge, and it is easy to feel as though a small personal effort is insignificant.  And it is only natural to come into a situation like this wanting to make a difference &#8212; to change the world in some small way.  As my week at NOLAC comes to a close, I find myself wondering, &quot;Did I make a difference?  Does the relatively small amount of work I did really chip away at the block?  Was I able to demonstrate to the attorneys and their clients that I assisted in New Orleans that people around the country care about this plight, and want to pitch in?&quot;  These are the same questions I asked myself a year ago after the tsunami in Sri Lanka, where my work focused on the rebuilding of fishing boats and therefore the livelihood of villagers.  And I am still asking the same questions; today some people complain that a problem in Sri Lanka is that there are more small off-shore boats than before the tsunami and over-fishing is becoming a problem.  Did I help individuals in a village, or contribute to a problem?  Did my week of assistance in New Orleans do anything to help?  <br /><br />I don&#39;t think there are any easy answers to these questions, and there may be a bit of truth no matter how each is answered. But I would like to think the answer is &quot;yes,&quot; that I did help in some small way.  I console myself with clich&eacute;s like &quot;every little bit makes a difference.&quot;  And I truly believe that there is power in numbers.  <br /><br />I have been extremely impressed by the <a href="http://www.studenthurricanenetwork.org/">Student Hurricane Network</a>, and how this student-run organization has facilitated the involvement of hundreds of law students that are willing to help.  Now that I am preparing to return to my first year law classes in Pittsburgh, I hope that knowledge of the involvement of the Student Hurricane Network will continue to chip away at the massive amount of work, and help to further the awareness of the needs in New Orleans and the other affected Gulf Coast areas.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu"><strong>Tahira Bland</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh School of Law 2L, in New Orleans]: &quot;Anne Bryson, Gina Mosley, and I have been assigned to a non-profit law firm, the Justice Center. The primary focus of the Justice Center is to provide indigent criminal defense. <br /><br />Hurricane Katrina caused severe damage to legal institutions in New Orleans. For example, the state courthouse suffered extensive damage from flooding. Critical evidence that was stored in the courthouse was destroyed (e.g., cocaine dissolving, devastation of paper documents, deterioration of photos). The parish clerk had a duty to use her best efforts in preserving the integrity of the evidence. As a result, the first day was quite eventful due to fact that we witnessed the sentencing of Kimberly Butler, Orleans Parish Clerk. Ms. Clark was charged with failure to comply with a court order. This charged stemmed from failing to protect the integrity of evidence and failure to relinquish certain responsibilities. In addition, Ms. Clark avoided receiving the summons to appear in court. The sentence was 72 hours of prison and a $500 fine. <br /><br />During the evacuation, inmates were evacuated to prisons throughout the state. The mass evacuation caused chaos for the court docket, resulting in the inability to produce inmates for scheduled court dates. <br /><br />Part of our duty at the Justice Center is to observe court proceedings to determine constitutional violations. It should be noted that all but six public defenders were laid off. These six attorneys are now responsible for thousands of cases. <br /><br />The proceedings observed overwhelmingly dealt with misdemeanors which under normal circumstances, a defendant would be released on their own recognizance or required to pay a small bond. Instead, many defendants have languished in jail since the hurricane without formal charges or proper legal representation. For instance, there was a 14-year girl who has been in jail since August with no legal representation. In another example, the bond of an 18 year-old was set at $1,000 after he was charged with possession of half of a joint and failing to register his bicycle.<br /><br />In conclusion, the chain of events occurring in the post-Katrina legal system has led to enhanced inequality between those who can afford private attorneys and those who depend on public defenders.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu"><strong>Kevin Baum</strong></a> and  <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu"><strong>Ricardo Alvarado</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh School of Law 3L and 1L, in New Orleans]: &quot;The Pro Bono Project&#39;s (PBP) mission is to provide free quality civil legal services to the poor by engaging volunteer attorneys to provide pro bono legal services. The Pro Bono Project has also expanded services to include some direct legal assistance. <br /><br />Kevin and I along with two Loyola Chicago law students and about 20 Georgetown law students were assigned to the project to provide legal assistance to clients affected by the Katrina disaster. <br /><br />On Monday, March 6th 2006 at about 9am we walked into the offices of the Pro Bono Project in New Orleans. We were met by a bubbly yet stern lady, Ellen Barrett Artopoeus, the PBP Staff Attorney. She quickly handed each of us a case file and had us get right to work. We were all assigned succession cases&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;of course all the students coming from the northeast had no idea what that was. Apparently, succession is the civil law version of a probate and is necessary to get title from a deceased parent to their heirs. Many of our clients lived in or took care of their parent&#39;s home after their parent&#39;s death, however they never transferred title to the property in their own name. Both FEMA and insurance companies will only provide funds to the title holder, therefore it was our job to wade through often many layers of heirs to try to put our clients in the position to receive funds as owners. <br /><br />We had the opportunity to interview clients and even intake new clients. Interviewing was a particularly difficult task since many clients had been displaced since Katrina and tracking them down to their new homes was an issue. Phone numbers had been disconnected, or were often changed, but by the end of the week most, if not all, of us had made contact with our clients. We also searched the remnants of county records for information pertinent to our cases, however we had a difficult time since many of the records were either destroyed by the flooding or relocated to different parts of the city and Baton Rouge, LA. <br /><br />However, we did have some success with the files, a few cases were closed, but more importantly we put a large dent in the succession case load. Hopefully we have put the PBP on a good enough footing to be able to close the rest of the files by next week when the UNC Law students arrive. <br /><br />The rest of the trip apart from work has been a big success. Although many businesses are still closed and the city is rebuilding, we&#39;ve been able to eat, drink, and enjoy the culture of New Orleans. There&#39;s definitely a feeling that they will rebuild, and there is optimism about having this city return as the jewel of the south. However, there is an equal fear that the rest of the country may be forgetting about them, especially the Federal Government. There is much work to be done and we are grateful that we had the opportunity to extend a helping hand and hope to be back in a short time and see the whole city get back on its feet.&quot;<br />

		<title>New Orleans Juvenile Court notes</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu"><strong>Courtney Murphy</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh School of Law 2L, in New Orleans]: &quot;Like so much in New Orleans, both pre- and post-Katrina, the Juvenile Court system is a dichotomy, its two faces coexisting uneasily.  Looking at the system as it is now, I feel hope and also an overwhelming despair.<br /><br />Our supervisor is with the Juvenile Court in order to reform the system and make New Orleans a model juvenile justice system.  Because they are starting almost from scratch, this is the perfect time to introduce such a program.  To that end, the Student Hurricane Network volunteers (6 of us) were mostly assigned to research and summarize various model systems around the country.  The facts and figures that we dealt with were somewhat sobering at times (juvenile incarceration rates, etc) but the work itself was mostly positive.  The programs we were reading about produced results, and implementing them in New Orleans can only be an improvement.  We were generating things that will be used to make the system in New Orleans better.  That is a good feeling&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;<br /><br /> But things are not good yet.  The court is facing severe staffing shortages.  More than 2/3 of the staff was laid off after the hurricane, though reminders of them were everywhere, including in the clerks&#39; office, where we worked a lot of the time.  It is really bizarre to sit at the desk of an employee that hasn&#39;t been cleaned out yet, pictures and other personal belongings still there &#8212; when they left work on Friday, August 26th, they had no idea that they wouldn&#39;t be back on Monday.   In the clerks&#39; office, there are stations for 10 or 12 people, but there are only two people currently working in that office.  The workload has exploded for them.<br /><br /> The court proceedings themselves are continuing, though because of big caseloads in the District Attorney&#39;s office and shortages of public defenders, judges are limited to holding court one day per week.  We were invited to sit in on one judge&#39;s proceedings on Thursday.  This was a tough couple of hours for me. <br /> <br />Things started with a bang &#8212; the first juvenile on the docket was caught in a lie to the judge, and sentenced to 30 days for perjury.  He was handcuffed right away, and what was heartbreaking to me was the fact that he knew just what to do with his hands&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; he was ready to be cuffed almost before the bailiff stood up.  Fifteen or sixteen, he had been in juvenile detention before, and was an old hand at the procedures.  He stayed in the courtroom, handcuffed, until our group left, and for who knows how long after. <br /> <br />An interesting aspect of these proceedings was one of the motivational devices that the judge used to keep the juveniles in line, if they were released to their parents&#39; custody.  A juvenile released to his parents&#39; custody is under house arrest, only allowed to go to school.  If the juvenile is out of his parent&#39;s supervision and rearrested, the parent(s) would also be incarcerated.  If the child skips school, he spends a day in jail, and so does the parent.  If the child is suspended, he goes to jail (three days per one day of suspension), and the parent either attends school on those days, or volunteers at the school.  This is a tough system, and I am of two minds as to its effectiveness.  On one hand, it may serve as a motivator: the parents have a much higher stake in fulfilling their responsibility to the child and will maybe make the effort to do so.  Also, maybe the child will start to understand accountability, if it is not just him being punished for his transgressions &#8212; it is his mother or father, and maybe his younger siblings or grandparents by extension.  On the other hand, if a child is 16, with only a single mother raising him, has been out of control for five years or more, and outweighs his mother by 100 pounds, how is she supposed to exert control over him?  Should she be incarcerated, absences risking her job and perhaps leaving younger children uncared-for?  How exactly does this benefit the juvenile justice system as a whole?  I really don&#39;t know, but it is a concept that makes an observer, and probably a lot of parents, consider some hard questions.<br /><br />The hurricane wasn&#39;t far from the scene at any point in the courtroom.  There were several cases on the docket whose subject had not been located, kids on probation, and kids who were to be tried.  Some just haven&#39;t resurfaced, and for various reasons there hadn&#39;t been a major effort on the part of the juvenile court to find them (probation officer shuffling, an understaffed DA&#39;s office, etc).  There were others, though, whose probation officers had searched for them, going through the databases available, checking with FEMA and other agencies, and they still hadn&#39;t turned up.  So either these juveniles really don&#39;t want to be found, and are doing a remarkably good job of staying hidden, or, well, that other possibility&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; especially when the last known address was in the Lower Ninth Ward.<br /><br />The city as a whole is much the same way.  There are many reasons to hope, and still lots of sights and realizations that can lead to despair.  During my visit, I was able to see several of my old friends, and hear stories of Tulane Law School running a high speed.  Many of my favorite places have reopened, the St. Patrick&#39;s Day parade rolled, and the progress I noted since my last short visit in December was great to see.  But there are the small things &#8212; a favorite bar boarded up, and obviously not coming back, massive traffic jams where there are no working signals &#8212; that are reminders that things are not okay.  And then there are the large things &#8212; Lakeview, the Lower Ninth, all of St. Bernard&#39;s Parish &#8212; that are still there, the wounds still raw, the wreckage still sitting.<br />  <br />It seems fitting that the Juvenile Court is exhibiting the same study in contrasts.  I, for one, am choosing hope for them and the city.  The system the JC is working to implement has worked elsewhere, and with time they will be modified (and staffed!) to work in New Orleans.  As for the city, time is the balm that it needs also.  More people are returning every month, and it seems like the Federal Government is inching closer to giving the disaster areas everything they need. <br /><br />There are reasons to hope, and many of them.  So long as the hard moments are outnumbered by the hopeful ones, the New Orleans Juvenile Court and the city of New Orleans will continue on the road to reform and recovery, both ending up better than they were before.&quot;<br />

		<title>Rebuilding the Mississippi Gulf Coast</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/"><strong>Frank Swaney</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh School of Law 2L in Gulfport, Mississippi]: &quot;Forgotten largely by national media coverage and private donations, the Mississippi Gulf Coast represents the area hardest hit by Hurricane Katrina. The Mississippi Center for Justice therefore has a 2-fold job on its hands, dealing with the problems, and drawing attention to them. The main focus of the Center has been addressing the Coast&#39;s affordable housing crisis. This was a major issue in an area that has experienced a boom in casino-related development since the late 1980&#39;s. Couple that with the fact that Hurricane Katrina destroyed 50% of the affordable housing on the Coast and the problem has reached epidemic proportions. The Center is trying to draw attention to the problem so that low income and other affordable housing is rebuilt as part of the plan to rebuild the Gulf Coast &quot;Bigger and Better.&quot; <br /><br />This week I have been working with attorneys in Justice Court here on the coast both observing proceedings and preparing to defend low income individuals who are faced with eviction. I have also been surveying the damages and repairs that have been made to low income and other unsubsidized apartment buildings and communities. Many of the communities show no signs of life, and worse, no signs of repair. In many places debris has been removed, but nothing else has been accomplished. The problem here is even greater than I had imagined. As someone who had been to the Gulf Coast pre-storm, I found the level of devastation far beyond what even the most sensational news reports have shown the country. The entire community of Waveland, Mississippi is almost completely wiped off the map. Many homeowners have started to rebuild, but for every home on the coast being repaired, there is another that has either been bulldozed, or appears that a bulldozer will be the only possible outcome for it. There are entire lots filled with FEMA trailers and campers.<br /><br />There is a very surreal feel to the entire area. At times here on the Coast, it feels as if I am an extra in some sort of post-apocalyptic movie, only the scenes are real. It doesn&#39;t feel like this is really the United States of America, it feels like some third world country. The stories of people who still don&#39;t have FEMA &#39;trailers&#39; 6 months after the storm because of bureaucratic screw-ups are commonplace. It is important for America to realize that we not only failed the response to the storm in the short term, but it also appears that we are failing it in the intermediate and long term timeframes. There is an ongoing fight to make sure that &quot;bigger and better&quot; doesn&#39;t become synonymous for &quot;without poor folks.&quot; To top it all off, what national attention still remains is focused on New Orleans, a microcosm of this is the fact that of 16 students from Pitt, only one of us came to the Gulf Coast. For those in the legal community who still feel that there is work to be done and help to be given, I only ask you not to forget Mississippi, as almost everyone else has.&quot;<br />

Foley</strong></a> [Florida Coastal School of Law]: &quot;If U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema throws out the government&#39;s bid to have the death penalty imposed on confessed al-Qaida conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, as a result of apparent <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/moussaoui-judge-recesses-trial-as.php">misconduct by government lawyers in the sentencing hearing</a>,  <br />she will be doing the government -- and rest of us -- a giant favor.  Moussaoui will end up being sentenced to life without parole. It&#39;s best to keep him alive, since he pled guilty in the case and apparently has knowledge and understanding of Al Qaeda.  If our government kills him, we can never get any further information from him. <br /><br />In this way, Judge Brinkema can help our political leaders avoid the mistake they made in killing Timothy McVeigh after he was convicted of the 1996 Oklahoma City bombing. There has been speculation that there were other people involved in that bombing besides McVeigh and Terry Nichols (also convicted for perpetrating this crime) who remain unknown to us. You never know: McVeigh, perhaps years from now, might have had a change of heart.  That could have led us to the other perpetrators, and people associated with them.  In an effort to seek retribution, our leaders helped him take that information to the grave.  If accomplices remain at large, they may strike again.<br /><br />Intelligence is a more potent weapon than revenge.&quot;<br />

		<title>Some things can&#039;t be lost in translation in New Orleans</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/"><strong>Candace Stockey</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh School of Law 3L, in New Orleans]: &quot;This week, I, along with our fearless leader, Elizabeth Seitz (Pitt Law 3L), and Andrew Wood (Pitt Law 1L), volunteered at New Orleans Legal Assistance (NOLAC), a non-profit legal aid center.  Personally, I have focused on research for an appellate brief regarding an action to establish paternity following the alleged father&#39;s death.  But here in Louisiana, they call these things &quot;filiation actions.&quot;  And a motion to dismiss is really called &quot;an exception.&quot;  Oh yeah, and don&#39;t forget that the proper term for a statute of limitations is a &quot;period of prescription.&quot;  <br /><br />I can attest to the difficulty that attorneys and law students from the other 49 states have translating the strange version of legalese that is utilized here in the great State of Louisiana.  Civil law is similar to our familiar common law system, but it has its own quirks.  Here, the law is mainly codified in statutes, compared to our reliance on precedential case law.  Common law statutes are written much more broadly, open to interpretation by the judiciary, compared to the precise nature of statutes here.  Also, there are many slight eccentricites in the law compared to other states.  For example, one unique legal fiction is that a child may have more than one &quot;father&quot; here.  Only in Louisiana.  <br /><br />Getting beyond the work I have done in NOLAC&#39;s law library and on my laptop, I had the opportunity to staff the Legal Aid table at the Disaster Relief Center (or DRC, a.k.a. &quot;FEMA tent&quot;) in St. Bernard Parish yesterday afternoon.  Let me briefly set the scene: You drive up to the now-defunct WalMart SuperCenter amid spray-painted signs reading &quot;Hurricane Relief - Enter Here&quot; and &quot;God Bless St. Bernard&#39;s.&quot;  Pulling into the crowded parking lot, you would think that there was a &quot;rollback&quot; sale going on inside WalMart.  Actually, it&#39;s closed for business, but a yellow and white circus-style tent, complete with a PVC pipe cross at the top, is open for folks to gather free groceries.  Next to the grocery tent sits the FEMA tent, which has been described as &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for those impacted by Katrina.  <br /><br />As you walk through the doors, a security officer searches your belongings for weapons and other prohibited items and you enter a line for an &quot;entrance interview.&quot;  Folks are given a hot pink form which lists all of the agencies, charities and organizations located around the perimeter of the tent.  These include FEMA, of course, the Small Business Administration, the IRS, the EPA, various State agencies, assorted religious charities, and us: Legal Aid.  The attorney who brought me to the DRC, Marisa Katz, has been sitting at the Legal Aid table since October 2005.  She told me stories of how she would often watch people break down into tears in front of her.  This tendancy was exacerbated by the fact that the Legal Aid table is the last one that people visit after making their rounds through the tent.  After hearing &quot;no&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; in response to their questions over and over, unanswerable questions at the Legal Aid table would simply push them over the edge.  Marisa would often go home at the end of the day, overwhelmed, and break down herself.  To call this work emotionally draining is quite the understatement.  These days, though, as the deadline to apply for a FEMA trailer quickly approaches, most of her work is performed in her capacity as a notary.  Apparently, EVERYTHING has to be notarized here in Louisiana.  Another random aspect of the civil law system.  Marisa notarizes all documents for free, no questions asked.  Well, besides those that begin with, &quot;Do you swear and attest that...&quot; or &quot;May I please see your identification?&quot; <br /><br />As folks exit the FEMA tent, the security officer collects the pink form, which has been checked and initialed by a person at each table visited.  I was told that this form assists the government in keeping track of statistics about Katrina relief.  I sure hope that it works.<br /><br />There are DRCs all around the city of New Orleans and throughout the Gulf Coast.  Some have been closed as the need for them has diminished.  But, the demand remains strong in St. Bernard Parish, as approximately 300-400 persons come through the DRC each day.  The most devastating thing that I learned about this Parish was that Katrina caused nearly one million gallons of oil to leak or spill from three separate crude oil refinery operations there.  Thousands of citizens returned home to find not only extensive flood and mold damage, but that their remaining property had been coated in oil and other petroleum products.  My research at NOLAC has unearthed about thiry class action lawsuits in St. Bernard Parish filed against these oil companies.  Some of the classes have already been certified and others await their turn in the overwhelmed and debilitated state and federal courts here.  <br /><br />I could go on at length about all of the experiences, legal and otherwise, that I have had here.  But, I will leave you with this: For most Americans, including myself, Katrina is something that you think about when you see another article in the newspaper or an update on the news.  For these amazing people of the Gulf Coast, Katrina is all they think about.  It&#39;s all they talk about.  And for good reason.  There is not one square block of property that is unaffected, thus, you can&#39;t exist here without being constantly reminded of how much Katrina has devastated this part of America...and its residents.  Their lives may never be the same again.  <br /><br />My fears about being baffled by the concepts and terms in Louisiana&#39;s system of civil law have come to fruition, then quelled.  Because we all speak the language of compassion.  Even lawyers and law students.    <br /><br />ReNew Orleans.  Please.&quot;<br />

		<title>The UN Guantanamo Report: False Premise, Flawed Conclusions</title>

Contrary to the findings of the Report, the United States is perfectly complying with the proper rule of law associated with engaging the enemy combatants of al-Qa&#39;eda and their allies (predominantly the Taliban).<br /><br />     The international community, especially the well-established democracies led by the United States, is faced with an enemy and a &quot;war&quot; unlike anything the world has ever known.  The foot solders of militant Islam are not common criminals or even common terrorists in the traditional meaning of the concept.  The scope of al-Qa&#39;eda and their allies is so great that the entity constitutes a &quot;virtual State&quot; that can only be dealt with under the long established laws of war.  This has been the position of the United States government since the &quot;armed attack&quot; of September 11, 2006.  <br /><br />     The fact that a state of international armed conflict between the United States and the al-Qa&#39;eda network came into being on September 11, 2001, constitutes the fundamental legal foundation for understanding the appropriate rule of law that should be applied.  Even NATO recognized the need to characterize the attacks under the rubric of the laws or war and not under common criminal law principles when they invoked Article 5 of the NATO treaty because one of its members, the United States, had suffered an unprovoked &quot;armed attack.&quot; <br /><br />     Rational people understand that the escalating and often uncontrollable level of disorder and violence that characterizes the Global War on Terrorism can only be met by using the unique set of laws established for armed conflict.  While it is true that the laws of war need to be revised (and there are many areas of complaint) to encompass the new paradigm posed by the forces of militant Islam, critics of all stripes should assist in this process instead of voicing false charges that the United States government officially engages in a policy of &quot;torture,&quot; &quot;human rights abuses,&quot; &quot;illegality,&quot; etc.  vis a vis the al-Qa&#39;eda and their allies.<br /><br />     Unfortunately, the recent Report issued by the United Nations Human Rights Commission on the situation of detainees at Guantanamo Bay repeats the misguided and sophomoric attacks on America that are all too familiar.  While the Report is chalked full of blatant distortions of fact (the special rapporteurs refused to even visit the facilities at Guantanamo) drawn from former detainees with a clear inclination to lie (if you can murder you can lie) and their attorney&#39;s, the central and fundamental flaw of the Report is that it refuses to recognize the fact that a state of armed conflict exists between the United States and the armed and vicious fighters of the radical al-Qa&#39;eda network.  Instead, the Report wholeheartedly adopts a false premise that the United States &quot;is not currently engaged in an international armed conflict between two Parties to the &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; Geneva Conventions.&quot;  Thus, in their eyes, the detainees are entitled to all the provisions of international law that would otherwise not apply.  In short, they should be released.<br /><br />     Not only does the United States reject this false premise, but it is not supported by any pronouncement or resolution from the United National Security Council.  On the contrary, immediately following al-Qa&#39;eda&#39;s armed attack of September 11, 2001, Security Council Resolution 1368 recognized that the United States had the inherent right of self-defense recognized under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations - &quot;[r]ecognizing the inherent right of the individual or collective self-defense in accordance with the Charter.&quot;  In essence, the Security Council recognized what the Human Rights Commission now rejects - that the United States has suffered an &quot;armed attack&quot; by an organized force significant enough in scope to invoke the laws or war.<br /><br />     Thus, under the laws of war, the purpose of detaining these enemy combatants is to ensure that they do not return to engage in combat activities against the United States and, in this unique situation, to allow American officials the opportunity to gather any necessary intelligence about the terrorist&#39;s organizational infrastructure, financial network, communication system, weapon supply lines and plans for future terror attacks.  As is the practice in all wars, the purpose of detention is not to punish the enemy combatant, but to protect the host nation from future acts of violence by the enemy.  Contrary to the Report, there is simply nothing illegal about the practice of indefinite detention in time of war.  <br /><br />     Again, the majority of the fighters held in the specially built facility named Camp Delta in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were captured on the battlefields of Afghanistan.  Although all of the detainees are said to be participants in the Global War on Terrorism, it is true that the Bush administration has not deemed these detainees as eligible for the special status of &quot;prisoner of war&quot; under the Third Geneva Convention.  The reason that the Third Geneva Convention does not apply is because both the Taliban fighters and the al-Qa&#39;eda fighters fail to qualify as lawful enemy combatants under the applicable provisions of international law.  Specifically, prisoner of war status is only conferred on persons who are &quot;[m]embers of armed forces of a Party to the conflict&quot; or members of militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; provided that such &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; fulfill[s]&quot; four specific conditions:<ul><li>That of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;<br /><li>That of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;<br /><li>That of carrying arms openly; and<br /><li>That of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.</ul>Clearly, the al-Qa&#39;eda and their allies do not get the special status of prisoners of war, but are more properly classified as unlawful enemy combatants.  Nevertheless, despite the fact that the Third Geneva Convention does not apply to these enemy combatants, the Bush administration has clearly treated all detainees in accordance with the humanitarian concerns set out in the Geneva Conventions.  Accordingly, the detainees receive regular visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross, diplomats from their respective nations, military attorneys, and various other fact finding groups.  As noted, the Special Rapporteurs were also invited but were content to issue a Report without viewing the facility.  <br /><br />     Since the detainees are not prisoners of war, they can be questioned.  Whereas Article 17 of the Third Geneva Convention
provides that prisoners of war are only required to give their &quot;surname, first names and rank, date of birth, and army regimental, personal or serial number, or failing this, equivalent information,&quot; unlawful enemy combatants may be interrogated.  <br /><br />    Certainly, if the Third Geneva Convention covered the detainees, American authorities would not be entitled to interrogate them or obtain additional information.  However, enemy combatants who are not prisoners of war do not fall under the protections of the Third Geneva Convention and may therefore be questioned by American interrogators on additional topics of interest.  <br /><br />    A recurring allegation the Report stressed was the charge of torture or ill-treatment by American officials of certain detainees.  These claims were generally associated with the issue of interrogations, but also extend to criticisms of the living conditions of the detainees.  Simply put, there is no evidence that the United States engages in an official command directed policy of torture or ill-treatment of the detainees.  While government officials responsible for gathering information from detainees certainly employ the full range of permissible interrogation tactics to include offering various incentives such as money, engaging in trickery, or offending cultural habits, they do not violate the Torture Convention.  Again, since the detainees are not entitled to prisoner of war status, international law does not forbid interrogation so long as it is conducted free of torture or ill-treatment.  The fact of the matter is that American soldiers who have engaged in  misconduct have done so in their individual capacity and the military has done a superior job in investigating the allegations and punishing those few individuals who have been guilty (e.g., Abu Ghraib) of abuse.  <br /><br />     A more fruitful area of concern that the Report touched on is the claim that even if one agrees that the detainees may be held and questioned, the process of deciding what do to with the more than 500 detainees in Guantanamo Bay is far too lengthy.  However, if one uses the length of detention in previous wars as a standard, the current detention is below the average for other wars.  <br /><br />     In summary, by rejecting the Report, the United States is not holding itself above the law.  Indeed, the government is acting under the appropriate rule of law associated with the dentition and treatment of enemy (illegal) combatants during war.  That rule of law is set out in the laws of war and the United States has followed both the spirit and letter of the law in the handling of these people.  <br />   <br /><br /><em>Jeffrey Addicott is Associate Professor of Law and Director, Center for Terrorism Law, St. Mary&#39;s University School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.duq.edu/Academics/AcaFacGor.html">Ken Gormley</a> of Duquesne University School of Law says that issues arising out of the President&#39;s domestic surveillance program are best addressed not by sweeping proposals of censure or legalization, but rather by carefully-crafted legislative reforms...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kengormley.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he White House has acknowledged that in the wake of the September 11th attacks, President Bush authorized the National Security Agency  to institute a program to monitor and intercept communications between  Americans and individuals abroad, presumably to pierce the al-Qaeda terror network.  According to the Justice Department&#39;s &quot;white paper&quot; published in January, these domestic wiretaps and interceptions were carried out without warrants.  They circumvented the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA,  by which Congress set up a special court  to handle precisely these sorts of emergency requests from the executive branch. <br /><br />In testimony last month before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales defended the Bush Administration&#39;s practice by insisting that it was &quot;vital to the national defense&quot;  and consistent with the President&#39;s &quot;inherent powers&quot; to conduct war.   President Bush has similarly stated that as commander-in-chief, he must possess the power to fight &quot;our enemies&quot; wherever -- and however -- he sees fit.<br /><br />I do not question the good faith of our President and our Attorney General.  These are extraordinary times in our nation&#39;s history.  I agree that the President&#39;s power as commander-in-chief -- even on American soil -- is potentially heightened, at least  for a period of time, given the attacks on the World Trade Center and the continued threat of attacks from a new brand of  enemy.<br /> <br />At the same time, the defense offered by the Bush Administration for its wiretap program is eerily similar to the losing argument advanced by President Harry Truman in 1952, when he seized the nation's steel mills during the Korean War.  The Supreme Court concluded that Truman's professed goal of &quot;keeping the country from going to hell,&quot;  even aggregating all of his powers under Article II, was not sufficient to nullify the Constitution.<br /> <br />As Justice Jackson declared in his now-famous concurrence in the <em>Steel Seizure Case</em>, presidential power was at its high point in matters of foreign affairs and in the &quot;theater of war.&quot;  It was at its &quot;lowest ebb&quot; on American turf, especially when the president had acted without Constitutional or Congressional support.<br /> <br />Applying these lessons of history, at least four problems are evident with respect to  the Bush administration's secret surveillance program. <br /><br />First, nothing in the text of the Constitution specifically gives the President the power to bypass the warrant requirement of the 4th Amendment, on the domestic front, even during times of emergency.<br /><br />Second, the administration&#39;s program circumvents a specific act of Congress, which establishes the FISA court and sets forth detailed procedures for conducting surveillance of precisely this sort, involving citizens and residents of the United States. <br /> <br />Third, that power is even further diminished  because the Bush administration&#39;s program collides with rights of American citizens and residents under the Bill of Rights; namely, those right protected by the Fourth Amendment.   This collision potentially puts the President&#39;s power at an even lower point on the Constitutional continuum than that of President Truman in the <em>Steel Seizure Case</em>.<br /><br />Fourth, if one adapts Justice Jackson&#39;s <em>Steel Seizure</em> test and applies it to Congress, one discovers that Congress is at its zenith in exercising powers in this matter.  Congress has the power to establish inferior courts and to define their jurisdiction.  Congress also has the power to enact laws ensuring that the 4th Amendment is observed;  it has done so with detailed wiretap statutes since the 1960&#39;s.  Congress additionally has the exclusive power to legislate on domestic matters and to declare war.   Congress is at a high point in terms of its power here.  President Bush is at rock bottom.<br /> <br />It has been nearly five years since the events of 9-11.  There is a Constitutional mechanism in place (i.e. the amendment process set forth in Article V of the Constitution) if the executive branch believes its powers on the homefront must be enhanced beyond what Congress and the Constitution already provide it.  Unless we are prepared to say that the President may unilaterally suspend the Constitution for an indefinite period in order to deal with emergencies that have no end-point, our system cannot survive without demanding that the executive branch abide by the limitations imposed by the Constitution's text.<br /><br /><center>* * *</center><br />Yet this is not the time for partisan battles or finger-pointing.  I do not agree with the current proposal of Senator Russell Feingold (D. Wis.) to censure President Bush.  Nor do I agree, however, with recent Republican proposals that would validate the existing secret program and allow the President and a committee of Congress to decide what secret surveillance of American citizens was permissible in the future, excluding the judicial branch from the process entirely.   Several legislative reforms are necessary if defects in the Bush Administration program are to be corrected.  Achieving these reforms must be our highest priority, as a nation.<br /><br />First, the FISA statute has been fine-tuned and subjected to judicial scrutiny since 1978.  It already provides flexible and relaxed standards to the executive branch.  It works.  It should be adhered to by the Bush Administration.  At the same time, the statute should be updated to deal with three decades' worth of technological change.<br /><br />Second, revising FISA  to give the executive branch tools to fight the war on terror is laudable.  Yet any such revisions must maintain the Constitutional mechanism of judicial review.   Federal agencies that engage in secret  surveillance programs  -- seeking to gather up electronic communications involving American citizens that may provide information about foreign terrorists --  should be required to apply to the FISA court for a &quot;program-based warrant.&quot;   This <em>in camera</em> application would require permission from a neutral and detached judge (or panel of judges) to engage in a specific type of surveillance program for a specific period of time.  The program-based warrant would explain the nature of the surveillance in detail and set forth reasons why it was impossible for the government to obtain a traditional search warrant.  The existing FISA procedures can easily be adapted to permit program-based warrant applications.   <br /><br />Senator Arlen Specter (R.Pa.) has proposed legislation of this type.  It is a good framework upon which to build. <br /><br />Third, the government&#39;s surveillance activities brought to the FISA court are conducted in secret.  In the overwhelming number of cases, the identity of those individuals whose communications have been monitored or intercepted are not known to the public.  Thus, there is often no aggrieved &quot;plaintiff&quot;  there is no "case or controversy" to be heard by the courts.<br /><br />In order to avoid stripping aggrieved U.S. persons of their rights to challenge the Constitutionality of governmental surveillance programs, it is crucial that a mechanism be created to ensure that proper parties have standing.  The statute should require the executive
 branch to report regularly to a designated "intelligence committee" of both the House and Senate.  As part of that confidential reporting function, the  Director of National Intelligence  would be required to explain the nature of any secret, warrantless surveillance programs.  He would also be required to file with Congress, as well as with the FISA court, an inventory of U.S. persons whose communications have been intercepted via secret surveillance, and who have been determined to have no link to terrorism. The designated Congressional committees would then be empowered --  after satisfying themselves that national security was not jeopardized -- to release the names of aggrieved U.S. persons  and to notify such individuals.  Such aggrieved individuals would then have standing, directly, to challenge the governmental surveillance activity. <br /><br /><center>* * *</center> <br />We know from experience that times of crisis are often when the worst decisions are made, in historical hindsight. Yet no generation is immune from committing errors.  Harry Truman believed with moral certainty that he needed to seize American's steel mills, in 1952, to protect American troops in Korea.  History proved him wrong.  Yet Congress and the courts did their job by reeling him in.<br /><br />President Bush confronts a world quite different than any previous President.  We should not condemn his efforts, designed in good faith  to preserve our nation.  At the same time, Congress and the courts owe a duty to our system of government to ensure that the Constitution, and each branch of government to which it assigns, are not disemboweled or diminished, even by a well-meaning President.<br /><br />This debate is not about right or wrong.  It is about attempting to find a common Constitutional ground among equally well-intentioned public officials and branches of government.  Hopefully, we as a nation are still capable of  accomplishing such an end.<br /><br /><br /><em>Ken Gormley is a professor of Constitutional Law at Duquesne University.

		<title>The UN Human Rights Council: Another Missed Opportunity</title>

It wasn't supposed to be like this.  The Human Rights Commission was meant to have been replaced by a smaller, more transparent, Human Rights Council that would have excluded regimes with appalling human rights records, but John Bolton, the US Representative to the UN, has effectively undermined negotiations for the creation of that body, leaving the Commission in place for at least another year.  This is perhaps most ironic because the United States has been among the most vociferous critics of the Commission, and helped lead the call for its replacement. So what happened?<br /><br />Last fall, at the annual UN summit, members called for the creation of the new Human Rights Council.  This initiated five months of negotiation, in which the key concerns included membership selection.  It was hoped that no more could a country such as Sudan effectively seek to block any discussion of its own atrocities at home merely by being a member of the global human rights body: their membership would be blocked.  Just how to exclude such abusers, however, has been a matter of some dispute.  On February 23rd, Jan Eliasson, the President of the General Assembly, put forth a proposal for a Human Rights Council that would constitute a marked improvement over the old commission, although it would be far from perfect.  Bolton's continued objections, counter-proposals, and amendments have not merely prevented the formation of the Council this year, they may permanently block it, or weaken its final shape by providing the opportunity for countries opposed to protection of human rights to offer their own amendments.<br /><br />In what way would the proposed Council be preferable?  First, it will work harder, longer: the current Commission only meets once a year for six weeks, while the Council would meet three times a year for ten weeks, with the possibility of members calling for additional sessions as necessary.  Second, it would introduce a universal review procedure, allowing scrutiny of all states, including powerful ones, addressing the critique that a double standard exists before the Commission. Third, it would retain some of the better elements of the old Commission: its use of special rapporteurs, and the right to address country specific situations directly. Fourth and most importantly, safeguards would be put in place to help bar the membership of the most serious rights abusers in the global human rights body.  Eliasson's proposal would require an absolute majority of the UN General Assembly's 191 members, or 96 states, to vote affirmatively for a state, in order for it to become a member of the Council.  Further, states that are members of the Council commit themselves not to commit violations, subject themselves to review while on the Council, and can be suspended for gross human rights violations. While these membership standards are not as stringent as those originally proposed by the UN Secretary-General, who suggested that a 2/3 majority be required for election to the Council, they are a vast improvement.<br /><br />The United States has, however, stuck to a strict negotiating position that inevitably undermined an agreement.  It has, according to Human Rights Watch, refused to support a proposal to allow regional blocs to nominate more states than seats available that would have ensured an open and competitive election for seats from each bloc, and provided a further protection against automatic election of rights-abusing countries.  It did not strongly support the Secretary-General's proposal for an election threshold of 2/3, whilst now criticizing the absolute majority threshold as too low.  It has steadfastly, instead, promoted different standards for exclusion of states.  It has argued that all states currently under UN sanctions should be excluded, a standard which clearly protects members of the P-5 [the 5 permanent veto-wielding members of the Security Council] and states under their protection. Further, as the only criteria by which states would be excluded from membership, this proposal makes no sense at all, as many states that seriously violate human rights are not currently under sanction, either because they are politically protected, or because of disinterest.  States that would be eligible for election to the Council, on the US proposal, would include current members Zimbabwe and China, as well as Libya, Burma, and Uzbekistan, to name a few. A demand by Bolton that the P-5 might expect to have permanent membership was hardly seen as reassuring, as this would have meant the inclusion of Russia and China, responsible for repression and abuses in Chechnya and Tibet, respectively, and indeed of a United States facing regular scandals regarding alleged torture of prisoners in the prison on Guantanamo and in Abu Ghraib, and rendition of terror suspects to countries where they face torture. While this demand has been formally dropped, reliance on UN sanctions as the sole criteria for exclusion effectively protects the P-5. These seem cynical negotiating moves from a country which previously blasted the Commission as a haven for rights-abusing nations to protect themselves.<br /><br />The current proposal for a Human Rights Council is not perfect.  But it is far better than the old Commission, and far better than the one that the US would promote.  Worse still, US delays have allowed the old Commission to continue, and may result in the delay or even death of the proposed Council. For as long as the Commission survives - with Sudan as a member while genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity continue unabated in Darfur - we have John Bolton to thank, for pursuing a cynical and rigid negotiating position at the cost of real change.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Chandra Lekha Sriram is Chair of Human Rights at the University of East London School of Law.</em><br />

Regardless of how one feels about the trial itself, the gaping hole left by this death in establishing the truth and a just and appropriate end to his trial, will remain; leaving a sense of frustration for the victims and a possible further cause for Serbian nationalists.  Could Milosevic's death be his ultimate victory over justice?<br /><br />Our sense is that it could, unless we stay focused on the rule of law and in continuing the process of international justice, even as critics of international criminal law and supporters of Milosevic begin to consider various options in capitalizing on his death for political purposes.  This all plays into Milosevic's political antics of characterizing himself as a lone Serbian standing up to the international community, defiant to the end.  This could be an unfortunate legacy of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, an asterisk next to its record, prompting the question &quot;is justice really served when the key indictee dies?&quot;<br /><br />This is not the first time death has pulled a war crimes indictee from the firm clutches of justice.  At Nuremberg Herman Goering, in 1946, by his own hand, used death to escape his justly rendered execution by the International Military Tribunal.  In Sierra Leone, Foday Sankoh died in international detention during the pretrial phase of his upcoming prosecution on seventeen counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.  There was disappointment then, raising again the question&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;was it ultimately worth the effort?<br /><br />Naysayers will harp on this question over the next few weeks.  Our answer to the cynics is that it is worth the effort at any cost, and that is the bandage which we place over that wound caused by Milosevic's death.  The current tribunals, delivering justice in The Hague, Arusha, and in Freetown are not perfect, but, along with the International Criminal Court (ICC), they represent mankind's efforts in facing down the beast of impunity that continues to roam the earth.  <br /><br />International criminal justice has made significant strides in enforcing international norms that will eventually corner the beast and begin to return the rule of law to the dark corners of the world.  In general, what are they?<br /><br />First, we now have developed jurisprudence over the past ten years that runs almost the entire gamut of legal issues, initially raised at Nuremberg.  This jurisprudence from the current three international tribunals will provide a powerful legal response to current and future atrocity and assist the ICC with its important mandate.<br /><br />Secondly, there are now workable and efficient models, sanctioned by the international community, to prosecute the likes of Goering, Milosevic, and Sankoh.  These models are the ICC and the regional hybrid international tribunals, such as the Special Court for Sierra Leone.  Under the principle of complementarity, coupled with domestic courts, these models are both mutually supporting and provide a flexible response to the next human tragedy, and the first line of defense against this important battle that must ultimately be won against impunity. We have the law and the infrastructure in place to move forward.<br /><br />Despite Milosevic's death, the rule of law, regardless of what paradigm it is used in, has to be the pathway civilization must take if it hopes to advance.  Without it, fear, terror, and anarchy will undermine mankind's ultimate goal of a secure peace and its quest for freedom, a freedom that allows a people to live and prosper in their own cultural environment.  Freedom from want and fear is a powerful response to the ideals of the terrorists today.<br /><br />Thus, the death of another war crimes indictee should not be an occasion to raise doubts, despite the disappointment caused in that death, but to strengthen our resolve to stay the course and to continue mankind's quest for justice.  In the 60th anniversary year of the end of the Nuremberg trials, we must continue its principles now embodied in today's international criminal law.<br /><br />The rule of law is fair, no one is above the law, and the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of the gun.  We must use these three ideals to fight the beast of impunity that the likes of Milosevic represented.  Milosevic's death will only be his ultimate victory over justice if we cease seeking the truth and justice for the victims of the Balkan tragedy.  It is always worth the cost, and the death of one indictee is not an end, only a part of a process that leads to some type of closure to what took place in the former Yugoslavia.  Justice Robert H. Jackson, former Chief Prosecutor of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg best summarized this process in his speech, The Rule of Law among Nations, given on April 13, 1945 to the American Society of International Law in Washington, DC:<blockquote> You cannot in human experience rush into the light. You have to go through the twilight into the broadening day before the noon comes and the full sun is on the landscape; we must see to it that those people who hope are not disappointed, by showing them the processes by which that hope must be realized&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;processes of law, processes of slow disentanglement, from the many things that have bound us in the past.*</blockquote><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>* Proceedings of the ASIL 10-18, in 31 <em>American Bar Association Journal</em> 290-94 (June 1945).</font><br /><br /><em>Henry T.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law says that what is most important about the trial of Slobodan Milosevic in the wake of his sudden death in jail is not its lack of outcome, but rather the hope its example holds for future justice against other dictators...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kellyupdated.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he sudden death of Slobodan Milosevic is regrettable in the sense that the judicial process he faced for the crimes he committed cannot be completed.  The fact that he faced such a process at all is, however, of surpassing importance.  <br /> <br />Milosevic was charged with war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, carried out while his regime was in power during the catastrophic break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990&#39;s.  The butchery that ensued engulfed Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia (including tiny Kosovo).  Milosevic hovered above all this, directing the bloodshed and eventually incurring the wrath of NATO, which deployed against Serb forces on its first combat mission since creation of the organization in 1949.<br /> <br />In a preview of his natural ability to throw his opponents off, in 1999 Milosevic actually sued the NATO countries in their individual capacities at the International Court of Justice for illegal use of force against his Serbia and Montenegro, including (ironically) a charge for genocide.  Requesting the Court to issue an injunction to stop NATO&#39;s bombing of Serbia, Milosevic pleaded<blockquote>The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is exposed to acts of use of force by which the Kingdom of Belgium has violated its international obligations not to resort to threat or use of force against another State, not to intervene in the internal affairs of another State and not to violate the sovereignty of another State, to protect civilians and civilian objects in time of war, to protect the environment, as well as those relating to free navigation on international rivers, to the fundamental rights and liberties of the individual, to the ban on the use of prohibited weapons and on deliberate infliction on ethnic groups conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction of the group. Both military and civilian targets came under attack in the air strikes launched against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.... [O]ver 10 000 attacks were made against the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In air strikes were used: 806 warplanes (of which over 530 combat planes) and 206 helicopters stationed in 30 air-bases (situated in 5 states) and aboard 6 warships in the Adriatic Sea. More than 2,500 cruise missiles were launched and over 7,000 tons of explosives were dropped. About 1000 civilians, including 19 children, were killed and more than 4,500 sustained serious injuries....</blockquote>The Court declined such an injunction, and the suits eventually sputtered out last year.  By that time, Milosevic was on trial himself at The Hague before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.  <br /><br />No other head of state had been tried for such crimes in modern history.  The Kaiser escaped trial after the First World War by seeking refuge in the Netherlands.  Hitler killed himself at the conclusion of the Second World War, leaving only his Number 2 (Hermann Goering) and his henchmen to face justice - which Goering cheated by committing suicide prior to hanging.  Italy&#39;s Benito Mussolini was mobbed and shot.  Japan&#39;s Hedeki Tojo faced trial and was put to death (after an unsuccessful suicide attempt), but he was the head of government - the Emperor, as head of state, continued on his throne.  The next head of government to face justice was Jean Kambada of Rwanda in 1998, and the next attempt at bringing a head of state to justice was the unsuccessful extradition request lodged by Spain with Britain to try Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1999. <br /> <br />Consequently, the fact alone of Milosevic&#39;s trial is vastly more important than the ultimate outcome of that trial - acquittal, guilt, or, in this case, premature death.  That a head of state was forced to face justice for his actions is the precedent that the world needs to take away from all this.  One may quibble with the conduct of the trial, its undue length, its manic focus on due process, its treatment of witnesses, its leeway offered the defense, or even its delayed broadcast back to Serbia and over the Internet - all of which have been roundly criticized by many quarters.  But, again, it is the FACT of the trial at all which hearkens a true breach in the wall of sovereign immunity that previously shielded despots around the world, encouraging them to act with impunity against their own people and those in neighboring states.<br /><br />Because of Milosevic&#39;s trial, uncompleted as it now is, that sense of impunity should waver in the minds of those who contemplate genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.  Milosevic&#39;s trial laid the legal groundwork for the new Special Court for Sierra Leone to indict Charles Taylor of Liberia, and issue its decision in the Taylor case explaining his complete loss of immunity from prosecution.  The activation of international criminal justice is becoming the rule rather than the exception, with another new court in Cambodia under development, and the permanent International Criminal Court now investigating crimes in multiple African countries, including the still unfolding genocide in Sudan.<br /><br />Thus, while Milosevic&#39;s legacy in the Balkans is a bloody one, and his legacy at the Tribunal itself is one of subterfuge, recrimination, delay, and obstreperousness (providing other courts with lessons from which to learn), his legacy to the future of international criminal law via his trial at The Hague is uncharacteristically one of hope.  Hope that brutal dictators receive the message loud and clear that they eventually will be brought to justice for their atrocities if the international community can get its hands on them.  And if they receive that message, and it stays their hand from even one genocide or war crime, sparing innocent people, then progress has been made.  The years of legal back-and-forth, reams of paperwork, millions of dollars, piles of evidence, and endless amounts of frustration at the trial of Slobodan Milosevic was worth it.  That he is now dead is of much less importance.<br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J. Kelly is Associate Professor of Law at Creighton University School of Law in Omaha, Nebraska.

President Bush's order permitting the National Security Agency (NSA) to eavesdrop on Americans without any judicial approval or warrant shows just how prescient our Framers were in placing controls on the executive.  In this instance, the legal controls were present &#8212; the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process that allows for secret judicial authorization to conduct the sort of electronic eavesdropping being conducted by NSA &#8212; but they were circumvented.  The civil liberties dimensions of the NSA program have taken a legal back seat to the constitutional and statutory authority issues in these debates.  Still, in the unlikely event that legal authority for the NSA program can be found, this domestic spying violates the Fourth Amendment.   <br /><br />Administration lawyers concede that, in general, individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their telephone calls, and that probable cause and a warrant are necessary under the Fourth Amendment to authorize electronic surveillance of those communications.  The extent to which national security and foreign intelligence collection might be exempt from the general rule and thus subject to the lesser Fourth Amendment requirement of reasonableness has been considered carefully if not exhaustively by Congress and the judiciary.  Thirty-four years ago the Supreme Court first confronted the tensions between unmonitored executive surveillance and individual freedoms in the national security setting.  <em>United States v. United States District Court</em> (known as the Keith decision, after the Judge who first decided it) arose from a criminal proceeding in which the United States charged three defendants with conspiracy to destroy government property &#8212; the dynamite bombing of a CIA office in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  During pretrial proceedings, the defendants moved to compel disclosure of electronic surveillance.  The Government admitted that a warrantless wiretap had intercepted conversations involving the defendants.  In the Supreme Court, the government defended its actions on the basis of the Constitution and a national security disclaimer in the 1968 Crime Control Act.  Justice Powell's opinion for the Court first rejected the statutory argument and found that the Crime Control Act disclaimer of any intention to legislate regarding national security surveillance simply left presidential powers in the area untouched.  <br /><br />Turning to the constitutional claim, the Court found authority for national security surveillance implicit in the President's Article II Oath Clause, which includes the power "to protect our Government against those who would subvert or overthrow it by unlawful means."  However, the "broader spirit" of the Fourth Amendment, and "the convergence of First and Fourth Amendment values" in national security wiretapping cases made the Court especially wary of possible abuses of the national security power.  Justice Powell then proceeded to balance "the duty of Government to protect the domestic security, and the potential danger posed by unreasonable surveillance to individual privacy and free expression."  <br /><br />Although the government argued for an exception to the warrant requirement, citing the unique characteristics of ongoing national security surveillance, Justice Powell answered that the potential for abuse of the surveillance power in this setting, along with the capacity of the judiciary to manage sensitive information in <em>ex parte</em> proceedings, rendered any inconvenience to the government "justified in a free society to protect constitutional values."  <br /><br />Justice Powell was careful to emphasize that the case involved only the domestic aspects of national security, and that the Court was not expressing an opinion on the discretion to conduct surveillance when foreign powers or their agents are targeted.  Finally, the Court left open the possibility that different warrant standards and procedures than those required in normal criminal investigations might be applicable in a domestic national security investigation, implicitly inviting Congress to promulgate a set of standards for such surveillance:<br /><br />Different standards may be compatible with the Fourth Amendment if they are reasonable both in relation to the legitimate need of Government for intelligence information and the protected rights of our citizens.  For the warrant application may vary according to the governmental interest to be enforced and the nature of the citizen rights deserving protection.<br /><br />Although Congress did not create discrete statutory rules for investigating domestic national security matters, Justice Powell's opinion provided an important impetus for the development of what became FISA and regulation of foreign intelligence surveillance.  Like the Supreme Court, Congress recognized that warrantless surveillance by the executive branch untethered by law could undermine important constitutional values at the confluence of the First and Fourth Amendments.  FISA thus became a sort of constitutional compromise between adherence to the traditional law enforcement warrant and probable cause requirements and those who sought authority for warrantless surveillance.  Instead of the traditional law enforcement warrant and probable cause, FISA requires the government to show that it seeks foreign intelligence and that there is probable cause to believe that the target of the surveillance is an agent of a foreign power.  All of the federal courts that reviewed the constitutionality of FISA upheld it against the Fourth Amendment challenge, and no court has upheld warrantless electronic surveillance since the enactment of FISA.  <br /><br />Congress made clear in FISA that its requirements provide the "exclusive" means for obtaining an order to engage in wiretapping in the United States in pursuit of foreign intelligence.   In effect, the Administration was boxed in by Congress and FISA on the Fourth Amendment.  If Congress had not responded to Justice Powell with a compromise scheme, refusing claims for executive branch authority to go it alone in foreign intelligence collection would be difficult to defend in today's climate.  Now, the proponents of the NSA program are left with the unconvincing arguments that FISA is too cumbersome, or that the statute unconstitutionally limits the Commander in Chief.  <br /><br />The only justification offered by the Administration that the NSA program complies with the Fourth Amendment is a weak one, borrowed from the opinion of the FISA Court of Review in its <em>In re Sealed Case</em> decision in 2002.  The argument is that the NSA program may be fitted within a line of Fourth Amendment cases excepting from the warrant and probable cause requirements situations where the government has "special needs" above and beyond ordinary law enforcement.  The "special needs" category has sustained drunk-driving checkpoints and drug testing in schools, programs that are relatively non-intrusive and standardized.  "Special needs" has never been extended to the highly intrusive and wholly discretionary warrantless wiretapping.  As the FISA Cour
t of Review recognized in <em>upholding</em> FISA, the FISA system for obtaining judicial approval based on individualized suspicion is workable and lawful.  <br /><br />If the NSA program was designed to listen in on known al Qaeda members or affiliates who are U.S. persons, as first claimed by the Administration, it is not difficult to imagine FISA judges issuing orders for such surveillance, following a FISA judge's finding that there is probable cause to believe that the targets are agents of a foreign power.  As congressional hearings and continued reporting expand our knowledge of the NSA program, it appears that the surveillance was not necessarily limited to known al Qaeda members of affiliates.  If instead, or in addition, the NSA program involves data mining &#8212; identifying persons of interest from among the general population, rather than listening in on persons of interest already identified &#8212; the government's unwillingness to follow the FISA process for the data mining makes more sense.  From the mined data, however, NSA still presumably identifies individuals who could be targeted through the FISA means. <br /><br />The President assures us that the NSA program protects civil liberties.  On this one, I'll cast my lot with Justice Powell, who maintained that the inconvenience of a judicial role in monitoring this program is "justified in a free society to protect constitutional values."  <br /><br /><br /><em>William Banks is the Laura J. and L.

The new laws build on the Government's comprehensive response to the post-September 11 security environment and are a combination of best practice from overseas and innovative solutions that respond to Australia's security needs.<br /><br />During the drafting of the new laws the Government was committed to ensuring that the need to protect the community from acts of terrorism was balanced against the rights of individuals. In addition, the legislation was developed consistently with Australia's international human rights obligations, as well as the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.  <br /><br /><em>The Anti-Terrorism Act 2005</em><br /><br />The Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005 was introduced and passed by the House of Representatives on 2 November. The Bill was passed by the Senate on 3 November and the Anti-Terrorism Act 2005 commenced operation on 4 November 2005. <br /><br />The Anti-Terrorism Act 2005 clarifies that, in the prosecution of a terrorism offence, it is not necessary to identify a particular terrorist act. Instead it will be enough for the prosecution to prove that the particular conduct was related to 'a' terrorist act.<br /><br /><em>The Anti-Terrorism (No. 2) Act 2005</em><br /><br />The Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 was introduced into Parliament on 3 November 2005 and referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 28 November 2005. Following public hearings on 14, 17 and 18 November, the Senate Committee tabled a report containing a number of recommendations, including a number of amendments. The Government considered those recommendations, and following consultation with States and Territories, introduced a number of Government Amendments to the Bill. The Bill, as amended, was passed on 7 December and received Royal Assent on 14 December 2005.  <br /><br />Most of the measures in the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 have now commenced operation. The measures that commenced on 15 December 2005 include provisions extending the criteria for listing terrorist organisations to cover those that advocate terrorism, strengthened financing terrorism offences, the new control order regime, the new preventative detention regime, the new powers authorising the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to stop, question and search people in Commonwealth places and the new notice to produce regime. <br /><br />The revised sedition offences that cover urging violence against other groups within our community, against Australia's forces overseas and in support of Australia's enemies, and the provisions permitting the development of a National Code of Practice for the use of CCTV in airports and on aircraft commenced on 11 January 2006. The remaining financing of terrorism provisions in the Act have not yet commenced. The delay in commencement of the provisions relating to counter terrorism financing measures is to ensure industry has sufficient time to comply with the requirements imposed by the legislation.<br /><br />The Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 amended a number of existing counter-terrorism laws and introduced new tools into the law enforcement armoury to combat the threat of terrorism. Some of the measures are briefly outlined below.<br /><br /><em>Sedition</em><br /><br />The new sedition laws address those in our community who directly urge others to use force or violence, including terrorist acts. The sedition amendments modernise the language of the old sedition provisions in the Crimes Act 1914 (Crimes Act), and move those offences to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Criminal Code). The new sedition offences are not a wholesale revision of the sedition offence.<br /><br />Australia's sedition offence is unique because it recognises that urging violence between groups is of concern to the fabric of society in the same way urging violence against government authorities is of concern.<br /><br /><em>Powers</em><br /><br />The Act confers powers on the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to stop, question and search in all places occupied by the Australian Federal Government and prescribed security zones within those places to more comprehensively protect the community from terrorism. The laws provide the AFP with a new notice to produce regime to ensure compliance with lawful requests for certain types of information where the provision of that information will assist the investigation of a terrorism offence or another serious offence.<br /><br />The Act strengthens the regime relating to Australian Secret Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) powers. This includes enhancing various aspects of ASIO's special powers warrant regime, enhancing its ability to access aircraft and vessel information, and developing an offence for providing false or misleading information under an ASIO questioning warrant. The Act also amends the relevant Customs legislation to broaden Customs powers for security and intelligence purposes.<br /><br />These measures complement others taken by the Government to ensure that agencies are appropriately equipped and resourced to protect the Australian community.<br /><br />Much of the discussion about the new laws has focused on the new regimes for control orders and preventative detention. <br /><br /><em>Control orders</em> <br /><br />The Act creates a new regime for control orders. Under new Division 104 of the Criminal Code, the AFP can apply to an issuing court for a control order where there are reasonable grounds that a control order would assist in preventing a terrorist act or that a person has trained with a listed terrorist organisation.  The concept is derived from similar powers in the United Kingdom.<br /><br />While the law provides for a range of different types of controls to be placed on a person, only those controls the AFP has satisfied an issuing court are necessary and appropriate will be imposed in a particular case. The types of controls that can be imposed under a control order include a prohibition or restriction on the person leaving Australia, associating with a specified person, or carrying out a specified activity.    <br /><br />When considering whether to impose each of the controls sought by the AFP, the issuing court will need to consider not only the need to protect the public from terrorist acts, but also the impact of the proposed controls on the personal and financial circumstances of the individual.<br /><br />The laws provide for an initial "interim" control order that is effective once it has been served on the person and lasts for a relatively short period of time. The person who has been served with an order and their lawyer are entitled to a copy of it, which includes a summary of grounds for making the order. This is designed to ensure the person is in a position to challenge the confirmation or continuation of the order. The person who is the subject of the order is entitled to attend the court and make representations about whether the control order should be confirmed, voided, revoked, or varied.    <br /><br />A confirmed control order can last for up to 12 months in the case of an adult and up to 3 months for a young person aged at least 16, but under 18 years of age. Control orders are not available for people u
nder 16 years of age.<br /><br />The Attorney-General is required to report to Parliament each year on the use of control orders and the operation and effectiveness of the regime will be reviewed after 5 years by the Council of Australian Governments, the peak intergovernmental forum in Australia comprising the Prime Minister, State Premiers, Territory Chief Ministers and the President of the Australian Local Government Association.<br /><br /><em>Preventative Detention</em><br /><br />The Act also creates a new regime for preventative detention orders. New Division 105 of the Criminal Code provides for a preventative detention regime that allows the AFP to take a person into custody and detain them for a short period to prevent a terrorist attack occurring, or preserve evidence of a recent terrorist attack.  <br /><br />Where a preventative detention order is sought to prevent a terrorist act, the AFP must establish that detaining the person is reasonably necessary for the purpose of substantially assisting in preventing a terrorist act. It must also be shown that:<ul><li>there are reasonable grounds to suspect that either the person will engage in a terrorist act, the person possesses a thing connected with the preparation for or engagement in a terrorist act, or the person has done an act in preparation for or planning a terrorist attack, and a terrorist act is imminent, or<br /><li>a terrorist act has occurred in the last 28 days and detaining the person is necessary to preserve evidence of or relating to a terrorist act.</ul>Where a preventative detention order is sought to preserve evidence, the AFP must establish that a terrorist attack has occurred within the last 28 days, and that the order is necessary to preserve evidence relating to the act, and detaining the person is reasonably necessary.<br /><br />As is the case with control orders, there is a need to balance the threat to the community against the intrusion on the personal freedom of the person to be detained.  <br /><br />The maximum period of detention under the preventative detention regime is 48 hours. Both the order and the treatment of the person detained are subject to judicial review, as well as merits review. <br /><br />Subject to the existence of a prohibited contact order, the person detained is entitled to contact a number of people while in detention, including a lawyer, a family member, their employer and another person at the discretion of the police officer. A prohibited contact order can only be made where the criteria for issue are met. These include that the prohibited contact order is reasonably necessary to preserve evidence of, or relating to, a terrorist act.  If the detained person is not permitted to contact, for example, a particular family member because of the existence of a prohibited contact order, the detained person will be given an opportunity to contact a different family member.<br /> <br />People cannot be questioned for investigation purposes while they are in preventative detention. Young people under 16 years of age cannot be held in preventative detention, and if a young person aged at least 16 years, but under 18 years of age is in preventative detention, there are special provisions that acknowledge the particular vulnerabilities of young people in custody. These rules also apply to people who are incapable of managing their own affairs.<br /><br />Each year the Attorney-General is required to report to Parliament on the operation of preventative detention orders and the operation and effectiveness of the regime will be reviewed by the Council of Australian Governments after 5 years.<br /><br /><em>Working with States and Territories</em><br /><br />The new laws are the result of extensive consultation and of a concerted effort by the Australian Federal Government and State and Territory Governments to create laws to better deter, prevent, detect and prosecute acts of terrorism. Because of Constitutional limitations on the exercise of the Australian Federal Government's power, cooperation was needed from the States and Territories to enact uniform laws. State and Territory leaders are currently enacting laws to give effect to preventative detention and stop, question and search powers in their particular jurisdictions. Under the State and Territory preventative detention laws, it is proposed that a person may be detained for up to 14 days.<br /><br /><em>Bi-Partisan Support</em><br /><br />The laws in Bill stage were well received by both major parties in the Parliament and received bi-partisan support when they were voted on in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Bill was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee and the Committee made a number of recommendations about the proposed Bill. The Government addressed many of those specific recommendations by amending the Bill before it was passed.  <br /><br />Overall, the new laws are an appropriate, proportionate and balanced response by the Australian Government to the emerging security threats our country currently faces.<br /><br /><br /><em>Philip Ruddock MP is the Attorney-General of Australia.</em><br />

John Radsan</a> of William Mitchell College of Law, former assistant general counsel at the CIA, says that the elaboration of secrecy under the Bush administration endangers the rule of law and is contrary to basic American principles...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/johnradsan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>P</strong></font>resident Bush proudly admits that, several years ago, he secretly approved taps on some of our international communications.  This is the tip of an iceberg that could sink Good Ship America.  Beyond partisanship, we should all be as concerned about a secret process that hatches policies as we are about the policies themselves.   <br /><br />Bush&#39;s extreme views on commander-in-chief powers, including Executive prerogatives to keep secrets and to investigate leaks to the fullest extent, are a danger to the rule of law.  Extreme presidential power threatens us all more deeply than the particular actions of the National Security Agency listening in on some people without court approval.<br /><br />The perverse lesson Bush may have learned from public disclosure of his bypass of the FISA court is that he should have told far fewer people the secrets.  Under a heavier cloak of national security, the Bush administration may be disregarding other laws.  It could claim - secretly to itself - that support for the global war on terror would be diminished, here and abroad, if the public knew the truth about American policies.  And if Bush keeps everything to himself and his operatives, how could anyone in Congress, the courts, or the media challenge them?<br /><br />A few years back, the Justice Department argued that, &quot;Congress can no more interfere with the President&#39;s conduct of the interrogation of enemy combatants than it can dictate strategic or tactical decisions on the battlefield.&quot;  Since then, although the Justice Department has retracted most of the &quot;torture memo,&quot; Vice President Cheney and others have not softened their sharp notes on presidential power.<br /> <br />Coercive interrogations by American officials are one possibility for secret government.  At the end of 2005, Senator McCain convinced Bush to sign a law that prohibits all such interrogations.  Now, it seems, the CIA must comply with the Army Field Manual, the rules for interrogations by the Defense Department.  Many view this law as our redemption from Abu Ghraib, as proof that we will not lower ourselves to the level of our adversaries.<br /><br />But, in a twist on the FISA episode, what would prevent Bush from violating the McCain Amendment and hiding that violation, all in the name of national security, from Congress, the courts, and the rest of us?  Only a few people would serve the commander-in-chief on coercive interrogations, and those who dared to reveal anything would lose their security clearances and face civil and criminal sanctions.  Our government, lest we forget, is usually tight-lipped about secrets.  Our officials still neither confirm nor deny whether Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, an alleged 9/11 mastermind, has been (or is being) water-boarded in their custody.  They expect us to take on faith that their interrogations comply with the law.<br /><br />Assassinations are another possibility.  While a long-standing Executive Order precludes our government from engaging in or being involved in assassinations, the President may have secretly amended that Order.  Reports of a secret Presidential &quot;finding&quot; for the government to go full force against Al Qaeda, issued days after 9/11, highlight this possibility.  Here, Bush could justify the secrecy because of the importance he sees in most everyone believing that we are out of the assassination business.  Or time-servers who give him legal advice may say that &quot;assassinations&quot; of some bad guys are actually military attacks permitted on the enemy&#39;s &quot;command and control.&quot;<br /><br />Another area where secrecy may cause abuse is &quot;rendition.&quot;  We hope our officials comply with the Convention Against Torture by not rendering terrorism suspects to other countries where there are &quot;substantial grounds for believing&quot; the suspects will be tortured.  But Bush may have set this standard aside, keeping his actions from a democracy&#39;s full view through a bureaucrat&#39;s &quot;Top Secret&quot; stamp.<br /><br />I am not against all secrets.  Keeping some of them is necessary to our diplomacy, our military policy, and our intelligence activities.  But a secret government, segregated from reasonable checks and balances, is contrary to the principles many Americans have nobly sacrificed to protect.<br /><br />This is of more than academic interest to me.  If we are unfortunate enough to be attacked again on American soil, Bush&#39;s next step may be to round up more people.  Citizens and aliens alike, Ali, Ahmed, and one author who hides behind a middle name, may be off to secret camps after secret trials.  As a patriot, I hope these nightmares are false.  As a realist, I fear for the truth.  There are just too many people, politicians and their apologists, who try to deceive us without any twitch of shame.<br /><br /><br /><em>A.

		<title>Statutes and Presidential Power: The Case of Domestic Surveillance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.gsu.edu/directory/view.php?id=35">Neil Kinkopf</a> of Georgia State University College of Law says that the broad interpretations of presidential power under statute being offered by defenders of the President&#39;s domestic surveillance program threaten to undercut the constitutional balance of power and even basic democratic values...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/neilkinkopf.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Bush Administration's domestic surveillance program has been the subject of extensive analysis.  My keyboard does not contain the 1,000 or so words that will finally put to rest the matter of the program's legality.  Instead, I prefer to draw a more general lesson about the nature of presidential power:  as a practical matter, the scope and content of the President's power is determined by statutes.  <br /><br />This is not a new phenomenon.  Yet, most scholarship on presidential power has focused on the Constitution rather than on the statutes that grant and limit presidential power.  In addition, interesting and important questions relating to the scope of presidential power have arisen with some frequency as the nation grapples with how best to respond to the challenges of terrorism in the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001.  Typically, these issues have been viewed in broad constitutional terms:  does the President have constitutional power to order the use of torture or to order warrantless wiretapping of communications with persons suspected of a link to terrorist groups, to take two prominent examples.  In fact, this broad phrasing of the issue is highly misleading for it ignores the crucially important statutory context within which the President actually operates.  <br /><br />In each of the examples just cited, there were statutes that apparently prohibited the President's action and, at least for the wiretapping program, a statute that might be taken to have authorized the President's action.  Moreover, the Administration's defense of its domestic surveillance program has been couched primarily in statutory terms &#8212; that the Authorization of Use of Military Force creates an exception to the statutory warrant requirement found in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  (This may be a reaction to the firestorm of controversy that greeted the Torture Memo and its reliance on bare constitutional power.)  Once we recognize the central role that statutes play, our focus will immediately be drawn to issues of statutory interpretation in the context of statutes that grant and limit presidential power.<br /><br />In a recent, seminal article Professors Curtis Bradley and Jack Goldsmith tackle a series of interpretive issues relating to the scope of the President's power under the Authorization of Use of Military Force.  ("Congressional Authorization and the War on Terrorism," 118 <em>Harv. L. Rev.</em> 2047 (2005).)  In this article, they propose reading the President's power broadly, unless the President's exercise of power implicates individual rights, in which case it is to be understood narrowly.  This approach tracks the framework that Professor Cass Sunstein advocates for construing the President's statutory powers relating to military and foreign affairs generally.  Professor Sunstein argues that the President should be accorded "super-strong" Chevron deference for his interpretations of his own statutory power over military and foreign affairs, unless the President's interpretation implicates "sensitive constitutional interests."  ("Administrative Law Goes to War," 118 <em>Harv. L. Rev.</em> 2663 (2005).)  Moreover, in a seemingly gratuitous concurring-opinion footnote -- that may have landed him his appointment as Chief Justice -- Judge John Roberts mused that the President should enjoy Chevron deference when he interprets his own statutory powers.  (<em>Acree v. Republic of Iraq</em>, 370 F.3d 41, 63 n.2.)  Together, these works indicate a significant movement toward the position that statutes relating to the President's power over military and foreign affairs should be read expansively and deferentially with respect to presidential power, at least where such a reading does not implicate substantial individual rights.<br /><br /> The claim for a broad and deferential reading of presidential power is unsupported in precedent and objectionable on normative grounds.  The teachings of precedent are somewhat perverse; one would expect to find that precedent strongly supports a broad and deferential approach to interpreting the President's authority, particularly in the areas of foreign and military affairs.  In fact, it does not.  One of the first great controversies to come before Chief Justice John Marshall was the legal status of the naval quasi-war with France.  In <em>Talbot v. Seeman</em>, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 1 (1801), the Court confronted the question of whether Congress had authorized a naval war with France, if so what were the extent of the President's powers to prosecute that war.  The lawyers for Captain Talbot sought to introduce the orders that President Adams had issued because "the court would consider well the opinion of the executive before they would decide contrary to it."  Nevertheless, the Court refused to allow Adams's opinion to be read, reasoning that the President's views are irrelevant.  In a subsequent case, <em>Little v. Barreme</em>, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64 (1804), Chief Justice Marshall ruled that the President could not order the interception of any ship he suspected of being an American ship trading with the enemy.  By statute, Congress had authorized the interception of American ships bound to French ports.  President Adams ordered the interception of ships bound to or from French ports, on the grounds that the prosecution of the naval war and the prohibition of trading with the enemy would be nugatory if the interceptions were limited to the terms of the statute.  Again, the President's views were irrelevant to the Court, which concluded that seizure of ships bound from French ports was unauthorized.<br /><br /> More recently, the Supreme Court refused to defer to the President's reading of his own power in <em>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</em>, 542 U.S. 507 (2004).  This case brought before the Court the legal status of U.S. citizens designated and held as enemy combatants.  The Solicitor General asked the Court to defer to the President, arguing "respect for separation of powers and the limited institutional capabilities of courts in matters of military decision-making in connection an ongoing conflict ought to eliminate entirely individual process."  In the alternative, the Solicitor General argued that any judicial review should proceed under a very deferential "some evidence" standard.  Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion emphatically rejected these claims for deference.  Instead she asserted the important role that the Court must play in policing the boundaries of presidential power, even over military and foreign affairs.  Her sound bite reads:  "a state of war is not a blank check for the President &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;."  <br /><br />The normative case for deference is also troubling.  First, such deference would dramatically shift power toward the President and away from Congress.  If a presidential assertion of power is met with deference rather than scrutiny, the opportunity for the process of checks and balances to operate is diminished.  Take the domestic surveillance program, for example.  If a court were to defer to the President's interpretation of his own authority, then Congress may respond only by enacting a statute directly prohibiting or regulating this surveillance.  Given the President's veto power, however, this or any other assertion of power can only be prohibited or regulated if the prohibition can muster a veto-proof supermajority. <br /> <
br />Such a shift of power to the President threatens other constitutional values in addition to the constitutional balance of power between the President and Congress.  Insofar as the President is able to design important programs without input from Congress &#8212; again consider the domestic surveillance program &#8212; the basic constitutional value of deliberation is undermined.  Without congressional involvement, and the public participation that accompanies the legislative process, fundamental value choices will be made by the President, acting alone and in secret.  From this perspective, the domestic surveillance program is a symptom of a much deeper problem &#8212; it represents a grave departure from basic democratic values.    <br />    <br /><br /><em>Neil Kinkopf is a professor at Georgia State University College of Law</em><br />

		<title>Tolerance on Trial: Why We Reprinted the Danish Cartoons</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.yobserver.com/aboutus.php">Faris Sanabani</a>, Publisher of the English-language <a href="http://www.yobserver.com/index.php">Yemen Observer</a> newspaper currently facing calls by Yemeni prosecutors for permanent shutdown, confiscation, and even the death penalty against its Chief Editor for republishing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, explains why - and how - his paper reprinted the Danish cartoons, and tells the remarkable story of what happened after that...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/farissanabani.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>hen the <em>Yemen Observer</em> newspaper initially ran its story about the cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad on February 4, the editorial urged Muslims at home and across the globe to accept the apology issued by the Danish <em>Jyllands-Posten</em> paper and asked all to move on. In the same issue, the cartoons were reprinted with a big X drawn over them to imply the rejection of the cartoons and what they stand for.  On the same page we went further and quoted a number of western scholars, scientists and leaders who expressed the positive impression left upon them by studying the life of Prophet Muhammad.  Two other small local papers published the story as well, with the intention of defending and protecting the Prophet. At the same time as our publication, a number of universities posted the Danish cartoons on their walls, urging the public to voice their protests at the depiction of the Prophet through local protests and boycotts of Danish products.   <br /><br />Then came the following Friday, the Muslim holiday and the day when Muslims go to their local mosques and listen to their preachers.  The topic of that Friday and every Friday since then has been the Danish cartoons.  People walked out enraged, promising that they will not buy Danish products and a few called for the punishment of those circulating or republishing the cartoons.  The avalanche effect soon took over and no one could stand in front of religious issues.  Everyone became scared, even those who believed deep in their heart that the intention of the newspapers were not to demean the Prophet.  <br /><br />All of a sudden a news text message was spread throughout the nation informing them of the closure of the <em>Yemen Observer</em>, the confiscation of the license and an order for the Publisher and Chief Editor to appear before the prosecutor.  Soon the news was picked up by Al-Jazeera TV, and the <em>Yemen Observer</em> became the talk of the town.  How dare they insult the Prophet?!<br /> <br />Psychological effects took over.  All of a sudden we were seen as the ones insulting the Prophet.  Families and friends shied away from us. Many questioned our Islamic faith and the battle spread inside and out.  We knew that the time was running out and that the situation had spiraled out of both our, and the government&#39;s, control.<br /><br />Immediately we connected with four of the top lawyers in Yemen. Their immediate reaction to the case was that it was not about the newspaper and what it had published but about public opinion and or politics.  The lawyers felt that it was clear that the intention was not to republish or demean the Prophet. In the prosecution office the Chief Editor was taken to jail before finishing his questioning.  The reason was that they had feared for his life in the face of the enraged public.  The lawyers were able to argue that the Publisher should not be held directly responsible for republishing. The <em>Yemen Observer</em> was ordered closed and the license revoked.  Then the case was sent to court.  <br /><br />Meanwhile we created five working teams; one with the newspapers and the local media, the other with religious leaders and mosque preachers,  the third compromising of legal advisors, the fourth lobbyists within the Yemeni government and the fifth to work with international media.  We were able to get the support of a number of well respected religious leaders. They voiced their support of us and called for the release of the Chief Editor and that the maximum sentence should be a prayer to Allah by the Chief Editor for forgiveness.  <br /><br />Soon the religious leaders in the country and the people divided into two groups, some calling for the punishment and the other asked to move on.    The Chief Editor was released on bail and court hearings were postponed once again. Meanwhile the newspaper remained closed and the costs were increasing daily as there was no income yet the costs were accruing.  Among the chaos and division a religious cleric started collecting money from mosques and fundamentalists to prosecute our newspaper and the other two local papers.  News reports estimated that approximately $100,000 US dollars had been collected for the purpose of prosecuting the local papers.  <br /><br />At the last court session on March 8 we at the <em>Yemen Observer</em> were shocked to find out that 21 lawyers had been commissioned to prosecute the <em>Yemen Observer</em> in addition to the government prosecutor.  As of today the lawyers commissioned by the religious cleric have called for the maximum punishment for the Chief Editor, capital punishment, for the confiscation of all property and assets of the <em>Yemen Observer</em>, and for a fine to be paid by the <em>Yemen Observer</em> for the distress to the local population caused by the reprinting of the Danish cartoons. But as scary as it may sound, a big smile broke out on our faces - including that of the judge - when the 21 lawyers called for the money to be collected from sale of property and assets as well the fine to be deposited into <em>Beit Mal Al-Muslimin</em> (Financial House of Muslims) an organization that has been extinct for the last 1,200 years.  <br /><br />We at the <em>Yemen Observer</em> do not support the Danish cartoons; we understand the sensitivity of the topic of religion.  But we would also hate to see one billion and a half Muslims demonstrate and get killed over cartoons that they haven&#39;t even seen.  We believe that the best way to overcome such irresponsible behaviors is by educating each other about what is important to each of us and to work at creating links.  It is the responsibility of those of us that have been educated in the West and those in the West with a bigger vision and a better understanding to lead the way in bringing us together and making our diversity a strength to support the human race in tolerance and interdependence of each other.<br /><br /><br /><em>Faris Sanabani is the Publisher of the </em>Yemen Observer<em>. The court case against the newspaper and its Chief Editor is scheduled to resume on March 22.</em><br />

		<title>Adel&#039;s Anniversary: A Guantanamo Tale</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.bingham.com/bingham/attorneys_bios.asp?aid=1407">P. Sabin Willett</a>, a partner at Bingham McCutchen, LLP, working <em>pro bono</em> with a team of Bingham lawyers in the Guantanamo habeas litigation, says that the detention of a Chinese Uighur is just one proof that the general, officially-articulated proposition that Guantanamo holds terrorists is a lie...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/sabinwillett.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>del&#39;s anniversary is coming up.<br /><br /> I met him one day last July, when he was chained to the floor of a hut in Guantanamo.  Four months before, my firm had filed his habeas case, but I&#39;d never seen or spoken to him before.  Was he a terrorist?  One of the worst of the worst? <br /><br /> You might be excused for thinking so.  Vice President Dick Cheney says, &quot;The people that are there [at Guantanamo] are people we picked up on the battlefield, primarily in Afghanistan.  They&#39;re terrorists.  They're bomb makers.  They&#39;re facilitators of terror.  They're members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban.&quot;  <br /><br /> But last July I discovered what the Bush Administration had kept secret about Adel.  They&#39;d concluded he was not a terrorist, not an enemy soldier, not Al Qaeda, not Taliban, had never been on a battlefield or fired a shot in anger.  He&#39;d been sold to U.S. forces by bounty hunters from Pakistan.  <br /><br /> On December 22, 2005, a federal judge ruled that the President&#39;s imprisonment of Adel is unlawful.  Then he dismissed Adel&#39;s case.  Adel is a &quot;Uighur,&quot; a Turkic Muslim from the far western reaches of Communist China.  A dissident, he cannot be returned to China because the Chinese would torture him, or worse.  The judge concluded he could not order Adel&#39;s release within the continental US because that would be to infringe on the President&#39;s control of immigration.  His lawyers think that was incorrect, but does it matter?  The core function of a judge in a free society &#8212; remedying illegal imprisonment &#8212; is undone by <em>immigration law</em>?<br /><br /> I used to think Adel was the exception.  My guess now is that History will show he&#39;s the rule.  Last month, Seton Hall Law Professor Mark Denbeaux published a study analyzing the Military's own "combatant status review tribunal" records.  He ignored what we lawyers say, and relied exclusively on military allegations.  Here's what he found.<br /><br /> The Vice President says they men are Al Qaeda fighters.  What does the military say?  Eight percent are al Qaeda fighters.  Ninety two percent are not.  The Vice President says these men were picked up on the battlefield.  The military data show that five percent were picked up on the battlefield.  How did we get the others?  US forces distributed leaflets.  One says, in Pashto:<blockquote>Get wealth and power beyond your dreams &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;<br />You can receive millions of dollars helping the anti-Taliban forces catch al-Qaida and Taliban murderers.  This is enough money to take care of your family, your village, your tribe for the rest of your life.  Pay for livestock and doctors and school books and housing for all your people.</blockquote>Eighty-six percent were sold to us by people who got the leaflets.<br />  <br /> Vice President Cheney says they committed hostile acts against Americans or their allies.  What do the data show?  Fifty-five percent of the detainees committed no hostile act against the US or its allies or any one else.  By the way, wearing a Casio watch is a &quot;hostile act.&quot;  So is fleeing from US bombing.<br />  <br /> Who's at Guantanamo?  Privates, orphans, the poor, conscripts, cooks, drivers, persons who &quot;associated with the Taliban&quot; by inhabiting its prisons as enemies of its regime.  The Taliban generals aren't there.  Some are busy in the Afghan parliament we helped construct.  A former Taliban spokesman isn&#39;t there either.  He's a freshman at Yale.<br /><br /> The central lie of Guantanamo is the whopper: that as a general proposition it holds terrorists.  The President, the Vice President, their amen chorus in Congress tell us so relentlessly.  But if one searches the military's findings for an act of violence against persons or property, for bombing or bombmaking or the teaching of bombmaking or planning or conspiring for it, fundraising, cheerleading &#8212; anything -- when one searches hundreds and hundreds of military records, one finds that this is, most of all, who <em>isn&#39;t</em> at Guantanamo. <br /> <br /> When the history of all this is written no branch of our government will fare very well.  The President will be remembered for the shabby inhumanity of this exercise, as well as the pointless ineptitude of imprisoning chicken farmers, stroke victims, and former prisoners of the Taliban.  He bowed to theorists who lacked life experience or judgment.  Or decency.  On his watch they brought their fanciful notions out of the academy and into Guantanamo, where men were beaten, and Bagram and Abu Ghraib, where men were murdered.  History will not be kind to him.<br />  <br /> Nor to Congress, either.  Last year, with trumpets blaring, Congress declared a ban on torture, voting <em>sotto voce</em> to abolish the only remedy that might bring torture to light: habeas corpus at Guantanamo.  Not so long ago, America&#39;s chief law enforcement officer blandly testified that the President is free to offend an act of Congress when he deems it necessary.  The legislators clucked and scolded for a few hours -- then hastened to amend the act.  The Republicans scramble to protect the President, while the Democrats are up on the roof with a windsock, trying to figure out what to believe in.  History will not be kind to them either.<br /><br /> But I wonder if History will save its sternest verdict for the judicial branch.  We like to think our judges are on the watch tower.  In times of panic and folly, we rely on them for judgment and courage.  Yet when our judges&#39; moment came, they flinched. <br /><br /> It came on June 28, 2004.  On that day, in the plainest possible words the Supreme Court of the United States ordered one court -- the United States District Court for the District of Columbia -- to hold factual hearings on the habeas cases.  It ordered the judges to decide who was an &#39;enemy combatan&#39;" and who a chicken farmer.  &quot;We ... remand these cases for the District Court to consider in the first instance the merits of petitioners' claims,&quot; the Court said in <em>Rasul v. Bush</em>.  The Court did not remand to a lieutenant colonel in the Army, and it did not, after two years of litigation, remand for a test of the pleadings.  It sent the case to a federal judge to hear the merits.  Thus far only one has done so, and he found the imprisonment unlawful. <br /><br />Through eighteen months, all the other district judges have begged someone -- Congress, the Court of Appeals, anyone -- to take the cup from them.  The Executive filed motions challenging jurisdiction (again); appeals were taken; the district judges breathed a sigh of thanks and granted stays.  The appeals grind on, and many of those stays are now more than a year old.  <em>Zadvydas v. Davis</em> teaches that indefinite imprisonment of aliens is illegal, but the district judges decreed an indefinite imprisonment in the habeas litigation nonetheless, and at last Congress let them all off the hook by voting to abolish habeas review at Guantanamo.  Or not: now we are into a new round of briefs about whether the Detainee Treatment Act is retroactive.  Another appellate exercise &#8212; well, <em>that&#39;s</em> a mercy.  It should keep the cup of judgment away for at least another year.<br /> <br /> Do we have a judicial branch in this country, or Kabuki theatre
?  We can wait for History's verdict, or we might just ask Adel.  On March 26, 2006, he&#39;ll reach a milestone: one year since the military completed its determination that he is not an enemy combatant.  He&#39;ll be celebrating that date behind concertina wire, at Camp Iguana, JTF Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.<br /><br /><br /><em>P.

		<title>The Line-Item Veto Act? Not Exactly</title>

The bill envisions an expedited process for considering the President's proposals, and it allows the President to withhold the funds he proposes to rescind for up to 180 days while Congress considers his proposal.<br /><br /> The problems with what OMB's press release calls this "enhanced authority" for the President are simple.  First, the bill proposes to create power the President pretty much already has.  Second, it is not a line-item veto.<br /><br /> Every President has always had an absolute right to recommend to Congress that it enact legislation to rescind previously granted budget authority.  The President's constitutional power to recommend to Congress "to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient" is right there in section 3 of Article 2.<br /><br /> But Congress has already gilded this lily.  Section 683 of Title 2 of the United States Code expressly authorizes specific Presidential messages to rescind budgetary authority when "all or part of [such authority] will not be required to carry out the full objectives or scope of programs for which it is provided" or the President believes the authority "should be rescinded for fiscal policy or other reasons."<br /><br /> Even better, section 688 of Title 2 creates an expedited procedure in Congress to consider proposed rescissions.  So, what the President is asking for seems to be something he already has.<br /><br /> To be fair, the proposed "Line-Item Veto Act" would not be identical to current law.  The expedited procedure could be even more expedited, and the President could wait 180 days before spending the money, not forty-five, as under current law.  But the point remains: If this kind of thing would actually work, in the President's words, "to reduce wasteful spending, reduce the budget deficit, and ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely," why does he not use this tool more aggressively now?<br /><br /> The answer is that a process for budgetary rescission, either as it currently exists or as the Administration would amend it, is not a real line-item veto.<br /><br /> The crucial virtue of a "line-item veto" is that it allows the executive, whether the President or a governor, to strip out of an appropriations measure an item of spending that could not be justified by the public interest, but exists entirely because of bargaining within the legislature.<br /><br /> This bargaining, typically called log-rolling, takes the form of, "If you'll vote for my Bridge to Nowhere, I'll support a courthouse named for your dog!"  Individual members of Congress may actually be indifferent to either the bridge or the courthouse, but they will want to preserve their right to bargain, so they will support everybody else's.<br /><br /> That's why asking Congress to go back and undo its bargain on particular pieces of the arrangements it has already made can be expected, generally speaking, to be futile.  But that is exactly what a rescission message asks Congress to do.<br /><br /> The real Line-Item Veto Act that the Supreme Court held unconstitutional in 1998 got around this problem in the only practical way possible: It allowed the President to cancel individual slices of pork spending without going back to Congress.  That's why it was called a "Line-Item Veto," not "Line-Item Finger-Pointing," or a "Line-Item Recommendation to Do Better."<br /><br /> It probably would be possible to craft a genuine line-item veto that would pass muster in the Supreme Court, but Congress is unlikely to do it.  Congressional Republicans supported the last effort in 1996 only because they had promised to do so in the Contract With America.  Now that the contract has expired, it turns out that Congressional Republicans enjoy spending with at least the same fervor as the Democratic majorities of yesteryear.  They won't want the President stopping them.<br /><br /> Does that mean the President's proposal is not a good idea?  No. It just means the "line-item veto" advertisement is flimflam.  It avoids being candid in order to sound tougher on problem-solving than it is.  Call it the Katrina Syndrome.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Peter Shane is the Joseph S.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.bancroftassociates.net/prof_wkeefer.htm">Wendy J. Keefer</a>, former senior counsel and chief of staff in the US Department of Justice Office of Legal Policy and now with Bancroft Associates in Washington DC, says that although the end result of the Patriot Act reauthorization process is not perfect, most of the changes made by the two renewal bills provide needed clarity to the original legislation...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wendykeefer.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>oday, March 9, 2006, more than four years since its original passage and months after the initial expiration date of December 31, 2005, President Bush is signing two pieces of legislation that will reauthorize key provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act.  Though little excuse exists for the delay in reauthorization, the relevant legislation does what is needed.  It works to continue provision of many of the tools necessary for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to protect the country from future attack, while adding more oversight by the judicial branch of our country's counterterrorism efforts.<br /><br />Since its inception, the Patriot Act has garnered the harshest of criticism and the greatest of praise.  The controversy it created, however, is not unique.  It stems from our system's continuous struggle to balance authority properly among the three branches of government.  Citizens are often suspicious of any government action that appears too much controlled by a single branch.  Most often this suspicion arises when it appears that the executive branch is acting without sufficient "checks and balances."  And despite the original Act's express inclusion of checks and balances in the form of both congressional oversight and judicial review, the legislation being signed today provides for more.<br /><br />Those critical of the original Act have focused almost exclusively on just a handful of the Act's numerous provisions.  Unfortunately, this focus drew the public's attention away from the rest of the Act and, as is the way with politics, permitted many to stall the ultimate reauthorization of its expiring provisions.  The legislation being signed today worked within this environment to find ways to comfort the Act's critics &#8212; at least those in Congress &#8212; in connection with the few most controversial provisions.  It provides extra safeguards without significantly hampering use of the relevant counterterrorism tools.<br /><br />Reauthorization legislation was passed last year by both the House and Senate.  Differing in some respects, a conference committee was assigned the task of reconciling the legislation passed by these chambers of Congress.  Then late last year a Conference Report was issued that did just that.  Many in the Senate remained unhappy with the legislation and though the compromise represented by the Conference Report, H,R, 3199, was passed by the House on December 14, 2005, with a vote of 251-174, the Senate failed to pass it.  Indeed, two separate legislative actions were needed temporarily to extend the Act in its original form to permit further work on reauthorization.  The Act was first extended until February 3, 2006, and then until March 10, 2006.  Now, just a day before this latest deadline, reauthorization is a done deal.<br /><br />The ultimate result was a second piece of legislation adding to the Conference Report's reauthorization, Senate Bill 2271.  The Senate passed this add-on legislation on March 1, 95-4, and, with that in place, then passed H.R. 3199 on March 2, 89-10.  With a complete reauthorization package in place in the Senate, the House, having already passed the primary legislation, voted in favor of the additional legislation on March 7, 280-138.<br /><br />To understand what changes are being made to the original Act, then, requires review of both pieces of legislation.  It also requires an understanding that despite all the bitter debates and apparent opposition to the Act, at no time did the majority of either body in the Congress, or public opinion, favor expiration of the sunsetting provisions of the Act.  Instead, issues arose primarily around just four provisions &#8212; Sections 215 (business records), 206 (roving wiretaps), 213 ("sneak and peek" warrants), and 505 (national security letters).  And not all of these provisions were even subject to the December 31 sunset.  Rather, reauthorization was a review of all controversial provisions, sunsetting or not.<br /><br />Section 215 permits those involved with counterterrorist investigations to apply to the court created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ("the FISA court") for an order to obtain business records.  The general intent was to extend into terrorist related investigations the same authority to obtain tangible things as grand juries have in ordinary criminal investigations.  Prior to enactment of the original legislation, the ability of counterterrorist and intelligence investigators to obtain tangible things was extremely limited.  <br /><br />Concerns arose, however, about this provision's lack of clear judicial review of (or means of challenging) orders obtained pursuant to it.  Criticism also developed as a result of the prohibitions put in place on disclosure by recipients of orders issued under this section, which it was argued could be interpreted to prohibit consultation with an attorney.  Moreover, reservations about its scope led to the common mischaracterization of this as the "library records" provision.  <br /><br />The Conference Report being signed today addresses these concerns, requiring a more direct showing of relevance to an authorized investigation prior to issuance of orders by the FISA court.  An explicit right of recipients of such orders to consult an attorney is also provided for in the Conference Report.  On a more substantive issue, library, medical, educational, and other sensitive records are provided greater protection, requiring the personal approval by specified high ranking officials of any request for an order seeking these sensitive records.  And, a new four year sunset is put in place. <br /><br />The add-on legislation also being signed today goes slightly further in clarifying the judicial review available.  It makes explicit the right of a recipient of a Section 215 order to challenge the prohibition on disclosure of the order one year after its receipt.  This provision, in effect, provides for non-disclosure but with a time limitation after which the right to disclose may be sought and the FISA court may then permit disclosure where there is no reason to believe such disclosure will endanger national security, endanger ongoing investigations, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the physical safety of any person.<br /><br />Similar criticisms as those lodged against Section 215 were also made of the use of national security letters (a type of administrative subpoena).  Though the Patriot Act did not create national security letters ("NSLs"), Section 505 did make changes to one of several NSL provisions, focusing public attention on the use of NSLs.  The opposition to NSLs stemmed from its non-disclosure requirements and related issues regarding disclosure to and consultation with counsel, and a lack of clear judicial review (or enforcement) procedures.<br /><br />The Conference Report takes the first steps to allay these concerns.  It provides an explicit right of recipients of NSLs to consult legal counsel and to challenge NSLs in court.  The Conference Report also, however, required a recipient to inform the FBI of any attorney to whom the NSL had been disclosed.  The add-on legislation removes this requirement.  It also clarifies that libraries are generally not subject to the NSLs covered by Section 505 of the Act.  Finally, the Conference Report will n
ow require public reporting on the total number of NSLs issued each year.<br /><br />Changes are also being made to the original versions of Sections 206 and 213.  Section 206 provides for roving wiretaps, permitting the tapping of devices used by a sufficiently identified target rather than of a single device.  Prior to the Act, a new order was necessary every time a target used a different communication device, delaying crucial surveillance activities.  The Conference Report slightly increases the burden in connection with what information is necessary to identify a specific target for such surveillance, requires new reporting of the use of this section to Congress, and puts in place a new four year sunset.  <br /><br />In connection with Section 213, which confirmed the availability of delayed notice search warrants &#8212; warrants that permit the government to search an area without removing anything and without providing immediate notice to the person's whose property is being searched &#8212; the Conference Report establishes presumptive time periods for providing delayed notice.  Under this provision, notice must be provided within a reasonable time that is not to exceed 30 days unless a longer time is expressly approved by the court issuing the warrant.  Extensions of this time period are available.  Like other changes to the original Act, this one addresses concerns relating to the lack of firm standards governing use of the Act's provisions.  Reauthorization provided the process through which standards could be developed with the wisdom of four years of use of the relevant provisions.<br /><br />The end result of the reauthorization process is not perfect.  Establishing new sunsets for some provisions is likely to result in continuing uncertainty among law enforcement and intelligence officials about whether the tools they have today will remain in place and, in effect, may negatively impact their desire to become familiar with and use these tools to their full potential.  But most of the changes made by the legislation being signed today provide needed clarity to the original legislation.  These modifications should convince critics that the Act is not a threat to our liberty but a means of protecting it.<br /><br />Debates will no doubt continue to swirl around the most controversial provisions.  But it is good to know that in the end a balance was sought and achieved -- balancing not only the claimed tug-of-war between security and civil liberties but the balance among our branches of government.<br /><br />We can only hope that in four years, when Congress again faces sunsetting provisions of this key counterterrorism legislation, it acts more promptly while achieving an equally acceptable result.<br />  <br /><br /><em>Wendy J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pascale Duparc Portier</strong> [National University of Ireland (Galway) Faculty of Law]: &quot;As expected, French President Jacques Chirac delivered a much-awaited televised public address on the First Employment Contract (contrat premiere embauche, CPE) last night, Friday, 31 March 2006. He formally confirmed the promulgation of the Statute on the equality of opportunities (loi sur l&#39;&eacute;galit&eacute; des chances) containing the controversial article on the First Employment Contract. He immediately said, however, that after negotiations with trade unions and youth representatives and other bodies a new bill would be passed as soon as possible to deal with the two main issues: the probation period should be shortened to just one year and youth workers should be given the reasons for their dismissal.<br /><br />He added that though the Statute on the equality of opportunities was immediately enacted, no First Employment Contract should be signed before the new bill amending the CPE is passed.<br /><br />This means that one the one hand President Chirac formally backs up Premier Ministre Villepin and his government and confirms the validity of the Statute, but on the other is to trying restore peace in the country by showing his will to negotiate.<br /><br />New strikes and demonstrations are planned on Tuesday 4th April 2006.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pascale Duparc Portier</strong> [National University of Ireland (Galway) Faculty of Law]: &quot;The French Constitutional Council has now ruled on the constitutionality of Article 8 of the Statute on the Equality of Opportunities (Loi pour l&#39;egalite des chances) dealing with the highly controversial First Employment Contract (CPE, contrat premi&egrave;re embauche) which is <a href="/forumy/2006/03/labor-law-protests-in-france-1968.php">tearing France apart</a>. The country has been at a standstill and was holding its breath waiting for the decision of &quot;les Sages&quot;. France has been focusing on an institution which used to be known to the lawyers and politicians&#39; world only.<br /><br />The Conseil constitutionnel is an independent recent <em>sui generis</em> institution which is not to be found in the hierarchy of judicial or administrative courts. It was created by the Constitution of the Fifth Republic on 4 October 1958. <br /><br />It comprises nine members, one-third of whom are replaced every three years. The members of the Council are appointed by the President of the Republic and by the Presidents of each of the Parliamentary Assemblies (Senate and National Assembly). In addition to the nine members, former Presidents of the Republic are ex officio life members. The Conseil constitutionnel&#39;s president, Pierre Mazeaud, has been appointed by the President of the Republic. <br /><br />One of the tasks of the Conseil constitutionnel is to rule on the conformity of the Statutes with the Constitution before their promulgation when referred to by the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, the President of the National Assembly, the President of the Senate, or sixty deputies or sixty senators. In this case the required number of MPs (Socialists) referred the case. Usually the Constitutional Council must rule within one month. However, if the matter is urgent, this period is reduced to eight days.<br /> <br />If the Council had decided to declare the Statute unconstitutional it would neither have been implemented nor promulgated. Indeed the decision binds all courts and public authorities.  No appeal is possible. Such a decision would have led to the total or partial censure of the law but not to its annulment since the statute has not been promulgated at this stage.<br /><br />This would have soothed the present bleeding social fracture and stopped the massive demonstrations. But this would also have meant a political landmark drawback for the conservative Government.<br /><br />Instead the Council Thursday declared the text constitutional both from a procedural point of view and from a law point of view. It had declared recently in the frame of the CPE dispute &#39;No constitutional principle nor any constitutional rule forbids the legislator to take appropriate measures with a view to assisting categories of people at stake with particular difficulties&#39;. It confirmed this point in parag.17 of its latest decision, adding that the controversial contract differences result from the will to find a solution to the specific features of the youth unemployment issue and thus are directly linked with the general public interest which the Legislator follows and therefore are not contrary to the Constitution:<BLOCKQUOTE>aucun principe non plus qu&#39;aucune r&egrave;gle de valeur constitutionnelle n&#39;interdit au l&eacute;gislateur de prendre des mesures propres &agrave; venir en aide &agrave; des cat&eacute;gories de personnes d&eacute;favoris&eacute;es; que le l&eacute;gislateur pouvait donc, compte tenu de la pr&eacute;carit&eacute; de la situation des jeunes sur le march&eacute; du travail, et notamment des jeunes les moins qualifi&eacute;s, cr&eacute;er un nouveau contrat de travail ayant pour objet de faciliter leur insertion professionnelle ; que les diff&eacute;rences de traitement qui en r&eacute;sultent sont en rapport direct avec la finalit&eacute; d&#39;int&eacute;r&ecirc;t g&eacute;n&eacute;ral poursuivie par le l&eacute;gislateur et ne sont, d&egrave;s lors, pas contraires &agrave; la Constitution.</BLOCKQUOTE>President Jacques Chirac is expected to deliver a televised public address on the issue tonight, Friday, at 8 PM Paris time  (18.00 GMT). He has 9 days to promulgate the Statute or to ask Parliament to deliberate again.<br /><br />Reports say he may promulgate the text immediately.  The decision now relies in his hands and is of a highly political nature. Social pressure on the government has not been this strong since the student riots of 1968.<br /><br />In the meantime the term &quot;CPE&quot; has become colloquially synonymous with &quot;How to lose elections&quot; (&quot;Comment Perdre les Elections&quot;) and indeed the polls show that only 12% of the French population want the CPE. Jacques Chirac has to show his diplomatic skills tonight.&quot;<br />

Apprehended on the border as he tried to escape to Cameroon, Taylor was flown briefly to Liberia.<br /><br />But his journey didn&#39;t end in his homeland. Taylor was whisked, almost immediately, by helicopter to Freetown - the capital of Sierra Leone, and the site of a United Nations&#39; war crimes tribunal (the &quot;Special Court&quot;) designed to prosecute perpetrators such as Taylor.<br /><br />While Taylor is considered responsible for fomenting a conflict that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths in the region, it is only in the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone that he has been indicted. Taylor made his first appearance in the Special Court on Monday, to hear charges that included enlisting children as soldiers and sexual violence.<br /><br />Still, Mr. Taylor and his trial might be in for further travels.  Now, the UN Security Council is considering a resolution (at the request of Liberia and Sierra Leone, as well as the Special Court itself) for the trial of Charles Taylor to be held in The Hague.  Under this proposal,the Special Court for Sierra Leone (the SCSL) would conduct the trial, but in the facilities of the newly established International Criminal Court.<br /><br />Why all this debate and drama over the appropriate place to conduct the prosecution of a notorious accused war criminal?<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/taylor.php">Charles Taylor</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2006/04/charles-taylor-war-crimes-charges.php">Charles Taylor war crimes charges summary</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />Selecting the appropriate jurisdiction for high-profile defenders (who often claim to be war heros rather than war criminals) is a complex job. When it comes to genocide, crimes against humanity and other so-called &#39;crimes of international concern,&#39; WHERE a defendant is tried can be as contentious as the charges.<br /><br />Mr. Taylor&#39;s trajectory, from president to human rights-precedent, and the decision to move his trial, highlights the complex politics and geography of justice in the wake of mass atrocity.<br /><br />The proposal to send Taylor to The Hague presents certain ironies. The removal of a critical case from a local court flies in the face of the core principles that gave rise to the Special Court for Sierra Leone in the first place.<br /><br />Unlike the UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia (located in The Hague) and for Rwanda (located in neighboring Tanzania), the Special Court for Sierra Leone was meant to bring justice &#39;closer&#39; to the population most affected by the violence. Some human rights supporters have argued that holding trials &#39;away&#39; (internationally) robs the traumatized population of the ability to heal.<br /><br />The Special Court for Sierra Leone - referred to as a &#39;hybrid&#39; tribunal in that it combined international expertise in a local setting - was meant to address some of these concerns with doing justice &#39;from afar.&#39;<br /><br />In theory, hybrid tribunals have the advantages of an international tribunal, and yet are close to the peoples most affected by the atrocities.  Hybrid tribunals, such as the Special Court in Sierra Leone, are created precisely because both international and local responses to these crimes have been attempted, and found wanting.<br /><br />Nations are frequently &quot;unwilling or unable&quot;  to prosecute past crimes: unwilling because prosecutions may affect those still in power, or provoke instability; unable due to the weak capacities of judicial and security systems associated with regions in intense conflict.<br /><br />Allegations of bias often accompany local prosecutions. International proceedings may rise above these problems, but suffer critiques of their own.<br /><br />International courts have been viewed as attacks by the international community upon the sovereignty of a proud nation: Slobodan Milosevic took this position repeatedly during his trial at the ICTY.<br /><br />Perhaps more importantly, international trials may have little meaning for societies rent by conflict, and for traumatized victims of abuses who may simply be unaware that proceedings are occurring, or unable to follow them.<br /><br />The proposal for the transfer of the trial of Charles Taylor to The Hague suggests that hybrid tribunals are not, after all, the best of all possible worlds. Even with the presence of international staff and security, fears that his supporters could disrupt proceedings, and even destabilize the region, justify his removal to The Hague.<br /><br />Ironically, it appears that the only place the Special Court for Sierra Leone can hear this case is outside Sierra Leone.<br /><br />There is further irony in the proposal to move Mr. Taylor to The Hague.  Moving Mr. Taylor&#39;s trial to the premises of the International Criminal Court - an institution which the Bush Administration has actively opposed - represents a victory for the fledgling ICC.<br /><br />This is indeed, a remarkable reversal for the Bush Administration, which has been adamant in its opposition to the International Criminal Court. The Bush Administration has been implacably opposed to supporting the ICC, going to great lengths to have other, smaller nations promise to refuse cooperation with the ICC.<br /><br />In its statement abstaining from a resolution referring the situation in Darfur to the ICC last year, the US made a point of stating that a regional or hybrid court would be preferable. Yet when confronted with the potential problems of prosecuting Charles Taylor locally, the US has opted for an international jurisdiction.<br /><br />Perhaps these ironies are reassuring, as they reveal the complex politics surrounding international criminal accountability.  The re-location of the Sierra Leone Special Court to The Hague, and the American support of this proposal, would constitute a
 part of a constructive ferment in international criminal law.<br /><br />On the other hand, the debates and dilemmas concerning the appropriate place to prosecute Charles Taylor might signal a wake up call: we need to re-think the appropriate locations for accountability, and who benefits from justice, and where.<br /><br /><br /><em>Amy Ross is a professor in the University of Georgia Department of Geography specializing in human rights, international justice, geographies of justice, genocide, and the spatiality of violence.

		<title>Slippery Slopes and the War on Terror: Lessons from Israel</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.soas.ac.uk/lawpeacemideast/people.html">Ron Dudai</a> of the SOAS School of Law at the University of London (UK) says that a recent ruling by Israel&#39;s Supreme Court constitutes an important judicial recognition that giving discretion to state security services in fighting terrorism - in Israel, the US, or elsewhere - invites overreaching, abuse, and violations of human rights...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/rondudai.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>&quot;E</strong></font>xceptional times call for exceptional measures" has been a common refrain in discussions about restrictions on civil liberties in the name of curtailing security threats. Torture, prolonged detention without trial or wiretapping without warrant are "normally" illegal, the argument goes, but when fighting terrorism, and when other alternatives are inefficient, they should be allowed in very narrow circumstances. A common counter-argument is that torture or prolonged detention is always illegal; this usually leads to discussions of the ticking bomb scenario and to the debating rhetorical question: "but aren't there ANY circumstances under which torture or wiretapping should be allowed?". The ensuing debate is rarely fruitful. <br /><br />Yet another counter-argument is that of the "slippery-slope". Leaving to one side the question of whether we can theoretically envisage a single case where torture would be legitimate, the slippery-slope proponents rely on a "policy argument": once you allow torture (or detention without trial, or wiretapping without warrant) in one case, the rigid normative prohibition will inevitably be eroded, and you will end up using these methods all across the board. The drizzle of a few isolated cases will become a deluge. <br /><br />Support for just such a policy argument has recently come from the Israeli Supreme Court. Given this Court's rich &#8212; and controversial &#8212; jurisprudence on human rights and terrorism, it calls for attention. <br /><br />The practice before the Court in this case was the Israeli Security Services' "Neighbor Procedure", colloquially known as the "Human Shields" case. According to this procedure, soldiers or police officers surrounding a house where a fugitive terrorist is hiding, in hostile Palestinian villages or towns, may ask a local Palestinian to enter the house, inform the fugitive he is surrounded and ask him to surrender. According to the official procedure, soldiers are allowed to ask a local person to do this only if all other possibilities short of an armed attack have been exhausted, and only if his agreement is "genuine" and not based on a perception of threat from the soldiers. According to the security services the procedure can save lives of Israeli soldiers, and also minimize risk to the fugitive himself and to other Palestinians who may be in the house. However, Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations argued that the practice is illegal under international law and challenged it in the Supreme Court. <br /><br />In the Court's main opinion (of October 2005), Chief Justice Barak found the procedure illegal under international law, on the grounds that, <em>inter alia</em>, it violates the principle of distinction between combatants and civilians, and as under the circumstances a genuine agreement of the local civilians to assist the army would be impossible to distinguish from actions under threat. Yet the main interest comes from separate opinions written by the Court's two other most senior Judges, who found that even if under narrow circumstances the act itself could be legitimate, the procedure should not be approved by the Court because this formal approval would be the beginning of a slippery slope. <br /><br />Justice Beinish, who in May will replace Barak and become Israel's first female Chief Justice, endorsed Barak's finding that the procedure is illegal, but added, crucially, that "Even if the procedure is legal, the danger of slipping into the prohibited practice is inherent in the means it allows". "The conditions articulated in the procedure", she wrote, "in addition to being flawed by themselves, would enable slipping down a slippery slope that will cause a blatant violation of international law principles [&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;] loopholes would be created that will deteriorate the activity on the ground toward situations of illegality." <br /><br />Justice Heshin, the Deputy Chief Justice, wrote that "as clear and clean as the written instruction may be, its execution would be in the field [&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;] in conditions of stress and threat [&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;] a slight deviation from the instruction, a misunderstanding, a wrong reading of the situation on the ground, and we will be slipping into the prohibited margins, a slipping from the allowed to the prohibited. The temptation is high, and the justification would be easily found". In other words, Heshin doesn't trust the security services to use an exceptional measure only when all other options are exhausted; give them the official possibility and they will be tempted to use it all the time, instead of developing other options which would be clearly lawful yet more difficult to execute. He goes on to make a decisive argument: "the routine, inevitably, erodes the sensitivity and care required in implementing the procedure, and there is a grave concern that the special and the exceptional would become the normal and the routine, an act of bureaucracy." To support his argument he points out that "This was the difficulty we encountered with [&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;] the 'ticking bomb' scenario". <br /><br />A bit of background is needed here. In 1987 an Israeli official Commission of Inquiry found that in exceptional cases of "ticking bombs" the Security Services may use "moderate physical pressure" in interrogations. In various decisions throughout the mid 1990s, the Supreme Court endorsed the policy. Heshin himself was very vocal in these endorsements. In 1996, when a human rights lawyer said in court that even when a bomb is ticking it would be illegal to torture, Heshin famously exploded and shouted at him "this is the most immoral statement I've ever heard". Yet gradually it became clear that torture was being used, routinely, in almost all interrogations of Palestinians, "ticking bombs" or not. Thousands were tortured, several died in interrogations, and the majority was never even convicted in any offence. In a dramatic decision in 1999 the Court, with Heshin on the bench, moved to outlaw "moderate physical pressure" altogether. Heshin now seems to admit learning a lesson: security services cannot be trusted with exceptional means, and thus the court needs to raise the legality bar even higher. <br /><br />The State went back to Court, and armed with an affidavit from the Army's Chief of Staff, argued that it can't be the case that the "neighbor procedure" would never be legitimate, and asked for a second hearing. The Court denied a second hearing; Justice Rivlin wrote in the February 2006 decision that "there is no doubt that the procedure was not meant only for those exceptional cases upon which the State is relying [&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;] the procedure grants the commander of a force the discretion and authority [&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;] in the circumstances, we cannot guarantee that the agreement [of the local Palestinian] would be genuine and that [his] life would not be put in danger". <br /><br />At first sight, the "neighbor procedure" case may look obscure and remote to American audience, yet the Israeli Court's refusal to give discretion to the security services sends an important and highly relevant message: discretion given to Security Services is a beginning of a slippery slope; attempts to regulate and control will fail. Any leeway would result in a wholesale violation of a principle. Fr
om categorizing the first Afghan detainees as "illegal combatants" to the approval of limited warrentless eavesdropping in September 2001, we have seen some mighty slopes in the American war on terror; the experience of the Israeli Supreme court can provide a lesson. <br /><br />This is at best a partial and fragmented process, yet the remarks made in the Neighbor Procedure case seem to be an indication of a painful realization the Israeli Court is going through. Justice Rivlin was correct to write that in the complex reality of the struggle against terror, "the colors of black and white often do not illustrate the dilemmas"; but the conclusion is not to be more flexible regarding human rights, but rather more rigid. "Complex times call for clear rules" should perhaps be our new refrain, one that can perhaps save many Americans from experiencing their own future troubling realizations. <br />    <br /><br /><em>Ron Dudai is a research fellow in the School of Law, School of African and Oriental Studies, University of London</em><br />

The reporting was only half right.  To be sure, the government sidestepped immediate Supreme Court scrutiny of one of the most extreme legal tactics in the war on terror: the indefinite imprisonment, without charge or trial, of American citizens suspected of associating with enemies of the state.  But in a carefully worded paragraph near the end of a brief concurrence, Justice Kennedy, joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Stevens, warned the government that its grace period is over.  <br /><br />Jose Padilla is an American citizen who was arrested as a material witness in Chicago and flown to New York, supposedly to testify before a grand jury.  On the eve of a hearing to determine if Padilla could continue to be detained, the government transported him to a military prison in South Carolina, where for more than three years he was held as an "enemy combatant."  Two days after being seized by the military, Padilla's court-appointed attorney filed a writ of habeas corpus asking that he be freed.  The Second Circuit found that Padilla had to be charged with a crime or released, rejecting the government's claim that the President could jail Americans without charge or trial.  The Supreme Court reversed on other grounds, finding that the habeas petition should have been filed in South Carolina.  Justice Scalia's dissent in the <em>Hamdi</em> case issued the same day, coupled with the four dissenting votes in <em>Padilla</em>, led most court-watchers to conclude that at least five justices viewed the military detention without charge of citizens as illegal.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/padilla.php">Jose Padilla</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2006/04/padilla-certiorari-ruling-us-sc.php">Padilla certiorari ruling</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />Padilla re-filed his case in South Carolina and the district court granted him summary judgment, agreeing with the Second Circuit that the President lacked the power to seize citizens on American soil and imprison them without charge indefinitely.  The Fourth Circuit, led by conservative icon Judge Luttig, reversed and Padilla petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari.  Then things got strange.  Having already changed its story about Padilla several times, and with the real possibility of Supreme Court review and reversal, the government shifted course again, asking that he be transferred from military custody to a civilian prison to stand trial for new charges unrelated to the earlier accusations against him.  The Fourth Circuit balked, with Judge Luttig penning some of the most memorable words in this long case.  "[A]s the government surely must understand," he wrote, the government's actions left two deeply unsettling impressions: "that Padilla may have been held for these years, even if justifiably, by mistake," and that the government thought that its assertion of power to detain Americans without charge or trial "can, in the end, yield to expediency with little or no cost to its conduct of the war against terror." "And these impressions have been left," Judge Luttig continued, "at what may ultimately prove to be substantial cost to the government's credibility before the courts."  Undeterred, the government argued that Padilla's transfer would moot the case or make it less worthy of review, then sought and received permission from the Supreme Court to transfer Padilla. <br /><br />The Court listed the certiorari petition for consideration at an extraordinary eight conferences.  Some commentators speculated that the wait augured a long dissent from a denial of certiorari, but yesterday's denial (one vote shy of the four required to grant) came accompanied only by thin escorts: a 2-page dissent by Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Kennedy's 4-page concurrence for himself, the Chief Justice and Justice Stevens.  <br /><br />The concurring opinion begins ordinarily enough, taking no position on the mootness arguments but concluding that "there are strong prudential considerations" for denying certiorari, both because Padilla is not now in military prison and because his "claims raise fundamental issues respecting the separation of powers, including the role and function of the courts."  In other words, today, when no American languishes without charge in a military prison, is the wrong day to decide such a monumental issue.  But echoing Judge Luttig's concerns about the government's waning credibility, Justice Kennedy noted that in "light of the previous changes in his custody status and the fact that nearly four years have passed since he first was detained, Padilla, it must be acknowledged, has a continuing concern that his status might be altered again."  The concurrence did not think that "continuing concern" worth resolving now because it "can be addressed if the necessity arises" &#8212; i.e., if he is again thrown into a military prison.  <br /><br />The opinion could have ended there.  Instead, it goes out of its way to make clear that if the government again tries to imprison an American citizen without charge or trial, the issue will be resolved quickly.  In the space of three sentences, Justice Kennedy three times emphasizes the need for swift resolution: Padilla is entitled to all normal constitutional protections, "including the right to a <em>speedy</em> trial"; if the government "seek[s] to change the status or conditions of Padilla's custody," the district court should "rule <em>quickly</em>" on the legality of such changes; and not only the district court but all "courts of competent jurisdiction" "should act <em>promptly</em>" on the legality of any such governmental moves.  Indeed, the concurrence emphasizes that Padilla "retains the option of seeking a writ of habeas corpus in this Court," a reminder of the little-used and oft-disfavored direct path to the Court.  Such speedy review is essential, Justice Kennedy explained, "to ensure that the office and purposes of the writ of habeas corpus are not compromised."  <br /><br />To my mind, the office and purposes of the writ were already compromised in Padilla's case, where the government locked up a citizen in a military prison for years without charging him or giving him a chance to defend himself.  There is nothing prompt about t
hat.  But if the concurring justices do not think the writ has yet been compromised, they signaled yesterday that the hour is nigh, and the opinion takes steps to warn that the government's grace period is over.  It may have taken four years the first time, Justice Kennedy suggests, but it won't the next time.  <br /><br />For Padilla, who faces the unthinkable prospect of being re-interned in a military prison even if found innocent in Florida, that's a silver lining.  For the rest of us, it's at least a  comforting indication that the Court recognizes that "at stake in this case is nothing less than the essence of a free society," as Justice Stevens warned two years ago.  He was not alone.  As the late Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote then for the Court, the central but as-yet unanswered question raised by Padilla's case is "indisputably of profound importance." Monday&#39;s order and opinions reveal a Court ready to answer those essential questions if the government ever again starts to lock up citizens without charge or trial.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Jonathan M. Freiman, a Senior Schell Fellow at Yale Law School and Counsel at Wiggin and Dana, LLP, is one of the attorneys representing Jose Padilla on his habeas petition.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.ahrcentre.org/management/pace.htm">John Pace</a>, former Secretary of the UN Commission on Human Rights, says that the creation of a new Human Rights Council to replace the Commission could be a major step forward for human rights protection, but the Commission should not painted as a &quot;discredited&quot; institution and proponents of the new Council must be wary of creating some kind of historically-false international human rights &quot;elite&quot; to watch over violators...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/johnpace.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he General Assembly of the United Nations has finally agreed to establish a Human Rights Council.  The Council will replace the Commission on Human Rights, established in June 1946 in accordance with Article 68 of the UN Charter.<br /><br />Like all changes, this one is fraught with exciting potential as it is with daunting risks.  There is no doubt that a change was due, especially since the Vienna World Human Rights Conference of 1993. In Vienna, the human rights agenda was reformulated by the international community and new priorities were enshrined in the Vienna Declaration and programme of Action.  <br /><br />It is in this context that the creation of the Council should be examined; the Declaration contained several significant statements, among them this one, taken from its preamble, saying that the document was adopted &quot;[i]nvoking the spirit of our age and the realities of our time which call upon the peoples of the world and all States Members of the United Nations to rededicate themselves to the global task of promoting and protecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms so as to secure full and universal enjoyment of these rights&quot;.<br /><br />After the establishment of a UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (1993) and of the International Criminal Court (1998), with, <em>inter alia</em>, jurisdiction over crimes against humanity (or "human rights crimes"), the reform of the Commission was long overdue.<br /><br />The Commission was set up in 1946 for the purpose of drafting the International Bill of Human Rights, which it completed in 1966.  During its existence, the CHR grew as the membership of the UN grew (18 countries to begin with, 21 in 1961, 32 in 1966, 43 in 1979 and 53 in 1992). It also grew in the extent of its participation, to include most States members of the UN.  It should be borne in mind that, other than voting, non-members of the Commission (and of the new Council) enjoying most rights of members, including the right to make proposals.  Another feature worth recording is the overall increase in participation of civil society &#8212; not always appreciated by Government representatives.  The number of participants at the last session of the CHR in 2005 ran into thousands.<br /><br />More importantly, it grew in the significance of the content of its work.  Over the years, the Commission had shifted focus to include the implementation of international human right standards.  Four milestones might be highlighted:<ul><li>the decision to look into human rights situations in particular countries on an ad hoc basis (1967), followed by an expansion to take up violations on a thematic (as distinct from country) basis, <br /><br /><li>the decision to set up a Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the field of Human Rights (1987) and, which opened the way to the focus on measures of prevention, the decision to address human rights education (1988),<br /><br /><li>the decision to authorise special sessions of the Commission (1990, taking effect in 1992)<br /><br /><li>the inclusion of human rights components in UN field missions (1994 on)</ul>By 1989, when the decision was taken to convene the World Conference on Human Rights, the Commission had developed an impressive body of international human rights law with a related treaty-based mechanism for implementation, and a parallel, extra-conventional system of so-called 'special procedures'. <br /><br />The work of the United Nations in the field of human rights has been traditionally grounded in a combination of genuine concern for the need to protect the dignity of the individual as well as a long-sighted vision of "national interests" on one hand, and of a cynical involvement inspired by misplaced considerations of sovereignty or short-sighted understanding of "national interests", on the other. <br /><br />The initiative behind the establishment of a Human Rights Council is no exception.<br /><br />On one hand, there is a stated concern to concretize for the benefit of people every where, the content of international human rights standards developed (largely by the Commission) over the decades. There is also overwhelming agreement that for this to happen there is a need to dedicate a balanced focus on the realisation both of civil as well as of economic rights.  In spite of the rhetoric on inter-dependence of rights (repeated in the resolution setting up the HRC &#8212; GA Resolution 60/251), in practice the international community has not reached consensus on the need to have a balanced focus.  <br /><br />Moreover, current efforts in various regions [e.g. the Middle East] to introduce "democracy" are not backed by any serious priority on reducing poverty or creating living conditions that would enable the creation of efficient institutions to ensure that democracy is viable.<br /><br />If the new Council turns out to be a forum where this balance between groups of rights can be achieved, then this would have been a major step forward in the history of the United Nations.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the need for change, the reasons invoked by some member States, and in the media have been described as motivated by a desire to replace a "discredited" or "failed" institution, by one that relies on a membership that does not include "chronic violators of human rights". <br /><br />It is a historical fact that no State is innocent of serious human rights problems from time to time in its history. That is precisely why international standards have been established and why institutions for the implementation have been devised.  After all, these standards were themselves drafted by a Commission that included the worst human rights violators of the time. <br /><br />It is historically incorrect to describe the Commission as a failed institution; but if failures there have been, it is important to look into the Commission's record to see where it has failed, at least in order to ensure that the Council avoids these errors.<br /> <br />It is also incorrect, and bound to failure, to attempt creating a human rights "elite" that would watch over the "violators".  This 'elitist' mentality has characterised the approach of some developed countries in the CHR.<br /><br />What does the HRC bring?<br /><br />There are some interesting innovations, such as:<ol><li>the introduction of a "universal periodic review mechanism". Any state wishing to be a member of the Council is to be the subject of such a review during their membership. The modalities for that mechanism are to be worked out by the Council during the first year of its existence &#8212; no mean task, since that would leave two years &#8212; or less in some cases &#8212; in which to conduct periodic reviews for the membership of the new Council.  <br /><br />This 'innovation' (a "warmed up" version of a system of 'periodic reporting' by member States, abandoned by the Commission in the late seventies after the coming into force of the ICCPR and the ICESCR) provides a formidable challenge, considering the failure of Article 41 of the ICCPR to operate.  <br /><br /><li>the provision for suspension by the General Assembly by a two-thirds majority if the Council member commits "gross and systematic violations of human rights". The current int
ernational climate does not make this a realistic option.   That term has a specific connotation in the Commission's work; how and who will make that determination in the General Assembly itself is yet to be determined.  Arguably the mandatory periodic review could serve as a basis for such an action.<br /><br /><li>the two-term limit on membership. This is an attempt to maintain "oxygen" in the Council; unlike the Commission, where some members became "regulars". (Russia and India have been members of the Commission since its establishment, the US was out for one year &#8212; 2002 and the UK was out in 1979 and 1991).  They are elected by a simple majority of the General Assembly.  This does not change much from the present arrangements, in that the Council &#8212; like the Commission &#8212; is made up of geo-political groups and as such elections can be, for all intents and purposes, determined at the level of the geo-political group. <br /><br /><li>the proviso to have the Council meet regularly throughout the year; the introduction of special sessions for the Commission in 1992 was already an improvement, and enabled action on some important situations, notably Yugoslavia (1992) and Rwanda (1994).  A mandatory three sessions plus a minimum of ten weeks per year should address one of the main problems encountered by the Commission in its recent years &#8212; the sheer volume of work and the notable absence of corresponding resources.  <br /><br /><li>it is a smaller body (47 members compared with the Commission's 53). There will be 2 less African States, 3 less Latin American and Caribbean, 3 less Western European, and one more Asian and one more Eastern European members. Any UN member may be elected, but in electing them, the members of the UN "shall take into account the contribution of candidates to the promotion and protection of human rights and their voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto".  Once elected they "shall uphold  the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, fully cooperate with the Council, and reviewed under a periodic review mechanism during their term of membership".  The modalities of this mechanism are to be developed within one year after the holding of the first session &#8212; sometime in mid 2007.  The effective implementation of this mechanism will require an unprecedented level of efficiency and good faith by member States, to judge by the poor reporting record to the treaty bodies &#8212; not to mention the preparedness of the Secretariat.</ol>The Council will inherit the work of the Commission but it has one year within which to review the Commission's legacy, "in order to maintain a system of special procedures, expert advice and complaint procedure" &#8212; meaning that these three 'tools' developed by the Commission, will not be dropped.  A number of UN members would have dearly wished to see some of these mechanisms eliminated; depending on the prevailing climate in the Council, these mechanisms could still be weakened. <br /><br />The reliance on input from non-member States, as well as civil society and national human rights institutions, is also maintained<br /><br />What is in store for the new HRC?  <br /><br />In all likelihood, nothing much will change, at least in the immediate future. Why? Because the parties that make up the international community themselves, have not or will not change. In particular, the attitude that human rights is "something that goes wrong somewhere else", and conversely, that human rights are proscribed by historical, traditional religious values &#8212; the old "cultural relativism" argument, still characterise the membership.  The change to a Council is not the result of any detectable change in these attitudes.<br /><br />Perhaps the most significant change is the shift of the main UN human rights body from being a functional Commission of the Economic and Social Council to an organ created by the General Assembly. We have seen above how the Commission evolved from a drafting body to the hybrid forum it is today. This new situation brings human rights issues much closer to the international political &#8212; and security &#8212; fora than heretofore. <br /><br />It also acknowledges the international political recognition that violations of human rights are directly linked &#8212; both as cause and effect &#8212; to international peace and security. This should have the effect of placing the new Council more centrally in the international community&#39;s efforts to address the implementation\realisation of international human rights standards.<br /><br />A major consideration in examining the future of the Council is the vital role that the High Commissioner for Human Rights will need to play as the "United Nations official with principal responsibility for United Nations human rights activities under the direction and authority of the Secretary-General".  The Office has a considerable substantive as well as a management responsibility in this change.  It constitutes a formidable challenge to the Office to live up to the role of the Secretariat over the years in balancing the political cynicism with sound substantive direction. <br />    <br /><br /><em>John Pace served as Secretary to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for sixteen years; in 1991-1993 he was the Coordinator of the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in June 1993. He recently completed an assignment as Human Rights Chief for the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq. A native of Malta, he currently resides in Australia, where he is associated with the Australian Human Rights Centre at the University of New South Wales Faculty of Law.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/shane.html">Peter Shane</a> of Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, says that instead of censuring the president, Congress should restrain the foreign excesses of the Bush presidency and restore respect for international law by cutting off funds for any US military adventure in Iran...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petershane2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>H</strong></font>owever great my admiration for Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) or my distress with the Bush Administration, the censure strategy for restoring accountability to the Presidency is a bad idea.  The Constitution does not specify grounds for censure. Neither does it describe an appropriate process.  As a result, the censure of any contemporary President is likely to appear no more than a political hand grenade, which the losing party will simply lie in wait to hurl back when a President of a different party takes office.  If an incumbent President commits high crimes and misdemeanors, the Constitution provides Congress a reasonably well understood process for removing him from office.  The fact that congressional Republicans severely abused that process in attacking the Clinton presidency does not justify Democrat-led efforts to fashion yet another way of delegitimating the President that would likely tempt abuse even more frequently.<br /><br /> If congressional Democrats want to demonstrate backbone and to instill presidential accountability in a way that actually matters, they should introduce the following two-sentence joint resolution:<blockquote>Unless and until Congress provides specific and explicit authorization for the operational deployment of military force against Iran, no funds heretofore or hereafter appropriated shall be used for that purpose, except to repel or respond to an Iranian attack on the United States or its armed forces, or under circumstances where the President determines such an attack is imminent.  In the latter case, the President, prior to or coincident with the deployment of military force, shall provide notification of the imminent attack to the Speaker of the House and to the president pro tempore of the Senate.</blockquote>There is no doubt that such a statute would be constitutional.  The most aggressive theoretical defense ever mustered for executive branch unilateralism in military affairs is Professor John Yoo's <em>The Powers of War and Peace: The Constitution and Foreign Affairs After 9/11</em> (University of Chicago Press 2005).  Although his bottom line on executive power is, in my judgment, implausible, Professor Yoo actually offers a compelling defense of Congress's authority to refuse to fund military operations.  Where we differ is that Professor Yoo thinks the power of the purse is Congress's only permissible check on the executive; I think it one of several.  But, either way, Congress is allowed to turn off the money spigot.<br /><br /> Professor Yoo bases his case for congressional funding power on a variety of evidence &#8212; Montesquieu's separation of powers writings, British parliamentary practice, and constitutional practice by both the American colonies and the post-independence states.  Yoo's view of the Framers' intentions in drafting Articles I and II is as follows:<blockquote>The executive [under the new Constitution] . . . could not wage war without the support of Congress, which could employ its appropriations power to express its disagreement and, if necessary, to terminate or curtail unwise, unsuccessful, or unpopular wars.</blockquote>If the most resolutely neo-Hamiltonian defender (or, I would argue, inventor) of executive prerogative acknowledges the power in Congress to refuse funding for military initiative, there can truly be no doubt of its legitimacy.<br /><br /> Such a congressional resolution would mark a dramatic step toward assuring the American people and the larger world that, henceforth, Congress is determined to return the United States to a fact-based foreign policy, consistent with international law.  It is time to stop threats of war based on overblown rhetoric, wishful thinking, and apocalyptic fantasy.  Congress, if you want to discipline the Bush presidency, start here.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Peter Shane is the Joseph S.

As we have seen in the news of the past few days, what to do with the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States has hit the front burner of Congress after being pushed aside for more than four years by the events of 9/11.  <br /><br />What to do about millions of undocumented immigrants is not a new question for U.S. policymakers. When the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) was passed, Congress chose legalization (or amnesty) as the answer, coupled with employer sanctions in theory to dissuade future undocumented migration by making it unlawful for employers to hire the undocumented. At the time, members of Congress perceived only a handful of alternatives: first, to legalize many of the immigrants, second, to find and deport them, or third, to do nothing. The third option was not an option given mounting pressure to do something, and the second option (which is touted by many today) was considered unworkable, given the expense and effort that would be necessary to round up and deport millions of individuals, while possibly violating the civil rights of many during the process. Today a fourth choice &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a large-scale guestworker program &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; is being advocated by President Bush.<br /><br />The House of Representatives acted first, by passing legislation just before Christmas. Sponsored by Congressman James Sensenbrenner, the law would increase enforcement against employers who hire undocumented workers, make it a felony to be undocumented, and promote immigration enforcement cooperation between federal and local officials. A central part of the legislation would be the construction of a 700-mile fence along the U.S.-Mexico border. These ideas have now been incorporated in Senate legislation introduced by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. The problem is that the fence idea has been tried; it won't work, and the result will be countless more unnecessary deaths.<br /><br />Beginning in 1994, the Clinton administration implemented Operation Gatekeeper, a strategy of "control through deterrence" that involved constructing fences and militarizing the parts of the southern border that were the most easily traversed. Instead of deterring migrants, their entry choices were shifted to treacherous terrain&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the deserts and mountains. The number of entries and apprehensions were not at all decreased, and the number of deaths due to dehydration and sunstroke in the summer or freezing in the winter dramatically surged. In 1994, fewer than 30 migrants died along the border; by 1998 the number was 147, in 2001, 387 deaths were counted, and this past fiscal year 451 died.<br /><br />Motivations for continued migration call into question the likely effectiveness of the expansion of Operation Gatekeeper if the goal is to discourage border-crossers. Beyond the economic situation in Mexico, a socio-economic phenomenon is at play. The phenomenon is the long, historical travel patterns between Mexico and the U.S., coupled with the interdependency of the two regions. Migration from Mexico is the manifestation of these economic problems and social phenomena. The militarization of the border does nothing to address these phenomena. Instead, it is killing individuals who are caught up in the phenomena.<br /><br />Understanding the economic and social situations in Mexico and the United States and the nature of their relationship enables us to formulate better approaches to border crossings and migrations. A real solution would address push-pull factors and the economic needs of both countries. For almost two years, President Bush has proposed temporary worker plan that, with modifications, makes more sense than Sensenbrenner-Frist enforcement only legislation. As a nation, the United States ought to do the right thing, especially when it comes to Mexican migrants given our long historical ties with Mexico. We have demonized the undocumented, rather than see them for what they are: human beings entering for a better life who have been manipulated by globalization, regional economies, and social structures that have operated for decades. The right thing to do is to develop a system to facilitate the flow of Mexican migrants to the United States who are seeking employment opportunities. Given the economic imbalance between the two nations, we know that the flow will continue&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;legally or otherwise. By legalizing the flow through a large guestworker program, we ease pressures at the border (thus freeing up personnel to concentrate on the serious challenge of looking for terrorists and drug smugglers), address the labor needs of employers, bring the undocumented out of the shadows, and ends unnecessary, immoral border deaths that have resulted from current enforcement strategies. But we have to do this in a manner that provides the workers with respect from other Americans and hope for membership. Thus, a path toward earning permanent residence after a period of time, as proposed by Senators John McCain and Ted Kennedy has become a critical ingredient of bipartisan legislation before the Senate today.<br /><br />Legalizing undocumented workers, coupled with a large worker program, is also in the interest of our national security and constitutes a step that would aid our country in its efforts to combat terrorism. By offering a program that would encourage undocumented workers to come forward, we would be able to conduct background checks on a large group that currently lives underground, while freeing up investigative resources to concentrate on real threats of terror at the border and within our borders. These new community members would be more inclined to participate in civil society and aid law enforcement efforts directly. Legalization would promote family reunification and the psychic benefits derived from enjoying the comfort of family. With more definite status, wages and working conditions for the new Americans and consequently all Americans would improve.  <br /><br />We have a choice of the Sensenbrenner-Frist death trap, police-state, or a path to enfranchisement for these individuals on whom we have depended upon for generations. Our economic, social, and national security interests demand that we pursue the moral choice.<br /><br /><em>Bill Ong Hing is Professor of Law and Asian American Studies at the University of California, Davis and the author of </em>Defining America Through Immigration Policy<em> (Temple Univ.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/bransond.php">Douglas Branson</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that defense lawyers in recent corporate fraud cases are not seeking to introduce reasonable doubts that might lead a jury to acquit their clients, but in the absence of much direct evidence are rather offering competing versions of events that threaten to reduce verdicts to a flip of the coin...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/douglasbranson.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>&quot;E</strong></font>vers to Tinker to Chance" is the paradigmatic baseball double play combination.  In similar fashion, "Ebbers to Scrushy to Skilling and Lay" has become the mantra of prosecutors seeking conviction of corporate CEOs for business crimes.<br /><br /> In the WorldCom criminal trial, prosecutors obtained a jury verdict of securities fraud.  The court sentenced Bernie Ebbers to 25 years.  The jury had found that Ebbers knew about, and failed to disclose, the capitalization of line costs (local telephone company charges) and the poaching of line cost accruals by WorldCom CFO Scott Sullivan, resulting in what has been reported as an $11 billion fraud.  By so doing, Sullivan made costs seem much lower than they were, masking from view losses and a deteriorating financial situation at WorldCom, then the U.S.'s 35th largest corporation by revenues.<br /><br /> As the expert witness for some of the independent WorldCom directors in the civil lawsuit,  I received daily transcripts of the Ebbers criminal trial, on an almost real time basis.  I thought that the prosecution produced little, if any, other direct evidence that Ebbers knew about the fraudulent accounting.  At the time, I remarked "they haven't laid a glove (boxing, not baseball) on him yet."  The case came down to Scott Sullivan's versus Bernie Ebbers's word.  The jury believed Sullivan, and afterwards commented that "he (Ebbers) must have known - he was the CEO."<br /><br /> HealthSouth, the company Richard Scrushy founded, provides physical and medical therapy through shopping center and strip mall outlets, close to where patients live.  The Selma, Alabama "good ole boy," who had begun as a respiration therapist, grew the company into a publicly held darling of Wall Street.  In the meantime, he became a benefactor of the Birmingham, Alabama community, which named a street (Scrushy Boulevard) after him.  The comings and goings of his rock band and of Scrushy's commutes to his Lake Alexandria weekend home (by seaplane) became fashion news for many Alabamians.<br /><br /> Then Medicare cut its reimbursement rates for the types of care that HealthSouth provided.  The allegations were that Scrushy directed subordinates "to find the dirt to fill the holes" so that HealthSouth could continue to meet or exceed Wall Street projections.  Five HealthSouth CFOs testified that CEO Scrushy had directed them to and knew about efforts to cook the books.  Yet a Birmingham jury acquitted Richard Scrushy.  The jurors evidently rejected the "he's the CEO - he must have known" inference, along with the live testimony.<br /><br /> Why Ebbers but not Scrushy?  It seems easy: New York versus Alabama.  As evidence of this, observe how Scrushy greased the rails.  His son-in-law had a daily television talk show devoted to the trial on local tv.  Scrushy's lawyers would show up as invited guests.  Scrushy often attended trial with a large and well worn leather bible in hand, visible to a jury with six African Americans, some of whom, along with others, may have been religious.  During the trial, Scrushy preached at services in a Birmingham church, a fact that well may have percolated through to the jury.  Those extra's could not have been pulled off in New York, even if a defendant had been willing to pay the price.<br /><br /> Both trials, however, seem like a fight you may have had with your brother or sister: "is too," "is not," "is too, "is not," and so on and so on.  There was little direct evidence tying the defendants to the crimes charged except the word of their subordinates, "my word against his."  Is there a hypothesis here?  <br /><br /> Although the sample is very small (two cases), can it be that, in "my word against yours" cases, beyond reasonable doubt, as a measure of the evidentiary showing a prosecutor must make, goes out the window?  Just like all of us, juries love to decide between two competing stories, one of innocence and one of wrongdoing. If my word against his case is 50-50, or 60-40, or even 70-30 in favor of wrongdoing, under the beyond a reasonable doubt formula, a jury should still decide in favor of innocence, or at least "not proven."  But they don't seem to.  Juries seem to like making a decision, either way, against two competing versions of events.<br /><br /> In a current trial, now ongoing in Houston, federal prosecutors are attempting to prove that in the year or so leading up to the demise of Enron, then the U.S. 7th largest corporation, according to market capitalization, CEO Jeffrey Skilling and CEO-Chairman-CEO again Ken Lay committed securities fraud.  The gist of the charges is that Skilling and Lay permitted the CFO, Andrew Fastow, to act as general partner of limited partnerships (LJM1 and LJM2) that provided seed capital to various special purpose entities (SPEs) so that Enron could move assets, and related debt, into the SPEs and thus off Enron's books.  Enron could thus borrow more and keep its debt rating and stock price high, as the off books movements (the "asset lite" business plan) and the SPEs took on much of the corporate debt.  The beginning of the end came when accountants Arthur Andersen made a belated call that Enron had to more $1.3 billion in debt back onto its (Enron's) own books.  Fastow made $46 million by acting as general partner and he violated many of the rules regarding SPEs, without disclosing that he had done so.<br /><br /> Once again the lawyers seem also to be trying this case as a "my word against his," or an "is too, is not," case.  The prosecutors have elicited from witnesses statements that Skilling and Lay seemed to have known what went on, masked not only a deteriorating situation but a house of cards from analysts and investors, and did nothing to correct the problems, even after whistleblowers apprised them of accounting shenanigans. <br /> <br /> As one might predict, lead defense attorney Daniel Petrocelli takes the exact opposite view.  Everything that took place at Enron, according to Petrocelli, was legal.  Should they obtain a conviction, the prosecutors, along with government's approach, will cause every business person to act in a more conservative fashion and to abjure taking risks if any material chance exists that losses might ensue.<br /><br /> This seems to be deja vue all over again, to quote Yogi Berra.  Who do you believe?  If it is close, flip a coin.  It seems as though the defense approach leaves too much room for proof beyond a reasonable doubt to fly out the window.  The defendants will benefit only if the jury believes their story.<br /><br /> A far better first year law student approach is to escape the "is too, is not" cycle by replying "actually, this is what it is" or this is "what it might be."  Such an approach shifts the burden back to the prosecutor to show by rebuttal that it isn't the case after all.  It also re-introduces the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard into the case.  The defense says "here is a reasonable doubt," or "here is a reasonable doubt and then some." <br /><br />  Within Enron, the board of directors (or more accurately the board committees, as Skilling and Lay were both on the 16 person board) held the thread that would have unraveled the fabric, revealing the wrongdoing.  Not just once but twice Fastow asked for permission to do what he eventually did.  Both times, Skilli
ng and Lay, or others with Skilling's and Lay's approval, made the right call.  They told Fastow that Enron had a written code of ethics, well posted and applicable to all employees.  That code of ethics contained a section on conflicts of interest.  If Fastow did what he desired to do, his actions would constitute forbidden conflicts of interest and violations of those code provisions.<br /><br /> Skilling, or Lay, or both, then sent Andrew Fastow to the board of directors Audit Committee which had charge of waivers of conflicts of interest.  They would not have done so if they had anything to hide or if they did not wish Fastow's limited partnerships to see the full light of day.<br /><br /> Fastow duly went to the Audit Committee of the board of directors, comprised exclusively of independent directors (no insiders such as Skilling or Lay or their subordinates).  The committee hesitated but then granted the requested waivers on not only one but two occasions.  The committee did so reluctantly, however, as it appended to the waivers prolix procedures monitoring what Fastow was to do and not to do, as well as the amount of compensation he was to receive.<br /><br /> The difficulty is that the Enron Audit Committee assigned implementation to the Finance Committee of the board of directors.  But they never informed the Finance Committee.   Thus there was no followup.  Monitoring and other followup either might have checked Fastow in his actions, or sounded the alarm when he began to take excessive compensation and otherwise bend the rules.<br /><br /> In August, 2001, Andrew Skilling resigned as CEO after only 6 months in office.  In April, 2006, he testified that he was "hurt" when not a single board member expressed misgivings about Skilling's premature resignation.  Perhaps the directors all thought Skilling to be arrogant and condescending, which seems to have been one view which  prevailed at the time.  Just as likely, the directors may have known that they, or key players among them, had dropped the ball.  They felt sheepish about a situation of which they had an inkling at least and which could put Jeffrey Skilling and Ken Lay in a very bad light, not to say Enron"s employees and shareholders as well.<br /><br /> Much of modern corporate governance is conducted by committees of directors (audit, governance and nominating, compensation, finance, etc.) rather than the full board of directors itself.  Few, however, have given thought to the need for committees to network, coordinating the work assigned to them and planning for the future.  One schematic assigns to the chair person of the board, previously regarded largely as a ceremonial or honorary position, the task but the proposal has not attracted attention.  Many observers do believe that what happened at Enron, an important matter "falling between the cracks, is more widespread than it should be, a shortcoming that receives little attention but an important one, given the way in which modern corporations police themselves.<br /><br /> The facts at Enron are known.  They could be elicited from a director or two who had been on the Audit Committee.  The U.S. Senate Report, "The Role of the Board of Directors in the Collapse of Enron," furnishes every necessary detail.  The Audit Committee, not Jeffrey Skilling or Ken Lay, had in hand the thread which, if pulled, would have caused the whole thing to unravel.<br /><br /> It seems as though lawyering in these cases (Ebbers's, Scrushy's, Skilling's and Lay's) has been caught up in macho posturing.  It is not only "my word against his," and "is too, is not," but "mano a mano."  The defense team will not seek to jump shift, introducing a reasonable doubt into the case.  They will persist in merely joining issue with the prosecution, butting heads, leaving the jury to decide the case, once again, by a flip of a coin.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Douglas M. Branson is W.

The suit itself alleges that the US government&#39;s so-called &quot;Terrorist Surveillance Program&quot; is in fact not focused on terrorists but rather is a &quot;vast fishing expedition&quot; directed at everyone in America &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a data mining program using voice recognition software and the NSA&#39;s vast array of computers to scan every phone call entering or exiting the United States. <br /><br />But unlike the suit we have filed, <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/govt_misconduct/govtArticle.asp?ObjID=RovrtPD8Bc&Content=694">Center for Constitutional Rights v. Bush</a>, the named defendants in EFF&#39;s suit are not government officials. Instead, EFF is suing a private party - AT&amp;amp;T - which supposedly enthusiastically helped the government carry out this illegal surveillance. Whereas our suit asks the court to order that the program stop, EFF&#39;s also seeks damages against AT&amp;T. And the damages are potentially enormous: the suit is a class action on behalf of the millions of AT&amp;T subscribers, and the statute making this kind of surveillance illegal (the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a>, FISA) also provides for minimum damages &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; $100 per day per person &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; plus punitive damages. Because the allegation is essentially that every single AT&amp;T international call or data transmission over the last four years was intercepted by the NSA with the active assistance of AT&amp;T, the damages could add up to hundreds of millions of dollars.<br /><br />In searching for parallels to this wonderfully audacious suit &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; an attempt to stop government lawbreaking by seeking not a court order against the officials responsible but a multi-million dollar jury verdict against their private-sector co-conspirators &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; I find myself looking back two centuries. Very few Americans today can name one Supreme Court case (<em>Bush v. Gore</em>? <em>Brown v. Board</em>?) let alone one case (<em>People vs. Orenthal J. Simpson</em>?) but in colonial times, most of America could name two cases decided across the Atlantic: <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendIVs4.html">Wilkes v. Wood</a> (1763) and <a href="http://www.constitution.org/trials/entick/entick_v_carrington.htm">Entick v. Carrington</a> (1765). Both dealt with issues less momentous than who would be the next president or whether public schools could continue to be segregated. Instead, they were about the far-less-sexy question of how broad a search warrant could permissibly be.<br /><br />In <em>Wilkes</em> &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; an English affair that became "the most famous case in late eighteenth-century America, period" according to one scholar &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a London publisher (John Wilkes) who had mocked the King in his writings was pursued for seditious libel (basically, inciting rebellion through one's writings). A broad search warrant was issued by Secretary of State Lord Halifax &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; an executive officer, not an independent judge &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; allowing the officers complete discretion to search through Wilkes' home and all his personal papers for evidence of any crime by Wilkes or anyone else. Wilkes himself was seized, and ended up locked away in the Tower of London.<br /><br />Wilkes, eventually freed, sued for damages. He argued his own case, calling the general search warrant issued against him "a ridiculous warrant on the whole English nation." The judge, Lord Camden, agreed with him, and sent the case to a jury for a verdict. The jurors returned with an award of 1000 pounds in damages for Wilkes; he received even more from Halifax in a suit six years later. The costs to the government in Wilkes' case and related cases were said to reach as much as 100,000 pounds (roughly ten million dollars in today's terms).<br /><br />In some ways, the open-ended search warrant at issue in Wilkes' case was the NSA data mining program of its day. By banning such general warrants, Lord Camden announced a principle that the colonists would enshrine in the Fourth Amendment, which stated that "no Warrants shall issue [except] upon probable cause" (meaning, roughly, good reason to suspect criminal activity) and that warrants must describe with particularity the places to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. Because the Fourth Amendment requires that a warrant must place limitations on a search, the government could never get a lawful warrant broad enough to allow it to scan every international email or listen in on every international call. Until EFF's filing, no one had claimed to have evidence that this was what the NSA was doing, but since colonial times everyone has known it was illegal.<br /><br />The award in <em>Wilkes</em> was an astronomical sum in 1763 &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a veritable king's ransom &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and especially shocking given that it was gifted to a spendthrift rogue like John Wilkes. Nonetheless, unlike the old lady who spilled hot McDonalds coffee on herself, both Wilkes and Lord Camden became instant heroes on both sides of the Atlantic after the judgment. Patriotic parents named their children &quot;John Wilkes&quot; (although that doesn't happen much anymore, for understandable reasons), and the colonists named several counties (the Wilkes Counties in Georgia and North Carolina) and towns (Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Camden, New Jersey and lovely Camden, Maine) after his lordship and the plaintiff.<br /><br />Wilkes even made it back into Parliament (he'd been expelled during the seditious libel affair) and from there managed to pass into law in England protections the independent colonists built into their new Constitution: freedom from general warrants, and freedom to criticize the executive during debate in Parliament. (Parliament did so in part because of the outcome of the court cases&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;in stark contrast to our present situation, where Congress seems eager to snuff out the lawsuits and whitewash the NSA Program by passing a statute legalizing it.)<br /><br />In some sense, the biggest difference between the AT&amp;T case now and the Wilkes case then is the fact that national security is at stake. John Wilkes was just a harmless clown committing lese-majest&amp;eacute;, mocking the crown, but EFF, the critics will charge, is seeking to expose the inner workings of a vital "terrorist surveillance program" to the world by dragging it into court. <br /><br />Indeed, EFF's recent filing was quite skeletal: it did not include "a number of internal AT&amp;T documents" because the government claimed these documents might include classified information, and refused to allow even the court to re
view them under seal. But it is easy enough to figure out what the documents must reveal from reading EFF's original complaint in tandem with last Friday's filing. The complaint says that AT&amp;T installed or helped the government install equipment in its main facilities that intercepts all or almost all communications that move through AT&amp;T's circuits. The fact that EFF has moved for relief from the court tells us that they undoubtedly have proof of this. It's really a shocking revelation: somewhere within the bowels of AT&amp;T's massive switching stations, a giant bug is delivering every phone call and email of every AT&amp;T subscriber to the NSA. And the government desperately wants this truth hidden from the court and the American public.<br /><br />The other case well-known to the Colonists, <em>Entick v. Carrington</em>, decided by Lord Camden two years after Wilkes, involved similar arguments for secrecy in the face of a civil claim for damages arising out of a forcible search and seizure. As CCR's founder Arthur Kinoy put it in his <a href="http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/420/audioresources">oral argument</a> to the Supreme Court in the <em>Keith</em> case (1972), establishing that President Nixon's warrantless domestic national security surveillance was subject to the Fourth Amendment:<blockquote>It stuns me a little bit to hear the arguments made by a representative of today's executive which were made by the representatives of George the Third in Entick against Carrington. This court is told, as was the British court in <em>Entick</em>, that courts cannot look at the reasons for the searches, that that resides in the special knowledge of the Crown. The British court was told in <em>Entick</em>, you must sanction this general search for &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and these are the words from <em>Entick</em> &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; for reasons of state. For reasons of necessity. We cannot tell you the reasons &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; for they reside in the head of our executive officer, known as the secretary of state. These were precisely the arguments raised in <em>Entick</em>. Those were the arguments the Fourth Amendment was designed to eliminate.</blockquote>Then, as now, the people who opposed the claims in <em>Entick</em> and <em>Wilkes</em> labeled the plaintiffs traitors. Let's hope the judges in the AT&amp;T case and our case don't agree. And that the regular-Joe phone subscribers who are the plaintiffs in the EFF case become (like Wilkes and Lord Camden before them) heroes too.<br /><br /><br /><em>Shayana Kadidal is a staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights and one of the lead attorneys on the Center's challenge to the NSA domestic surveillance program, </em>Center for Constitutional Rights v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nimj.org/">Kathleen Duignan</a>, Executive Director of the National Institute of Military Justice, says that the prosecution and conviction of low-ranking soldiers like US Army dog handler Sergeant Michael J. Smith for abusing prisoners at Abu Ghraib should not be allowed to hide or distract from the legal accountability of officers higher-up the military chain of command...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kathleenduigan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he conduct giving rise to the recent court-martial and sentencing of United States Army dog handler Sergeant Michael J. Smith on March 22, 2006 could have been completely averted.  At General Court-Martial, Sgt. Smith faced up to 8 1/2 years in prison, because in the end, his chain of command failed him.  A lack of supervision, guidance, and leadership allowed his and other soldiers' actions to devolve into an "anything goes" mentality that culminated in the abuse against detainees, as well as other offenses that were allowed to occur in this command environment.  During a recent panel discussion at which the topic of Abu Ghraib prosecutions came up, a retired Army General stated that the senior officers in these commands have been investigated and cleared.  Cleared?  If this is the perception in the senior ranks, then it is apparent why accountability problems plague these cases.<br /><br />Observers had hoped that Sgt. Smith's court-martial might reveal something about how dogs were authorized to be used against detainees, but as the court-martial unfolded, it was apparent that this information would not be forthcoming. Colonel Thomas M. Pappas, United States Army, who had been given immunity in exchange for his testimony, did not reveal more than being aware that dogs were used, and admitted not giving adequate guidance or training for proper use of the canines.  Quoted in the New York Times on March 22, 2006, Avi Cover, a lawyer with Human Rights First who monitored the trial stated, "The testimony in these proceedings revealed an appalling level of confusion and implicated the chain of command &#8212; certainly Pappas &#8212; for blame in authorizing these techniques in some instances.&#39;&#39;  During his testimony, Colonel Pappas revealed that he discussed with Major General Geoffrey D. Miller, the team leader and commander at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay, the &#39;&#39;Arab fear of dogs&#39;&#39; as a reason to &#39;&#39;set the conditions&#39;&#39; for interrogations.  So what has happened to General Miller?  He's awaiting retirement.<br /><br />The <em>New York Times</em> also <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F60E16FA3D540C718EDDAA0894DE404482">reported</a> as part of its coverage on Smith's court-martial that two months ago, General Miller took the unusual step of invoking his right not to give testimony that might incriminate him, and said he would not answer questions in the court-martial proceedings against Sergeant Smith and another dog handler, Sergeant. Santos A. Cardona, who is scheduled to face court-martial in May 2006.  In response to questions about why the General chose to invoke his rights to remain silent, a military lawyer representing General Miller said that "he had already fully answered all questions put to him on the issue by Congressional committees, Army investigators and other court proceedings. General Miller has said he only advised using working dogs to keep order." <br /><br />While every member of the armed forces has the right to remain silent under the conditions outlined under Article, 31, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), there is a disconnect between the invocation by a senior officer and the prosecution of many of his subordinates for unchecked conduct under his command.  Article 31(b), states, "No person subject to this chapter may interrogate, or request any statement from an accused or a person suspected of an offense without first informing him of the nature of the accusation and advising him that he does not have to make any statement regarding the offense of which he is accused or suspected and that any statement made by him may be used as evidence against him in a trial by court-martial."  The triggering words of the rule are "accused or suspected."  There is also a portion in Article 31 that stated that a person cannot be forced to answer questions which might incriminate him.  Certainly there is no equation between invoking one's rights under Article 31 and culpability, but invocation does not equal exoneration.  The <em>New York Times</em> further reported that General Miller had been expected to retire from the Army soon, but that the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month told the Army to delay that until the dog handlers' cases were resolved.  Couple the invocation of rights with a delayed retirement, and the picture is not one that suggests higher ranking officers have been cleared &#8212; only excused.  <br /><br />During just about every court-martial regarding misconduct with detainees, prosecutors argued that the soldiers were a rogue group of individuals &#8212; an anomaly in the United States armed forces.  But now that a trend of illegal behavior continues to be revealed, it can no longer be effectively argued that the actions of these soldiers were an exception.  The command should have known about this conduct.  It would be unthinkable that the senior enlisted non-commissioned officer community would have ignored knowingly illegal conduct.  They would have been obligated to raise any questionable trends in conduct to the senior levels of the command.  Either, this conduct was condoned and the senior enlisted ranks knew this &#8212; and thus did not report it &#8212; or the senior officers disregarded the advice of their senior enlisted professionals, a failure that belongs with the senior leadership, not a handful of dog handlers.<br /><br />At Sgt. Smith's trial, Colonel Pappas testified under a grant of immunity.  According to the <em>New York Times</em>, his answers were <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F60E16FA3D540C718EDDAA0894DE404482">at best contradictory and just confusing</a>.  If Colonel Pappas's answers were confusing to a <em>Times</em> reporter, imagine what they were to the men and women sworn to obey his orders.  Paragraph 14.c.(2)(a) of the Manual for Courts-Martial defines the duty to obey orders.  It provides that soldiers and sailors must only follow lawful orders, but states "an order requiring the performance of a military duty or act may be inferred to be lawful and it is disobeyed at the peril of the subordinate."  It is not surprising that someone told to use dogs to control prisoners would follow such an order.  Without knowing the boundaries of whether this conduct would be defined as criminal, it would seem the safer course of action.  This is precisely why the laws of war are defined, taught, and heeded in civilized countries.  Doing so not only protects the detainees, it protects the soldiers.<br /><br />Alberto J. Mora, the former Navy General Counsel, fought an internal battle at the Pentagon seeking clear and accurate guidance.  From both a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060227fa_fact">story</a> and a Navy memo published in the <em>New Yorker</em> magazine on February 27, 2006, one can see the internal turmoil that contributed to the confusing guidance that was revealed at Smith's court-martial.  It becomes more obvious how this turmoil did not translate to the troops on the ground needing definitions and boundaries.  But where were Mr. Mora's counterparts in the Army?  Moreover, why is the only Army officer on record requesting clear guidance on this topic <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/27/AR2005092701527_pf.html">Captain Ia
n Fishback</a> &#8212; a junior officer?  One would have expected, or at least hoped, such a request for definition be made at the flag levels.  <br /><br />So, why do these lower ranking soldiers, such as Sgt. Smith and soon to be Sgt. Cardona, continue to be prosecuted and punished exclusively?  The answer is simple.  The world and international community demand accountability.  By court-martialing these young and more powerless enlisted troops, the senior officials can claim that the United States is holding them accountable for their actions.  <br /><br />In some ways, the military justice system is not so different from civilian state and federal systems.  Those with the means and power can afford better counsel and have greater influence with those operating the system.  They have the knowledge to invoke their rights to remain silent and a greater ability to secure immunity from prosecution in return for their cooperation.  But the military justice system also has safeguards that the civilian system does not against abuse, such as the right to free counsel for everyone charged of an offense &#8212; regardless of rank or paygrade.  There is also an opportunity to litigate any adverse effects imposed by the exercise of "unlawful command influence."  The system, as written, has the ability to be extremely fair.  Those who administer it, however, must not just be managers, they must be leaders.  The numerous detainee mistreatment cases to date should not raise questions about a failed military justice system; instead these questions should be focused on failed leadership.  For the sake of our military, its justice system, and the future, let us hope for more officers like Captain Fishback.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Kathleen A.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/clinic/Scheffer/Scheffer.html">David Scheffer</a>, former US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues (1997-2001), now at Northwestern University School of Law, says that the government&#39;s attempt to charge Salim Ahmed Hamdan with conspiracy to commit war crimes - a crime that does not exist under US or international law - falls short of a violation allowing him to be prosecuted before the President&#39;s military commissions and demonstrates the folly of the effort to push the square peg of terrorism into the round hole of the law of war...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidscheffer.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>D</strong></font>uring the Supreme Court's hearing of <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> on March 28th, an instructive exchange took place between several of the justices and Professor Neal K. Katyal, counsel to the petitioner.  The issue was whether the government had properly charged Salim Ahmed Hamdan with a violation of the law of war, an essential prerequisite to prosecuting him before the military commissions established without Congressional authorization by President George W. Bush pursuant to his Military Order of November 13, 2001.   The lengthy discussion that ensued revealed the perpetual disconnect between 1) the Bush Administration's attempt to frame its detention and prosecution policies in the "war on terror" within the rigorous framework of the law of war, and 2) the far more logical approach of prosecuting alleged combatants either in a manner similar to rules long established for prisoners of war or as alleged terrorists under U.S. Code Title 18 (under which some terrorists detained in the United States, such as Zacarias Moussaoui and Richard Reid, have been solely prosecuted and convicted).<br /><br /> The government repeatedly charged Mr. Hamdan with <em>conspiracy</em> to commit violations of the law or war, or war crimes.   But as Justice Antonin Scalia suggested, the Sixth Amendment entitles a defendant to know the charges against him and those charges must be accurate in order to give the defendant a fair opportunity to mount his defense against them.  The same holds true for the international criminal tribunals, where the principle of <em>nullum crimen sine lege</em> is upheld and any ambiguity in the definition of a crime must be interpreted in favor of the defendant.<br /><br /> Since the newly established military commission before which Mr. Hamdan is being prosecuted must, by its own terms, remain limited to adjudicating "violations of the law of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals," the first requirement of any such judicial body must be to frame the charges correctly given its limited jurisdiction.   That is why it has been so astonishing to see the government's charge sheet against Mr. Hamdan repeatedly invoke a crime that does not exist - under U.S. or international law.   There is no crime of conspiracy to commit war crimes.  That understandably may sound odd even to Supreme Court justices who often deal with the crime of conspiracy in other areas of litigation.  Federal courts rarely hear war crimes cases and thus are not exposed to the large body of jurisprudence on this issue that has evolved in international criminal tribunals and foreign courts.  Because the law of war as it applies to the United States is largely defined by international law (including treaty law and customary international law), any federal court or U.S. court martial or military commission must turn to international law and practice - what the Supreme Court called "universal agreement and practice" in the 1942 Nazi Saboteur Case - to interpret accurately and then properly enforce the law of war.  That standard of near-universal acceptance of what constitutes the law of war thus is the benchmark for the military commission as well as the Supreme Court.<br /><br /> The last time the crime of conspiracy appeared in association with war crimes was in the 1945 London Charter of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal.  But it was quickly abandoned by the judges during the Nuremberg trials and only conspiracy to commit crimes against the peace survived.  The 1948 Genocide Convention established the separate crime of a conspiracy to commit genocide, but genocide, as perhaps the most heinous of atrocity crimes, is not legally defined as a war crime <em>per se</em> any more than are crimes against humanity (for which there is no crime of conspiracy either).<br /><br /> As the chief U.S. negotiator during the United Nations talks for the International Criminal Court (ICC), I had the opportunity to address the conspiracy issue very directly when the general principles of law on individual criminal responsibility were being considered over many drafting sessions.  Some common law countries felt comfortable pursuing theories of conspiracy because such a crime exists in their domestic law (albeit not for the law of war).  Civil law countries do not embrace the crime of conspiracy, however, and require evidence that the defendant acted with respect to the underlying crime.   Being far more numerous than their common law brethren, civil law jurisdictions have never agreed to incorporate the crime of conspiracy into the law of war.    The statutes of the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and Rwanda (ICTR), approved by the U.N. Security Council in 1993 and 1994, respectively, and of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, all with full U.S. support, identify the crime of conspiracy only with genocide consistent with the Genocide Convention.   In their many judgments, the ICTY and ICTR have held that with respect to war crimes, a charge of joint criminal enterprise associated with an actionable war crime - rather  than adjudicating a stand-alone charge of conspiracy to commit war crimes - is the proper reasoning for establishing individual criminal responsibility for war crimes.  The other prongs of individual criminal responsibility are direct or joint perpetration or aiding and abetting. <br /> <br /> This terminological joust may seem like a distinction without a difference, but it is central to the prosecution of war crimes.    In the <em>Ojdanic</em> Joint Criminal Enterprise Decision, the ICTY Appeals Chamber explained that "[w]hilst conspiracy requires a showing that several individuals have agreed to commit a certain crime or set of crimes, a joint criminal enterprise requires, in addition to such a showing, that the parties to that agreement took action in furtherance of that agreement."   In the <em>Vasiljevic</em> appeals judgment, the ICTY held that a joint criminal enterprise requires "the intention to participate in and further the common criminal purpose of a group and to contribute to the joint criminal enterprise or in any event to the commission of a crime by the group."   Thus the two key requirements of agreement and engagement to further the agreement must be proven for a war crimes prosecution of this character.  Simply to charge the crime of conspiracy falls short of the international legal requirements imposed by the joint criminal enterprise standard.<br />  <br /> By 1998 in the ICC negotiations, we put the conspiracy issue behind us by turning to what had just been successfully negotiated, and adopted by consensus with U.S. support in 1997, for the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.   Article 2 of that convention was essentially replicated in what became Article 25(3)(d) of the Rome Statute of the ICC, which holds a person criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a war crime if that person "[i]n any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group of persons acting with a common purpose.  Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:
(i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group, where such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court; or (ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;"  Such requirements have been identified by the international criminal tribunals and legal scholars as constituting the joint criminal enterprise theory, which far exceeds the threshold for a conspiracy charge.<br /><br /> Neither the Uniform Code of Military Justice nor Title 18 of the U.S. Code, which includes the War Crimes Act of 1996 as amended, aligns the crime of conspiracy with the law of war.  It is simply implausible, as the Nuremberg judges discovered, to sweep vast numbers of individuals into conspiracy theories about war crimes.  A higher standard is required, and that standard is joint criminal enterprise - which of course is a standard for proving a specific crime, not a stand-alone theory of liability.  The conspiracy theory works well for genocide because of that crime's unique characteristics and intent requirements.  The same might also be concluded for the crime of aggression (recalling the Nuremberg precedent) if and when it is properly defined for purposes of prosecution by the ICC.  But in war something more is required than evidence that one might have agreed in some vague or ambiguous way, or inferentially by simply being in close proximity to the master planners and implementers, with a plan or design to violate the law of war.   The international criminal tribunals since World War II have required a higher standard of engagement by the defendant in order to thrust him into the law of war.<br /><br /> Why the government demonstrated such sloppiness in its charge sheet against Mr. Hamdan, and failed to correct it over four long years, is emblematic of a stubborn insistence that somehow the square peg of terrorism can be jammed into the circular hole of the law of war.  That remains the fatal flaw of the military commissions as well.<br /><br /> <br /><em>David Scheffer is visiting professor of law at Northwestern University School of Law and former US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues (1997-2001).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that at its 100th annual meeting this week in Washington, DC, the American Society of International Law is being called upon to take a stand on the laws of war and occupation at a critical moment in the history of the Society, the United States, and the world...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavis.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>his Wednesday, March 29, 2006, the American Society of International Law (ASIL) considers at its historic <a href="http://www.asil.org/events/am06/index.html">100th annual meeting</a> the adoption of a resolution on international law related to the laws of war and occupation. The texts of the <a href="http://www.law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/ASILDraftResolution.htm">original proposed resolution</a> and an <a href="http://www.law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/KirgisDraftClean.htm">alternate proposal</a> are available online.  <br /><br />At this critical juncture, the <a href="http://www.law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/ASILDraftResolution.htm">signers</a> of the original resolution seek to reaffirm principles of the laws of armed conflict so as to promote the establishment and maintenance of international relations on the basis of law and justice.  We reaffirm the right of self-defense of all states to demonstrate that the ASIL recognizes the important right of self-defense that is done consistent with international law.<br /><br />We reaffirm directly the constraints on the United States of America in its conduct of armed conflict.  This reaffirmation from within by an American learned society demonstrates to the world "leadership by example" by Americans speaking to America on American international legal obligations.   In particular, we reaffirm the applicability to the United States of America of the four Geneva Conventions.  We seek to provide some clarity as there has been far too much confusion and obfuscation about these bedrock rules.<br /><br />Given recent experiences (we have seen the pictures), it seems obvious that a reaffirmation of rules concerning torture, cruel, inhuman and/or degrading treatment is essential at this time.  In addition, we reaffirm the constraint on the United States and/or other states when they seek to do secret incommunicado detentions (whether prolonged, arbitrary, without International Committee of the Red Cross access, without court access, without safeguards, disappearances, non-Geneva Convention IV Article 5 compliant situations, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights public emergency derogation measures that are not strictly required, etc.).  We also focus on the constraints on the United States of America acting alone, acting in concert with other states, or other states to emphasize the continuing obligations on all states to protect human dignity through these bedrock principles that are the fundamental bases of civilization.<br /><br />We all have in our memory persons who have been held in secret incommunicado detention in Chile, Argentina, Liberia, the Lao Gai in China, the Soviet Gulag, the Nazi era and noted that this violates basic human rights.  This reaffirmation appears essential as we are only sketchily informed of Guantanamo practices, black sites in Eastern Europe, extraordinary renditions, and other secret incommunicado detentions.  Trust is not enough.<br /><br />Given the diverse opinions expressed by the three branches of government about what the international law obligations of the United States of America are during armed conflict, we felt it was important to focus the attention of all three branches on both constitutionl and international tribunal jurisprudence to help assist these branches in understanding how to comply with long-standing jurisprudence.<br /><br />We reaffirm obligations for non-governmental actors under international law at at time of armed conflict(s) when traditional military and intelligence structures are partially or totally privatized.  Our resolution draws attention to the obligations of non-state actors to not violate international law.  <br /><br />We feel it is important to reaffirm that command responsibility applies to the United States of America even in a time where traditional military and intelligence structures are partially or totally privatized.  It appeared important, in the context of civilian run military and intelligence authority in the United States, to remind all concerned of their command responsibility &#8212; whether uniformed or not, whether subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice or not - under international law.  No one is above the law.  We are not above our international law obligations no matter how we organize ourselves in armed conflict.<br /><br />It appeared important to reaffirm &#8212; in the difficult task of balancing security and liberty &#8212; that the United States should not lose sight of or ignore its international law obligations (law of war, humanitarian law, human rights law, etc).<br /><br />In sum, the original resolution reaffirms bedrock rules of international law focused primarily but not solely on the United States of America's obligations and, by implication, reaffirms those principles to all other states.<br /><br />All ASIL policy criteria for adoption of resolutions (fundamental importance, member information, no significant disagreement) are met.<br /><br />Our resolution speaks clearly to the United States of America as the ASIL did in 1946 when it resolved, "That the American Society of International Law strongly favors a declaration by the United States Government of its acceptance of the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in the types of legal disputes enumerated in Article 36 of the statute of the Court."<br /><br />In 1946, at the height of United States power in the world, the ASIL was willing with courage to speak clearly to that power in the interest of preserving and enhancing the rule of law.<br /><br />At this time we should have no less courage than our forbearers in speaking directly to the United States of America in reaffirming  American international law obligations.  The hallmark of the ASIL is tempered idealism.  This is what is needed today.<br /><br />By speaking clearly in this Centennial year to ourselves, we speak to our best selves &#8212; not our worst &#8212; and encourage the best selves of others in other countries through encouragement and implication.  There can be no more important effort at this time.<br /><br />[<em>Afterword: March 30</em><br /><br />On March 30, 2006, the American Society of International Law overwhelmingly adopted a <a href="http://www.asil.org/events/am06/resolutions.html">resolution</a> reaffirming bedrock international law rules as regards self-defense, the applicability to armed conflict of the Geneva Conventions and other international law, the law of armed conflict and occupation, torture, cruel inhuman or degrading treatment, prolonged secret incommunicado detentions, state responsibility, command responsibility, and the need to maintain security and liberty in a manner consistent with international law obligations.  <br /><br />The consensus on these rules was overwhelming among the largest gathering of the Society in its history.  In the discussion, no one disagreed with the terms of the draft resolution &#8212; the question that arose was whether this was an appropriate occasion for the Society to adopt such an instrument.  In its 100 year history, the Society had previously only adopted 3 resolutions.<br /><br />The breadth of the resolution and the consensus on an international level as to its terms is a significant achievement.  One of the key sources of evidence of international law under Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court
of Justice is the writings of the most highly qualified publicists.  While possibly very rare, such a resolution is evidence of such a broad consensus of highly qualified  publicists that it serves as a bulwark against all those now and in the future who seek to undermine these rules.  In that sense, the resolution marginalizes more peculiar readings of international law.]<br />   <br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<title>Labor Law Protests in France: 1968 Encore?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Pascale Duparc Portier of the National University of Ireland (Galway) Faculty of Law says that the mass protests in France against the new First Employment Contract (CPE) legislation may be reminiscent of the 1968 Paris student uprising, but this time French youth and their supporters are fighting not for more rights, but to keep what they have...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/pascaleduparcportier.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he French 'Kleenex generation', the un-paid or low-paid generation, the 'throwaway' generation, the 'precarious' generation is in the streets.<br /><br />Of France&#39;s 84 universities, 60 are either partially or completely shut down following over 3 weeks of protests. Over a thousand secondary schools are on strike. One would better walk to work than try to use public transportation. Hundreds of thousands of people are demonstrating.<br /><br />The trade unions want the withdrawal of the CPE - the so-called First Employment Contract - passed earlier this month. And they want the law withdrawn before entering discussions with M. de Villepin, the French Prime Minister, on other ways of trying to reduce France&#39;s 22 per cent youth unemployment (up to 70 per cent in some poor suburbs).<br /><br />Polls show that over 68% of the French population opposes the labor law reform. The French and international media have reported widely on an upsurge of violence during the protests. Is France on the path to a new "May 1968" ?<br /><br />France has quite a rigid labor code and one of the most secure contracts of employment in the democratic Western world. Under French law a worker - once hired and holding a permanent contract - is protected and the employer has to find very serious reasons to be entitled to put an end to the contract. <br /><br />France's labor market is also one of the worst. It is sluggish. Potential highly skilled young workers can't start their careers. Unemployment has stricken the country for over two decades and both seniors and the youth are the first victims. In contrast, incompetent unproductive people with secure contracts can't be fired, employers can't get rid of them or if they decide to it costs them a huge amount of money; severance costs employers a huge amount of money. So, they are not willing to take on staff because of the shackles of the law.<br /><br />In sum, France's labor law strictly protects workers without, but fewer and fewer people can find jobs even if they happen to be fully-fledged students.<br /><br />Today's France also has a multitude of labor contracts of various sorts. Among them one still finds the traditional very secure permanent contract ("contrat &Atilde;&nbsp; dur&Atilde;&copy;e indetermin&Atilde;&copy;e"). This contract is officially the usual standard contract and presented as the principle. This contract can't be terminated without cause. Unfortunately for today's French working population this contract is definitely not the contract offered to most people especially those starting a career. But the much less secure fixed-term contract ("contrat &Atilde;&nbsp; dur&Atilde;&copy;e determin&Atilde;&copy;e") and temporary employment contract (" contrat de travail temporaire &Acirc;&raquo;) are not the only 'precarious' i.e. insecure contracts nowadays. <br /><br />Recently an incredible number of new contract types have popped up to try and cope with the high rate of unemployment, namely the on-the-job training contract leading to a professional certificate ( &Acirc;&laquo; contrat de qualification, d'adaptation, d'orientation &Acirc;&raquo;), hire inciting contracts ("contrat d'incitation &Atilde;&nbsp; l'embauche") such as "contract initiative job" &Acirc;&laquo; contrat initiative emploi &Acirc;&raquo; (CIE) or "solidarity employment contracts" (&Acirc;&laquo; contrats emploi solidarit&Atilde;&copy; &Acirc;&raquo; (CES) and "youth contract" (&Acirc;&laquo; contrat jeunes &Acirc;&raquo;), "apprenticeship contracts" (&Acirc;&laquo; contrat d'apprentissage &Acirc;&raquo;) and in 2005 the "new-job contract" (&Acirc;&laquo; contrat nouvelle embauche &Acirc;&raquo; (CNE)). Those contracts have been created to respond to the dire issue of youth unemployment. They provide for the frame in which young people learn a trade and thus access the labor market more easily. Most of those schemes relieve the employers from the heavy compulsory social contributions they have to pay when hiring someone. <br /><br />The last highly controversial novelty is the First Employment Contract - the &quot;Contract of First Employment&quot; or &quot;First-Hire Contract&quot; (contrat premi&Atilde;&uml;re embauche, CPE), taking the form of a new bill which was first pushed through the National Assembly discretely on February 9th 2006 at 2.30 AM in the morning, formally adopted as a statute on March 9, and which is now leading France into major demonstrations, violent rioting, random violence and major strikes. <br /><br />The CPE targets young people under 26 with no prior experience on the labor market. It gives the right to the employer to terminate the job of a worker under 26 for up to two years at will without any justification. A registered letter with invoice of receipt does the trick. It is defined in the bill as a 'permanent contract' with 'a consolidation period' of two years. A probation period in France usually lasts 3 to 6 months. The CPE 'consolidation period' amounts to a very long lasting trial period. The government hopes the CPE will prompt employers to hire.<br /><br />On the one hand the economic and social constraints in the labor market are compelling and measures do have to be taken to give jobs to a youth that is on average highly educated.<br /><br />On the other hand, creating a two tier labor system is extremely unhealthy. How can a desperate youth admit that although they are as well or better educated than their parents while the latter can earn 40% more for the same job and capitalize on pension schemes while they can't? How can this youth accept that some employed people have highly secured jobs and can thus be granted mortgages to buy a house while they might well not be in such a comfortable position because of a new contract without any guarantees? Banks have announced that they will treat the CPE as a permanent contract. Will that be the case?<br /><br />The middle-class youth revolt is not about getting more, as was the case in the 1968 student uprisings, it's about keeping what it has.<br /><br />In a democratic country where the 1958 Constitution starts with a Preamble stating that the Republic is grounded on  "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" and then confirms in article 2 'The motto of the Republic shall be &Acirc;&laquo; Liberty, Equality, Fraternity ', can the French youth keep silent in front of blatant inequality? Even if France can't do anything else but move towards a healthy liberal labor market in a globalized world, is the CPE the solution? In the name of equality, shouldn't we suggest that all labor contracts should read the same? <br /><br />The Socialist Party waits for the right time to appeal to the <em>Conseil constitutionnel</em> on the grounds of workers inequality before promulgation. An ideological battle is under way.<br /><br />Clearly, France has to move from a rigid welfare state with overtaxed employers and employees paying for unsustainable social benefits while privileges for a few are still quite alive (although those making decisions won't suffer from the new precarious CPE) - to a more flexible market, i.e. an Anglo-Saxon type of labor market where everyone has a chance to start working and to make it.<br /><br />The CPE is one of the few steps towards liberalisation. It sounds better to have a job without security than no job at all. Furthermore, French labor law has become so complicated due to so many new types of lab
or contracts that there is an urgent need to simplify and to lay down statutes to ensure equal liberal rules for all.<br /><br />French elections are not far away. In the face of popular uproar the government now has to make up its mind on one simple question: to give up, or to struggle?<br />   <br /><br /><em>Dr. Pascale Duparc Portier is a lecturer in Legal French at the National University of Ireland (Galway) Faculty of Law.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uidaho.edu/richard">Richard Seamon</a> of the University of Idaho School of Law says that in light of ever-increasing evidence of detainee abuse by US personnel or parties acting with the approval or complicity of the United States, Congress should change federal law to create a civil remedy for victims of US-sanctioned torture...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/richardseamon.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>N</strong></font>ewly publicized photos from Abu Ghraib prison and the ongoing court-martials of some of the soldiers who served there remind us of the uncomfortable truth that the United States has tortured people detained in the war on terrorism.  Although Congress banned torture late last year, the ban is an empty gesture without ways to enforce it.  One way is through civil suits for damages.  Current law provides almost no support for such suits, however, as a recent federal court case shows.  Congress should change the law to create a civil remedy for U.S.-sanctioned torture.<br /><br />The recent case involved Maher Arar, a native of Syria whose parents immigrated to Canada when he was a teenager.  U.S. officials arrested Mr. Arar in 2002, when he stopped in a U.S. airport on his way back to Canada from a vacation in Tunisia. After several days of interrogation, U.S. officials determined  that Mr. Arar was a member of Al Qaeda.  They arranged for him to be taken to Syria, despite his protests that he would be tortured there.  For the first twelve days of his detention in Syria, Syrian officials interrogated him eighteen hours a day and beat him with two-inch-thick electrical cable.  For ten more months, they kept him in a dark, rat-infested cell the size of a grave.  Then Syria released him without filing any charges.<br /><br /> Mr. Arar sued John Ashcroft and other U.S. officials in a federal court.  He alleged that he has not a terrorist and, as far as he knew, had no ties with terrorists.  He alleged that U.S. officials sent him to Syria precisely so he could be tortured outside the U.S.  He asserted claims under the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.<br /><br />In February, the federal district court for the Eastern District of New York (Judge David G. Trager) dismissed Mr. Arar&#39;s action.  The court held that Mr. Arar failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted under the TVPA.  Among other reasons for this failure, the court explained, was that the TVPA authorizes remedies only for torture conducted under color of foreign law, not torture conducted under color of U.S. law.  Furthermore, Mr. Arar could not assert constitutional claims under the Bivens doctrine.  Bivens relief was barred because of &quot;the serious national-security and foreign policy issues at stake.&quot;<br /><br /> Judge Trager&#39;s decision is not necessarily incorrect, nor is it unusual.  To the contrary, most suits in U.S. courts seeking civil remedies against the U.S. or its officials for U.S.-sanctioned torture will fail. <br /><br /> The barrier to claims against the United States is sovereign immunity.  Congress has waived sovereign immunity from some tort claims in the Federal Tort Claims Act (&quot;FTCA&quot;).  The FTCA has exceptions, however, that collectively will bar most civil suits for U.S.-sanctioned torture.  FTCA exceptions bar claims for most intentional torts; for claims arising in a foreign country; for claims &quot;arising out of combatant activities of the military or naval forces ... during time of war&quot;; and for claims based on the exercise of a &quot;discretionary function.&quot; <br /><br /> The most viable basis for claims against the federal officials responsible for torture is the Bivens doctrine.  Most Bivens claims, however, will founder on one or more of three grounds.  First, people who are not U.S. citizens and who are tortured on foreign soil may have no constitutional right to be free from torture.  Second, even if torture violates a person&#39;s constitutional rights, Bivens may not create a cause of action for that violation.  As the court concluded in Mr. Arar&#39;s case, torture claims by suspected terrorists may present &quot;special factors&quot; &#8212; such as the danger of inserting the federal courts into foreign affairs matters traditionally reserved to the political branches of government - that would defeat a Bivens action.  Finally, many officials sued for torture in Bivens actions might have qualified immunity because of the paucity of case law clearly establishing the unconstitutionality of the use of torture in the war on terrorism and high-level executive-branch actions seeming endorsing the torture, such as the Department of Justice&#39;s infamous &quot;torture memo.&quot;<br /><br /> The near-total absence of remedies for U.S. sanctioned torture does not reflect a determination by Congress or the courts that remedies are unwarranted.  Rather, it reflects that current law was not designed with U.S.-sanctioned torture in mind.  Congress designed the FTCA to deal with the &quot;garden variety torts&quot; of federal employees, as the Supreme Court has observed.  Thus, FTCA exceptions limiting government liability reflect Congress&#39;s determination that certain governmental interests outweigh the interest in providing civil remedies for everyday negligence.  Congress may well -- and should -- make a different determination for U.S.-sanctioned torture.  <br /><br /> Similarly, the law governing claims against federal officials is designed more for the rogue officer who deliberately violates someone&#39;s constitutional rights than for the reasonably competent, well-intentioned officer who violates constitutional rights in the course of &quot;just following orders.&quot;  The idea has been that the specter of tort liability in the latter situation could discourage officials from doing their duty.  The government&#39;s interest in officials doing their duty might justify denying a remedy for an individual official&#39;s tort.  But U.S.-sanctioned torture is more than just a garden-variety tort conducted by an individual officer (the &quot;bad apple&quot;) who has gone astray.  To the contrary, the torture has been systemic and approved at the highest levels of government.<br /><br /> The problem with current law is that it treats U.S.-sanctioned torture as a mere tort.  Instead, it should be treated as a human rights and a civil rights violation.  One way to move toward this treatment is through legislation that would make the U.S. and its officials liable for torture under the same circumstances as local governments and their officials would be under the civil rights statute, 42 U.S. Code Section 1983.  Such legislation, though not ideal, might be politically feasible. It would put the U.S. and its officials on a similar footing with local governments and theirs -- hardly an irrational result -- using familiar and well developed (even if arguably flawed) legal standards.  <br />    <br /><br /><em>Richard Seamon is a law professor at the University of Idaho College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=152">David Crane</a>, former Chief Prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, now at Syracuse University College of Law, says it&#39;s time for Nigeria to hand over former Liberian president Charles Taylor for trial on war crimes charges...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidcrane.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font> little over three years ago, on 3 March 2003, I signed the international indictment of President Charles G. Taylor of Liberia for 17 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity while serving as Chief Prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunal in West Africa, called the Special Court for Sierra Leone.  I sealed that indictment, awaiting the appropriate time to unseal it.  I did so, on 4 June 2003, as Charles Taylor arrived in Accra, Ghana to allegedly begin the peace process to end the Liberian civil war.  The unsealing of his indictment was a carefully laid plan to humble Africa's most powerful warlord before the law and to bring world attention to this African leader who destroyed two West African nations, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and was individually criminally liable for the murder, rape, maiming, and mutilation of over a million human beings. The unsealing was also necessary to ensure that a legitimate peace process began in Accra, not a flawed series of dialogs with an indicted war criminal. With the stroke of my pen, the rule of law was shown to be more powerful than the rule of the gun.  There was dancing in the streets of Sierra Leone that day.<br /><br />Though appropriately warned, the international community was not ready to see this head of state, only the second in history behind Slobodan Milosevic, and the first African head of state to be indicted for war crimes at the international level, turned over to an international tribunal they created to prosecute those who bore the greatest responsibility for the atrocities that took place in Sierra Leone during the ten-year long civil war in the 1990's.  Scrambling, the United States, Great Britain, the United Nations, and Nigeria entered into an agreement to put Taylor aside in Calabar, Nigeria while a peace took hold in Liberia. <br /><br />It has been two and a half years now since Taylor left Liberia, stripped of his political power by the indictment.  He sits brooding, yet still meddling, in Nigeria.  To date, despite tremendous international pressure, and a request by the new Liberian President, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to hand Taylor over to the Special Court for Sierra Leone, President Obasanjo of Nigeria has refused to do so, saying it is not time, that peace needs to take hold in Liberia before it can be done.  Obasanjo is in violation of both international and Nigerian domestic law in holding Taylor.  He continues to defy the international arrest warrant.  He should be brought to task for this.<br /><br /><u>It is now time</u>. There will be no peace in Liberia until Taylor is handed over to the tribunal in Freetown, Sierra Leone for a fair trial on the 17 count indictment.  Taylor swore to the people of West Africa that he would be back, "God willing".  This statement sent a chill through all of us.  We knew he meant it, and because of this statement a true peace in Liberia will never take hold; millions of US dollars will go for naught.  Even a large peacekeeping force in Liberia will not be sufficient, as they will not be able to remain there forever.  Taylor is young and patient.  He knows us better than we know ourselves.  He will wait and when the world has moved on to another crisis he will make his move and return to Monrovia, the capital.  What will happen after that is too horrific to contemplate.  <br /><br />Taylor is well placed politically to return.  He has meddled in the election process that saw President Johnson-Sirleaf elected as the first female president of any African state, by ensuring that he controls the legislature.  Many leaders in that legislature are old Taylor cronies, some indictable war criminals.  Even his wife has been elected a senator.  Most politicians in Liberia are looking over their shoulders, as are business leaders and civil society, knowing that if they commit to the new president they could be jeopardizing their lives should Taylor return.  An armed group in Taylor's home county of Lofa stands ready, on Taylor's orders, to move on Monrovia when the peacekeepers leave.<br /><br />To end this possibility and fear in Liberia, Taylor needs to be handed over to the Special Court for Sierra Leone. It is that simple. By doing so he will be carved out of Liberian politics, his supporters no longer having a rallying point, and the new government can look forward, not back, to start solving Liberia's massive internal problems.  <br /><br />Last week, while in the United States, Liberian President Johnson-Sirleaf did publicly acknowledge that Taylor needed to be handed over so that justice could run its course, and she called on Nigeria to do just that.  Before a cheering joint session of Congress, she pledged that Liberia would be a democratic success in West Africa.  Next week President Obasanjo will visit the United States.  It is hoped by then he will have an announcement to make related to Taylor and his hand over.  <u>It is now time</u>, President Obasanjo, time for justice to begin in West Africa.<br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://its.law.nyu.edu/faculty/profiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=bio.main&personID=22544">Margaret Satterthwaite</a> of New York University School of Law says that US actions in the war on terror - especially the practice of extraordinary rendition - make a mockery of formal US insistence on the rule of law, damaging it and ultimately reducing it to nothing...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/margaretsatterthwaite.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>S</strong></font>ince 9/11, the U.S. government has used the discourse and authorizing rules of the laws of war while simultaneously flouting the limiting and protective rules of that regime, labeling them "quaint" and inapplicable.  At the same time, the Administration insists that human rights law is not applicable to this new "war," arguing alternatively that the relevant norms do not apply to extraterritorial conduct, that there is no relevant implementing legislation requiring the U.S. to abide by its international obligations, and that human rights law does not apply in situations of armed conflict.  As to those standards it does concede applicability &#8212; such as the prohibition on torture &#8212; the Administration has largely defined away the practice.  The effect is to take U.S. actions in the "War on Terror" outside of both frameworks, dealing a blow to the rule of law.  <br /><br />Among U.S. strategies are practices aimed at avoiding the due process rules included both in the Geneva Conventions and in human rights treaties to which the U.S. is a party.  Through extraordinary renditions and secret detentions, the U.S. attempts to avoid norms concerning due process by avoiding any process at all.  Instead, it opts for procedures in which individuals are unilaterally and secretly determined to be a danger to the U.S.  On the basis of this determination, the U.S. sends individuals to be interrogated under torture by other governments, places them in secret detention, or ships them to Bagram air base, where it presumably believes U.S. courts may not exercise jurisdiction.  In the process, our government is rejecting not only the human rights norms against prolonged incommunicado detention, non-refoulement, and the prohibition on torture; it is also rejecting the framework of international justice that insists on accountability and the rule of law. <br /><br />With the Council of Europe, the European Union and a variety of their Member States now focusing attention on these practices, the Administration may be heading into trouble. At the beginning of March, the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, Terry Davis, reported publicly on the responses his office had received from 45 of the 46 States Parties to the European Convention on Human Rights concerning extraordinary rendition and secret detention. Under a mandatory procedure, the Council asked States to answer a short list of questions aimed not only at assessing each Member's potential involvement in the practices, but also &#8212; more crucially &#8212; their procedures for ensuring that intelligence services stay within the bounds of human rights law. As the "war on terror" becomes the "long war," this is one discussion that the legal community should focus on with diligence. <br /><br />"Extraordinary rendition" is not a legal term; it describes the perverted form of a practice already defined by its informality. Used by the U.S. since the Reagan era, rendition involves the extra-legal transfer of an individual from one state to another. While originally used to bring suspected terrorists into the United States so they could stand trial before federal courts, it morphed during the Clinton presidency into a procedure through which the U.S. would effect the transfer of suspects from one country to another where they were expected to stand trial. After 9/11, the process apparently took on a new purpose: intelligence-gathering. Instead of focusing on suspects with pending charges, the U.S. sent detainees to States known to "employ interrogation techniques that will enable them to obtain the requisite information," as one alarmed F.B.I. agent explained. These were States that the U.S. had itself accused of widespread and systematic torture, including Syria, Egypt, and Morocco. Rendition to justice had become rendition to torture, or extraordinary rendition. <br /><br />Unlike extraordinary rendition, secret detention does not have clear predecessors in U.S. intelligence history. Instead, it appears to be a new practice for the U.S., in which individuals are held in "black sites" run entirely off the radar of normal civilian or military procedures. Such detentions are not monitored by the International Committee of the Red Cross, and they apparently involve transfers of prisoners from site to site to evade detection. Thus far, no one has argued that unacknowledged incommunicado detention by U.S. agents was authorized by presidents of a bygone era, or that the practice has long been an essential tool in the fight against terrorism. This is not surprising &#8212; clear norms exist to proscribe secret detentions under international human rights law. In the European, Inter-American, and United Nations human rights systems, a deep jurisprudence has developed against this practice &#8212; based on the lessons of Latin America's "dirty war" &#8212; a practice more properly called enforced disappearance.<br /><br />Neither extraordinary rendition nor secret detention can be carried out without the cooperation of allied governments. This cooperation may range from involvement through intelligence-gathering or detainee handover to passive cooperation in the form of a blind eye turned to the real reason behind CIA flights or a no-questions-asked policy toward the use of military installations that could house detainees in secret. Suspicions that the latter two forms of acquiescence were being practiced by the Member States of the Council of Europe led to the Secretary-General's inquiry initiated in November 2005. <br /><br />With a striking uniformity, States from across the many spectrums of the enlarged Europe appear to have inadequate safeguards for ensuring that intelligence services abide by the human rights obligations of their home States or the countries where they operate. As Terry Davis explained, "We need an appropriate regulatory framework providing for effective safeguards against abuse, democratic oversight by national Parliaments and judicial control in cases of alleged human rights violations." Without such mechanisms, governments can answer, sometimes honestly, that they were not aware of the activities of their own agencies, or that they could not be held responsible for the actions of the U.S. CIA for missions conducted on their territory. <br /><br />If core rights, such as due process and the right to be free from torture, are to have any real meaning, they must apply to the actions of those we have often thought of as operating "outside" the law. Intelligence services have been asked to take on new and expanded roles in this untraditional "war": they are detectives, investigating crimes and collecting evidence, and they are jailers, holding keys to a realm that we hear about only in shadowy bits, leaked information or the testimony of a former "disappeared" or rendered person like Khaled El-Masri or Maher Arar. If democracies like ours do not exercise oversight and regulate these activities through enforceable laws, intelligence agencies will become judge and jury as well. At that point, the rule of law will have been rendered meaningless.<br /><br /><br /><em>Margaret Satterthwaite is Assistant Professor of Clinical Law at NYU School of Law and Faculty Director of the Center for Human Rights and Global Research.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a> and <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/Friedman.cfm">Lawrence Friedman</a> of New England School of Law say that the President&#39;s stretching of US military resources close to the breaking point in Iraq raises a constitutional issue demanding Congressional intervention ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/victorhansen.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/forumy/lawrencefriedman.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>R</strong></font>ecently, much attention has been paid in the media to the legality of many of the Bush administration&#39;s efforts to prevent future terrorist attacks in the United States, including the use of torture on terrorism suspects and widespread electronic surveillance of domestic telephone and Internet traffic.  Lost in the headlines has been further confirmation that the U.S. Army is stretched too thin.  The latest indicator has come by way of a Pentagon-commissioned report from Andrew Krepinevich.  The essence of the report is that the troop deployments to Iraq cannot be sustained at current troop levels and that the Army is in danger of reaching the breaking point.  This is not just a military or logistical matter - it is also an issue of constitutional dimension, one that involves specific allocations of authority between Congress and the President.  <br /><br />While the President's authority as Commander in Chief includes the discretion to control military forces in the field and matters related to the national defense, he does not have the unchecked power to regulate the armed forces or to determine the appropriate troop levels and force composition.  The Constitution expressly authorizes the Congress, among other things, to "provide for the common Defense," U.S. Const., Art. I, &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 1; to raise and support armies, see id. &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 12, and to "make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces," see id. &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 14.  The President, on the other hand, has the authority to see "that the Laws [are] faithfully executed," Art. II, &Acirc;&#167; 3, and to serve as the Commander-in-Chief, see id. &Acirc;&#167; 2, cl. 2.  Given these textual commitments of authority and responsibility, in no sense can it be maintained that the President has exclusive authority over matters related to foreign affairs and national security, in particular maintenance of the country's armed forces.  <br /><br />Indeed, Congress is constitutionally required to exercise its appropriations authority in respect to the armed forces every two years, and the Congress in modern times has consistently exercised that power. See id. &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl.12.  Congressional authority does not end at the decision to raise an army; it embraces as well the discretionary authority to "support" the army&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;to regulate its size and composition.  There is little support in history for the view that, once the Congress called an armed force into existence, the issue of its maintenance would fall within the Executive authority.  As Alexander Hamilton noted in Federalist No. 69, the President's constitutional power as Commander in Chief relates to the command and direction of military forces; it does not extend to "the . . . regulating of fleets and armies."  And the Supreme Court has taken the view that constitutional text means what it says.  The Court concluded in Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748 (1996), for example, that the Executive has the power to regulate the conduct of members of the military, but he may do so only so long as those regulations do not conflict with Congressional enactments.  <br /><br />Congress, in short, has the constitutional authority to ensure that the armed forces are well-maintained under the watch of any President.  As Professor Louis Henkin put it in his seminal essay on the Constitution and foreign affairs, "[t]he evidence is that in the framers' contemplation, the armed forces would be under the command of the President but at the disposition of Congress"  (Louis Henkin, <em>Constitutionalism, Democracy, and Foreign Affairs</em> 25 (1990)).  It follows that Congress has a responsibility to take the President to task when, as is the case today, his increasingly unreasonable assessment of the Army's long term needs and sustainability threatens the structure and integrity of American military capacities as the world's most powerful fighting force.  Congress abdicates that responsibility when it does not fully inquire into the status and condition of that force.<br /><br />One might argue that questioning the President's handling of the composition and maintenance of the Army is just another aspect of the criticism that has been leveled at the administration's decision-making in respect to the war in Iraq and the post-war occupation.  But that would miss the point that the current problem concerns the Army's ability to defend the nation apart from the ongoing American involvement in Iraq.  And the problem of force strength is not an issue&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;like the administration's views on the use of torture or deployment of a domestic electronic surveillance program&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;that may be resolved by the federal courts.  Rather, the constitutional obligation to ensure that the military's ability to defend the nation lies squarely with the Congress.  <br /><br />In exercising its constitutional role in the appropriations process, Congress must take into consideration evidence like the Krepinevich report.  While the military services through the Department of Defense determine what they believe the appropriate levels of troop strength should be, Congress is not obligated to accept the Department of Defense's or the administration's views as to the appropriate levels of troop strength and composition.  Congress must conduct its own inquiry through congressional hearings and investigation, and determine independent of the administration what the state of the Army is and what the appropriate force levels are for the Army in the future.  Congress must then provide an honest assessment both in the appropriations process and otherwise about the real costs of sustaining the world's best fighting force over the long term. <br /><br />This issue naturally implicates current debates about the extent of Congress's war powers.  Congress has long claimed its constitutional authority to declare war makes it an equal partner with the Executive in matters concerning the national defense, while this President more than his predecessors views his authority in this regard as virtually limitless. If Congress wants to assert that authority, it must begin by fulfilling its constitutional obligation to see that the Army is sufficiently manned and fully resourced.  The nation simply cannot afford to rely on the President's short-sighted and unrealistic assessments of the Army's condition any longer.<br /><br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps and currently teaches courses in criminal law at New England School of Law, where Lawrence Friedman teaches courses in constitutional law.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: &quot;By substituting the language of respectful negotiation for that of threats, the Bush administration is on the right track in dealing with Iran over nuclear power issues. The policy reverses the neo-conservative fantasies of defeating Iran in the battlefield. Sobered by ceaseless killings in Iraq, the Bush administration has learned a bitter lesson that the policy of shock and awe is not only morally bankrupt, but it does not work. At some point, the authors of Iraqi war will be held accountable under the laws of the United States and the laws of Nations. Meanwhile, the change of policy from invasion to diplomacy is a welcome development. It is also consistent with the UN Charter.<br /><br />Article 33 of the United Nations Charter imposes an affirmative obligation on member states, which Iran and the United States are, to resolve any dispute, the continuance of which threatens intentional peace or security, by means of &quot;negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means.&quot;  Whether Iran is making nuclear energy for civilian needs or weapons is a &quot;dispute&quot; in every aspect of the word.  A dispute is by definition the existence of two or more irreconcilable viewpoints on the same issue.  The United States contends that Iran is engaged in building nuclear weapons. And Iran insists that it has a right to manufacture nuclear energy and that it is not building nuclear weapons. These divergent viewpoints constitute a dispute under the language of the Article 33. Furthermore, the dispute carries the potential to trigger an armed conflict.  In view of these facts, the United States and Iran are under a Charter obligation to seek peaceful solutions to their irreconcilable contentions. If negotiations fail, the parties may resort to binding arbitration. But this process will fail if any party sees nothing but war at the end of the tunnel.&quot;<br />

Speculation is mounting that fresh off his recent &quot;re-election&quot; (stolen as it was) to the presidency of Belarus, Lukashenko will seek to re-federate with Russia, forming a new country and requiring a new federal-level constitutional agreement which could open up a new office for Putin to occupy - President of the Russian/Belarussian Federation.  This, Putin could do without violating the Russian constitution.  Similarly, Slobodan Milosevic occupied the federal Yugoslav presidency after he left the Serbian presidency (and we all know what happened after that).&quot;<br />

		<title>The balance of civil/military power and the DOD Law of War Working Group</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Geoffrey_Corn.htm"><strong>Geoffrey Corn</strong></a>, South Texas College of Law: &quot;On May 9th, the Department of Defense published a revised version of <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/d2311_01e.pdf">Department of Defense Directive 5100.77</a>, &quot;The Department of Defense Law of War Program.&quot;  This Directive is the foundation for all law of war related policies, training, application, and compliance programs  throughout the armed forces.  Like the prior version, establishes as a matter of DOD policy that the armed forces of the United States shall comply with the law of war during all armed conflicts and all other operations.  This policy mandate provides the consistent standard for military units executing military operations across the &quot;conflict spectrum.&quot;  <br /><br />This Directive also establishes the Department of Defense Law of War Working Group, the DOD &quot;think tank&quot; on law of war issues.  In a subtle but potentially significant modification to the prior version of the Directive, the composition of the Working Group has been modified.  In the past, although chaired by the DOD General Counsel, this Working Group was composed almost exclusively of representatives from the uniformed legal services: representatives of the Service Judge Advocate&#39;s General and the Legal Adviser to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  The revised version of the Directive alters this composition by including representatives from each Service General Counsel&#39;s office.  Unlike their uniformed counterparts, the General Counsels are political appointees who serve as legal advisers to the civilian chains of command for each Service, and are therefore normally not responsible for providing advice on operational issues.<br /><br />The inclusion of these representatives may be a positive development, but it is without question a significant change.  According to the media, certain controversial legal issues related to the &quot;war on terror&quot; have disagreements between the uniformed legal advisers and their civilian counterparts.  One must question why the longstanding composition of the Working Group was modified.  If the purpose was to enhance the analytical process by including more voices, the change should be applauded.  However, if the purpose was to dilute the effectiveness of the uniformed legal adviser&#39;s by increasing the representation of the politically appointed General Counsels, this change might further strain the civil/military balance within the DOD legal community.  Only time will tell.&quot;<br />

		<title>War crimes and the limits of combatant immunity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Geoffrey_Corn.htm"><strong>Geoffrey S. Corn</strong></a> [South Texas College of Law]: &quot;Media attention is once again focusing on the laws of war.  Recent reports indicate that a criminal investigation is underway to determine whether members of a U.S. Marine unit should be prosecuted for &quot;war crimes&quot; in Iraq.  The incident under investigation allegedly involved what some have characterized as a series of &quot;revenge killings&quot; immediately after the Marine unit suffered casualties from an improvised explosive device.  Information made public to date indicates that in response to the IED attack, the Marines went through nearby homes and killed a number of unarmed civilians who posed no immediate threat to the unit. <br /><br />As with any criminal investigation it is inappropriate to speculate on exactly what occurred during the incident without the benefit of all the relevant facts.  However, some initial observations seem in order.  <br /><br />First, it is important to understand how the U.S. military prosecutes individuals suspected of violating the laws of war.  It is the longstanding practice of the Department of Defense to charge &quot;war crimes&quot; as violations of the punitive articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  These articles include statutory prohibitions against murder, manslaughter, and many other &quot;common law&quot; criminal offenses.  Accordingly, if the military authorities determine that these killings were unlawful, the likely charges will not be &quot;war crimes&quot;, but instead murder, manslaughter, or any other violation of the UCMJ supported by the evidence.  This policy in no way diminishes the character of the underlying misconduct, but instead reflects the pragmatic reality that efficient criminal disposition is facilitated by relying on the well-establishes principles of military criminal law derived from the Code.<br /><br />Second, regardless of the nature of a potential charges, the underlying principle is clear: not all killings in war are lawful.  Some commentators have already raised the question of whether killings in the &quot;fog of war&quot; should ever be considered illegal.  The answer to that question is emphatically yes.  War certainly provides a &quot;blanket of immunity&quot; for warriors, an immunity derived from the laws and customs of war.  This law essentially &quot;legalizes&quot; conduct that would be illegal in peacetime.  Warriors engaged in armed conflicts are required to take those measures necessary to defeat their enemies, including killing members of that enemy force.  They do so as agents of their respective states, and so long as their destructive activities comply with the laws of war, they are immune from any criminal sanction.  <br /><br />However, this immunity is far from absolute.  The &quot;blanket of immunity&quot; is essentially co-extensive with the laws of war.  Therefore, killings or other destructive actions not authorized by the laws of war fall outside this immunity.  In short, when a warrior inflicts harm or destruction that is not authorized by the laws of war, the warrior derives no &quot;immunity&quot; from this law, and the conduct is therefore unlawful.  In this regard, as Telford Taylor noted, the term &quot;war crime&quot; is actually a misnomer, for a &quot;war crime&quot; is simply an act that was criminal in peacetime, and remains criminal even if committed by a warrior in wartime.  Thus, a killing that is murder in peacetime is also murder in wartime if it is not justified by the authority derived from the laws of war.  <br /><br />Nothing in the laws and customs of war permits the killing of unarmed civilians who pose no immediate threat to an armed force, even if the force suspects them of supporting the enemy.  On the contrary, it is a fundamental principle of this law that combatants must always distinguish between the lawful objects of attack and all other individuals, and any person not taking an active part in hostilities falls into the latter category.  The &quot;fog of war&quot; provides no exception to this cardinal principle, nor does rage, anger, frustration, or suspicion of enemy sympathies.  Thus, if these victims posed no immediate threat to the Marines who killed them, the laws of war provide no immunity for the killings, and prosecution for criminal homicide would clearly be an appropriate sanction.&quot;<br />

Kelly</strong></a> [Creighton University School of Law]: &quot;From the perspective of the outside world, Gen. Michael Hayden&#39;s decision to wear his military uniform makes it appear that the military is taking over the CIA.  And from their perspective, about the only thing worse than the CIA after Iraq is the U.S. military.  Perspective matters.  This administration doesn&#39;t take it into account much and the poor foreign policy results are evident.  Indeed, that is the underlying reason that the U.S. is so widely viewed as losing the battle for hearts and minds in this protracted war on terror generally and in the Iraq operation particularly.  <br /><br />The stream of poor policy choices by the Bush administration reinforce this conclusion:  fencing off our border with Mexico, eavesdroping on our own citizens and throwing some of them into military brigs without access to courts or counsel, indefinite detention of people at secret locations known as black sites, and the continuing torture of foreign detainees in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Cuba.  The message seems to be that we no longer respect human rights, that we no longer trust even our own citizens, and that civil liberties are available only when they are convenient at the whim of whatever government is in power.  Again, from the perspective of the rest of the world, which viewed America during both World Wars and the Cold War as a beacon of freedom, hope and opportunity and after 9/11 as the victim of an unprovoked attack, America has become that which it most abhors:  a security state that is evermore closing itself off from the world and its own people - a self-protecting government.  That is the hallmark of a state in distress, closing in on itself.  <br /><br />America is not that state, and never should become so, but that perspective is being fed continuously by this administration, and Gen. Hayden is helping it along even further today.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26"><strong>Michael J. Kelly</strong></a> [Creighton University School of Law]: &quot;With Porter Goss&#39;s resignation as CIA director, President Bush is presented with an opportunity to make real and lasting changes to a broken intelligence system.  The cosmetic changes of two years ago (putting John Negroponte into a newly independent oversight post of Director of National Intelligence and blurring some of the lines between the 14 federal intelligenge agencies) did little to address the sweeping changes offered up by the 9/11 commission and members of Congress.  In fact, the CIA continues to sink ever more deeply to the abyss of public skepticism as more abuses come to light involving torture, detention, rendition to third countries and the use of secret &quot;black sites&quot; where suspects remain hidden from public scrutiny indefinitely.  <br /><br />This, of course, is a disturbing background for an agency that has been given assassination privileges upon presidential intelligence findings - the CIA these days is using armed Predator drones to take out &quot;suspected&quot; terrorists.  What emerges is a picture of an unaccountable agency that is spinning wildly (and dangerously) out of control.  With Goss&#39;s departure and Bush&#39;s re-election safely in hand, the president can utilize this unique opportunity of not having to face voters again and really shake up the intelligence community in such a way that moves us further from the model of fighting the Cold War against the now non-existent KGB and more toward the model of engaging an enemy that is more unpredictable, unascertainable, and stubbornly impenetrable.  Hopefully the president&#39;s new Chief of Staff, Josh Bolten, understands this long-term strategic need as well as he understood the short-term political need to shake up the White House staff.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/shane.html">Peter Shane</a> of Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, says that the Bush Administration&#39;s apparent lack of respect for norms of constitutional governance is more troubling than any breaches of technical law in either the NSA domestic surveillance program or the more recent FBI search of Rep. William Jefferson&#39;s congressional office...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petershane2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>E</strong></font>ven more disturbing than the particular assertions of executive power embodied in the NSA surveillance scandal and the May 20-21 FBI search of the legislative offices of Rep. William Jefferson (D-LA) is what the two episodes reveal about how the Bush Administration thinks about the Constitution and about American freedom.<br /><br /> What the Administration does not understand is that effective governance depends not just on laws, but on norms - informal understandings that constrain behavior in order to help people and institutions achieve the benefits of ordered liberty.<br /><br /> Among neighbors, the point is obvious.  Every property owner is protected by a set of technical legal rules that prohibit various forms of nuisance and intrusion.  But no one thinks it is neighborly to be every bit as noisy, intrusive, and inconsiderate as the law permits.  In order to achieve the peace and mutual enjoyment that is the essence of domestic tranquility, we learn to be quieter and more accommodating than we are technically compelled to be.  We don't just obey the law.  We follow the norms of good neighbors.<br /><br /> From the perspective of norms, the technical legality or illegality of NSA surveillance is almost beside the point.  That is because, legal or illegal, such surveillance is a profound threat to freedom, virtually unprecedented in American history. <br /> <br /> The point is perhaps easier to see if we think about a low-tech analogy, namely, the post office.  Legally, none of us has an enforceable interest in privacy in what we write on the outside of our envelopes.  If I am a suspected smuggler and postal inspectors write down the addressees of every parcel that carries my return address, my legal rights have not been violated.<br /><br /> It would follow, according to the Bush Administration's way of thinking about the NSA, that I would also have nothing to complain about should the Post Office decide to organize a database that records the addresses and return addresses on every piece of mail that any American sends anywhere.  If reading the outside of one carefully targeted envelope is permissible, so is reading them all.<br /><br /> There is room for debate about whether such a database would be legal.  What would be unmistakable, however, is that such data gathering would embody a fundamental breach in a norm of government respect for personal autonomy that we have always thought central to the American conception of freedom.  <br /><br /> An America in which ordinary citizens have their mail "surveilled" would be a different America from the country in which virtually all of us think we live.  Our freedom would be lost not because a law was broken, but because of the breakdown in respect for the norms of liberty and government self-restraint.  This is precisely what is at stake in the case of NSA surveillance, as well.<br /><br /> The May 20-21 FBI search of the legislative offices of Rep. William Jefferson (D-LA) is disturbing for much the same reason.  It reflects yet another distressing erosion in the norms of constitutional governance that have helped sustain American liberty for over 200 years.<br /><br /> Whether the search technically violated the so-called Speech and Debate Clause of Article I, section 6 of the U.S. Constitution is not clear.  But it certainly violates its spirit.<br /><br /> The framers of the Constitution gave us a government of checks and balances, and of separated powers, in order to protect us from tyranny.  The drafters of the Speech and Debate Clause realized that our liberty depends upon having a legislative branch co-equal in authority to the President and the courts.<br />  <br /> Yet, Senators and Representatives could not function effectively as a co-equal branch of government if they were subject to being policed by the executive and judiciary in the conduct of legislative business. Seen in that light, it can hardly be doubted that the prospect of executive branch searches threatens the ideal of legislative independence with which congressional offices were supposed to be administered.  The FBI may not have interfered directly in Rep. Jefferson's discharge of his duties, but the danger to all legislators is now patent.<br /><br /> If America is to survive as a free society, it is not enough that our Constitution and statutes set precise limits on executive, legislative, and judicial power.  There must be a deep understanding by all public officials that freedom, like neighborliness, needs breathing space around law's precise boundaries.  Our constitutional system cannot hope to achieve its intended virtues if every branch of government pushes its technical powers to their logical limit. <br />    <br /><br /><em>Peter M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a TARGET="_blank" href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Geoffrey_Corn.htm">Geoffrey S. Corn</a>, Lt. Col. US Army (Ret.) and former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters, now a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that the killings of Iraqi civilians at Haditha, like the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War, illustrate critical aspects of the law of war even as they ostensibly manifest its failure....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/cornforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>s Haditha the My Lai of the war in Iraq? The question is not at all surprising.  The thought of warriors wearing the uniform of the United States killing unarmed men, women, and children is perhaps even more shocking today than it was in 1969.  Of course, debate has already commenced on whether any comparison between the incidents is valid considering the disparate number of killings - some 500 - that occurred at My Lai.  But this quantitative focus misses the point.  It is the qualitative aspect of both these sad incidents that serves as a profound reminder that, as I have stated previously on JURIST, the law of war is as much about war as it is about law.<br /><br /> Let me state at the outset that I write this editorial based on the assumption that the initial reports of unjustified killing at Haditha are in fact accurate.  Like any investigation, this certainly involves a degree of speculation.  However, even if the facts ultimately lead to a contrary conclusion, the mere suspicion of such unjustified killings serves as a reminder that the law of war and the discipline essential to a morally sound military force are inevitably connected.<br /><br /> If these killings were not justified by the exigencies of war, they fall outside the scope of what is known as combatant immunity.  Whether characterized as war crimes or as criminal homicides in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the underlying premise is the same: even in war there are limits on when it is permissible to kill.  This premise was eloquently expressed by Telford Taylor in his seminal work on the Vietnam conflict, <em>Vietnam, an American Tragedy</em>:<blockquote>War does not confer a license to kill for personal reasons &#8212; to gratify perverse impulses, or to put out of the way anyone who appears obnoxious, or to whose welfare the soldier is indifferent.  War is not a license at all, but an obligation to kill for reasons of state; it does not countenance the infliction of suffering for its own sake or for revenge.</blockquote>This quote provides insight into the first qualitative similarity between Haditha and My Lai.  The law of war lies as the very core of military discipline, for it provides the barrier between killing required on behalf of the strategic interests of the state and the instinct of revenge and retribution so routinely aroused in the hearts and minds of young warriors.  Haditha, like My Lai, involved a group of warriors who had been subjected to countless "faceless" attacks by remotely detonated explosives.  In My Lai, these took the form of landmines.  In fact, the My Lai district was one of the most heavily mined areas in all of South Vietnam.  In Haditha, they took the form of improvised explosive devices (IEDs).  <br /><br /> In both conflicts, these enemy weapons extracted a devastating toll on U.S. forces.  Their inability to identify and respond to an enemy associated with these attacks invariably led to tremendous frustration, and almost certainly rage.  The most profound lesson from My Lai for members of the profession of arms was that at no other time is the law of war more important than when this sense of frustration triggers the instinct of revenge.  It is at this point when the existence of "rules", and the commitment to respect for these rules, must operate to preserve the line between killing for justifiable reasons of state and killing for the illicit purpose of revenge or retribution.  <br /><br /> Both My Lai and Haditha also demonstrate another critical component of the law of war: the relationship between the law and leadership.  Upon hearing the news reports of the Haditha killings, international lawyers began to use the term war crime.  Upon hearing the same news, military professionals almost certainly contemplated the breakdown in discipline that must have facilitated the killings.  This reveals the simple truth that it is discipline, implemented by competent leadership, that must be relied upon to ensure warriors embrace the logic of the law of war and comply with its mandates during the most stressful moments of combat.  As one former colleague was apt to remind his students at the Army Judge Advocate General's School, "the troops need to understand why this law matters, because you can't ask for a recess in war."  If the initial reports coming from Haditha are confirmed, it will, like My Lai, be as representative of a failure of leadership and discipline as it is of a violation of the law of war.  More importantly, it will also once again confirm that effective leaders must truly understand the relationship between the law of war and a morally sound force.<br /><br /> This reveals another critical aspect of implementation of the law of war: the need to ensure that warriors understand the logic of the rules more in terms of war and less in terms of law.  Warriors must be taught that respect for these rules will ultimately contribute to the achievement of the strategic objectives for which they place their lives at risk.  They must understand that like any other aspect of their duties, their may be times when this compliance might result short term sacrifice, but that this sacrifice will contribute to long term benefit.  They must also be taught that these rules were developed over the centuries primarily by military leaders who understood the negative consequences of a lawless battlefield.  Only by embracing this logic will the law of war provide an effective shield between the warriors and their darker instincts, for as history has demonstrated time and again, during the extremes of mortal combat, the deterrent influence of potential criminal sanction is of limited utility.  Thus, Haditha once again reminds us that the law of war must be understood not primarily in terms of legal consequences, but in how it impacts the accomplishment of the military mission.<br /> <br /> In this regard, it is therefore not surprising that the Commandant of the Marine Corps recently went to Iraq to emphasize to his Corps the relationship between the moralities reflected in the law of war and the profession of arms.  He, like so many other leaders of that fine force, must certainly understand that compliance with the law of war is essential to achieve the strategic goals of the nation.  Indeed, President Bush is no doubt correct that members of the Marine Corps itself are as troubled by these revelations as anyone else, for these professionals understand better than most the strategic consequences of failing to comply with this law.<br /><br /> This leads to perhaps most unfortunate similarity between My Lai and Haditha: how the exception of non-compliance swallows the rule of compliance.  Perhaps no single event from the Vietnam War became more symbolic of the conduct of American warriors than My Lai.  This is almost certainly a reflection of the validity of the other comment made by President Bush: that American warriors are held to the highest standard.  But it is truly tragic that the faithful, moral, and admirable service of hundreds of thousands of Americans in Vietnam was overshadowed by the deplorable conduct of one platoon of soldiers and their substandard leader.  Indeed, it is the name of Lieutenant Calley, and not that of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4589486.stm">Captain Hugh Tho
mpson</a> - the true hero of My Lai who threatened to fire on members of Calley's platoon from his helicopter in order to shield civilians from harm &#8212; that is etched in the American memory.   A force held to the highest standard of professionalism and morality should not be surprised by such an illogical disparity.  <br /> <br /> As in Vietnam, hundreds of thousands of American warriors have served in Iraq with great distinction.  They have endured the harrows of war, and the frustrations of constant attacks by an elusive enemy that seeks to exploit their compliance with the law of war to gain tactical advantage.  The vast majority of these warriors have not wavered in their commitment to the moral principles at the core of both the law of war and the profession of arms.  It will indeed be unfortunate if like My Lai, Haditha improperly becomes the event that defines the character of their service.  <br /><br /> More importantly, it should be a reminder to every leader in the U.S. military that these highest standards must be enforced.  Haditha, like My Lai, validates once again the concept of the "strategic private" &#8212; that the actions of an 18-year old private can have strategic consequences in the time it takes for news to travel the internet.  It is therefore incumbent on the armed forces to conduct a legitimate, thorough, and transparent investigation of these killings.  If this investigation establishes a basis for prosecutions, they must be pursued without delay, and reach all those responsible for both the killings and any subsequent failure to make an immediate and legitimate investigation into the incident.  The military justice system is fully capable of dealing with any allegation of criminal misconduct.  If Marines are prosecuted, fellow members of the profession of arms will judge them.  While critics will no doubt question the legitimacy of this process, there is truly logic in allowing members of the profession of arms sit in judgment on those accused of breaching the law so central to their profession. <br /><br /> It is equally incumbent on the American public to allow this process to work, and to place this incident into proper context.  It is an unfortunate reality that the brutality of war will almost always lead warriors to cross the barrier between justified and unjustified killings.  What is important, however, is that this truly does represent an exception and not the rule.  <br /><br /> The law of war has endured over centuries not because it never fails, but because it works most of the time.  What the Haditha incident must come to stand for is a renewed commitment to making this law work better in the future.  Accordingly, every leader who wears the uniform of the United States must once again consider the lessons so painfully learned over three decades ago at My Lai, remaining vigilant in order to prevent the warriors entrusted by the nation to their charge from transforming war from an ugly necessity of state to a personal vendetta. <br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S.

In fact the trial has become such an embarrassment to the United States that the American puppeteers are likely committing war crimes themselves.<br /><br /><em>Illegal from the Start</em><br /> <br />The glaring illegalities of the current process begin with illegal origins. The invasion and occupation of Iraq is widely understood to be illegal. On 5 March 2003, three of the five members of UN Security Council and Germany, which was then a non-permanent member, unambiguously declared that a US-led invasion without further Security Council authorization would violate international law. On 16 September 2004, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan reiterated what was by then obvious to almost every international lawyer, that the invasion and occupation of Iraq is illegal. In fact, this is a textbook case of illegal aggression in violation of the prohibition of the use of force by one country against another found in article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations and under customary international law. <br /><br />The Nuremberg Tribunal described such illegal aggression as &quot;essentially an evil thing. Its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone, but affect the whole world. To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.&quot; <br /><br />It is not the person on trial in Iraq who committed this crime, but the American President George W. Bush and his allies. Rather than being brought to justice for their crimes, the Bush administration and it allies resorted to trying their victims in a manner that insults longstanding concepts of justice and fair trial &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; both a central Islamic value and an international human right. To the Bush administration their actions apparently justified or at least distracted attention away from their own illegal actions.<br /><br />One of the ends of this illegal act was to capture, detain, try, and execute the President of Iraq who had dared to stand up to the will of a powerful country like the United States. The creation of the Iraqi Special Tribunal (IST), which is sometimes known as the Iraqi Higher Criminal Court, and the subsequent trials are acts taken to fulfill this goal. <br /><br />Under international law, when illegal acts have such consequences, all states are obliged not to recognize them. This rule, which is adopted in article 41(2) of the famed International Law Commission's Draft Article on State Responsibility, prevents states from benefiting from their own illegal act.<br /><br />As if the inherent illegality of the court were not enough, the United States has constantly taunted the international community by orchestrating a trial that is as widely criticized as unfair as the invasion of Iraq is illegal.<br /><br /><em>Unfair Trial</em><br /><br />The violations of unfair trial are too numerous to mention here, but include almost every provision in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that could be violated at this juncture of the proceedings. <br /><br />Among the other striking violations of the human right to a fair trial are the lack of equality of power between the parties and the lack of an independent and impartial tribunal. <br /><br />The inequality of power can be illustrated simply in dollar values. The United States has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars supporting the prosecution of the Iraqi President; the defense lawyers are working as volunteers with hardly enough money to travel to Iraq. The inequality of power can also be illustrated in minutes, days, weeks, and months. The prosecution alleges to have been collecting evidence since at least 1991 &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; which, of course, could only be true if it were the United States government doing the collecting &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and has at least been doing so since April 2003 when dozens of American lawyers and Iraqis who had not lived in Iraq for years were shuttled in to build a case. The defense lawyers, despite requesting visits with their client since December 2003 when he was detained, have to date not been allowed the confidential visits that are necessary to begin to prepare a defense. No visits were allowed with the most senior lawyers until after the trial had started and at each visit American officials exercise the authority to read any materials brought into the visiting room despite the fact that all meetings remain under close audio and visual surveillance. As if this were not enough, evidence has been withheld from the defense lawyers. They have been denied access to investigative hearings; they have been denied prior notice of witnesses, and they are prevented from even visiting the site of the alleged crime. <br /><br />All of these rights of the defendant are part of the right to a fair trial under both Iraqi law and international law. This law is merely violated with impunity. The extent of this impunity was evidenced on 24 January of this year when judicial clerk Riza Hasan attempted to return a more than fifty-page brief that had been submitted to the IST claiming that "the judges did not want it." Perhaps he was explaining why none of the eight motions which have been before the IST for months, including motions on illegality of the IST and disqualification of specific judges, have never received a written reply. <br /><br />The interference with the independence of the tribunal has permeated all its aspects. Four out of five judges who started the cases have been removed, two by publicly announced interference connected to the United States occupying powers. In September 2005, four prominent statesmen wrote the UN Secretary-General advising him of the threat to participants in the trial in Iraq. These warnings were ignored. Several weeks later two defense lawyers were murdered in a manner suggesting possible involvement of the authorities in Iraq. More recently a possible defense witness was killed when his whereabouts were disclosed to US authorities. Even US President George W. Bush has declared that the trial is on track and that the Iraqi President will be executed.<br /><br />Such statements coming from judges of the IST also indicate a clear lack of impartiality. In a film by Jean-Pierre Krief for Arte France and KS Visions that was shown in France in 2005, a judge of the tribunal states that the Iraqi President who was then about to go on trial before them had "persecuted the Kurds. He killed them, wiped many of them out. He also used chemical weapons with the aim of committing genocide against this race, against this people, to eradicate them as a nat
ion. He also went after the Shiites due to their religious beliefs." Another judge states that the President is "one of the worst tyrants in history." These are not the statements of an impartial judge who in the inquisitorial system of justice is both the evaluator of law and fact.<br /><br />In March 2006 the European Court of Human Rights avoided having to decide if the trial violated international human rights law by claiming that it had no jurisdiction because the European allies of the United States were not involved in the trial. The Court did implicitly seem to agree that it was the United States &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and not Iraq &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; who were responsible for the trial. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on 30 November 2005 and the UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers in March 2006 explicitly confirmed that the United States shared responsibility with the Iraqi authorities. <br /><br />These latter two human rights experts have also condemned the trial as unfair. In his March 2006 report to the newly created Council on Human Rights the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro Despouy, stated that after "analysis and special concern of the Special Rapporteur since 10 December 2003 when the Statute of the Iraqi Special Tribunal (IST) was adopted and throughout its development &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; [the Special Rapporteur] express[es] his reservations regarding the legitimacy of the tribunal, its limited competence in terms of people and time and the breach of international human rights principles and standards to which it gives rise."<br /><br /><em>What to do About an Unfair Trial before an Illegal Tribunal?</em><br /><br />What is the solution for this mess? How can the rule of law be restored? <br /><br />Some answer has been given before the whole process started by the original architect of the special Court, DePaul University professor Cherif Bassiouni, and more recently by the UN's expert on fair trials, Professor Leandro Despouy. Both these formidable experts have indicated that the trial must be before a truly international court under UN auspices. Both have pointed to the several examples of such courts that exist today.<br /><br />Although the UN may not come with clean hands into the fray, they are perhaps the only way out for the United States. The solutions proffered and orchestrated by the United States to date merely emulate and emphasize already serious violations of international law. The path currently being followed is truly one where a cast of the worst criminals are running the legal system. Is this really how American democracy views the rule of law?<br /><br />Perhaps a more important question is when will the international community act?<br /> <br />Although the opinions expressed above indicate a widespread perception that the trial is illegal and unfair, the international community, particularly the Security Council, has to date refused to take on the responsibility of ensuring respect for the rule of law.<br /><br />Despite having acknowledged in UN SC Resolution 1483 that the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Iraq is responsible for "promoting the protection of human rights" in Iraq, little successful action has been taken. This was confirmed earlier this year when the outgoing UN human rights chief in Iraqi, John Pace, described the human rights situation as worse than under the previous regime and deteriorating daily. Taking a stand on the issue of unfair trial would be a good place for the UN to start promoting human rights. The fairness of these proceedings, which are closely followed by Iraqis and throughout the Arab world, is a crucial test of the international community's commitment to the rule of law.<br />    <br /><br /><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Doebbler">Curtis F.J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor Marjorie Cohn of Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego says that although reparations for African-American slavery remain an elusive goal due largely to misconceptions about what they might entail, meaningful reparations could in practice come in different forms in different contexts...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/cohncolor.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><blockquote><em>The reparations movement is grounded in the civil rights movement and the social justice movements of the 1960s &#8212; 1980s.</em><br /><br />- Congressman John Conyers, keynote address, March 18, 2006</blockquote><font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>ne hundred and forty years after the end of legalized slavery and 40 years after the passage of civil rights legislation, the legacy of slavery persists. In employment, education, healthcare, and criminal justice, African-Americans suffer from institutionalized racism.  The movement to secure reparations for slavery has gained new traction with recent successes of Holocaust litigants.  But it remains an elusive goal, due, in large part, to common misconceptions about what reparations would really mean.<br /><br />Last month, Congressman John Conyers and scholars from around the country participated in an historic gathering to address the myriad issues arising from the debate over reparations.  Held at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, the two-day conference focused on slavery and reparations as well as other instances of mass injustice in relation to the themes of justice, causation, group responsibility, moral culpability, racism and forgiveness.  <br /><br />Thomas Jefferson School of Law professor Kaimipono Wenger described reparations as "an acknowledgement of the displacement of the rule of law under slavery."  He noted that Blacks were denied civil and political rights even after slavery ended.  "Not only are reparations consistent with the rule of law," he said.  "They are in fact a product of the rule of law."<br /><br />Conyers told the conference, "After slavery ended, a new form of subjugation kicked in.  There is a continuing, traceable, uninterrupted connection of racial subjugation that explains why there are ghettos today."<br /><br />The first reparations for slavery came in the form of land.  Titles to 40-acre tracts were distributed to the head of each family of freedmen.  Animals that were no longer useful to the military &#8212; mules and horses &#8212; were given to each household.  <br /><br />In 1989, Conyers introduced a bill which would establish a federal commission to study reparations.  It was named HR 40, in honor of the now-famous phrase "40 acres and a mule."  But Congress has still not passed HR 40.<br /><br />Conyers noted that on February 13, 2006, the American Bar Association adopted a resolution urging the US Congress to 1) create and appropriate funds for a commission to study and make findings relating to the present day social, political and economic consequences of both slavery and the denial thereafter of equal justice under law for persons of African descent living in the United States; and 2) authorize the commission to propose public policies or governmental actions, if any, that may be appropriate to address such consequences.<br /><br />In adopting this resolution, the ABA cited Congress's establishment in 1980 of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians.  Congress directed the commission to review the facts and circumstances surrounding the impact of the internment during World War II on American citizens and permanent resident aliens.<br /><br />Margaret Chon, a professor at Seattle University School of Law, told the audience that "the Japanese American reparations experience teaches us about the capacity as well as the limits of law to address injustice, not only for this particular group, but also for all groups that have and continue to be harmed by group discrimination."  She said, "If the primary purpose of reparations is to repair past harm, then reparations should include mechanisms to correct past harm that has 'hardened' into present everyday practices.  That is, reparations requests should anticipate ways to effect long-term structural change."<br /><br />Chon cited the 2000 Civil Liberties Public Education Act.  Its purpose is to provide competitive grants for public educational activities and the development of educational materials to ensure that the events surrounding the exclusion, forced removal and incarceration of civilians and permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry will be remembered and so that causes and circumstances of this and similar events may be illuminated and understood.<br /><br />Rebecca Tsosie, a professor at Arizona State University College of Law, spoke about reparations for Native Americans.  "There is no 'uniform' theory of reparations that fits all cultures, all nations, all people.  Part of the process is telling the truth," she said.  "That's why apology is so important."  Tsosie maintained that "'reconciliation' constitutes a process of 'healing' between groups who have experienced bitter and painful relations."<br /><br />Professor KJ Greene, from Thomas Jefferson, cited the mass appropriation of Black cultural production as unjust enrichment.  He advocated atonement as reparations, not only for the victims, but also for the perpetrators of cultural theft and distortion.<br /><br />Linda Keller, another Thomas Jefferson professor, discussed reparations for victims of massive human rights violations, with particular emphasis on the compensation system in the new International Criminal Court.  "It has the potential to be a comprehensive reparations regime with truly global reach, covering victims of the international crimes of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity," she said.<br /><br />In the United States, "reparations advocacy has recently shifted from legislative efforts to the courtroom," Theodore Kornweibel, a professor at San Diego State University, explained.  He detailed the way in which the railroads "employed" over 10,000 slaves yearly, making them the largest example of industrial slavery.  Kornweibel said that corporate defendants in recent suits seeking reparations include banks, insurance companies and railroads. <br /><br />The week before the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States delegation walked out of the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durbin, South Africa.  Although framed as opposition to resolutions condemning Israel for its treatment of the Palestinians, the Bush administration opposed the demand that the US pay reparations to African-Americans for the damage they suffered from slavery.  Conyers reported at the time that other delegates from the Congressional Black Caucus alleged the US was using the Middle East issue as a smoke screen to avoid discussion of reparations.<br /><br />But this unique conference at Thomas Jefferson took the issue of reparations head-on.  The thread that wove the broad range of scholarly views together was the notion that one size doesn't fit all when it comes to reparations.  "Different types of injury proclaim different relationships with disparate national, local, and private entities," St. Louis University School of Law professor Eric Miller told the gathering.  "Each requires a different form of reparations and permits a different critique of structural and individual discrimination.  Some forms of reparations are appropriate as between nations; others as between discrete groups within a particular society.  Some are directed towards government entities, some towards private actors.  Some require monetary damages and some require other forms of remediation."<br /><br />Whether apology, atonement, education, or 40 acres and a mule, the solution must fit the problem.  And the problem is racism, which, unfort
unately, is still very much with us today.<br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, president-elect of the National Lawyers Guild, and the US representative to the executive committee of the American Association of Jurists.</em><br />

		<title>What the Detainee Treatment Act Really Means for Guantanamo Detainees</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Jonathan Hafetz, a lawyer with the <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a> at New York University School of Law and the author of an amicus brief on Guantanamo detainee appeals recently filed on behalf of legal scholars in the US DC Circuit, says that interpreting the Detainee Treatment Act to eliminate habeas corpus jurisdiction over detentions at Guantanamo would undermine the most critical substantive right against unlawful executive detention in the American legal system...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/jonathanhafetz.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>ith courts poised to decide whether the <a href="/gazette/2005/12/detainee-treatment-act-of-2005-white.php">Detainee Treatment Act of 2005</a> (DTA) strips them of habeas corpus jurisdiction over detentions at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, it&#39;s worth considering what the writ's elimination could really mean for the 500 people imprisoned there without charge.  Quick to minimize the act's significance because statutes that affect substantive rights are presumed not to apply retroactively, the US government says the DTA simply replaces habeas review in the district court with "exclusive review" in the court of appeals.  But closer inspection shows why that argument is false and how the government would use the DTA to cut off meaningful access to the courts.<br /><br />While the US Supreme Court is reviewing the statute's application to the handful of detainees charged with crimes in military commissions, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is considering the DTA's application to pending Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainee cases.  At last month's oral argument, the circuit panel pressed the government about the scope of judicial review under the new act.  The government responded that the DTA prevents Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees from presenting evidence of their innocence in court, a right they clearly have on habeas corpus.<br /><br />Eliminating any judicial inquiry into the facts would be particularly troubling because the detainees were never given a fair hearing in the first place.  Instead, they were subjected to the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf">Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a> (CSRT), an <em>ad hoc</em> proceeding that denies fundamental safeguards, including a neutral decisionmaker, assistance of counsel, and the right to see and confront the government's evidence.  The CSRT, moreover, allows for the use of evidence secured by torture if it deems that evidence "reliable."  If, as the government argues, the DTA is applied to pending habeas corpus cases, it will allow for indefinite executive detention without any meaningful opportunity to rebut the government's allegations, eviscerating a core guarantee of the Great Writ since common law.<br /><br /> The DTA also jeopardizes detainees' access to counsel, another critical safeguard of habeas corpus which the government has tried to undermine since the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/28june20041215/www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/03pdf/03-334.pdf">Rasul v. Bush</a> that the writ extends to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.  Federal magistrate judge <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/federal-judge-orders-us-to-give.php">Alan Kay</a> recently rebuked the government for its latest roadblock, a requirement that attorneys obtain proof of their authority to represent a Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainee before they are even permitted to meet their client.  Judge Kay held that requirement violated the protective order governing counsel access at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo and imposed an unacceptable Catch-22 on detainees whose only meaningful way to communicate with the outside world is through another prisoner who already has an attorney with access to the base.  The government has sought reconsideration of Judge Kay's decision, arguing that the DTA deprives the court of jurisdiction to enforce the protective order.  While this motion targets attorneys who have yet to meet their clients, future ploys to curtail counsel access for other detainees are but a short step away.<br /><br />Why does the government want to cut off attorney visits?  For one thing, lawyers help detainees put the government to its proof by contesting the basis for their detention.  Lawyers also prevent the government from operating Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo as a secret prison in which details of prisoner abuse remain hidden from the public.  Indeed, counsel access is a principal reason we know about the continued detention of innocent men, prolonged hunger strikes and abusive force-feedings, and attempted prisoner suicides.  In short, take away counsel access to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, and you take away a critical means of discovering the truth about the detentions there.<br /><br />There is another reason why the government will use the DTA to limit counsel access.  Attorneys constitute the embodiment of precisely what the government still refuses to accept at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo: the rule of law.  Both a concept and a culture, the rule of law subsumes within it notions of independent judicial review, established rules, and principled limits on executive power.  More concretely, access to counsel means that the government's allegations will be subjected to the crucible of the legal process, where they will be rigorously tested and assessed.  Under the DTA, that process, and the critical role lawyers play in it, would be undermined.  All that would remain is narrow appellate review of a one-sided CSRT determination (in which no attorney participated), a veritable rubber-stamp for unlawful executive detention.<br /><br />Just as startling is the government's assertion that the DTA prevents a federal judge from ordering the release of innocent individuals.  To be more precise, the government says that review under the DTA is limited to detainees who challenge a CSRT determination finding them "enemy combatants."  Individuals who the government concedes are not enemy combatants, but who nonetheless remain imprisoned at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo because they cannot safely be returned to their home countries, are therefore out of luck.  No court, the government says, has the power to order these men's release under the DTA, even if they do not present a danger to anyone.  At least nine individuals are already in this permanent state of legal limbo, with more surely to follow. The legality of their detention is pending before another panel of the D.C. Circuit. <br /><br />Denying a judicial remedy to these "non-enemy combatants" turns habeas corpus on its head.  The writ has always provided two core guarantees: searching review into the legality of a prisoner's confinement; and release when there is no lawful basis for the detention.  The DTA fails on both accounts.<br /><br />For the DTA to pass muster under the Constitution's Suspension Clause, it must provide an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus.  But the act does not even come close &#8212; it cuts off meaningful judicial review, jeopardizes counsel access, and denies a remedy to the innocent.  If the DTA is interpreted to eliminate habeas corpus jurisdiction over detentions at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, it will undermine the most critical substantive right against unlawful executive detention in the American legal system.  And, it will give the government the green light to push Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo backwards towards its pre-<em>Rasul</em> state of secrecy and lawlessness.<br /><br /><br /><em>Jonathan Hafetz is Associate Counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law and author of an amicus brief on behalf of British and American Habeas Corpus Scholars in the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainee appeal.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=35">Nancy Rapoport</a>, dean of the University of Houston Law Center, says that although the convictions of Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling in the Enron corporate fraud trial offer several important lessons, it&#39;s not clear that all of them - or any, for that matter - will actually be learned....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/nancyrapoport.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>B</strong></font>y any measure, Enron cost us plenty.  After billions fleeced from shareholders, millions spent by electronic and print media covering the various trials, and thousands of hours selflessly given by jurors and alternates, we can be forgiven if we deign to look for potential returns on our collective "investment" in Enron.  Perhaps the final accounting of our investment will take shape, Raptor-like, in items not found on any balance sheet:  in lessons that might stand the test of time and extend beyond the sentences that Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay will receive on 9/11.  Here are some top contenders for consideration:<br /><br /><em>Potential Lesson #1</em>:  Corporate America has seen the light, and it won't cheat any more.  When Richard Scrushy won acquittal with his "duh" defense, ne'er-do-well CEOs across the land probably smirked and breathed a sigh of relief.  The convictions of Skilling and Lay changed those sighs into sharp intakes of breath [<a href="#1">1</a>],  and therefore, corporate America will be kinder and gentler (and more honest) in the future. <br /><br /><em>Likelihood of learning Lesson #1</em>:  Zero.  Do I believe that corporate America is going to give up outright cheating and shading the truth?  No, because there will always be people who thrive on skirting the edge of ethical behavior.  (My husband calls it "casting your shadow across the ethical line.")   <br /><br />Let's face it:  Honest people who would never broach the line between truth and lies aren't going to spend much time thinking about the Enron verdicts, because their world and Enron's world of lies and excesses are galaxies apart.  And extremely intelligent cheaters won't spend too much time thinking about the verdicts, either; they'll assume that their brains will still easily distinguish them as the smartest guys in the room.  (If you don't understand something, how you can possibly hope to prosecute it?)  <br /><br />If anything changes in corporate America, it will be the tools employed by corporate miscreants.  Instead of flawed mark-to-market accounting and fake special purpose entities, up-and-coming cheaters will backdate stock options (the current scandal <em>du jour</em>) or create other ways of siphoning wealth from the corporate fountain of plenty.  Only the "mostly honest" [<a href="#2">2</a>] business person is going to weigh temptation against the Enron verdicts, and my guess is that even that person will forget all about the verdicts in record time.<br /><br />Enron happened in part because a lot of people broke a lot of rules.  Take a look at Ken Lay's testimony during the criminal trial:  "Rules are important, but they should not ... you should not be a slave to the rules, either." [<a href="#3">3</a>]  I can't possibly be the only person who read about Lay's testimony and immediately thought of three quotes:  first, Leona Helmsley's famous explanation:  "We don't pay taxes.  Only the little people pay taxes." [<a href="#4">4</a>]  Second, for those with a love for Shakespeare, the last act in <em>Henry V</em>:<blockquote>O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings.  Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country&#39;s fashion.  We are the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find-faults. [<a href="#5">5</a>]</blockquote>And third belongs to Rousseau's recollection of the thoughtless saying of a great princess, 'who, on being informed that the country people had no bread, replied, 'Let them eat cake.'" [<a href="#6">6</a>]   <br /><br />Not only did Ken Lay not follow the rules when the rules didn't suit him, <em>he didn't even follow the rules of the courtroom just before the verdict was announced</em>, choosing to sit with his wife instead of with his attorneys when the verdict was read aloud.  Lay also broke the rule of logical defendant behavior by talking in public and on the web about his case.  In his own blog &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; updated after the verdict &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; he expressed shock at the jury's determination of guilt [<a href="#7">7</a>].   Perhaps, if he'd paid more attention to the accounting and corporate governance rules, and to the rule of common sense that suggests that a criminal defendant let the defense lawyer (and not the defendant) do the heavy lifting, Lay wouldn't have had to experience this particular form of shock.  <br />  <br /><em>Potential Lesson #2</em>:  Just because "everyone does it" doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.<br /><br /><em>Likelihood of learning Lesson #2</em>:  30%.  Put another way, "If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also, look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb?" [<a href="#8">8</a>]  Sure, traders in several energy companies were round-tripping electricity in and out of California and reaping obscene returns for re-importing the power; in fact, the California regulatory climate virtually served as a co-conspirator that enabled that type of behavior.  But the gloating exhibited by some Enron traders ("Burn, baby, burn!") went beyond the pale, and anyone either contemplating or engaging in line-blurring behavior may now be motivated to adopt a more civil tone&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;especially when communiqu&Atilde;&copy;s such as telephone-call recordings and emails can return to haunt you.  Where is Rose Mary Woods when you need her?     <br /><br />If you're a corporate executive, which of these lessons will you draw from the Enron verdicts:  that you must use your own common sense rather than simply relying on the advice or good will of others (good); or that no matter how much you try to double- and triple-check your actions, you'll be second-guessed when things go south (bad)?  <br /><br /><em>Potential Lesson #3</em>:  Enron wasn't anything special, in terms of greed overcoming common sense.<br /><br /><em>Likelihood of learning Lesson #3</em>:  This lesson might actually "take," because Enron really wasn't all that special.  WorldCom's fraud was just as bad, and Tyco's had much better sound bites, video clips, and interior d&Atilde;&copy;cor (recall the $6,000 shower curtain and the $15,000 umbrella stand, both of which would have been readily welcomed in the second-hand store opened by Linda Lay when the family fortunes started down the slippery slope.)  We're in "[r]ose is a rose is a rose is a rose" [<a href="#9">9</a>] territory here.  <br /><br />Really, Robert Fulghum was right when he wrote <u>All I Really Need to Know I learned in Kindergarten</u> [<a href="#10">10</a>].     Perhaps Skilling, Lay, and others will spend time relearning some basic rules of business:<ol><li>Don't assume that everything is what it seems.<br /><li>Don't bet twice with the same money.<br /><li>If it looks too good to be true, it usually is.<br /><li>Character counts.  Talking about character doesn't.  Character is about actions, not words, and it's built over a lifetime of making the right choices, even in the midst of temptation.</ol>The popular credit-card advertisements might sum up Enron's lessons this way:<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPASSING=0 Border=1><tr><td valign=top><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 10pt'><strong>Kenneth Lay</strong></font></td><td valign=top><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 10pt'>Guilty on 10 counts (including making false statements to banks regarding his own loans)</font></td></tr><tr>

		<title>What the Moussaoui Verdict Teaches Us</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Jonathan Hafetz, a lawyer with the <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a> at New York University School of Law, says that the Zacarias Moussaoui verdict demonstrates that the best way to promote national security and democracy in the world is by reaffirming America's commitment to a fair legal system, not by casting it aside...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/jonathanhafetz.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>welve jurors voted unanimously this week to spare the life of admitted terrorist Zacharias Moussaoui.  The jurors had previously determined Moussaoui bore responsibility for the worst attack on American soil in the nation's history.  Yet, when faced with the separate question whether the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors in Moussaoui's case, the jury recommended a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death.<br /> <br />It is too early to assess the full impact of Moussaoui's case, the only federal trial to date in connection with the September 11 attacks.  Those allegedly involved directly in the attacks are still at large or are in U.S. custody in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/01/AR2005110101644.html">secret detention centers</a>, and it is unclear how, if at all, Moussaoui's case will affect them or the nearly five hundred people held indefinitely without charge at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.  Yet, the verdict contains important lessons about the continuing importance of the centuries-old American criminal justice system and, in turn, the failures of the Bush administration's post-September 11 detention policy.<br /><br />The jurors in Moussaoui did not explain their reasoning, but the 42-question <a href="http://notablecases.vaed.uscourts.gov/1:01-cr-00455/docs/72434/0.pdf">special verdict form</a> offers insight into their determination.  Most jurors found it proper to weigh Moussaoui's unstable early childhood and dysfunctional and abusive family life, though none was persuaded by the defense's contention that Moussaoui had schizophrenia or that a death sentence would make Moussaoui a martyr.  Importantly, three jurors found Moussaoui played a minor role in the September 11 attacks and three separately found he had limited knowledge of the real plotters' nefarious designs.<br /><br />Perhaps the most significant lesson of the Moussaoui verdict is that the system still works, imperfectly and slowly, but works nonetheless.  The district judge grappled with a range of thorny issues throughout the proceedings, from Moussaoui's competency to stand trial to his Sixth Amendment right to compel the production of witness held in secret detention overseas, an issue which generated several interlocutory appeals to the Fourth Circuit and whose resolution still raises significant questions about the fairness of the proceeding.  The system was further strained by Moussaoui's venomous, disruptive outbursts and wildly unpredictable behavior, which eventually pitted him against his own lawyers who battled in the highest tradition of the defense bar to save their client's life.  Yet, in the end, it was the jury system &#8212; the crown jewel of the American legal system &#8212; that triumphed, as jurors resisted the temptation to be swayed by emotion over the horrific event and imposed punishment based upon a careful consideration of the evidence presented by both sides.<br /><br />Yet, if Moussaoui shows the criminal justice system worked, it also throws into stark relief how the system has been eroded by the President's continuing efforts to detain individuals indefinitely without trial.  It was not lost on the jury that those who most deserved to be tried for the September 11 attacks, such as alleged al Qaeda mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, are still detained without charge.  Instead, the jury heard the "<a href="http://www.rcfp.org/moussaoui/">substituted testimony</a>" of several of those individuals &#8212; culled from information provided to interrogators over the past several years &#8212; which helped portray Moussaoui as a marginal figure in al Qaeda.<br /><br />The Moussaoui verdict also demonstrates the important fact-finding role of criminal trials, which force the government to bear its burden of demonstrating a defendant's culpability and expose the government's own conduct to public scrutiny.  Here, prosecutors had to sustain their contention that Moussaoui was responsible for the September 11 attacks, the focus of the first stage of the penalty phase.  The defense showed, for example, how the government had failed to act on an FBI's agent's repeated warnings which could have led them to the September 11 plotters.  Moussaoui sought to help the government by claiming that he and convicted "shoe-bomber" Richard Reid were planning to hijack a fifth plane and fly it into the White House on September 11 (a far-fetched claim the government itself was forced to disavow).  The unmistakable impression was that the government had overstated Moussaoui's significance in order to shift attention away from its own mistakes and to demonstrate its toughness in fighting terrorism.   None of this exonerates Moussaoui, a despicable human being who gloated over killing of nearly 3,000 innocent people.  But it does show how criminal trials provide accountability by putting the government to its proof.<br /><br /> The jury's verdict also demonstrates something else America has lost by holding suspected terrorists in legal limbo as "enemy combatants" instead of trying them for their alleged misdeeds.  Criminal trials are about more than protecting the accused against abuses of power by the state.  They are also society's way of collectively assessing culpability and imposing punishment on those who violate its laws.  This process has a cathartic effect on the public and provides a critical opportunity to reaffirm shared moral values.  Moussaoui's case still served that important function, even if the sanction ultimately was life imprisonment rather than death.<br /><br /> Finally, the jury's verdict affirms an American value recently in short supply: taking the moral high ground.  To be sure, Moussaoui made it difficult, taunting the jury with his diatribes against America and the innocent victims of September 11.  The victims' family members, meanwhile, testified poignantly about their profound grief and suffering.  Yet, the jury exercised laudable restraint, recognizing that truth is not always black and white, and affirming the rule of law by concluding that Moussaoui was insufficiently culpable and sufficiently troubled to merit a death sentence.  The Bush administration, by contrast, has shown no such restraint or considered judgment, indiscriminately maintaining that alleged terrorists do not deserve any legal protections, whether those of the American legal system or international law.<br />    <br />The Moussaoui verdict shows why our criminal justice system has endured for so long.   It also shows that, in the long run, the best way to promote national security and democracy in the world is by reaffirming America's commitment to a fair legal system, not by casting it aside.<br /><br /><br /><em>Jonathan Hafetz is Associate Counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.</em><br />

Foley</a> of Florida Coastal School of Law says that critical decisions about going to war should be constrained by national and international process that obliges empowering authorities to ask serious questions and requires leaders to demonstrate the necessity of using force...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/brianfoleyleft.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>hought exercise: You're "The Decider."  Someone asks you whether the U.S. should attack Iran, to prevent that country from building an atomic bomb.  How would you decide?<br /><br />You'd probably ask some questions: war is serious business.  You might make proponents of war meet a substantial burden of proof that Iran has a weapons program; that the program is headed toward a bomb; and that Iran would actually use the bomb &#8212; that, in short, Iran poses a serious threat.  You might demand estimates of the likely costs and how to keep them as low as possible, and weigh these costs against other uses for the money, lives, materiel and energy needed for war.  <br /><br />If you asked these questions, you'd be far ahead of the real "Deciders," the U.N. Security Council and the U.S. Congress.  Although both bodies are charged under international and U.S. law respectively with deciding whether war is an appropriate way to address Iran's alleged efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, neither body is required to ask these sorts of questions. Both failed to ask them before the 2003 invasion of Iraq (which the U.N. did not authorize, but has not condemned), and the result was a war that most of the world now regards as unnecessary, a war based on misinformation that could have been revealed as such before the bombs were ever dropped.  Indeed, two years ago, two major newspapers, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/international/middleeast/26FTE_NOTE.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5070&en=278d045f384b459b&ex=1148702400">New York Times</a>  and the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A58127-2004Aug11?language=printer">Washington Post</a> issued mea culpas for failing to ask hardnosed questions.  But Congress has not issued any apologies for failing to deliberate, for surrendering its constitutional power to decide whether to go to war to the president several months before this wasteful, counterproductive war was launched.   <br /><br />Congress appears equally unlikely to ask tough-minded questions this time, despite the fact that the President has essentially <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/04/20060418-1.html">threatened a first-strike with nuclear weapons against Iran</a>. Nor does the U.N. Security Council appear ready to probe the Administration's case with any rigor.  <br /><br />It's a pity.  War should no longer be treated as a sport of kings, an ad hoc decision more about whether countries will join coalitions than about evidence and a serious search for intelligent alternatives. War is too deadly, too costly; the risk of escalation, the spread of conflict, refugee crises, environmental harm, economic damage, and terrorist blowback against the public is too high.  Although the existing "law of war" (that is, the law that purportedly takes effect once war starts) might seek to protect against many such harms, those laws are too little, too late: many damages are foreordained once war begins.  It's time for Congress and the U.N. to create processes to ensure that the searching questions are asked <u>before</u> any bombs are dropped.<br /><br />This lack of process is rarely discussed by politicians or jurists.  It was, however, raised recently, albeit obliquely, by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his proposals for UN reform. In his 2005 report, <em>In Larger Freedom: Towards Development, Security and Human Rights for All</em>, the Secretary-General urged the Security Council to adopt a resolution where the Council could "come to a common view on how to weigh the seriousness of the threat; the proper purpose of the proposed military action; whether means short of the use of force might plausibly succeed in stopping the threat; whether the military option is proportional to the threat at hand; and whether there is a reasonable chance of success." (<em>In Larger Freedom</em>, <a href="http://www.un.org/largerfreedom/chap3.htm ">Chapter 3</a>, "Freedom From Fear," para. 126) So far, however, no such resolution has been adopted. <br /><br />In addition to the points the Secretary-General raised, decisionmakers should be required to identify specifically the harms that would likely result from military action, and seek ways to limit them.  For example, decisionmakers should be required to investigate the likely military and civilian casualties; refugee crises; the danger that the targeted country (or forces allied with it) might retaliate; the possibility that the conflict might spill over the target nation's borders; likely environmental harm and likely economic impacts, especially on energy markets.  <br /><br />Congress, too, should step up.  The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, and the power of the purse. With the Bush policy of preemptive war &#8212; a war we initiate when we're not directly under attack &#8212; Congress has the duty to ensure that any use of military force is undertaken with seriousness and responsibility.  The White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/nss.html">announced this policy almost four years ago</a> and recently <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/nss/2006/nss2006.pdf">reaffirmed it</a>; the time is ripe for Congress to reassert itself by creating a process to test the need for such wars.  <br /><br />Preventing unnecessary wars is an important goal of the U.N. Charter and the U.S. Constitution.  Recent history has shown that it's hard to achieve this goal, however, when the White House is bent on war.  The crisis regarding Iran presents the U.N. and Congress with the opportunity to create a process to guide the decision of whether to go to war, a process that helps ensure that any resort to force is truly the last resort, truly necessary, and that the attendant destruction and disorder are as limited as possible.  Failure to create such a process is a mistake we cannot afford to repeat.<br /><br /><br /><hr size=1><em>Brian J. Foley is an assistant professor at Florida Coastal School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Glenn Sulmasy, a professor of law at the US Coast Guard Academy, says it&#39;s time for US military commissions to evolve and morph into a national security court appropriate to handle the international jihadist threat...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/glennsulmasy.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Global War on Terror has created ambiguities in both the laws of armed conflict and how best to fight the new war of the 21st century.  The asymmetric threat of terrorism itself, no defined nation state to fight against, the relative problems with the Military Commissions in Guantanamo Bay (GITMO), allegations of torture and the recent constitutional issues surrounding wiretap efforts of the National Security Agency all highlight the lack of appropriate laws to govern this new conflict.  Nowhere is this ambiguity more evident than in the United States' handling of detainees.  <br /><br />The "enemies" in the Global War on Terror (GWOT) are men and women who fight not for nation but for ideology, do not wear standard uniforms and, as doctrine, flout the laws of war.  These new "warriors" have created extreme difficulties since they are not, <em>de jure belli</em>, prisoners of war and thus the Geneva Conventions simply do not apply to them.  Adjudicating their status and crimes has become increasingly chaotic.  It initially appeared, relying in large part on <em>Ex Parte Quirin</em> [<a href="#1">1</a>],  that the military tribunals (currently referred to as military commissions by the Bush Administration) would provide the appropriate venue for handling the prosecution of the detainees.  I would concur this was appropriate assertion &#8212; particularly when viewed through a post 9/11 lens.  But now, over four years later, there has not been a completed prosecution.  Over 500 detainees remain in Guantanamo Bay and allegedly another 450 are reportedly are being held in Afghanistan.  National consensus and international support of the Commissions has eroded significantly &#8212; most notably over the past two years.<br /><br />As this problem escalates, a new approach must be entertained.  This is a new war, one that mixes law enforcement and warfare, and does not fit neatly in either regime.  The Bush administration and Congress have adapted U.S. resources strategically, tactically and militarily to meet the new threat.  They enacted the USA PATRIOT ACT, conducted the largest reorganization of government since 1948 by creating the Department of Homeland Security (merging 177,000 employees and over 22 agencies), and created a flexible new foreign policy embodied by the National Security Strategy of the United States in 2002 (recently re-released and reaffirmed in 2006).  They were, and remain, conscious that this is a new type of war requiring new policies.  Ironically, there have been no changes in how we handle the new enemy "warriors" of the GWOT once captured.  It is now time for the military commissions to evolve and morph into a court appropriate to handle the international jihadist threat.  The formation of national security courts seems a logical solution to the ongoing threat posed by international terror.<br /><br />In cooperation and concert with an updated Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), a national security court apparatus needs to be statutorily created.  The detainee issue will not be resolved soon, nor will the Global War on Terror end in the foreseeable future.  Policy makers must achieve both the reality <u>and appearance</u> of justice for the short and long term.  Clearly, many issues need to be hammered out in regards to court composition.  The current thrust should simply be to inject new ideas into the national debate over the proper handling of detainees.  In that vein, I humbly offer fundamental guidelines for a National Security Court:<ol><li><u>Article I judges with law of armed conflict expertise.</u>  The courts would be led by judges, appointed by the President, who are experts in the law of armed conflict and have some background in national security law.  These Article I judges should possess the educational background necessary to determine the lawfulness of intelligence gathering, terrorist surveillance, etc.  Several scholars, advocating against judicial intervention in the war, correctly note that those who are making such decisions now are not necessarily versed in this unique area of the law [<a href="#2">2</a>].   Whether you agree or disagree, the nature of this war seems to necessitate judicial intervention more than has been customary, in previous U. S. military operations and wartime.  As it stands now, the existing systems (the FISA court and Article III federal courts) permit judges who have no background in warfare or national security to intervene, conduct hearings and decide on cases and issue warrants.  Unfortunately, such actions are beyond the scope of their scholarship or expertise [<a href="#3">3</a>].  The complex threat we now face demands specialty courts staffed by appropriate personnel.<br /><br /><li><u>Prosecutors</u> &#8212; Five dedicated prosecutors, assigned by the Department of Justice (DoJ) would represent the government and exercise prosecutorial discretion on whether or not to proceed in cases.  Oversight would be conducted by the Chief, Criminal Division of DoJ [<a href="#4">4</a>].  The powers of these prosecutors, as currently exists in other democratic, E.U. nations, would be great.  However, these prosecutors would still operate under the ethical rules standard for all US government attorneys.<br /><br /><li><u>Specified and Qualified Defense Counsel(s)</u> &#8212; Judge advocates would serve as the government-provided defense counsel.  This group would be similar to what has been provided for the detainees in the military commissions.  The judge advocates would be assigned from the Department of Homeland Security [<a href="#5">5</a>] and the Department of Defense.  Initially, a pool of ten judge advocates would serve on the defense teams.  As an option, the jihadist could employ, at his own expense, civilian counsel so long as such counsel have requisite classified document clearance(s).<br /> <br /><li><u>Trials Proceedings would be closed</u> - As a result of the sensitive nature of intelligence gathering and specialized methods employed &#8212; as well as ensuring such hearings do not become propaganda tools for the enemy - the trials would be closed to the public.  One need look no further than the World Trade Center bombings in 1993 and the recent Moussaoui case [<a href="#6">6</a>] to see the heightened need for such hearings to be closed to the media and public audiences.  However, qualified representatives from designated NGO's and the United Nations would be permitted to attend as "observers" to ensure trial fairness and witness the procedural protections expected of a nation dedicated to upholding the rule of law.<br /><br /><li><u>Trials Held on Military Bases within the Continental U. S.</u> &#8212; This would keep the detainees held in a location that is secure, like Gitmo, but located within the United States on one of our military bases.  This would, in part, alleviate some of the international concerns about the detention centers located in Gitmo.  Since Eisentrager has been essentially overruled by recent cases [<a href="#7">7</a>], the extraterritoriality needs are no longer applicable and, in essence, are  moot [<a href="#8">8</a>].<br /> <br /><li><u>Convicted Defendants Imprisoned at Military Brigs</u> &#8212; If convicted and sentenced to jail time, military brigs are by far and away not only the best but also the right place to imprison those convicted by the National Security Courts.  This is the most secure place to imprison such illegal combatants and affords the same protection against abuse given to those U. S. service members who are trie
d, convicted and sentenced under the UCMJ by courts-martial.<br />  <br /><li><u>Appropriate Appellate Rights</u> &#8212; Consistent with the theme of the National Security Courts being a military-civil hybrid, appeals would go through the Courts of Appeals of the Armed Forces (CAAF) [<a href="#9">9</a>].  This limited right of appeal would ensure these cases were heard by an outside panel of judges versed in military law and the laws of war, as well as have some background in the procedural nuances of national security law.  Appellate counsel would be provided by experienced Air Force, Coast Guard, Navy-Marine Corps, and Army appellate attorneys.<br /><br /><li><u>Death Penalty</u> - The death penalty would still be an authorized punishment as it currently still is under certain UCMJ offenses (and the commissions) a possibility for convicted military members.  This penalty would only be authorized in those cases deemed egrigous enough and ones that severely impact the homeland security of the United States.  Certain aggravating factors would have to be codified to distinguish between what offenses are appropriate for life sentence or those better suited to capital punishment.  Cognizant this would still cause concern among our European and certain other international colleagues, this proposal must undergo intense scrutiny prior to implementation.</ol>The Global War on Terror has introduced ambiguity in the choice of the appropriate legal regime best suited to comport with the law of armed conflict and satisfy customary international legal obligations.  Of the myriad new issues and legal problems confronting policy makers in the West, the most problematic has been the proper handling of jihadists once captured.  The Gitmo "distraction" is impacting our ability to effectively lead the world in other areas of national security.  International concern over Gitmo is detracting from our ability to provide guidance, counsel and policy in this and other arenas.   Regardless of blame or why this has occurred, the United States needs to take a fresh look at how best to deal with detainees, the proper adjudication of detainees in Guantanamo Bay now, and for those detainees yet to come, as they surely will.  A blue ribbon commission, created by the President, should immediately be employed to look at the possibilities of creating a national security court system which will address questions as to proper detention, adjudication, intelligence gathering, terrorist surveillance and other such legal issues associated with the threat of international terror.  The National Security Court, an evolution of the military commissions, affords an opportunity for U.S. policy makers to respond forcefully and effectively to calls, both domestically and internationally, for a way out of the Guantanamo issue.  The time is now for the United States to once again be viewed as the "shining city on the hill," a vision so eloquently defined by President Reagan.  It is time to regain the initiative, and reaffirm our leadership in the humane prosecution of those who would undermine the ideals of democracy.<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes<br /><br /><a name="1">1.</a>  <em>Ex Parte</em> Quirin, 317 U.S. 1, 28 (1942).<br /><br /><a name="2">2.</a>  See, John C.

The CAAF is currently employed as a civilian "check" over the military justice program and the level of review before access to the Supreme Court.  Many judges on the court have either experience in national security or the law of armed conflict.  This skill set seems most apropos for a judicial check on surveillance and other activities now necessary to effectively fight the jihadist threat of international terror.<br /><br /></font>   <br /><br /><em>Glenn Sulmasy is an associate professor of law at the U.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Shayana Kadidal, one of the lead attorneys on the <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>&#39; challenge to the NSA domestic surveillance program, says that the government&#39;s invocation of the state secrets privilege in a motion to dismiss the case filed late last week contradicts the core idea of judicial review and essentially allows the executive branch to dictate to the federal courts what cases they can and can't hear...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/shanekadidal.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font> few minutes before midnight last Friday, the government filed a motion to dismiss the Center for Constitutional Rights&#39; <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/govt_misconduct/govtArticle.asp?ObjID=RovrtPD8Bc&Content=694">lawsuit against the National Security Agency&#39;s warrantless wiretapping program</a> on the grounds that allowing the litigation to go forward would jeopardize "state secrets." (Their heavily redacted but still very long brief is available <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/govt_misconduct/docs/NSA_Statesecrets_BriefinSupportofGovernmentsMotiontoDismissunclassified.pdf">here</a>.) <br /><br />It its most basic terms, invocation of the state secrets privilege involves the government submitting an affidavit from a department head saying that any court proceedings would risk disclosure of secrets that would threaten grave damage to national security, and asking the court to dismiss the suit based solely on those grounds. Previous invocations of the privilege by the government have most commonly been at the discovery stage, asking the courts to deny private litigants access to documents or witnesses, but more recently the government has moved to dismiss a spate of cases &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; most notably torture-rendition cases on behalf of <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/september_11th/sept11Article.asp?ObjID=zPvu7s2XVJ&Content=377">Maher Arar</a> and Khaled El-Masri &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/govt_misconduct/docs/NSA_3906SummaryJudgmentbrief3906.pdf">at the pleading stage</a>. In these cases the government has argued that to even answer the complaint by confirming or denying its allegations would risk the disclosure of secrets that could cause "exceptionally grave damage to the national security." (This is a particularly perplexing assertion in our case, where administration officials went on an extensive public speaking campaign in defense of the legality of the NSA program; indeed, we filed a motion for summary judgment two months ago based on these public admissions.)<br /><br />Typically, when faced with sensitive evidence, a court might close the courtroom, place briefs under seal, and make the other side's attorneys promise not to divulge the information, or even make them seek security clearance in rare cases. In the government's view, the state secrets privilege says that isn't good enough for some secrets. For the most sensitive secrets, even the judge cannot be trusted to hear the secret matter. Whether the risk of disclosure is in fact real if litigation is allowed to continue, and whether grave damage to national security will result in the event of disclosure, are purely executive determinations which the court is compelled to accept uncritically. The judge may not call the executive official who executes the affidavit setting forth these determinations into court for further scrutiny of his claims, even in camera. And all this is the case "even where allegations of unlawful or unconstitutional [executive] actions are at issue." Or so the government's argument goes.<br /><br />If it seems to you that this view of the privilege contradicts the core idea of judicial review &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; independent judges making independent evaluations of the facts and how the law applies to them &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and essentially allows the executive branch to dictate to the federal courts what cases they can and can't hear, you are correct. From whence did such an absolutist doctrine enter American law? Conservatives &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; particularly those offended by the Supreme Court's invocation of international legal opinion in its recent <em>Atkins</em>, <em>Lawrence</em>, and <em>Roper</em> decisions &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; will be alarmed by the fact that it came from a foreign legal system with a decidedly different attitude towards separation of powers. <br /><br />In the Cold War-era case that established the state secrets privilege &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; <em>United States v. Reynolds</em>, 345 U.S. 1 (1953) &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the Supreme Court noted that cases discussing this sort of broad privilege "ha[d] been limited in this country" but that the "English experience has been more extensive." Essentially our Supreme Court imported the state secrets privilege from British law.<br /><br />The Court did so without giving thought to serious differences between our system of government and theirs. The British government is organized around the idea of Parliamentary supremacy. Although British judges review statutes for consistency with the (unwritten) constitution, all they can do is issue a "statement of incompatibility" &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; unlike our courts which routinely declare laws void as unconstitutional. If Parliament decides not to take a ruling from the highest courts seriously, it has the last word, not the courts. The Prime Minister is an agent of Parliament&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;unlike our President, he is not elected directly by the people, and he serves at the pleasure of Parliament. The highest court &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the Law Lords &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; is technically a committee of the upper house of Parliament (the House of Lords). The very idea of separation of powers is to this extent foreign to the English system, and so we shouldn't be surprised that they developed a "state secrets" privilege that lets the executive trump judicial review.<br /><br />So much for the claims of logic. What has experience taught us about the privilege in practice? Sadly, five decades of living with it has shown that the privilege is frequently invoked to cover up executive mistakes.<br /><br />In the <em>Reynolds</em> case itself, a B-29 bomber crammed with intelligence equipment crashed, killing several civilians on board. Their widows sued. The government withheld the official accident report from the widows, saying it "cannot be furnished without seriously hampering national security, flying safety and the development of highly technical and secret military equipment." In 2000, 52 years after the crash, the report was finally declassified.<br /><br />Did the withheld "state secret" documents show anything about a "secret mission," "newly developing electronic devices," or anything else the military should have kept secret? No, they did not. Instead, all they showed was that the crash and resulting deaths were caused by ordinary negligence. (The civilians didn't receive training in how to bail out in emergencies, and the plane itself was a chronic maintenance problem, "not ... safe for flight" (read about it yourself at pp.20 and 22-24 of <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/reynoldspetapp.pdf">this pdf</a>)).<br /><br />Similar cover-ups have been at work in several recent cases where the government has managed to successfully assert the state secrets privilege. One of them involved Sibel Edmonds, a Turkish translator hired by the FBI who was appalled at what she saw inside the agency's translation section and complained to her superiors. Like many whistleblowers before her, she was fired. She brought suit, and the government successfully argued that the state secrets privilege was an absolute bar to her suit going forward. (Adding insult to injury, she was barred from the courtroom during the argument of her appeal.)
 The Supreme Court declined to review the case.<br /><br />What was it she was trying to tell her supervisors that got her fired? Among other things: that a translator sent to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo to translate Farsi detainee interviews didn't speak that language, and that foreign diplomats suspected of spying in the U.S. were having their wiretaps translated <em>by their own relatives</em> who worked for the FBI. Rather than let those serious national security breaches see the light of day (and perhaps become subjects of an embarrassing outside investigation), the FBI fired her, and then successfully managed to deprive her of her vindication in court, courtesy of the state secrets privilege.<br /><br />The Edmonds case reveals the rot at the heart of the government's "war on terror" &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; that the legal shortcuts the administration has used, by removing oversight, ended up weakening law enforcement's efforts against terrorism by diminishing accountability. The same applies to the massive detention sweeps that have alienated immigrant communities &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; law enforcement's most valuable ally, its eyes and ears on the street&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;from the federal authorities, and to the warrantless and most likely suspicionless surveillance carried out by the NSA &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; which the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Washington Post</em> exposed as being vast sinkholes of effort for the agents forced to follow the NSA's dead leads.<br /><br />Defenders of the State Secrets privilege justify it with a "greater good" argument: A trivial case &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; say, a slip-and-fall accident at Los Alamos &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; should not be allowed to risk disclosure of the entire Manhattan project, even where that risk is small (for example, the risk of an accidental disclosure from a good-faith failure to obey a court's protective orders). The injustice in the individual case is outweighed by the greater good (and only the executive has the expertise to balance the injustice against the risk).<br /><br />Even the superficial appeal of this argument is tempered by the notion that judges cannot be trusted to strike the balance of interests&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;as they do in so many other contexts. But the apologia ignores another "greater good" argument: that the (still-)greater good is served by maintaining the separation of powers by denying the executive a trump card that would allow it to cover up its abuses, its incompetence, and its willful disregard for the will of Congress &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; as in <em>Reynolds</em>, <em>Edmonds</em>, and now our case, where the government states in its motion to dismiss:<blockquote>[To argue that plaintiffs'] "private interests must give way to the national interest in state secrets"... is not to say that there is no forum to weigh the weighty matters at issue, which remain[] a matter of considerable public interest and debate, but that the resolution of these issues must be left to the political branches of government.</blockquote>Yet, short of impeachment, it is impossible to envision what a Congressional check would look like in the absence of judicial enforcement. By allowing the President to smother judicial review in the crib, the ultimate power of the Constitution (through the voice of judges) and the Congress to tell the executive "no" is lost.<br /><br />The Nazi political theorist Carl Schmitt declared that true sovereignty resided with whoever could decide when the state of exception to ordinary political life existed. Other constitutional systems (often, ironically, those formed in the shadow of totalitarianism) have chosen to place this power to declare emergencies and trump the ordinary rule of law in one branch of government or even one official. Our system stands in stark contrast. Here, judges have always been the ultimate deciders (perhaps "referees" captures their more restrained role more accurately) in the delicate three-way balance of powers between branches. Appropriately, they will have the final word on whether the state secrets privilege excuses what we assert is a vast array of unlawful behavior orchestrated by the President of the United States.<br /><br /><br /><em>Shayana Kadidal is a staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights and one of the lead attorneys on the Center's challenge to the NSA Surveillance Program, </em>Center for Constitutional Rights v.

		<title>Going Native at Guantanamo: When Government Lawyers Lose Their Way</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a> of New England School of Law says that the development of US detainee policy at Guantanamo demonstrates what can happen when government lawyers forget that their duty is not to a governmental official or a political party, but rather to their departments and the Constitution and people of the United States...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/victorhansen.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>E</strong></font>arlier this year information from former US Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora revealed to the general public for the first time the degree of concern and disagreement that some lawyers within the US Department of Defense have had with the Administration's policy on the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo.  In an internal memo released in February, Mora detailed his concerns about many of the interrogation techniques the Department had approved.  The memo also set out Mora's efforts to reverse what he viewed as a seriously flawed legal analysis of an extremely important and sensitive issue.  <br /><br />Mora's efforts to get the Secretary of Defense to reconsider his position on the proper treatment of the Guantanamo detainees highlight one of the most basic and difficult challenges of any organizational lawyer, loyalty to the organization as the client versus loyalty to the organization's head.  Mora's memo also reveals the harm that often results when organization lawyers loose sight of who their client is.   <br /><br />Every service member and most elected and appointed public officials take an oath of office when they begin their service.  The oath of office includes a pledge to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.  It is significant and not by accident that the oath is to the Constitution, not to a specific person or political party.  There is a long tradition in military and public service to support the rule of law and to place one's duty to the rule of law above loyalty or allegiance to a specific person or political view.  The obligation that a government lawyer has to the organization is no different.  Lawyers within the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice do not represent the department head or the President.  They represent the organization and the larger public interests.  This ethical obligation is clearly set out in the ABA Model Rules of Professional Responsibility under rule 1.13.  <br /><br />When the lawyer's focus is more on advocating and enabling the department head's views than what is in the best interests of the organization the consequences can be disastrous.  The Mora memo and other recently released documents show that at the most critical junctures in the development of US Guantanamo policy, key US government lawyers lost their objectivity and as a result, provided flawed and inaccurate legal analysis that has resulted in tragic consequences to the Army and the Department of Defense. More importantly, the analysis has put individual soldiers at risk and has undermined our moral authority to effectively wage the war on terror.  <br /><br />Legal opinions both within the Department of Defense and the US Department of Justice concluded that using stress positions for several hours, removing a detainee's clothing, using detainees phobias such as the fear of dogs to induce stress, the use of scenarios designed to convince the detainee that death is imminent to him or his family, exposure to cold water, and inducing the misperception of suffocation, and other aggressive interrogation techniques do not raise to the level of torture.  These opinions were given in spite of the fact that 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 2340A(2)(C)&amp;(D) defines torture to include severe mental pain or suffering such as "the threat of imminent death; or the threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death."  Common Article 3 of the four Geneva Conventions and other customary international laws also prohibit torture.  <br /><br />As Mora's memo shows, the legal opinions - particularly those authored by the Office of Legal Counsel within the Department of Justice - justified the departure from established laws preventing torture by adopting erroneous legal analysis.  The justifications for the use of harsh interrogation techniques were compelling government interests, that the President's authority in time of war is virtually limitless, that the detainees at Guantanamo have no recognized legal status, and that as long as there is no specific intent to cause prolonged harm, the techniques are legal.  <br /><br />The most troubling revelation, however, is that lawyers within the Department of Defense and the Office of Legal Counsel were not only aware that key decision makers were pushing for illegal interrogation techniques, but through their legal opinions and bureaucratic maneuvering these lawyers assisted and enabled the decision makers to authorize torture.  Sadly those lawyers with the greatest knowledge and expertise on issues relating to the law of war were purposely sidelined.  In their stead, lawyers who were willing to tell the Administration what they wanted to hear were given the task of writing the legal opinions that the White House and the Department of Defense used to justify their treatment of the detainees at Guantanamo.  These memos were of course later withdrawn after detainee abuses throughout the Department of Defense came to light.   <br /><br />Absent from any of these erroneous legal opinions is any serious analysis as to the impact that the use of these aggressive interrogation techniques will have on the real client.  There is no discussion of the possible risks interrogators who use these techniques could face, to include criminal prosecution and harsh treatment at the hands of their enemies.  There is no consideration in these legal opinions of how the use of these interrogation techniques will impact the United State's standing among its coalition partners our allies or the world at large.  The legal opinions are silent as to the effectiveness of these interrogation techniques in actually obtaining useful intelligence.  Yet these are the very considerations that an organizational lawyer should consider and advise on in order to fully and completely represent the best interests of the client.  <br /><br />How did these lawyers get it so wrong and provide such poor legal advice?  The answer comes back to the very simple point that these lawyers lost sight of who the client is and what is in the best interests of the client.  The corporate scandals of the past several years are replete with examples of lawyers who have failed to fulfill their ethical and legal responsibilities to the organizations they represent.  Unfortunately, as we are now seeing, when government lawyers fail their clients in matters vital to our national security, the consequences can be severe.  Much of this may have been avoided if some of those lawyers would have simply asked the fundamental and most basic questions. Who is my client? What actions are in my client's best interests?  <br /><br />For those who would claim that these questions are too basic, or that this is too simplistic of an approach in the extremely complex arena of national security, I suggest that they look to the example of Alberto Mora.  He clearly did not forget who his client was. We are all better for that.<br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps and currently teaches at New England School of Law</em><br />

		<title>Freedom and the &#039;Wet Foot, Dry Foot&#039; Policy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Roberto Iraola, a former prosecutor now with the US Department of the Interior, says that Cuban migrants reaching American shores after fleeing the oppressive regime of Fidel Castro should be given the benefit of the legal doubt when it comes to their eligibility to apply for US permanent residency status...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/robertoiraola.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>round midnight on January 4, 2006, after a 27-hour voyage, a makeshift boat with fifteen Cubans, including four women and two children, reached Flagler Bridge, popularly known as the old Seven Mile Bridge, south of Marathon Key, Florida.  The Cubans believed they had finally arrived at the land of freedom.  This is because under the so-called "wet foot, dry foot" policy, which does not apply to any other group of immigrants and has been in effect since 1995, Cubans who make it to American soil are allowed to apply for permanent resident status in one year under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966.   Those interdicted at sea, however, generally are returned to Cuba, unless they establish a credible fear of prosecution, in which case they are taken to the naval base at Guantanamo Bay and then found asylum in a third country.  The genesis of this policy, in part, can be traced to the exodus of over 30,000 refugees who left Cuba in small boats and rafts in 1994 after Cuba's communist dictator Fidel Castro proclaimed that those wishing to leave would not be prevented from doing so.  The ensuing crisis resulted in the entry of migration accords between the two countries in 1994 and 1995, leading to the promulgation of the current policy.  Unfortunately for the fifteen Cubans who landed on the old Seven Mile Bridge, the American government concluded that because the piling holding the section of the bridge in which they disembarked was no longer connected to the mainland at either end, they had wet feet. As a result, they were all repatriated. <br />  <br />The day after the Cubans were sent back, a suit was filed in district court by four of their group and other interested parties alleging that the United States Coast Guard had failed to implement the wet foot, dry foot policy reasonably when it elected to repatriate the group to Cuba.   The district court agreed holding that "those Cuban refugees who reached American soil in early January 2006 were removed to Cuba illegally."   The court further directed the government to undertake its "best efforts" to provide for the return of the group.  Two weeks after the entry of the court's order, the parties settled the case.  The government agreed to issue visas to fourteen members of the group (one of them reportedly had a criminal history so he was not included) and the earlier order was vacated and the case dismissed.  Whether Castro ultimately will grant these brave men, women, and children permission to immigrate to the United States remains to be seen.<br />          <br />The decision to repatriate the Cubans that landed on the old Seven Mile Bridge produced an outcry in the Cuban exile community, was sharply criticized by Mel Martinez, Florida's Cuban-American Senator, and raised concerns with members of Congress about the need to re-examine the policy.  Putting aside the policy's wisdom and whether it reflects a betrayal of principle (before then, most Cubans picked up at sea were taken back to the United States because it was recognized they were fleeing a communist dictatorship), the recent repatriation teaches that at times, there will be room at the joints when the issue surrounding the policy's enforcement concerns whether a Cuban migrant has "dry feet."  This means that when interpreting or gauging the bounds of this aspect of the policy, two fundamental considerations must be kept in mind.<br /><br />The first concerns the country at issue and the type of relationship which we have with that country.  In this regard, while the United States, as reflected in the Cuban Adjustment Act, has warmly welcomed the Cuban people, it does not formally recognize the Cuban government, a communist dictatorship with no respect for basic human rights.  Second, those that risk their lives in makeshift boats traversing the Florida Straights in the hopes of reaching American shores are looking for a chance to live in freedom - a condition that does not exist in Cuba.   President Bush forcefully made this point last year when, in commemorating the 103rd anniversary of Cuban independence from Spain, he warned:  "The tide of freedom is spreading across the globe, and it will reach Cuban shores. No tyrant can stand forever against the power of liberty because the hope of freedom is found in every heart."  In the meantime then, for purposes of the implementation of current policy, when a scenario arises in the future involving United States territorial waters and which calls into question whether a Cuban migrant has reached American soil, consistent with the promotion of the "hope of freedom found in every heart," the migrant should be given the benefit of the doubt.    <br />    <br /><br /><em>Roberto Iraola, a former prosecutor, is the Senior Advisor to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Law Enforcement and Security at the Department of the Interior.  The views expressed herein are solely his and do not purport to represent the views of the Department of the Interior or any of its bureaus or offices.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.soas.ac.uk/lawpeacemideast/people.html">Ron Dudai</a> of the SOAS School of Law at the University of London (UK) says that the dubious US response to 9/11 has given Israel an excuse to engage in its own questionable practices, as reflected by a recent Israeli Supreme Court ruling endorsing the detention of two Palestinians an &quot;illegal combatants&quot;...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/rondudai.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>hen the US Administration announced in January 2002 that the detainees captured in Afghanistan and transferred to Guantanamo will be classified as "Illegal Combatants", the international legal community reacted with surprise: no one was even familiar with the phrase. But in Israel, human rights activists nodded with disbelief. Just the previous year, an Israeli government attempt to pass an "illegal combatants" law had failed. Fulfilling pessimistic expectations, following the American example the Israeli bill was resurrected and passed the parliament successfully in mid 2002. Even then it went unused until last year, when two Palestinians from Gaza were detained as "Illegal Combatants". In March, the Israeli Supreme Court <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/06/210/012/t04/06012210.t04.pdf">endorsed these detentions</a> [PDF decision text, in Hebrew]. This is not only another sad and alarming tale on how the "war on terror" erodes basic civil liberties principles; it is a powerful illustration of the global interactions and effects of these erosions. <br /><br />The beginning of the Israeli classification was quite unique. During the 1990s, Israel captured several Lebanese citizens and held them in detention, with the explicit aim of using them as bargaining chips in negotiations with Hezbollah on returning captured Israeli soldiers. After years of deliberations, the Supreme Court ruled that the detainees could not remain in custody solely as hostages without being brought to trial on specific charges. In 2000, the government set out to bypass this ruling by enacting new legislation that would categorize these detainees as "illegal combatants". Whereas international law recognizes only two categories: combatants (who can be held as POWs or prosecuted for war crimes) and civilians (who can be detained for specific grounds), this law was to create a new category. Neither combatants nor civilians, "illegal combatants" are those civilians classified by the Army's Chief of Staff as suspected of "taking part in hostile activity against Israel, directly or indirectly" or "belonging to a force engaged in hostile activity against the State of Israel." A concentrated campaign by Israeli human rights organizations and jurists, as well as pressure from abroad, succeeded then in influencing the Israeli law-makers and the bill has failed to pass parliament. A major trump in the campaign against the bill was that no other country in the world recognized the concept of "illegal combatants". This, of course, soon changed. With talk of "illegal combatants" suddenly coming from Washington, the Israeli government opportunistically revived the law, and this time the legislators abided. <br /><br />The Lebanese detainees were released shortly thereafter in an exchange deal with Hezbollah. It was not clear, initially, if the law would be used against Palestinians from the Occupied Territories of Gaza and the West Bank. One reason for this doubt was that the Israeli authorities had already been using, in addition to criminal prosecution, the sanction of "administrative detention" against Palestinians. Administrative detention is detention without trial, authorized by order of a military commander rather than judicial decree. Thousands of Palestinians have been held in administrative detention for periods ranging from six months to several years. Indeed, the two Palestinians against whom the law was used last year, were already being held in administrative detention at the time. Yet, in September 2005, The Israeli Chief of Staff signed an order changing their status to Illegal Combatants. They were both declared as being "members of Hezbollah" and "involved in military activities against Israel".   <br /><br />Why is the illegal combatants law utilized? Following the Israeli "disengagement" from Gaza, the military order (relating to this area) that authorized administrative detention was cancelled. The State could still have used the Israeli domestic law on administrative detentions. Yet while the law on administrative detention falls short of fair trial standards, it does contain some checks and balances and allow a narrow role for judicial review. This puts a certain pressure on the security services, especially when detention orders are being renewed again and again, a practice that sometimes tests the patience of the usually happy-to-approve judges. Indeed, the appellants in this case were held in administrative detention for three years, and brought several times for renewal hearings. But now, with a stroke of pen the administrative detainees are transformed into illegal combatants &#8212; and once suspected of involvement in the activities of Hezbollah, they are to remain in custody indefinitely (or as long as the Chief of Staff finds that this organization continues to act against Israel). The security services no longer need to worry about individual renewal orders being scrutinized in court. The fact that the suspicion of membership of Hezbollah did not arise in any of the previous hearings reinforces this interpretation. <br /><br />After the Tel-Aviv District Court approved the September 2005 order, the case of the Palestinian detainees reached Israel&#39;s Supreme Court, sitting as High Court of Appeals. In his decision, Justice Rubinstein wrote "indeed, this is not a simple law" &#8212; yet he does not seem to harbor any major doubts. Nodding conspicuously toward the US, he pointed out that "the US is also dealing with similar issues, in the al-Qaeda case, and re detainees being held in Guantanamo and elsewhere", and referenced the <em>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</em> and <em>Rumsfeld v. Padilla</em> cases. Aiming to create a flattering comparison, however, he noted that while in the US the question of judicial review in such matters is still open, in Israel it is unequivocally agreed that judicial review should always take place. <br /><br />Yet how powerful can this judicial review be? Not only does the Illegal Combatants law create a new category not recognized in international law, it reverses the burden of proof. Once an order is signed by the Chief of Staff, the burden of proof is on the defendant: he has to prove to the court that he is not an enemy combatant. Moreover, he is expected do this when the charge against him is based solely on classified evidence, which he is barred from examining and is therefore unable to challenge. One of the defendants told the court he was arrested in his house, for no reason, and added that if he were exposed to the evidence against him he would be able to respond. But that, of course, did not happen. After the defense lawyers argued their case, they and their clients had to exit the courtroom, leaving the security services' representatives to reveal their secret evidence to the judge. Unsurprisingly, Justice Rubinstein was "convinced" by that evidence. <br /><br />Although in some recent decisions &#8212; the "human shields" case and some of the petitions regarding the West Bank Barrier &#8212; the Israeli Supreme Court proved that it is capable of ruling against the government on security-related issues, it seems that in cases like this, where secret evidence is involved, the Court will invariably rule for the State. The Court's record in cases of administrative detentions, where the burden on the state was higher, has almost always been to defer to the security service
s suspicions and to succumb to their secret evidence. With the lower threshold of the illegal combatants law and its reversed burden of proof, there is not much hope that the Court would ever challenge the army's decisions. There may be formal habeas corpus here, but in practice it has almost no substantial value.  <br /><br />In a true masterpiece of manipulative rhetoric, Rubinstein quoted an earlier decision by the Court regarding administrative detentions, where it was acknowledged that a defendant facing secret evidence is like a man fighting with one of his hands tied behind his back. Yet Rubinstein immediately proceeded to quote from the Court's 1999 decision to outlaw torture, where the Court's president wrote that the State &#8212; because of its adherence to the rule of law &#8212; has to fight terrorism with one of its hands tied. Rubinstein's attempt to create this artificial balance to legitimize his decision is a case of judicial bad faith if there ever was one. Equating the State's "disadvantage" in not using torture with the defendant's disadvantage in not being able to see the evidence against him is dishonest, aiming to portray equality of arms where clearly none exists. <br /><br />Those who were involved in attacks against Israeli civilians must be punished. They may be prosecuted, in ordinary Israeli courts, or as is much more often the case, in its military courts. With conviction rates of 90-95 percent in this biased system, opting for military prosecution poses no major risk for the Israeli government. At worst, the Israeli government can use &#8212; as it has &#8212; administrative detentions. Indeed, international law allows limited use of such preventive detentions, with rigid restrictions and procedural safeguards (which are not fully followed by Israel). These avenues do exist. Current law can and should be used to prosecute, convict and punish those who target civilians, according to established principles of law and due process. The choice to use instead the new concept and procedures of illegal combatants does not serve any real need, apart from the security services' desire to let go of even the limited legal requirements they face. Rubinstein wrote that "this law was enacted in response to a situation which is not unique to our region, especially after the 9/11 events in the US". But in fact, this law did not stem from any new complex situation in international affairs; the more accurate way to read this statement is that the US&#39; dubious response to 9/11 has given Israel an excuse to engage in its own devious practices. Many voiced concerns about the potential global effects of the US measures in its "war on terror" &#8212; this case shows that these concerns should not be seen as merely abstract. <br /><br />It should be noted the question of the legality of the law as such was not dealt with in this decision. It is likely that a general petition regarding the constitutionality of the Illegal Combatants law will soon reach the Supreme Court. Justice Rubinstein, who in his previous position as Israel's Attorney General was involved in drafting the law, has hinted he would excuse himself from such a hearing. Let us hope that some of his colleagues on the bench will be brave enough to refrain from using American measures as an alibi and rule to nullify this law and erase it from Israel's statutes. <br />    <br /><br /><em>Ron Dudai is a research fellow in the School of Law, School of African and Oriental Studies, University of London</em><br />

		<title>Bad Politics, Worse Law: Re-writing the UK Human Rights Act</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.uel.ac.uk/law/staff/chandrasriram.htm">Chandra Lekha Sriram</a>, Chair of Human Rights at the University of East London School of Law (UK), says that the UK government&#39;s push to limit the application of the Human Rights Act in matters of public safety is politically dubious and legally unjustifiable...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/chandra.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>hen it was revealed that the US program of &#39;extraordinary rendition&#39; was delivering terror suspects to countries where torture was routinely practiced to be interrogated, UK politicians declared their outrage widely. When reports emerged that such rendition involved flight paths over western Europe, our leaders demanded answers. In the face of ongoing reports of prisoner mistreatment in Camp Delta in Guantanamo, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair declared the US prison an &#39;anomaly&#39;, stopping just short of suggesting that it ought to be closed, a step which has since been taken by his Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith. In the fall of 2005 the UK Minister for Constitutional Affairs, Lord Falconer, categorically condemned torture, asserting that the UK was the first European country to ban torture, in 1709. <br /><br />Considering all this, many in the UK and abroad might be forgiven for believing that the Blair administration is committed to an ethical foreign policy and the staunch defense of  human rights. <br /><br />Yet the position of the UK government on the protection of human rights and the prevention of torture in the context of the war on terror has not been so unequivocal, a point lately highlighted by Blair&#39;s vow to re-write the UK Human Rights Act (HRA) in the wake of court determinations that nine men who hijacked a plane from Afghanistan to London in 2000, seeking to escape persecution by the Taliban, could not be returned home. Citing public safety and the war on terror, Blair and other politicians seem prepared to re-write British human rights law in ways that would have long-term effects on due process of law in this country. <br /><br />The call to revise the Act is legally unjustifiable, and appears to be driven by short-sighted domestic political concerns as much as anything else. <br /><br />In the first place, revising the Act as suggested is contrary to the UK&#39;s obligations under international and regional human rights law. Both the Torture Convention of 1984, and the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 1950, prohibit the use of torture, and no derogations are permitted, as they are in the case of some other rights enshrined in these documents, in the event of war or public emergency. The Torture Convention prohibits the return of any person to a country where she might face torture, and UK judges have interpreted the UK&#39;s obligations under the European Convention and the HRA, which incorporates the European Convention into domestic law, to bar such returns. Further, mere reassurance by the recipient country that specific individuals will not face torture is unlikely to survive legal scrutiny by domestic courts or the European Court of Human Rights.<br /><br />Indeed the original UK court decision interpreting the HRA&#39;s language enshrining he protections of the European Convention held that the hijackers could not be deported because of the protection against torture. It is for this reason that the HRA has come under fire. The Tories first led the call to eliminate or re-write the Act, and soon after Lord Falconer himself suggested that it might need re-writing, even suggesting that a &#39;human rights culture&#39; created by the Act had led to the release of a rapist in an unrelated case. The claim has been simple: public safety and the war on terror require a revision of the HRA. Blair soon followed suit, calling for reform of the Act and arguing that the ruling was an &#39;abuse of common sense.&#39;<br /><br />The argument made by those leading the call for reform has been that revision would not derogate from the UK&#39;s international obligations, and that the UK Act either incorporates the European Convention differently than other member states do, or offers confusing guidance to judges who are then issuing ill-advised judgments.<br /><br />The claim by those seeking the revision of the act is this, then: courts in the UK are misinterpreting fundamental rights, and are giving them undue preference over public security. Therefore, the revisions that Blair would seek would limit judicial discretion in the interpretation of the UK&#39;s international obligations. Yet this would undermine the very purpose of the Torture Convention, the European Convention, and indeed the HRA, to protect individuals against the excesses of their governments, even where those governments have other valid goals, such as the prevention of terrorism. Such changes would subject due process and the protection of individual rights to the vagaries of politics and politicians in ways that invite authoritarian abuses. <br /><br />The push to revise the HRA may be seen as part of a larger trend amongst the leaders of the country to prioritize public security and the war on terror over human rights and civil liberties. Notwithstanding the apparently strong criticisms of rendition and Guantanamo by UK politicians, the country has not only allowed its airspace to be used for rendition flights, but rendition flights apparently landed at some UK and Northern Ireland airstrips, and there are allegations that UK intelligence agency MI5 enabled the rendition of two UK residents to Guantanamo. The UK also reached an agreement with Jordan for the deportation of Jordanian terror suspects back to that country after gaining reassurances that they would not be tortured. As with any revision of the HRA to allow the return of individuals to countries where they might be tortured, agreements with Jordan or any other country where official torture is a significant risk, even if government reassurances are offered, are not consistent with the UK&#39;s international obligations.<br /><br />The proposal to revise the HRA might be seen as designed to a address a short-term domestic political problem rather than a serious legal issue. The current government faces a scandal over the release of perhaps 150 dangerous foreign criminals without deporting them, or even tracking their whereabouts, as would have been appropriate. No one has genuinely argued that these individuals were terrorists, or that they were allowed to stay because of the HRA. However, this scandal clearly motivates many of the calls for reform, and politicians have conflated the foreign criminal scandal, which involves common criminals, with the Afghan decision, a separate case involving the release of an individual rapist, and the treatment of terrorism suspects generally. The conclusion in the rush to judgment: the HRA is the culprit and must be revised.<br /><br />But reforming the HRA will not make the current scandal go away, nor would it relieve the UK of its international human rights obligations. Deportations of individuals to countries where they might be tortured would still violate international law. Equally, any revision of the HRA, and any move to publicly deport individuals to countries with records of officially sanctioned torture - whether Afghanistan under the Taliban, or Jordan today - strips the UK and Tony Blair of whatever moral authority the push for an &#39;ethical foreign policy&#39; might have conferred. It places UK politicians in the ranks of the hypocrites when they seek to condemn the US for policies of extraordinary rendition, or in Guantanamo, and further distances the country from European allies who do not share their interpretation of key human rights obligations. <br /><br />Revision of the HRA is, in short, a poor and p
otentially permanent response to a current and temporary political crisis. It threatens real protections of human rights in the name of illusory advances in security.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Professor Chandra Lekha Sriram is Chair in Human Rights and Director of the newly founded Centre on Human Rights in Conflict at the University of East London School of Law.</em><br />

Foley</strong></a> [Florida Coastal School of Law]: &quot;The Supreme Court has finally spoken on the military commissions, after four-and-one-half years.  Now it&#39;s time for Congress to step up - as it should have four-and-one-half years ago, when the Administration first created these commissions and proceeded to build a fake justice system to try suspected &#39;enemy combatants.&#39;<br /><br />Let&#39;s hope that Congress rises above its now-habitual subservience to the Executive and recognizes that it should serve the rule of law instead. Let&#39;s hope that Congress requires a real justice system.  Better yet, why not end these shenanigans and simply try these suspected terrorists in our federal courts, which were apparently adequate for Zacarias Moussaoui? Then Congress can focus on crafting necessary legislation, and the Executive can focus on enforcing our laws.  <br /><br />Such a move may sound idealistic, but it&#39;s actually pragmatic.  Real rules of procedure and evidence, instead of rules that simply make it easy for the Executive to win its cases against &#39;enemy combatants,&#39; are part of the important and necessary oversight of the Executive.  Robust rules of procedure and evidence make it much harder for the Executive simply to squeeze a confession out of someone and declare &#39;mission accomplished,&#39; or to use hearsay or other unreliable evidence and then tell the public that it has convicted another &#39;terrorist&#39; and thereby made us all safer -- and accumulate unwarranted public support and increase its own political power.  Robust rules require the Executive to actually investigate and gather reliable evidence if it wants to win its cases &#8212; actions that can help us disrupt and disable terrorist organizations.<br /><br />The real beneficiary of robust rules is not &#39;terrorists,&#39; but the public.  Congress and the Executive should have recognized this four-and-one-half years ago.  Our leaders have a chance to recognize this now &#8212; and that our well-developed federal court system is the proper place for trying people charged with crimes.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Geoffrey_Corn.htm"><strong>Geoffrey Corn</strong></a> [South Texas College of Law]: &quot;Today it was reported that the Department of Defense has officially acknowledged that Common Article 3 of the four Geneva Conventions applies to the conflict with Al Qaeda.  In fact, the Memorandum issued by Gordon England specifically directs the military departments to ensure that all Department of Defense (DOD) personnel adhere to the humanitarian mandate of Common Article 3 when dealing with any detainee under DOD control. <br /><br />Secretary England&#39;s Memorandum begins by citing the decision in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> for the proposition that the Supreme Court has determined that Common Article 3 applies as a matter of law to the conflict with Al Qaeda.  This policy is a clear retraction of the flawed &quot;inapplicability&quot; interpretation that senior Bush administration officials had imposed on DOD and refused to abandon.  While the <em>Hamdan</em> decision was undoubtedly the final nail in the proverbial coffin of this widely condemned interpretation of the law of war, it was not the only factor.  In fact, this policy reversal is also a testament to the tenacity of numerous legal advisers within DOD who have been unrelenting in their efforts to restore the humane treatment mandate to its proper status vis a vis U.S. military operations, including detention operations.<br /><br />This is a major step forward in preserving the moral and legal integrity of these military operations.  More importantly, this policy reversal provides a clear and unambiguous mandate to U.S. forces &#8212; when you conduct combat operations, you are bound by the law of war, even if your enemy is a transnational non-state terrorist entity.  Such clarity is essential to enable military legal advisers and the commanders they support to identify and enforce appropriate limits on the measures taken in the name of military necessity.  Balancing the principle of necessity with basic principle of humane treatment is a bedrock concept of the contemporary law of war and integrally related to the preservation of a disciplined and professional force.<br /><br />It is therefore unsurprising that the acknowledgement of Common Article 3 applicability to the conflict with Al Qaeda was not only a key aspect of the <em>Hamdan</em> decision, but also the objective of virtually every senior uniformed and civilian legal adviser within DOD.  It is equally unsurprising that the atmosphere of <em>extremis</em> that characterized the post 9/11 attacks bred novel and what we now know to be overreaching legal interpretations.  It is a credit to the professionalism and tenacity of the uniformed and career civil service lawyers who serve our nation that benefit of time and reflection were ultimately able to move these interpretations back towards the realm of credibility.  These lawyers are no doubt grateful that the Supreme Court pushed this issue over the finish line, but there should be no doubt that the finish line was close at hand when the push finally came, thanks to their efforts.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm"><strong>Ben Davis</strong></a> [University of Toledo College of Law]: &quot;As the debate intensifies in an election year in Congress over what to do after the Supreme Court decision in the Hamdan case last week, I would ask two things:  in drafting legislation listen to the uniformed military lawyers, and make sure the Senate Armed Services Committee under Senator John Warner has a preeminent role.  I believe that Senator John Warner is likely to pay much more attention to the retired and uniformed Judge Advocates General in the crafting of any new tribunals and will attempt to do this in a deliberative manner (even waiting until after the November election).  One of the main reasons that we are in this mess is that the military lawyers were cut out of the loop in designing these tribunals for the past five years.<br /><br />I understand that those soldiers as well as several Reagan era civilian employees and others have been pushing for Geneva Convention standards to apply to all detainees in this conflict. They have been fighting a very difficult battle internally in the Department of Defense to block the classified interrogation techniques part of the attempt to revise the Army Field Manual (see Jordan Paust, <a href="/forumy/2006/06/no-place-for-war-crimes-redrafting-us.php">No Place for War Crimes: Redrafting the US Army Interrogation Manual</a>, JURIST, June 15, 2006).  The Supreme Court strengthens their hand and we should listen to them and reject the incompetent counsel from the high level civilian lawyers that have gotten us into this mess.<br /><br />If Congress passes something that is suspect as a matter of Geneva law, then we have a likely breach of a treaty obligation.  One could also imagine that Congress passes a law that guts the Geneva Conventions.  Such an action would be detrimental to our war effort.  Such an approach would expose our leaders and soldiers to international prosecution, but that is not the only avenue of response around the world.  The level of active support of US efforts in a wide variety of domains by our allies would remain low or go lower as political responses to a perceived weakening by us of Geneva law.  The same reactions of our military I would suspect are present in the military in other countries.  The concrete example of this kind of non-prosecutive response that we have seen is the minimal burden sharing of the War in Iraq by our allies.  The second will be the reinforced perception of us as phonies (i.e. human rights law).  This is potent stuff &#8212; losing hearts and minds &#8212; as we see each day in Iraq.  Moreover, as a matter of reciprocity, our non-compliance makes it even more likely that our soldiers will be abused in this and future wars.<br /><br />The problem that is unstated is that - since Geneva has been violated over the past five years - war crimes far more than those prosecuted so far have been committed.  Those unprosecuted war crimes on our side are the result of a collective effort of Executive overreach and Congressional acquiescence.  So all these folks have blood on their hands - it&#39;s not just a few bad apples.  They allowed this to happen in panic and cut out the soldiers who were preaching Geneva compliance.<br /><br />The Supreme Court has pushed a rule that creates unease and forces the Congress to do a deliberative process and vote in the open to enshrine in law - if they dare - kangaroo courts of some kind.  Our salvation will, i suspect, come from the military lawyers.<br /><br />If Congress creates military tribunals that are still bad, then a question will remain of a Constitutional challenge by detainees on due process grounds to these military tribunals.  The constitutional rights of these detainees is an issue in the DC Circuit now.  The Supreme Court has successfully ducked that issue several times now consistent with its prudential approach.  It may not be able to continue ducking it, however.<br /><br />The lawyers who are the principal architects/apologists for this charade (Yoo, Rivkin, Casey et al) are doing overtime work right now to convince us that Congress should codify the military commissions as put in place by the President and rejected by the Supreme Court.  <br /><br />Those who propose Geneva standards might fear being said to &quot;coddle the terrorists&quot;.  I hope that the Geneva standards supporters will find the courage to say we are keeping our honor clean and protecting our soldiers for this and future armed conflicts by reinforcing the Geneva standards.<br /><br />Each of us can write our Congresspersons and Senators rather than sit passive to push them to understand that &quot;lynch law&quot; is not the answer in this arena.  You can find your Congressperson at <a href="http://www.house.gov">www.house.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.senate.gov">www.senate.gov</a>. <br /><br />In case there is any doubt, the Al-Qaida types who violate the laws of war are subject to prosecution for war crimes too.  So those who recently beheaded two American soldiers are subject to war crimes prosecution (this prosecution might take place in the form of a murder charge).&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong>Lisl Brunner</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh School of Law 2L, in Argentina]: &quot;&quot;Asesino!&quot; resounds from the stained-glass windows and marble columns of the makeshift courtroom in the city hall of La Plata, an hour south of Buenos Aires.  Miguel Osvaldo Etchecolatz, former Director of Investigations of the Buenos Aires Police Department during Argentina&#39;s last military junta, has just appeared to face charges of kidnapping, torture and murder.  A middle-aged woman near me is weeping, and groups of young people waving flags start to clap and chant about how the Nazis are going to get it.  In an empathetic tone, the president of the three-judge panel reminds the observers that he can order the trial closed to the public.  The bustle subsides during the two hours it takes to read the charges against Etchecolatz: a woman dumped in the mountains after being beaten and raped; a house looted and machine-gunned while its occupants were carried off in hoods; an infant given to a military family to raise when her parents were arrested . . .  <br /><br />High-profile cases like these now constitute the minority of the cases taken on by the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights (APDH) in Buenos Aires.  While the group was founded thirty years ago for just this purpose, its mainly volunteer staff has transformed it into a multifaceted organization that has evolved with the country&#39;s legal climate.  Free legal clinics are held at the main office on Monday evenings, and on other days the attorneys travel to &quot;emergency neighborhoods&quot; to hear a variety of problems akin to those presented to an American public interest lawyer; the only difference is that perhaps the situation is more desperate.  Although the country has recovered impressively from its financial crash of 2001 in the macroeconomic sense, the unemployment rate still hovers around 16%.  At night, the sheer number of people rifling through garbage bags on the street to find recyclable items for which the city will pay a few pesos is alarming.  I read in the newspaper that there may be 40,000 of them, and on average they earn $100 per month.  Many of them come to the legal clinics with complaints of wrongful eviction, denials of welfare benefits, and police refusal to answer calls or investigate in certain neighborhoods.<br /><br />The Wednesday legal clinic, held in a one-room building of plywood and tin and framed by hundreds of shacks haphazardly scattered in the mud, is the focal point of another major case that APDH is sponsoring.  The city of Buenos Aires proposed to give the residents a sum of money to relocate &#8212; the settlement is on prime waterfront property &#8212; but it has not offered assistance in finding new homes.  The lack of an official census means that some people have already spent their subsidy and returned to the settlement, while others moved in for the sole purpose of collecting it.  With APDH&#39;s support, the neighbors are suing the city for the right to stay, or at least for its help in finding new places to live.  As they like to remind me, the less glamorous cases such as these illustrate what human rights work is really about.  <br /><br />Human rights work is also attending meetings of Mercosur, where NGOs have recently been invited to ensure that its policies respect the rights of immigrants, children and indigenous people.  This new approach echoes my law professors&#39; constant admonitions that international trade and human rights are interrelated aims that can be pursued together.  Nevertheless, the delegates&#39; nebulous statements about the importance of these rights and the absence of clearly articulated policies that protect them suggest that I am not the only one for whom this concurrence is unclear.  <br /><br />My greatest curiosity is to explore whether the trials of people such as the 77-year-old Etchecolatz are evidence that the rule of law and the respect for constitutional rights have truly taken root in Argentina.  The case of Etchecolatz is the first to follow the annulment of laws granting impunity to most of those responsible for atrocities during the dictatorship.  Originally passed to quell threats of yet another military uprising, the impunity laws were struck down by the Supreme Court last June.  It is an auspicious moment for the legal system, yet at the same time, new cases of detainees being beaten to death in police custody seem to emerge every week.&quot;<br />

		<title>The Future of the EU Constitution: Escaping the Ratification Maze</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Dr. <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/law/Staff/laurent_pech.html">Laurent Pech</a>, Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Union Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, says that while it&#39;s too early to abandon the troubled European constitution, significant strategic and political adjustments are required before it can secure ratification by enough states to bring it into force...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/pechlarge.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>s the EU Constitution condemned to the dustbin of history? <br /><br />The auguries are not good. Although quite amusing, it may not be entirely exact to claim, as Denis Macshane, the UK's Europe minister from 2002 to 2005, did recently, that "[t]he thing is as dead as Monty Python's famous parrot". Predictions are always problematic. Ideological considerations or wishful thinking can cloud critical thinking. It appears clear, however, that the EU &quot;Constitution&quot; &#8212; it is also described as a &quot;Constitutional Treaty&quot; by those willing to emphasize its true legal nature &#8212; simply cannot survive in its 2004 form. At the time of writing, fifteen EU Member States &#8212; already representing a majority of the Member States &#8212; <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/en/constitution/ratification-eu-constitution-state-play-member-states/article-130616">have ratified the text</a>.  The next European country scheduled to ratify it is Finland, which assumed the rotating six-month presidency of the EU Council on July 1, 2006. The negative outcome of the 2005 referenda in France and in the Netherlands has, however, made the final outcome of the ratification process rather uncertain. <br /><br />From a legal perspective, the rules governing the entry into force of the Constitution are clear-cut: unanimous ratification is required before November 1, 2006. No matter how practically absurd in a Union of 25 Member States, such unanimity is actually the clearest indication that the Member States retain the entirety of the "pouvoir constituant", i.e. the supreme power to decide one's own constitutional arrangements. Therefore, the EU "Constitution", if ever ratified, will not give life to a new sovereign power &#8212; "We, the People of Europe" &#8212; as its ratification will not be the result of a European-wide referendum of self-determination. Apprehensive of future hurdles, thanks to the unworkable unanimous requirement, the Member States gave themselves some political latitude by agreeing (in a <a href="http://europa.eu.int/constitution/en/ptoc164_en.htm">Declaration No. 30</a> appended to the Constitutional Treaty signed in 2004) to review the situation where, hypothetically, four fifths of the Member States have ratified the Constitution, but one or more have "encountered difficulties" in doing so. In other words, there is simply no legal solution to the ratification conundrum. Political leadership is required. Legal ingenuity may then follow. The trouble is there is simply no European leader left with enough political capital or ideological enthusiasm to fight for the EU Constitution. In particular, to paraphrase Roger Cohen, a columnist for the <em>International Herald Tribune</em>, the whiff of "fin-de-r&Atilde;&copy;gime" in Tony Blair's Britain and Jacques Chirac's France have become unmistakable. Any significant new initiative on Europe is therefore unrealistic until their successors come on stage. When you add an Italy in shambles, a German coalition with an uncertain political future, and a Polish government filled with eccentric anti-EU politicians to the picture, it not surprising that the Member States have continuously decided not to decide anything. <br /><br />Rather than officially proclaiming the "death" of the Constitution, the Member States did however agree in June 2005 on a "period of reflection" to enable a broad debate to take place in each country &#8212; at the time of writing still largely absent &#8212; on "the construction of Europe". They also declared that the ratification process could continue and that the original timetable for the entry into force of the text (November 1, 2006) must be extended. This may seem, at first, a wise decision. Indeed, more than half the Member States have ratified the Constitution and they represent more than half of the EU population. Furthermore, it is manifest that the French and Dutch No votes cannot be understood as a simple No to the idea of a constitution for Europe or even the idea of further European integration (see Laurent Pech, <a href="/forumy/2005/05/non-sense-frances-no-to-european.php">France&#39;s No to the European Constitution</a>, JURIST <em>Forum</em>, May 31, 2005). There were certainly voters exclusively concerned with and ideologically favorable to the EU and who nonetheless rejected the Constitution. Above all, however, the French No was a patchwork of inconsistent claims: essentially a no to what is called there "Anglo-Saxon" Europe and its "neo-liberal" policies, a no to unemployment and social dumping and finally, a no to Turkey. With ideological absolutism on the left side of the political spectrum and a deeply unpopular government and President, these ingredients have proven fatal to the Constitution. This is also the view adopted by the European Council. In its <a href="http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/85325.pdf">Declaration of 18 June 2005</a>, the Member States agreed to state that these results of the French and Dutch referenda "do not call into question citizens' attachment to the construction of Europe" but that "citizens have nevertheless expressed concerns and worries which need to be taken into account".<br /><br />If debating may be required in order to identify those concerns and worries, a more delicate task is how to take them into account. In particular, with regards to the future of the Constitution, there seems to be no genuine "Plan B". Proclaiming the Constitution's death, although a clear and apparently more realistic solution, would send the wrong signal as it would demonstrate that some "No"s are more important than others. On the other hand, it is hard to deny that the current period of reflection, as <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/dead.pdf">Andrew Moravcsik judiciously observed</a>, "increasingly seems a smokescreen behind which to bury the constitutional remains." Indeed, there appears to be no obvious exit strategy available to the Member States. The EU can certainly continue to work on the basis of the Nice Treaty as long as there is no further enlargement after the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007 or 2008. Furthermore, if some Member States are willing to deepen European integration in certain areas, they may rely upon the provisions governing "enhanced cooperation" (Art. 43 of the Treaty on European Union). The current conditions governing the implementation of these provisions are however so cumbersome that it is unrealistic to expect such an outcome.<br /><br />Another option is to let the ratification process follows its path. This is the view most notably advocated in May 2006 by the Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, author of a challenging book on the future of Europe entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1903403863/202-5565058-1505434?v=glance&n=266239"><em>The United States of Europe</em></a> in which he suggests the establishment of a core of integrationist countries. In this scenario, we could see ultimately four-fifths of the Member States being governed by the Constitution. Their relationship with the Member States that did not ratify the Constitution will be governed by the current rules. Such a scenario, however lawful under international public law, remains highly unrealistic as Member States would find it extremely impractical to work under differing rules of voting arithmeti
c or institutional composition. Furthermore, this scenario assumes there will be not too many negative votes. Yet, if negative answers become more numerous, an hypothesis highly probable in the case of the United Kingdom and Poland at the very least, urgent reforms may be blocked for a longer period of time and lead to an era of prolonged "eurosclerosis". As for a complete renegotiation of the Constitution at a later stage of the ratification process, this is also an option not without potential vicious effects. To be sure, Member States will then be tempted to "lose" a referendum with the hope of regaining some leeway in future re-negotiations. And it may be well impossible to reconcile the French and Dutch No votes with, say, a British No to the Constitution if based on the dominant view that the text goes "too far". <br /><br />Due to the imperfections of all these diverse scenarios, an uneasy status quo has thus far prevailed, with some voices advocating a "soft" constitutionalization of the current European Treaties by the back door. For this author, the Constitution represents a respectable compromise and a necessary improvement. Any requiem for it still appears to be too difficult to accept for its drafters. As a result, it would not be surprising, nor legally too troublesome, to see some consensual provisions of the Constitution &#8212; e.g. the creation of an EU Foreign minister or the granting of new powers to national parliaments to scrutinize EU legislative proposals &#8212; inserted into the current Treaties or applied outside the EU framework. Yet, several Member States, including Ireland, are opposed to this strategy of "cherry-picking" and officially favor the implementation of the Constitution in full for fear that, as the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Dermot Ahern put it in May 2006, "if you start to take parts out of the treaty, then you run the danger of the whole thing unravelling". Unwilling to pronounce the Constitution dead, EU foreign ministers  pledged in May 2006 &#8212; a pledge formally endorsed on June 15-16 by the Heads of State or Government of the 25 Member States <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/90111.pdf">at the Brussels Council</a> &#8212; to find an agreement on the future legal basis of the EU by 2009 at the latest. The not-so-secret hope is that an initial agreement could be finalized under the German presidency, which runs in the first half of 2007, once French and Dutch elections are held in the spring of 2007. Interestingly, one may note that France will hold the EU presidency in the second half of 2008. France would therefore &#8212; quite ironically &#8212; be in position to decisively orient the final discussion and eventually draw up a new Treaty before European parliamentary elections are due to take place in 2009.<br /><br />This latest extension of the "reflection period" makes one wonder if there is, in the end, any realistic alternative other than to formalize the death of the Constitution in its current form. If the Member States seriously believe that the Treaty of Nice is not a viable basis for a well-functioning Union of 25 - soon 27 - Member States, the best solution may be to redraft the current text with a view of making it more concise in line with what <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/europeanInstitute/Events/LSE_EuropeanPublic%20LectureSeries/Giscard%20dEstaing%20transcript%2028th%20Feb.pdf">Val&Atilde;&copy;ry Giscard d'Estaing suggested in February 2006</a>. For the former French President and former President of the European Convention, the debate should be refocused on the only genuinely constitutional parts of the Constitutional Treaty, that is, on Parts I and II which concern respectively the institutions of the EU and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. His suggestion, however, not to abandon Part III on the policies and functioning of the EU but to make it ratified by national parliaments, unlike the new and more "fundamental" treaty based on Parts I and II which would normally call for a popular vote, appears impractical. Although Part III mostly codifies current legal provisions, countries such as Denmark or Ireland may nonetheless be constitutionally required to hold a referendum on this text as well. It may be wiser, therefore, to contend ourselves with a new and unique "mini-trait&Atilde;&copy;" of 10-15 articles, as <a href="http://www.eupolitix.com/EN/News/200602/aa9073b0-a438-46d0-bf3c-d28a2b3e0f2e.htm">advocated in February 2006 by Nicolas Sarkozy</a>, the leading contender for the French Presidency in 2007. This "mini-treaty", which will merely amend the existing Treaties and not replace them with an entirely new machinery, could then be ratified either by referendum or by national parliaments. <br /><br />The use of the word "constitution" should also be reconsidered and used only if genuine changes to the current European Treaties are proposed. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that it was not a sensitive choice, not only because the term constitution is (though erroneously) synonymous in the mind of most voters with unalterability, therefore dramatizing the debate, but also because it spectacularly raised expectations, in particular in France. And these expectations could only be disillusioned by the reading of a document of 448 Articles, which does not revolutionize the nature of European integration and does not alter the complexity of its current decision-making process. This diagnosis has now been accepted by the Member States.<br /><br />Regardless of its name and content, two new indispensable conditions should govern the ratification of any new "Constitution" or "Constitutional Treaty":<ul><li> Member States must accept its ratification on a super-majority basis rather than unanimity; and<br /><li>the text must clearly articulate what would happen to the Member State(s) which will be unable to ratify it.</ul>Voters' interest and attention would certainly be enhanced by a clearer and shorter text, with obvious and immediate negative consequences in the case of rejection. Such conditions would also help focusing the debate on the EU and the new text rather than on issues of domestic politics. Were the unanimity requirement to be retained &#8212; pure folly in a Union of 25 or more Member States &#8212; the EU would certainly find itself once again into another constitutional conundrum. On the long-run, Member States would also be well-advised to emulate Ireland with its <a href="http://www.forumoneurope.ie/">National Forum on Europe</a>. There is a need indeed for a politically neutral public space offering a regular and popular debate on the European project and European policies. Such a space may help citizens realize that even respectable politicians often hide behind "Brussels" to justify unpopular but inescapable policies. As for the proponents of European integration, it may advisable - as suggested by <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page9003.asp">Tony Blair in February 2006</a> - that they forget meta-politics for a while and concentrate on a "Europe of projects", i.e. practical policy proposals, in order for citizens to see the benefits of integration. They should also relentlessly explain (and defend) the EU for what it is: not a super-state in the making but an original and unprecedented system of government by, of, and for the Member States, with conferred and limited powers, and which is perfectly democratic in light of its "consociational" nature. In parallel, Eurocritics' inconsistencies, gladly propagated by shameless tabloids, should be constantly highlighted and concrete alternatives demanded from them. This is not to say there is no considerable room for improvement. The EU's current rules of governance and some of the most important EU's common policies (in particular, the Common agricultural policy and the Regional policy) are in need of serious reforms. But if Europeans are to preserve their way of life and not become politically insignificant, they should be careful not to &quot;throw the baby out with the bath water".<br /><br /><br /><em>Laurent Pech is Jean

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a TARGET="_blank" href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Geoffrey_Corn.htm">Geoffrey S. Corn</a>, Lt. Col. US Army (Ret.) and former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters, now a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that the US Supreme Court&#39;s finding in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies to US military operations against al Qaeda restores a broad approach to basic law of war doctrine long held by US military lawyers....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/cornforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Supreme Court has spoken on military commissions, and contrary to the determined assertions of the Bush administration, the Court concluded that the method chosen by the President to try captured al Qaeda operatives at Guantanamo was anything but "full and fair."  The stark deviation from well-established procedures of the military justice system, coupled with the <a href="/forumy/2006/06/hamdan-v-rumsfeld-supreme-court.php">overreaching charging efforts of the government</a> (see Professor David Scheffer&#39;s JURIST commentary), proved fatal to the President's policy.  While it is certainly possible that some alternate method to try the Guantanamo detainees may ultimately emerge from the ashes of Military Order Number 1, as a defense lawyer for a different detainee pending trial before that commission said to me, one thing seems certain: this process is over.<br /><br />The significance of the decision almost certainly transcends the narrow issue of military commissions, however.  Commentators are already noting its impact on, among other issues, analysis of executive power; the obligation to comply with customary international law; and the role of Congress in war-related decisions.  It is its potential impact on defining legal obligations related to armed conflict that I will address here.<br /><br />For at least three decades prior to the attacks of 9/11, U.S. military lawyers assumed as an article of faith that the principles reflected in Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions were applicable to all armed conflicts, no matter where they occurred or who they involved.  This assumption provided the foundation for all law of war related policies within the Department of Defense.  In fact, this baseline standard of humanitarian treatment was extended by policy to all military operations, even those that did not fit within the "armed conflict" paradigm.  <br /><br />These law of war practitioners always knew that the plain language of Common Article 3 indicated application was limited to non-international armed conflicts occurring within the territory of a High Contracting Party.  However, this plain language did not undermine an assumption of applicability across the spectrum of military operations.  Instead, the logic of treating Common Article 3 as a default standard applicable to any armed conflict &#8212; a logic reflected not only in the commentary to the article but also domestic and international jurisprudence &#8212; rendered such application virtually unquestioned.<br /><br /> The interpretation of the law of war proffered by the Bush administration in the months following 9/11 rejected this fundamental assumption.  Instead of endorsing a broad application of the principles of Common Article 3 as a matter of legal obligation, a narrow interpretation of applicability, based on the plain language of the article, resulted in a determination that although the military operations against al Qaeda qualified as an armed conflict, the baseline humanitarian principles reflected in Common Article 3 were inapplicable because of the "international" scope of the conflict.  <br /><br />This interpretation perplexed many experts in the field, both military and civilian.  Unfortunately, this interpretation prevailed in analysis of legal obligations related to military operations directed against al Qaeda.  While many experts have challenged the predicate conclusion that such operations can even be considered an armed conflict within the meaning of international law, the most troubling aspect of this conclusion for the lawyers working within DOD was how it undermined the symmetry of the law of war.  By "interpreting out" of Common Article 3 obligations, the Bush administration essentially invoked the authority of the law of war without accepting the limits established by this law.<br /><br />A plurality of the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Hamdan</em> that the United States is bound to accept "the bitter with the sweet."  The analysis of Common Article 3 was limited to its impact on the validity of military commissions.  However, the message was far more significant.  By concluding that invocation of the authority of the law of war to establish a military commission included the requirement to abide by the obligations of that same law in the process for the commission, the Court endorsed a restoration of the symmetry of the law of war.  Necessity cannot be invoked without accepting the constraint of humanity, which is exactly how the Bush administration has interpreted the law.  By rejecting this interpretation of the law of war, the Court endorsed the pragmatic interpretation of the Geneva Conventions that ensures that no &quot;armed conflict&quot; falls outside the law &#8212; an interpretation that has guided U.S. military operations for decades.  Common Article 3, according to the Court, is binding on the United States in the armed conflict with Al Qaeda as a matter of treaty obligation.  While many experts object to the characterization of the fight against al Qaeda as an armed conflict, at least this interpretation ensures that the balance between authority and obligation so central to the law of war has been endorsed by the highest court in our land. <br /><br />In restoring this symmetry, the Court has rejected the proposition that an armed conflict can occur outside the scope of some legal regulation, a proposition central to the purpose of the law of armed conflict.  This aspect of the opinion transcends the question of the legality of the military commission and extends to every aspect of military operations conducted against al Qaeda. It represents a categorical rejection of the proposition that individuals detained in relation to such operations are protected against inhumane treatment only as a matter of policy, and not as a matter of law. Instead, such individuals fall under the protective umbrella of the Common Article 3 humane treatment mandate. The &quot;international&quot; scope of the military operations associated with this fight should therefore no longer be asserted as a justification for denying the applicability of this provision to such individuals.<br /><br /> Many commentators are already questioning whether this aspect of the opinion will have any meaningful impact beyond the military commission.  I believe it will.  For the first time since 9/11, proponents of the broad and pragmatic application of the principles reflected in Common Article 3 to U.S. military operations, as a matter of law, will be armed with a potentially controlling interpretation of this law.   The next time such a proponent is confronted with the question "where does it say we have to comply with Common Article 3?", the answer will be much more compelling than before this decision was announced.<br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S.

		<title>Trying Habre in Senegal: An African Solution to an African Problem?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.uel.ac.uk/law/staff/chandrasriram.htm">Chandra Lekha Sriram</a>, Chair of Human Rights at the University of East London School of Law (UK), says that the favorable response by Senegal&#39;s president to an African Union call that former Chadian president Hissene Habre be tried in Africa for alleged torture and mass killings committed by his regime in the 1980s is promising, but the option of trying Habre elsewhere should not be abandoned if Senegal fails, yet again, to follow through...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/chandrasriramnew2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n 1 July, an expert panel appointed by the African Union (AU) reported to the organization&#39;s summit in Banjul that the former Chadian dictator, Hissene Habre, should be tried for alleged torture and mass killings during his regime by the courts of Senegal, the country to which he fled in 1990. The panel announced that this was an &quot;African solution&quot;, a phrase that resonates with the AU&#39;s mantra, &quot;African solutions to African problems&quot;. The Panel&#39;s report was endorsed by the AU membership, and on the 3rd of July Senegal&#39;s President, Abdoulaye Wade, announced that his country would try Habre, stating that &quot;Africans must be judged in Africa.&quot; This is an admirable sentiment, no doubt, but it is worth asking whether a trial is Senegal will offer any solution at all. In light of the potential difficulties, is an African solution really to be preferred above all others?<br /> <br />It is first perhaps worth asking why the Habre case has provoked such interest, and why therefore African countries have been so keen to ensure that he remains in Africa. The current dispute over trying Habre for his past crimes arose because victims of his regime brought a case in Belgium under its universal jurisdiction legislation in 2001. Belgium issued a request to Senegal for Habre&#39;s extradition to stand trial. However, in 2005, a judge in Senegal determined that Senegalese courts were not competent to rule on the extradition request.<br /><br />The President of Senegal then indicated that he did not wish to send Habre to Belgium, and some African nations supported that, viewing the Belgian request as &quot;neocolonial&quot; and insisting that only an African court could try an African leader. This stance is in line with recent statements by Habre&#39;s attorney, El-Hadj Diouf, rejecting a Belgian trial: &quot;Belgium is a colonialist. Belgium created a genocide in Rwanda and Congo. Belgium cannot accuse an African man, it is the new colonization. Why Belgium? Hissein Habre is a Chadian.&quot; Such assertions resonate in much of post-colonial Africa, although they do not explain why the courts of Senegal could not or would not try Habre themselves, as required by the UN Convention Against Torture (CAT), to which Senegal is a party.<br /><br />The challenge of Hissene Habre is not a novel one. He is not the first African to face trial in Europe for war crimes, crimes against humanity, or torture, nor will he be the last. The worries of Africans about controlling their own fate, and the guilt of their former colonizers, are very real.<br /><br />But so are the legal requirements that certain crimes be tried, no matter where they occurred. It is partly for this reason that the African solution of the Special Court for Sierra Leone was nuanced by the recent transfer of Charles Taylor to The Hague. He still faces a partially African court, but in a European venue. The move was not one of colonization, but of pragmatism: if he didn&#39;t face trial outside the region he had so decimated, it was feared, he might not face a functional trial at all. Similarly, the dilemma of Habre was for some time not that of African trial vs. European trial, but of trial elsewhere vs. no trial at all.<br /><br />Following international pressure on Senegal, the AU set up a panel of experts to consider the situation. In May, the Committee Against Torture, set up to monitor the CAT, issued a statement giving Senegal 90 days to try or extradite Habre, and indicating that the country was in violation of its obligations under the CAT for not having dealt with Habre&#39;s past abuses during the 15 years he spent in exile there. <br /><br />The AU panel indicated not only that Habre must be tried, and could indeed be tried in several African venues, whether Chad, Senegal, an ad hoc tribunal, or any other African nation that has ratified the CAT, but also indicated that Senegal would be the most suitable location for a trial. Further, contrary to the finding of the earlier Senegalese ruling that courts of that nation did not have competence to even rule on the extradition request, the AU experts found that Senegal not only had jurisdiction over the case, but an obligation to act in accord with its duties under the CAT.<br /><br />The AU panel&#39;s contradiction of the Senegalese judge regarding competence might seem like a technicality, but it highlights a potentially serious problem. Senegalese courts may be the most appropriate venue to try Habre, but they have evinced a distinct aversion to doing so. The evasion by the judge in 2005 was only the latest example. A case had previously been brought in Senegal against Habre through the exercise of universal jurisdiction, in 2000. Habre was placed under house arrest, and the case proceeded, briefly.<br /><br />However, following apparent interference by politicians, the country&#39;s highest court ruled in 2001 that Senegalese courts could not hear a case involving crimes outside the country, and the Senegalese President even suggested that Habre could be sent to any country, such as Belgium, interested in trying him. While it is to be hoped that Senegalese courts are now more immune to political pressure, and interested in implementing the country&#39;s obligations under the CAT, the 2005 judicial decision on competence suggests the opposite. <br /><br />It remains to be seen whether Senegal will now fulfill its obligations under the CAT, as articulated by the Committee Against Torture and the AU Panel.<br /><br />President Wade&#39;s announcement holds out the promise of  a trial in Senegal, perhaps through the creation of a special court in the country with wider African jurisdiction, and in collaboration with Chadian authorities. If that promise is fulfilled, then the idea of an African solution might at long last be vindicated, but if not, one can only hope that one of the other venues identified by the AU Panel will be utilized. However, Senegal has avoided trying Habre for over 15 years, so some skepticism may be warranted. If no steps are taken, and no African solution emerges, allegations of neocolonialism should not deter considerations of trying Habre elsewhere in the world.<br /><br />Of course, there is potentially a more positive interpretation of these<br />events: that the recommendation and President Wade&#39;s announcement constitute a real break with the past on a continent where countries routinely elevate sovereignty above examination of internal abuses. If so, then the AU decision itself is a sort of African solution to an endemic African problem: impunity of sitting and former leaders.<br /><br /><br /><em>Professor Chandra Lekha Sriram is Chair in Human Rights and Director of the Centre on Human Rights in Conflict at the University of East London School of Law, and is currently conducting research in Sudan on that country&#39;s Comprehensive Peace Agreement.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=35">Nancy Rapoport</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that the sudden death of Enron founder Kenneth Lay before he was even sentenced has a variety of legal implications, but its greatest consequence may be the loss of any opportunity for his redemption by appeal or rehabilitation...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/nancyrapoport.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>t&#39;s safe to say that Houston was stunned to hear of Ken Lay's death, one day after Independence Day.  I heard about it around 9:15 a.m., and by that time, the whole network of Enron news junkies was abuzz.  So far, two Enron executives have died since the collapse of the company:  Cliff Baxter's death (ruled a suicide) was first, on January 25, 2002.<blockquote>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br />And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br />Do not go gentle into that good night.[<a href="#1">1</a>]</blockquote>Did Lay go gentle into that good night?  Was his death a suicide?  The autopsy results say no, although the gossip here in Houston is that Lay had stopped taking his heart medication and then headed off to the thin air of Aspen, expecting the (inevitable?) result.    <br /><br /> Imagine what it must have been like for the Lays &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; they were back in Aspen, where they had once owned several houses, surrounded by people who likely were still wealthy, wondering whether they would be accepted in others' Aspen homes, and facing the possibility of life in prison.  Lay, who had been considered affable and avuncular for most of his life, had been convicted in part because the trial revealed another side of his persona &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; an arrogant, nasty side (even during Lay's direct examination).  Now the days of influence and ease were at an end.  If it is ever found that Lay did hasten his own death, would it really be that surprising?  Suicides are always tragedies for the survivors, and death is always hard for the families and friends of the deceased.  But what are the other aftereffects of Lay's death?<br /><br /> <u>The criminal case</u>.  I'm no criminal law expert, but a quick scan of treatises tells me that the conviction (which Lay had planned to appeal) goes away, the prosecutors' forfeiture motion withers on the vine, and Skilling's case progresses as before, with October 23 still being the revised target date for the sentencing.[<a href="#2">2</a>]  Given that the traditional rationales for punishment (e.g., deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation) don't make much sense when the defendant is dead, unwinding the whole shebang makes sense.  <br /><br /> <u>The civil case</u>.  It goes forward, of course, and if the plaintiffs win, then they will look to the Lay estate for satisfaction of the award, which leads us to . . . <br /><br /> <u>Linda Lay's assets</u>.  If I were Mrs. Lay, I'd be very, very worried about creditors getting their hands on my assets, and I'd think long and hard about the possibility of filing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy to avoid any piecemeal attachments of assets.  Although her husband would have had a difficult time homesteading their condo in Houston, thanks to one of the 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code [<a href="#3">3</a>], Mrs. Lay probably can take advantage of Texas's generous homestead exemptions.<br /><br /> <u>The lost opportunity for redemption</u>.  With his death coming so soon after his conviction, Lay never had a chance to progress through his appeal, and from there, either to vindication or to possible rehabilitation while serving his time.  His death freezes his iconic image as corporate villain, even though other similarly vilified corporate miscreants have overcome (at least, to some degree) their sullied reputations.  Mike Milken is one such example:<br /><br /> Take a look at this snippet from BUSINESSWEEK ONLINE:<blockquote>As far as Milken is concerned, he has paid his penalties&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;a total of $1.1 billion&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and done his time. But that doesn&#39;t mean he has faded from the scene. Far from it. For the past six years, Milken has used every waking moment to rebuild his life and his reputation. First, he became a major cancer philanthropist, raising some $75 million for research and appearing regularly on such TV programs as Larry King Live and The Charlie Rose Show to push efforts to cure prostate cancer. And since 1996, he&#39;s moved back into business in a big way, founding Knowledge Universe (KU), a new venture that he hopes to build into a huge presence in the $800 billion educational-services industry. Together, his twin pursuits have given Milken a new platform from which, on his own terms, he is once again a player.[<a href="#6">6</a>]</blockquote>Milken for sure; maybe Martha Stewart as well, in time.  Who knows what Lay would have done in prison?  With his doctorate in economics, he certainly could have worked to help educate other inmates.  He could have written books.[<a href="#7">7</a>]  He could have come to terms with his own rise and fall.  He might even have come to accept his own part in Enron's downfall.  All of those options are gone now, ended at 3:11 a.m. Aspen time on July 5, 2006.  <br /><br /> Lay was the son of a preacher, and as such, he was probably well-versed in all of the traditional themes of Christianity, including sin and redemption.   Maybe he was familiar with Dylan Thomas's earlier poem about death:<blockquote>And death shall have no dominion.<br />No more may gulls cry at their ears<br />Or waves break loud on the seashores;<br />Where blew a flower may a flower no more<br />Lift its head to the blows of the rain;<br />Though they be mad and dead as nails,<br />Heads of the characters hammer through daisies;<br />Break in the sun till the sun breaks down, <br />And death shall have no dominion.[<a href="#8">8</a>]</blockquote> Most of us see Enron's demise as part of a classic Greek tragedy with Lay and Skilling both the traditional protagonists, with great potential thwarted by hubris.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hofstra.edu/Academics/Law/law_efreedman.cfm">Eric M. Freedman</a> of Hofstra University School of Law says that the US Supreme Court&#39;s 5-4 ruling in  <em>Hudson v. Michigan</em> is a warning that the Fourth Amendment may be on the verge of a judicial trivialization contrary to the interests of democracy...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/ericfreedman.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>here is a widely-circulated poster which viewed from a certain angle depicts a young woman with black hair and from another an old woman with white hair.<br /><br /> That is a good metaphor for the Supreme Court's 5-4 opinion last month in <em>Hudson v. Michigan</em>, the "no-knock" case.  As the Court explained, this involved a conceded violation of the centuries-old rule that before making a forcible entry "law enforcement officers must announce their presence and provide residents an opportunity to open the door."<br /><br />  On one view the issue presented was relatively narrow: whether the defendant was entitled to the remedy of suppression of the evidence seized by the officers.<br /><br /> From that perspective, <em>Hudson</em>'s rejection of suppression was regrettable but represented just another one in a dreary litany of cases in which the Court's focus on what Justice Scalia described as the high social costs of  "setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large" have led it to forget that the Fourth Amendment rights of everyone can only be vindicated by convicted defendants because, realistically, only they have the standing and incentive to pursue such claims. <br /><br /> On a second view, as Justice Breyer rightly warned for the dissent, the decision could be seen as a broad assault on our centuries-old understanding that the "right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects" is critical to a vibrant and productive society of free individuals.<br /><br /> Consider John and Cathy Smith of Anytown, Kansas.  Neither they nor any of their four children has ever had the slightest contact with the criminal justice system.  Indeed, all of them are model citizens.<br /><br /> Their oldest son, John, Jr., is a graduate student at the University of Kansas.  He is diligently researching a doctoral thesis demonstrating that today's militant Islamists have hijacked a noble tradition and misquoted and perverted religious texts to justify atrocities contrary to the genuine teachings of Islam.<br /><br /> The second child, Mary, is also a graduate student at the University of Kansas.  She is in the chemistry department and pursuing a set of experiments that she hopes will eventually result in improved fertilizers.  As she brainstorms, she trades ideas frequently by mail, telephone, and e-mail with her younger sister Susie, who, while working for the Peace Corps on a rice farm in the Philippines, provides many suggestions for improved formulations.<br /><br /> The youngest Smith child, Bill, is in high school and still living at home with his parents.  He hopes to go to business school some day and currently spends most of his spare time on his computer trying to create a secure on-line payment system that will enable people to conduct internet transactions paperlessly, conveniently and privately.<br /><br /> Each of these activities exemplifies the sort of forward-looking thinking that our society should encourage.  None of them is criminal or even remotely close to being criminal.  But all of them could easily be misconstrued by the authorities.  Of course, the suspicions would be unjustified.  But unlike Justice Scalia, who will certainly be treated with the utmost deference by any law enforcement agent whom he should happen to encounter, many ordinary people living in the real world find less than complete comfort in the thought that "the innocent have nothing to fear."<br /><br /> If the Smith children decided that the path of prudence was to avoid the possible need to explain themselves to the government and therefore inhibited their free-wheeling explorations our core values would be at risk.<br /><br /> A country in which the door may be burst down at any time by Redcoats, SS officers, or KGB agents is a country whose potential is stifled because the average person is discouraged from dreaming of how it might become better.<br /><br /> Restrictions on the police are not designed simply to prevent damage to the door or even to forestall violations of what Justice Scalia dismissively described as "the right not to be intruded upon in one's nightclothes."<br /><br />Most fundamentally, a democracy limits law enforcement tactics because, as Justice Brandeis said in <em>Whitney v. California</em>, "the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people" under a government whose laws "discourage thought, hope and imagination" by people like the Smiths. <br /><br /> Fortunately for all of us, in providing the critical fifth vote for the result in <em>Hudson</em> Justice Kennedy made very clear that he saw the case as a narrow one.  "Today's decision," he wrote in concurrence, "determines only that in the specific context of the knock-and-announce requirement, a violation is not sufficiently related to the later discovery of evidence to justify suppression."<br /><br /> Justice Kennedy squarely and correctly disclaimed the plurality's monocular focus on the needs of law enforcement.  Violations of the knock-and-announce rule are not "trivial or beyond the law's concern," because the "requirement protects rights and expectations linked to ancient principles in our constitutional order."<br /><br /> So indeed it does.  But <em>Hudson</em> is a warning knock on the door.  If the Court follows Justice Scalia's path and trivializes the Fourth Amendment as merely "a get-out-of-jail-free card" for criminals every one of us will pay the cost. <br />    <br /><br /><em>Eric M. Freedman is the Maurice A. Deane Distinguished Professor of Constitutional Law at Hofstra Law School</em><br />

		<title>Searching Congress: A Fabricated Constitutional Crisis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.bancroftassociates.net/prof_wkeefer.htm">Wendy J. Keefer</a>, former senior counsel and chief of staff in the US Department of Justice Office of Legal Policy and now with Bancroft Associates in Washington DC, says that claims of a constitutional crisis arising out the recent FBI search of the Capitol Hill office of Rep. William J. Jefferson (D-LA) are exaggerated...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wendykeefer.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>F</strong></font>ollowing an FBI search of Congressman William J. Jefferson's Capitol Hill office in connection with an ongoing criminal bribery investigation, a firestorm has ignited in which members of Congress are now claiming violations of the Speech and Debate Clause and the separation of powers principles of the US Constitution.  But is this really a constitutional crisis?  <br /><br />Members of Congress must not be permitted to pervert the Constitution into a right to conceal evidence of criminal activity in their congressional offices with impunity.  The search at issue was conducted in compliance with the Constitution, including the constitutional provisions invoked by critics.  <br /><br />Where the charge being investigated is clearly a felony and the immunity provided in the Speech and Debate Clause is merely from arrest and questioning under certain circumstances, the claimed applicability of this provision is mysterious:<blockquote>They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.</blockquote>U.S. Const. art. I, &Acirc;&#167; 6.  In the case of Congressman Jefferson, no arrest occurred.  Even if it had, the arrest would have been for a felony and thus not subject to this provision.  The only possible claim of applicability would relate to whether somehow the search of a congressional office constitutes questioning of the member on a speech or debate.  Despite the facial absurdity of such an argument, those publicly condemning the search cloaked themselves in it.  Not surprisingly, most of the voices were those of current or former congressmen.  But, the investigation and resulting search warrant have no connection to any legislative process.<br /><br />The search warrant was instead part of a routine criminal investigation.  On May 18, a special agent with the FBI applied to a court for a search warrant of Jefferson's office.  The warrant application was supported by an 83 page affidavit that detailed, among other things, taped conversations between a confidential informant and Congressman Jefferson.  The special agent making the application has been employed in this capacity since 1996 &#8212; hardly a rogue politico seeking to usurp congressional powers.  And the warrant application was, as it should be, pursuant to the appropriate constitutional provision, reviewed by a court to determine if probable cause existed for issuance of the warrant.<br /><br />In fact, special precautions were taken precisely because a congressman and his office were at issue.  Agents not before involved in the investigation conducted the search.  A "filter team," including lawyers, reviewed the documents retrieved to identify any truly privileged &#8212; legislative &#8212; materials.  Even under these circumstances, where the Speech and Debate Clause provides no protection from criminal investigation, Congress &#8212; namely, Congressman Jefferson &#8212; were provided additional, unnecessary safeguards.  <br /><br />Invoking the Speech and Debate Clause under these circumstances runs afoul of the intent of that clause.  The protection afforded is for acts done as part of the legislative process &#8212; it protects legislators engaged in legislative acts, thereby preventing intimidation from the other two branches and permitting free and open discussion of policy issues.  It does not, and is not intended, to shield legislators from searches, seizures, arrests and prosecutions of materials and for conduct that is indisputably criminal.  <br /><br />In any case, any evidence obtained during such a search that is properly subject to the protections of the Speech and Debate Clause will not be permitted to be introduced during any prosecution of Congressman Jefferson.  Interpreting the protections afforded by this constitutional protection, courts have determined introduction of such evidence would amount to "questioning" the congressional member concerning a speech or debate in the member's House.  To date, however, none of those crying foul have identified any document or item seized that is actually entitled to protection under the Speech and Debate Clause.  Instead, in what amounts to a disturbing attempt to create a place for themselves above the very laws they enact, several members of Congress demanded the return of all items seized.<br /><br />If charged with a crime, a jury will determine the guilt or innocence of Congressman Jefferson.  No doubt, the evidence submitted to that jury should exclude any materials appropriately protected by the Speech and Debate Clause.  But where probable cause existed for evidentiary searches, particularly where the type of evidence sought is so wholly unrelated to the Congressman's legislative acts, the Speech and Debate Clause does not stand in the way.  <br /><br />Similarly, the conduct of a routine investigation, even when the target is a member of Congress, does not violate separation of powers principles.  Indeed, both the Executive and Judicial Branches served their intended role in this situation.  It is only Congress that seems uncomfortable with the fact that they may be subject to the same Fourth Amendment search and seizure principles as the rest of us when acting outside their legislative roles.  Simply having a legislative office does not make anything contained within it legislative and worthy of special privilege.<br /><br />A constitutional crisis?  Only if the Executive Branch is bullied into returning documents that were lawfully seized.  Merely invoking the phrases "Speech and Debate" and "separation of powers" cannot be permitted to undermine a legitimate criminal investigation.  The Executive Branch is constitutionally tasked with enforcing our laws.  If that branch is prevented from performing this task because the target of enforcement is a legislator, that is when a legitimate constitutional crisis emerges:  we would be allowing Congress unjustified immunity from fair and just enforcement of the law.<br /><br />Congressman Jefferson could have prevented the search had he simply complied with a subpoena issued to him last year.  Instead, he refused to comply, leaving investigators with only two choices:  (1) seek court approval to search for the documents, including a search of his office, or (2) provide special treatment to members of Congress by providing a de facto depository for evidence of crime.  The first was a proper execution of the law.  The last would have been a real constitutional crisis.<br />  <br /><br /><em>Wendy J. Keefer is a lawyer with Bancroft Associates in Washington DC.

The allegations are shocking. They include <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/toronto-bomb-plot/index.html">claims</a> that the men tried to purchase three tons of ammonium nitrate to use in truck bombs and that they trained to prepare for terrorism north of Toronto.<br />  <br />The arrests followed an extensive two year investigation by the combined forces of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and various police services in the Toronto area. All of these organizations are represented in an Integrated National Security Enforcement Team created in 2002. <br /> <br />  The men have been <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/terrorism/crownahmad60506inf2.html">charged</a> with a variety of crimes under the <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Lang=E&Chamber=N&StartList=A&EndList=Z&Session=9&Type=0&Scope=I&query=2981&List=toc-1">Anti-Terrorism Act</a> that was added with considerable controversy to Canada's Criminal Code in late 2001.  Only one other person, Mohammad Momin Khawaja, has been charged under the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/toronto-bomb-plot/anti-terrorism-act.html">new law</a>.  He was charged in March, 2004 and his trial has yet to be held. The result is that the new Anti-Terrorism Act remains untested.<br /><br />Prior to these charges, Canada had mainly used immigration law powers against suspected terrorists, including five non-citizens suspected of terrorism. Canadian authorities had used an <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/I-2.5/index.html">immigration law</a> procedure known as a security certificate which can apply to non-citizens if there are reasonable grounds to believe they were a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in terrorism and prohibits disclosure of information to the detainee that would injure national security or the safety of any person.  The seventeen persons, mainly teens and those in the early twenties, charged in Toronto, however, mainly grew up in Canada and most are Canadian citizens, so the immigration law approach was not an option that could be used. <br /><br />All twelve adults face charges under <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/chambus/house/bills/government/C-36/C-36_4/C-36_cover-e.html">s.83.18(1)</a> of the Criminal Code which makes it a crime punishable for up to ten years to knowingly participate in or contribute to any activity of a terrorist group for the purpose of enhancing the ability of any terrorist group to carry out a terrorist activity. This crime was created as an alternative to crimes of membership in a terrorist organization that exist in the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions. The fact that this crime was charged against all the suspects suggests that the participation crime might be used in Canada as the functional equivalent to the American crime of providing material support for terrorism. <br /><br /> The participation offence is defined broadly under s.83.18(3) of the Criminal Code to include both providing and receiving training and also recruiting a person to receive training and offering to provide training. At the same time, the prosecution has a double intent requirement that requires proof of 1) knowing participation in the terrorist group and 2) acting for the purpose of enhancing the ability of any terrorist group to carry out a terrorist activity. <br /><br /> Terrorist activities are defined under <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/chambus/house/bills/government/C-36/C-36_4/C-36_cover-e.html">s.83.01</a> of the Criminal Code to include the intentional causing of death or serious bodily harm by violence, the intentional endangering of life and the intentional causing of substantial property damage that is likely to cause death, serious bodily harm or endanger life.<br /><br />Importantly, a terrorist activity includes a conspiracy, attempt, threat or counselling of any action that if completed would constitute a terrorist activity. In this way, people can be guilty of terrorist activities that involve threats, attempts, conspiracy or counselling, but not the actual commission of an act of terrorism. In essence, the definition of terrorist activities incorporates other inchoate offences in the Criminal Code.<br /><br />In addition, a terrorist activity must be committed for a political, religious or ideological purpose and done with the intention of intimidating the public with regard to its security or compelling a person, government or organization to act. This will require the prosecution to introduce and prove evidence about the religious or political motives of the accused, all of whom are Muslim. This will require the judge to admit evidence about the accused's politics and religion regardless of the prejudicial effect it may have on the jury.<br /><br />In determining whether an accused has participated or contributed to a terrorist group, the court under section 83.18(4) may also consider a variety of factors including the use of a name or symbol associated with a terrorist group, frequent association with any person in a terrorist group, receipt of a benefit from the terrorist group or repeatedly engaging in activities at the instruction of the terrorist group.<br /> <br /> Finally, a terrorist group is defined either as an entity that has been listed by the government or as an entity that has the facilitating or carrying out of terrorist activities as one of  its purposes or activities under s.83.01 of the Criminal Code. There are no reported links between the accused and listed terrorist groups so the government may have to prove the existence of a terrorist group.<br /><br /> Should the accused elect trial by jury, the jury charge on the participation offence will be quite complex and require the prosecutor to prove various forms of intent and participation both in relation to the offences and the included and complex concepts of a terrorist activity and a terrorist group. <br /><br /> Two of the men arrested, including one who is a landed immigrant from Somalia, were already in prison serving two year sentences for attempting to smuggle firearms into Canada from the United States.  Some of the men also face charges of providing prohibited weapons as a form of property with the intent or knowledge that they be used to facilitate or carry out a terrorist activity or knowing that they will be used or will benefit a terrorist group. As with the participation charge, the providing property offences under s.83.03 of the Criminal Code incorporate the definition of terrorist activities and terrorist groups under s.83.01 and this offence also carries a maximum of ten years imprisonment.<br /><br />Finally, some of the men, including the alleged ringleader, face explosive and importing weapons offences that have been charged under s.83.2 of the Criminal Code which provides a separate offence of committing an indictable offence for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a terrorist group. This offence is significant because it is subject to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. <br /><br /> The prosecutors have decided to test the new Anti-Terrorism Act with these arrests and charges. Both the s
.83.03 providing property and the s. 83.18 participation offence could be challenged under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms on grounds of vagueness and overbreadth, but Canadian courts have upheld the vast majority of laws challenged on this basis. These offences should also survive Charter scrutiny because of its clear intent requirement.<br /><br /> The section 83.2 offence could be challenged on the basis that it does not on its face require intent beyond the intent required for the underlying explosive and weapons offence. The accused could argue that because of the stigma and punishment of this terrorism offence that the prosecutor should have to establish that the accused intentionally or knowingly committed the offence for purposes of terrorism and point to cases that have required such fault levels for murder and war crimes. The prosecutor could argue that the offence does not require such a high level of fault and point to other cases in which the courts have not required fault in relation to all elements of the offence.<br /><br /> It is also possible that the accused could raise an entrapment defence in relation to a reported controlled purchase of ammonium nitrate, but they would have to establish either that the police did not have a reasonable suspicion that they were engaged in criminal activity or were not conducting a bona fide inquiry when they offered the accused an opportunity to commit a crime or that the police actually induced the commission of the crime. On the known facts, an entrapment defence seems unlikely to succeed.<br /><br /> The case may not raise the issue of whether electronic surveillance conducted by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service or the Communications Security Establishment is admissible in a criminal trial because the RCMP was brought into the case in November 2004 and the crimes are alleged to occur in 2005 and 2006. In other words, electronic surveillance conducted in this case was likely authorized by a judge on reasonable grounds under the Criminal Code. If security intelligence intercepts were used, however, this will raise the question of whether electronic surveillance that was not obtained under a warrant issued on probable cause is admissible in a criminal trial.<br /> <br /> It is not known whether the accused have been subject to interrogation or have made statements. Any statements provided to the police could be challenged on grounds that they were involuntary or that the accused had not been provided a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel. There are extra requirements under section 146 of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/Y-1.5/index.html">Youth Criminal Justice Act</a> with respect to the admissibility of any statements taken from the five suspects who are under eighteen years of age. Lawyers for the accused have raised concerns about lack of access to their clients and detention conditions.<br /><br /> Another factor in the prosecution may be the accused's right to disclosure of all relevant evidence in the possession of the police. In the 1990's, one terrorism prosecution was stopped in Canada after the courts held that the accused were <a href="http://www.cardozolawreview.com/PastIssues/ROACH.WEBSITE.PDF">entitled to disclosure of the identity of a key informer</a>.<br />  <br /> The Attorney General of Canada who is prosecuting the case can oppose the disclosure of evidence on the basis that its disclosure would be injurious to international relations, national defence or national security. Such issues will not be decided by the trial judge but rather in the Federal Court of Canada which can balance the public interest in disclosure and non-disclosure and can prohibit or place conditions on disclosure. The Attorney General of Canada can also issue a certificate to block disclosure even if disclosure is authorized by the Federal Court. <br /><br />Any restrictions on disclosure,  however, will eventually return to the trial judge who under s.38.14 of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/c-5/232055.html">Canada Evidence Act</a> can make any order he or she consider necessary to protect the rights of the accused to a fair trial so long as it respects the restrictions that either the Federal Court or the Attorney General has placed on disclosure. This order can include a stay of proceedings.<br /><br /> The prosecution process will likely be long and challenging. Canadian courts have traditionally been much more willing to issue publication bans especially on pre-trial proceedings where there may be a jury than American courts. Little is known about the one other prosecution under the Anti-Terrorism Act that was started with an arrest in March, 2004 but with no trial scheduled until January 2007, and defence lawyers have raised concerns about the adequacy of disclosure and have recently announced they will challenge the offences under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The resolution of the Toronto arrests are not likely to be known for some time.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Kent Roach is a professor at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law and the author of </em><a href="http://www.mqup.mcgill.ca/book.php?bookid=1599">September 11: Consequences for Canada</a><em></em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.ijdh.org/">Brian Concannon Jr.</a>, Director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, says that although the return to Haiti of ousted former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide is legally and constitutionally permissible, a double standard in the international community still blocks his way home...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/concannon.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>S</strong></font>ay "<em>the return</em>" when discussing Haiti, and people who follow events in the country know you are talking about former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide returning from his exile in South Africa. Aristide was ousted in a coup d'etat in February 2004, and flown, against his will, in a U.S. government plane to the Central African Republic. He settled in South Africa, at the government's invitation, but has always said he will return to Haiti when the conditions are right.<br /><br />The conditions are getting closer to right, although Aristide would now return as a private citizen. President Ren&Atilde;&copy; Preval was elected on February 7 and inaugurated on May 14, 2006. His Ministers were ratified by Parliament on June 7, replacing the brutal and unconstitutional Interim Government that had ruled since the coup. Haiti's Constitution limits presidents to two non-consecutive terms, and President Aristide's second term ended in February.<br /><br />The prospect of President Aristide's return generates passionate reactions, both for and against, in Haiti, but also in Washington and other world capitals. <em>The return</em> is usually debated in terms of President Aristide's likely role in Haitian politics, but the controversy raises two important questions beyond politics - what right does everyone have to weigh in on a private Haitian citizen's decision to live inside the country or out? And what does the controversy say about the much broader issue of <em>return</em> - of the return of full democracy and sovereignty to Haiti.<br /><br />Haiti's new President, Ren&Atilde;&copy; Preval, is asked about <em>the return</em> incessantly by the foreign press, and he gives a simple answer: no one besides President Aristide has the right to determine when and if he returns to Haiti. Article 41 of Haiti's Constitution declares that "no individual of Haitian nationality can be deported or forced to leave the country for any reason whatsoever." Article 41-1 adds that "no Haitian needs a visa to leave the country or to return to it." As a legal matter, therefore, the government has nothing to say about any citizen's return. President Preval has responded that Articles 41 and 41-1 govern his actions, and that he intends to comply with them and with all the articles of Haiti&#39;s Constitution. <br /><br />Several commentators have mentioned that President Aristide would have to face any legal action against him if he returns to Haiti, or if he goes to the U.S. That is true of any citizen, but is independent of the right to come home. Moreover, although the foreign press has reported extensively on criminal investigations against President Aristide in both Haiti and the U.S., there are no criminal charges against him in either country. The Interim Government and its allies made many serious accusations of criminal activity against President Aristide to the press, but not a single one to the Haitian justice system. Haitian authorities did file a civil complaint against Mr. Aristide and several others in a federal court in Miami. They launched an impressive public relations campaign, including press conferences, Washington briefings and seminars. But they did not actually pursue the case in court - seven months after filing the complaint (the first step) not a single defendant has been served (the second step, usually done immediately). A U.S. Grand Jury has spent two years investigating drug trafficking and money laundering between Port-au-Prince and Miami, and although the "smoking gun" against President Aristide has been announced several times in the press, not a single charge has issued from the courthouse.<br /><br />Articles 41 and 41-1 should dispose of the discussion of <em>the return</em>, but once again Haiti's Constitution is not allowed the last word. The countries that used their financial and military clout to remove President Aristide back in 2004 - the U.S., Canada and France - are now using their diplomatic clout to keep him out. The U.S., once again, is taking the lead, with its trademark faithfulness to a consistent sound bite. Before the votes from the February 7 Presidential elections had even arrived at election headquarters, Acting U.S. Ambassador Tim Carney predicted that the election "is going to demonstrate....how Jean Bertrand Aristide <em>is a man of the past</em>.&quot; Later that week, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters that Aristide "is in South Africa, and I would expect that he would stay there,&quot; and that "we think the Haitian government should be looking forward to their future, <em>not to its past</em>.&quot;  Deputy State Department Spokesman Adam Ereli added: "our understanding is that the government of Haiti is looking forward, not looking back. They've got a democracy to build, and the <em>future is not in the past</em>. Aristide <em>is from the past</em>" (all italics supplied).<br /><br />This message was echoed far beyond the Bush Administration. Former Assistant Secretary of State Roger Noriega declared that for Preval, Aristide&#39;s return &quot;would be the end of his ability to run the country.&quot; Lawrence Pezzullo, President Clinton's special envoy to Haiti warned &quot;if [Preval] brings Aristide back, that thing will blow up.&quot; The International Crisis Group added that Aristide's return "would be a very polarizing and divisive event that could fatally damage the effort to move Haiti forward.&#39;&#39;  None of these experts even mentioned that it was Aristide&#39;s removal in 2004 that led to unprecedented violence - thousands of deaths - not to mention the reversal of ten years' hard won democratic progress.<br /><br />France's Minister for Cooperation and Development, Brigitte Girardin, visited South Africa in April, and opposing Aristide's return was high on her agenda for discussions with Foreign Minister Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. Canada, France, and even some South American countries buttonholed South African President Thabo Mbeki when he went to Chile for President Michelle Bachelet's March inauguration, to tell him not to allow Aristide's return. <br /><br />The fact that such a broad spectrum of non-Haitian officials and commentators feel they can pressure Haiti's government to deprive a citizen of his Constitutional right to live in his homeland raises the second question: how much has democracy actually returned to Haiti, and how much democracy will the international community allow?  <br /><br />There are few, if any, precedents of the world's powerful countries keeping a former elected President out of his own country, but that level of interference is routine for Haiti. On February 17, 2004, as insurgents took over cities in the north of Haiti, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell reaffirmed that President Aristide was Haiti's constitutional President, and announced that the U.S. "cannot buy into a proposition that says the elected President must be forced out of office by thugs and those who do not respect law and are bringing terrible violence to the Haitian people." But twelve days later, Mr. Powell's State Department forced President Aristide onto a plane, delivering Haiti to thugs who brought terrible violence to the Haitian people. The United Nations, with a Charter proclaiming "respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples," declined the elected government's request for help before the coup. But with
in a few hours of President Aristide's departure (on a Sunday morning), the UN Security Council had authorized a military mission to Haiti, not to restore the Constitutional authorities, but to consolidate their overthrow. The Organization of American States, which had a newly-minted Inter-American Democratic Charter designed to respond to threats against the democratic order of member states, never once criticized the coup.<br /><br />If Haiti's former President has trouble travelling into Haiti, its current Prime Minister, Jacques-Edouard Alexis has trouble travelling out. Canada announced in early May that he was barred from the country because his name is on a list of people accused of "crimes against humanity."  The Canadian government admits it has no specific evidence against Mr. Alexis. It makes vague reference to the <em>Carrefour Feuilles</em> massacre, a police killing of suspected gang members during Mr. Alexis' previous tenure. Ironically, Mr. Alexis' government aggressively prosecuted that massacre - several top police officials were convicted of murder and imprisoned - and the UN and human rights groups hailed the prosecution as a major step in fighting large-scale human rights violations. Canada claims to be sorry and to be looking into the matter, but a month after the issue was first raised, Mr. Alexis' name is still on the list.<br /><br />Imagining analogous treatment among the world's powerful countries is difficult: England's Prime Minister Tony Blair pressuring President Bush to restrict former Vice-President Gore's anti-war speeches, because he "<em>is a man of the past</em>." Or the U.S. Ambassador to France warning against the "<em>divisive</em>" socialist Parliamentarians who called for a vote of no-confidence against the French government last month.  In Canada, lawyers and human rights groups did present extensive evidence of George Bush's responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity ahead of his December 2004 visit. Of course the Canadian government declined to invoke the same immigration bars it invoked against Mr. Alexis, despite the ample evidence for Mr. Bush, and the lack of any for Mr. Alexis.<br /><br />Haitians have a marketplace expression for double standard - <em>de pwa, de mezi</em>  (literally "two weights, two measures"), that gets frequent use in discussions about the international community's treatment of their country. Haitians with varying levels of approval for President Aristide's tenure in office agree that his forced exile is yet another example of <em>de pwa de mezi</em> - powerful countries that preach respect for human rights and national sovereignty declining to apply those principles to their weak country. So for them, President Aristide's physical return is one part of a broader return of Haiti to a complete democracy, and to a sovereignty respected by the rest of the world. In this broader return, there would be no more need to argue about a former President coming home, any more than there is in the rest of the world. <br /><br /><br /><em>Human rights lawyer Brian Concannon Jr. directs the Institute for Justice &amp; Democracy in Haiti, <a href="http://www.ijdh.org">www.ijdh.org</a></em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/concannon.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='70' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist and British human and medical rights activist <a href="http://medweb.bham.ac.uk/http/depts/clin_neuro/djn.html">Dr. David Nicholl</a>, a neurologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, says that the recent hunger strike and now suicides by prisoners held by the US at Guantanamo Bay highlight the need to accord the detainees not just due legal process, but also ethical medical treatment...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidnicholl.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he ongoing detention without trial of over 400 individuals in the US base at Guantanamo Bay has rightly been decried as an ongoing human rights scandal by everyone from Amnesty International to the <a href="http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=42763">Vatican</a>. The recent hunger strike and now the suicides of three prisoners have however raised the issue of the medical treatment of the Guantanamo detainees.<br /><br />Recently <a href="/pdf/lancetsignatories.pdf">I and over 250 other physicians</a> [PDF] from the UK, Australia, Italy and the United States published a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/10_03_06_letter.pdf">letter</a> [PDF] in the British medical journal <em>The Lancet</em> criticising the use of forcefeeding and restraints at Guantanamo as a breach of medical ethics. We reiterated that the World Medical Association specifically prohibits forcefeeding in the Declarations of Tokyo and Malta, to which the American Medical Association is a signatory and that the doctors responsible should be held to account by their regulatory bodies. <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/16086.html">Dr. Duane Cady</a>, chair of the AMA, confirmed that the <a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/332/7545/854-c?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=guantanamo&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=relevance&resourcetype=HWCIT">AMA</a> upholds the Declaration of Tokyo. To date, however the AMA and the <a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/332/7541/569-c">Medical Boards for Georgia and California</a> have refused to take any action against the doctors involved, even though some are AMA members.<br /><br />Given this background, it would be prudent to give some background to the WMA, the <a href="http://www.wma.net/e/policy/c18.htm">Declaration of Tokyo</a> and a brief history of the treatment of hunger strikers. The <a href="http://www.wma.net/e/about/index.htm">World Medical Association</a> was set up in 1947 after the atrocities performed by Nazi doctors, and was intended to promote the highest standards of medical ethics and care by physicians at all times. The WMA now consists of over 80 national medical associations, including the AMA and the British Medical Association (BMA). <br /><br />Until the 1970s, it had been British policy to forcefeed prisoners who went on hunger strike as a life saving manoeuvre - perhaps the most famous examples of this were the <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Whunger.htm">Suffragettes</a> in the early 1900s who were campaigning for the right of women to vote. This policy changed after the death in custody of an IRA prisoner, <a href="http://irelandsown.net/gaughan.html">Michael Gaughan</a>, in 1974. Mr Gaughan died as a consequence of an aspiration pneumonia during forcefeeding. This caused widespread uproar both within and outside of Ireland. In view of this case and other aspects in relation to the torture and treatment of prisoners held in custody in Northern Ireland, the BMA and the Irish Medical Association developed the guidelines which ultimately formed the basis of the<a href="http://www.wma.net/e/history/tokio.htm"> Declaration of Tokyo</a>. This was adopted unanimously in 1975, and in over 30 years, despite some extremely difficult circumstances (eg the Irish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Sands">hunger strikes of 1980-81</a>), there have been no calls to change the Declaration of Tokyo. Why is it that this document has stood the test of time? Essentially, this boils down to the principle that a doctor's first principle is to respect the right of any patient, even a prisoner, to refuse medical treatment if they are mentally competent. This latter point is crucial as clearly a patient who is mentally ill is not competent to make a decision regarding refusal of medical treatment. One example of this is the infamous <a href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/moors/index_1.html">Moors murderer Ian Brady</a>. There is no doubt that Mr Brady committed some of the most heinous serial murders in English history for which he received 3 life sentences in 1966. Since 1985, he was detained under the Mental Health Act in a high security psychiatric hospital where he has remained ever since. In October 1999, he was forcibly moved to another room and he went on hunger strike in protest. The doctors treating him forcefed him as they did not believe he was capable of making a rational decision. The doctors' decision was upheld by judicial review in February 2000 as it was felt that forcefeeding was medical treatment within the meaning of the Mental Health Act (1983). Mr Brady has remained on hunger strike, and as a consequence has been forcefed ever since.<br /><br />Are there ever grounds for involuntary forcefeeding a mentally competent individual and does forcefeeding constitute torture? Dr <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList302/F18AA3CE47E5A98BC1256B66005D6E29">Hernan Reyes from the International Committee of the Red Cross</a> makes this quite clear in the most comprehensive article on the medical and ethical aspects of hunger strikes. Dr Reyes concludes "Doctors should never be party to actual coercive feeding, with prisoners being tied down and intravenous drips or oesophageal tubes being forced into them. Such actions can be considered a form of torture, and under no circumstances should doctors participate in them, on the pretext of "saving the hunger striker's life". Heeding the informed consent of a hunger striker, confirmed within the trust of the doctor-patient relationship, and respecting the intrinsic dignity of the fasting prisoner he is treating is certainly part of the doctor's duty in looking after the patient's welfare."<br /><br />The most famous example of a doctor respecting a hunger striker's wish is the so-called <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList302/F18AA3CE47E5A98BC1256B66005D6E29">Kalk refusal</a>. Dr John Kalk was a physician in South Africa involved in the treatment of anti-apartheid activists in the early 1980s who protested their indefinite detention without trial by going on hunger strike. The South African government became anxious at the political embarrassment of these prisoners dying so transferred them to Johannesburg Hospital. Dr Kalk refused to forcefeed the prisoners as he felt this constituted torture, and refused to return the prisoners to custody as he felt that indefinite detention without trial was torture in terms of the effects on the prisoners' mental health. Dr Kalk was interviewed about this aspect in relation to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/listenagain/ram/today5_guantanamo_20060310.ram">Guantanamo by the BBC</a> [audio] after he was a co-signatory on the recent Lancet letter.<br /><br />Thus it would appear that not only is a Guantanamo a legal black-hole, but also a black-hole of medical ethics where doctors can justify breaching informed <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/guantanamo/story/0,,1681662,00.html#article_continue">patient consent</a>, on the grounds of following orders of a "higher military authority". This was <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673606683268/fulltext">not a defence at Nuremberg</a>, and should not be used in Guantanamo.<br /><br />It
is interesting to reflect on the guidelines for medical staff treating detainees from <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/231008_060606/231008p.pdf">the Pentagon</a> [PDF] compared to that of the <a href="http://www.dmsd.mod.uk/sgpl012005.pdf">UK military</a> [PDF]. Nowhere in the Pentagon guidelines does it explicity state that detainees have the right to the same medical care as those of anyone else, under the Geneva convention and UN declarations, as well as a right to confidentiality and informed patient consent. In the case of hunger striking, this is not synonymous with attempted suicide as the Pentagon have attempted to state. Indeed as <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/57JPZP?OpenDocument&View=defaultBody&style=custo_print">Dr Reyes commented in 1998</a> "It is inappropriate to assert, however, that hunger strikers should be placed in the same category as persons intending to commit suicide. This is a simplistic approach to the issue which wrongly reduces it to purely medical terms".<br /><br />Finally the recent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5069230.stm">descriptions of the suicides of 3 inmates at Guantanamo</a> as "a good PR move" and "an act of war" by the US administration clearly shows a complete lack of insight and humanity into the medical aspects. It is vital that the prisoners in Guantanamo are allowed immediate, independent and unfettered access to outside physicians and for these results to be made public (the Red Cross have a long-standing practice of not speaking publicly, and it is not known if they have seen the forcefeeding regime). <br /><br />Outside of the medical aspects, I would concur with President Bush in his October 2005 statement that "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/10/20051028-7.html">Each individual is presumed innocent and entitled to due process and a  fair trial</a>" . However, I believe he was referring to his colleague Scooter Libby rather than the individuals being held in Guantanamo. No-one should be beyond either the law or appropriate ethical treatment.<br /><br />   <br /><br /><em>Dr David Nicholl, MBChB FRCP PhD is a consultant neurologist and honorary senior lecturer at City Hospital Hospital &amp; Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham and the University of Birmingham, England.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/clinic/Scheffer/Scheffer.html">David Scheffer</a>, former US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues (1997-2001), now at Northwestern University School of Law, says that in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> the justices of the US Supreme Court have demonstrated how fundamental tenets of international law amplify American values and are deeply embedded in American law...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidscheffer.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n a 5-3 decision on June 29th reversing the Court of Appeals (D.C. Circuit) in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>, the Supreme Court upheld the Geneva Conventions of 1949 as enforceable U.S. law.  A plurality of the justices also relied on international law to strengthen another key finding in the case.   They restored the critical partnership that international law has with federal law.  The Supreme Court justices demonstrated how fundamental tenets of international law amplify American values and are deeply embedded in U.S. law.  No other decision of the Supreme Court in recent years has so forthrightly reaffirmed American obligations under international law.<br /><br />A plurality consisting of Justices Stevens, Souter, Breyer and Ginsburg found that <a href="/forumy/2006/03/why-hamdan-is-right-about-conspiracy.php">"conspiracy" cannot be charged as a violation of the law of war</a> [David Scheffer, <em>Why Hamdan is Right About Conspiracy Liability</em>, JURIST <em>Forum</em>, March 30, 2006] and that such a charge is not triable by a military commission.  The four justices confirmed what the court had recognized in <em>Ex parte Quirin</em>, 317 U.S., at 29 (1942), namely that "commissions convened during time of war but under neither martial law nor military government may try only offenses against the law of war." The justices did not find "conspiracy" identified anywhere in U.S. law as a war crime or "in either the Geneva Conventions or the Hague Conventions&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the major treaties on the law of war."  Yet conspiracy to commit war crimes (rather than the overt acts themselves) is what Salim Ahmed Hamdan was belatedly and solely charged with by military lawyers in July 2004.  The justices cautioned that "the incremental development of common-law crimes by the judiciary is . . . all the more critical when reviewing developments that stem from military action."  The mere intention to commit a war crime that would constitute a conspiracy charge falls short of the overt acts that a military commission would have the authority under U.S. law to prosecute.  <br /><br />In a significant confirmation of the scope of the law of war that international and military lawyers have long used since the post-World War II Nuremberg trials, the plurality wrote that, "international sources confirm that the crime charged here is not a recognized violation of the law of war."  They observed that "none of the major treaties governing the law of war identifies conspiracy as a violation thereof," and that the only conspiracy charges recognized by international war crimes tribunals are conspiracy to commit genocide and conspiracy in a common plan to wage aggressive war.  They cited supporting Nuremberg precedents and two Appeals Chamber decisions of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which has adopted a "joint criminal enterprise" theory of liability as a species of liability for the substantive offense and not as a stand-alone crime.   In a footnote criticizing Justice Thomas' dissent, the four justices remarked, "That conspiracy is not a violation of the law of war triable by military commission does not mean the Government may not, for example, prosecute by court-martial or in federal court those caught 'plotting terrorist activities like the bombing of the Khobar Towers.'" <br /><br />The second international law tenet, which is found in the majority's decision, is that the procedures governing Mr. Hamdan's trial by commission violate the Geneva Conventions of 1949, of which the United States has been a state party since 1955.  The five justices, including Justice Kennedy, corrected an erroneous reading by the Court of Appeals (of the District of Columbia) of a footnote in <em>Johnson v. Eisentrager</em>, 339 U.S., at 789, n. 14 (1950) which the lower court believed meant that "the 1949 Geneva Convention does not confer on Hamdan a right to enforce its provisions in court."  415 F. 3d, at 40.  The Supreme Court found that the rights conferred on Hamdan by the Geneva Conventions are indisputedly "part of the law of war" and that Article 21 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice requires that a military commission's authority lies in compliance with the law of war.<br /><br />That conclusion permitted the majority to reach the mega-issue looming throughout the many years of the Hamdan litigation.  Does Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions apply to Hamdan's case?  The District Court had concluded yes, but the Court of Appeals, with the vote of Judge John Roberts (who now, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, had to recuse himself from the case), had concluded that Common Article 3 does not apply because al Qaeda, a terrorist organization which Mr. Hamdan is alleged to have been a member of prior to and until his capture shortly after 9/11, is not a "High Contracting Party" of the Geneva Conventions.  That is a critical view because Common Article 3 requires that in a "conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties," there are still minimum protective provisions that must be provided to "persons&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;placed hors de combat by&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;detention."  Hamdan would qualify for that designation provided Common Article 3 applies overall.  One key protective measure prohibits "the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples."  That means the military commissions must meet that standard.<br /><br />The Supreme Court found that the reading of Common Article 3 by the Court of Appeals and the Government was flawed, based on a view that it must only apply to internal conflicts, a reading long ago abandoned in international law.  The Common Article 3 conflict is one that is not between nations per se (hence, literally not inter-national), but it is a conflict that may be either internal or transnational.   The key is that the legal status of the entities opposing each other may be very divergent, namely a state vs. a rebel group.  This common article in all of the four Geneva Conventions provides blanket protection regardless of the character of the conflict.  The majority thus found that Common Article 3 applies to the Afghanistan theater of conflict and that Hamdan, captured in that country in late 2001, must be tried by a court with the judicial guarantees "recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples."  The justices also turned to the commentary on the Fourth Geneva Convention to find that a "regularly constituted court" includes "ordinary military courts," which in American practice are courts-martial.<br /><br />Finally, in a remarkable foray into customary international law, the plurality of four linked the Common Article 3 judicial guarantees to the protections described in Article 75 of the 1977 Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions.  That article was intended to amplify in greater detail the Common Article 3 guarantees and provide "fundamental guarantees" for detainees who may not earn prisoner of war status under the Third Geneva Convention.  Prior to the Bush Administration, the United States (which was deeply engaged in its drafting) viewed Article 75 as embodying cus
tomary international law, and Washington had never identified that provision as a reason for not ratifying Protocol I.   The plurality found that the various provisions of the order establishing the procedures of the military commissions "dispense with the principles, articulated in Article 75 and indisputably part of the customary international law, that an accused must, absent disruptive conduct or consent, be present for his trial and must be privy to the evidence against him."<br /><br />The majority emphasized that despite "a great degree of flexibility" afforded by Common Article 3, it still has "requirements" that must be honored.  And the military commission "convened to try Hamdan does not meet those requirements."  <br /><br />Justice Kennedy declined to join the plurality on the conspiracy and Article 75 opinions because he found enough illegality in the military commissions under U.S. law.  He also had some "observations" regarding Justice Stevens' opinion regarding Common Article 3, but he still joined it.<br /><br />It was a good day for international law, and a good day for American jurisprudence.  When the majority found that "the Executive is bound to comply with the Rule of Law that prevails in this jurisdiction," they did so with the Rule of International Law foremost in their deliberations.<br /><br /> <br /><em>David Scheffer, former US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues (1997-2001), is a law professor and director of the Center for International Human Rights at Northwestern University School of Law.

		<title>Unlikely Reformers: Egyptian Judges Challenge the Regime</title>

Street demonstrations, arrests of dissidents, attempts to form opposition coalitions &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; all the familiar signs of embryonic democratic transitions &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; have taken place, quite literally, just outside the country's high court building.  In the course of political conflict, some of Egypt's leading judges have been drawn into an increasingly risky struggle with the executive branch.  But judges are rarely revolutionaries, and Egypt's judiciary is no exception: despite the international attention their stance has attracted, the current confrontation is more likely to result in compromise than democratic breakthrough.<br /><br />The dispute began last year, when judges in Alexandria assembled to discuss an assault on one of their colleagues.  The meeting evolved into a more general discussion of the shortcomings of Egypt's current judicial structure and unanswered judicial demands for greater autonomy from the executive branch.  Egypt's judicial council &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the central structure for overseeing most judicial affairs &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; already stands out from its regional counterparts for the degree of its independence from the executive and for its impressive list of responsibilities.  But there are a variety of formal and informal ways that the executive branch still can affect judicial affairs, and some leading judges have sought to secure structural changes to minimize executive influence.<br /><br />In this quest, reforming judges found that their adversaries were not only located in the executive branch but within the judiciary.  Some judges felt that taking an overly confrontational pose would be counterproductive and indeed risked pulling judges into partisan political debates they had always sought to avoid.  Thus from the very beginning, the confrontation assumed the form not simply of a contest between branches of the state but also of a division within the judiciary.  Judges friendlier to the regime have dominated the judicial council, but the Judges Club &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a largely social body &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; has a board dominated by reformers. <br /><br />The quiet dispute among judges broke into public view when the Alexandria branch of the Judges Club audaciously linked its reform call with a threat to boycott oversight of Egypt's elections.  Under the Egyptian constitution, supervision of elections is a judicial responsibility, though it has rarely operated effectively.  A series of court challenges &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; including a landmark ruling by the country's constitutional court &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; has enhanced the judicial role.  Judges have often been ambivalent about their role in elections.  On the one hand, it stands as a marker of their neutrality.  And more prosaically, they have been paid very handsomely for the role.  But even with the recent changes, they have only been able to ensure that what takes place at the polling station meets minimal standards.  When the security forces and ruling party act brazenly outside the polls &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; by arresting opposition activists, dominating the media, and beating would-be voters &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; judges have been powerless to intervene.<br /><br />Charging that their integrity was being used cynically to support a deeply corrupt electoral system, Alexandria judges &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; later supported by their colleagues in the Cairo headquarters of the Judges Club &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; declared that they would boycott any role in the elections unless their demand for greater autonomy from the executive branch.<br /><br />There was no logical relationship between the two issues of elections and judicial independence.  Further, the election duty is assigned by the constitution, a document judges are loath to ignore.  It therefore came as no surprise that the reformist judges backed away from their threat.  But the Judges Club set up its own shadow system for monitoring and documenting electoral violations, thus keeping the conflict alive.  <br /><br />Past demands emanating from the judiciary &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; for more autonomy, better working conditions, and higher salaries &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; had been met through quiet lobbying.  Now, however, reforming judges were no longer restricting themselves to purely judicial issues.  Instead they were attacking one of the most important authoritarian tools available to the regime (such as a rigged election system); other judges challenged other aspects of Egyptian authoritarianism, including the nearly permanent state of emergency and the system of exceptional courts constructed to avoid the judiciary in politically sensitive cases.<br /><br />The regime responded harshly, bringing disciplinary action against some leading reforming judges and organizing the reformists' opponents to counter their moves.  Since these measures were internal to the judiciary, leaders from the ruling party could piously fend off opposition criticisms of the crackdown on the grounds that separation of powers required that the matter be resolved wholly within the judiciary.<br /><br />Thus, the reformist judges found themselves in a nasty conflict not simply with the regime but with their own colleagues &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and their major allies were a host of opposition movements (including the Muslim Brotherhood) that embarrassed some of the fairly staid members of the judicial profession.  But rather than try to defuse the confrontation, judicial leaders gambled that the best defense was a good offense.  By accepting the public limelight, subtly endorsing public demonstrations on their behalf, and even courting international attention, the rebel leaders suddenly found themselves at the vanguard of the drive for political reform in Egypt.<br /><br />This is not a role that comes easily to most judges and it is unlikely to last for long.  It seems quite unlikely that judges can bear the weight of hopes that the opposition has placed on their shoulders.  Their decision to embrace confrontation with the executive stems not from a calculated political strategy but instead from a mixture of impulse, moral outrage, and hope that garnering domestic support and international attention will force the regime to control its retaliatory impulses.  The core demands that initiated the confrontation &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; involving transferring responsibilities from the Ministry of Justice to the Judicial Council, selecting some Council members by election by their colleagues, and strengthening the Judges Club &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; are ones that are better seen as mild reforms rather than revolutionary change.  Despite the lofty rhetoric of some of the judges' supporters, compromise or even defeat seem far more likely outcomes than transformation of the regime.<br /><br />By escalating the confrontation, the judges have managed to stave off defeat, but they have also begun to threaten core regime interests&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and most judges privately admit that they may therefore have to find a quieter compromise than they have led their supporters to expect.<br /><br /><br /><em>Nathan J.

Even when measured in different ways, including police reports and survey interviews, the results are in agreement: there has been an 85% reduction in sexual violence in the past 25 years.  The decline, steeper than the stock market crash that led to the Great Depression, is depicted in this chart prepared by the United States Department of Justice:<p><table><tr><td><img src="/images/rapechart.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td><font SIZE=1><p>Source: U.S. Department of Justice &acirc;&#8364;&cent; Office of Justice Programs,  Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Crime Victimization Survey.

The American public is probably not ready to believe it.  My theory is that the sharp rise in access to pornography accounts for the decline in rape.  The correlation is inverse: the more pornography, the less rape.  It is like the inverse correlation: the more police officers on the street, the less crime.<br /><br /> The pornographic movie "Deep Throat" which started the flood of X-rated VHS and later DVD films, was released in 1972.  Movie rental shops at first catered primarily to the adult film trade.  Pornographic magazines also sharply increased in numbers in the 1970s and 1980s.  Then came a seismic change: pornography became available on the new internet.  Today, purveyors of internet porn earn a combined annual income exceeding the total of the major networks ABC, CBS, and NBC. <br /> <br /> "Deep Throat" has moved from the adult theatre to a laptop near you.<br /><br /> National trends are one thing; what do the figures for the states show?  From data compiled by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in 2001, the four states with the <em>lowest</em> per capita access to the internet were Arkansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, and West Virginia.  The four states with the <em>highest</em> internet access were Alaska, Colorado, New Jersey, and Washington.  (I would not have guessed this.)<br />  <br /> Next I took the figures for forcible rape compiled by police reports by the Disaster Center for the years 1980 and 2000.  The following two charts display the results:<p><br /><table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 border=1><th><tr><td colspan=4><font SIZE=2>TABLE 1.  STATES WITH LOWEST INTERNET ACCESS [<a href="#2">2</a>]</font></td></tr></th><tb><tr><td><font SIZE=2>STATE</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>Internet 2001</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>Rape 1980</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>Rape 2000</font></td></tr><tr><td><font SIZE=2>Arkansas</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>36.9</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>26.7</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>31.7</font></td></tr><tr><td><font SIZE=2>Kentucky</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>40.2</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>19.2</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>27.4</font></tr><tr><td><font SIZE=2>Minnesota</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>36.1</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>23.2</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>45.5</font></tr><tr><td><font SIZE=2>W.

STATES WITH HIGHEST INTERNET ACCESS [<a href="#3">3</a>]</font></td></tr></th><tb><tr><td><font SIZE=2>STATE</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>Internet 2001</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>Rape 1980</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>Rape 2000</font></td></tr><tr><td><font SIZE=2>Alaska</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>64.1</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>56.8</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>70.3</font></td></tr><tr><td><font SIZE=2>Colorado</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>58.5</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>52.5</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>41.2</font></td></tr><tr><td><font SIZE=2>New Jersey</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>61.6</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>30.7</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>16.1</font></td></tr><tr><td><font SIZE=2>Washington</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>60.4</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>52.7</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>46.4</font></td></tr></table><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>All figures are per capita.</font><br /><br />While the nationwide incidence of rape was showing a drastic decline, the incidence of rape in the four states having the <em>least</em> access to the internet showed an actual <em>increase</em> in rape over the same time period.  This result was almost too clear and convincing, so to check it I compiled figures for the four states having the <em>most</em> access to the internet.  Three out of four of these states showed declines (in New Jersey, an almost 50% decline).  Alaska was an anomaly: it increased both in internet access and incidence of rape.  However, the population of Alaska is less than one-tenth that of the other three states in its category.  To adjust for the disparity in population, I took the combined population of the four states in each table and calculated the percentage change in the rape statistics:<p><br /><table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 border=1><th><tr><td colspan=2><font SIZE=2>TABLE 3.  COMBINED PER CAPITA PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN INCIDENCE OF RAPE.</font></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><font SIZE=2>Aggregate per capita increase or decline in rape.</font></td></tr><tr><td><font SIZE=2>Four states with lowest internet access</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>Increase in rape of 53%</font></td></tr><tr><td><font SIZE=2>Four states with highest internet access</font></td><td><font SIZE=2>Decrease in rape of 27%</font></td></tr></table><br />I find these results to be statistically significant beyond the .95 confidence interval.<br />  <br /> Yet proof of correlation is not the same thing as causation.  If autumn regularly precedes winter, that doesn't mean that autumn causes winter.  When six years ago my former Northwestern colleague John Donohue, together with Steven Levitt [<a href="#4">4</a>, found that legalized abortion correlated with a reduction in crime, theirs would have only been an academically curious thesis if they had not identified a causal factor.  But they did identify one: that prior to legalization there were many unwanted babies born due to the lack of a legal abortion alternative.  Those unwanted children became the most likely group to turn to crime. <br /><br /> My own interest in the rape-pornography question began in 1970 when I
 served as a consultant to President Nixon's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography.  The Commission concluded that there was no causal relationship between exposure to sexually explicit materials and delinquent or criminal behavior.  The President was furious when he learned of the conclusion.<br /><br /> Later President Reagan tried the same thing, except unlike his predecessor he packed the Commission with persons who passed his ideological litmus test.  (Small wonder that I was not asked to participate.)  This time, Reagan's Commission on Pornography reached the approved result: that there does exist a causal relationship between pornography and violent sex crimes.<br />  <br /> The drafter of the Commission's report was Frederich Schauer, a prominent law professor.  In a separate statement, he assured readers that neither he nor the other Commissioners were at all influenced by their personal moral values [<a href="#5">5</a>].<br /> <br /> Professor Schauer's disclaimer aroused my skepticism.  If the commissioners were unbiased, how could the social facts have changed so drastically in the decade between the Nixon and Reagan reports as to turn non-causality into causality?  My examination of the Commission's evidence resulted in an article published by the <em>William and Mary Law Review</em> [<a href="#6">6</a>]. <br /><br /> Although the Reagan Commission had at its disposal all the evidence gathered by psychology and social-science departments throughout the world on the question whether a student's exposure to pornography increased his tendency to commit antisocial acts, I found that the Commission was unable to adduce a shred of evidence to support its affirmative conclusion.  No scientist had ever found that pornography raised the probability of rape.  However, the Commission was not seeking truth; rather, as I said in the title to my article, it sought political truth.<br />  <br /> Neither Professor Schauer nor the other Commissioners ever responded to my <em>William &amp; Mary</em> article.  Now they can forget it.  For if they had been right that exposure to pornography leads to an increase in social violence, then the vast exposure to pornography furnished by the internet would by now have resulted in scores of rapes per day on university campuses, hundreds of rapes daily in every town, and thousands of rapes per day in every city.  Instead, the Commissioners were so incredibly wrong that the incidence of rape has actually declined by the astounding rate of 85%.<br /><br /> Correlations aside, could access to pornography actually cause a decline in rape?  In my article I mentioned one possibility: that some people watching pornography may "get it out of their system" and thus have no further desire to go out and actually try it.  Another possibility might be labeled the "Victorian effect": the more that people covered up their bodies with clothes in those days, the greater the mystery of what they looked like in the nude.  The sight of a woman's ankle was considered shocking and erotic.  But today, internet porn has thoroughly de-mystified sex.  Times have changed so much that some high school teachers of sex education are beginning to show triple-X porn movies to their students in order to depict techniques of satisfactory intercourse.<br /><br /> I am sure there will be other explanations forthcoming as to why access to pornography is the most important causal factor in the decline of rape.  Once one accepts the observation that there is a precise negative correlation between the two, the rest can safely be left to the imagination. <br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes<br /><br /><a name=1>1</a>.

Some of the draft changes would perpetuate unlawful treatment during interrogation for alleged terrorists or unprivileged belligerents that has been authorized by several members of the Bush Administration and military commanders at Guantanamo Bay and Iraq, including Secretary Rumsfeld (in at least his December 2, 2002 action memo and his April 16, 2003 memo &#8212; authorizing, among other tactics, the stripping of detainees naked and hooding for interrogation and the use of dogs to instill intense fear for interrogation), Major General Miller, and Lieutenant General Sanchez (at least in his September 14, 2003 memo).  The new final draft is being created under the supervision of Under-Secretary of Defense Stephen Cambone, who opposes use of legally required minimum protections for all detainees under customary international law reflected in common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and who (along with Vice President Cheney and his chief of staff David Addington) openly opposed passage of the McCain Amendment to a 2005 Defense Appropriations Act &#8212; both of which set forth absolute prohibitions of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of any human being, regardless of their status and regardless of purpose.<br /><br /> Media also report that DOD civilian leaders, Addington, and others have argued that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to terrorists or irregular fighters, which is widely known to be incorrect, and that the new draft manual would create two separate sets of interrogation tactics &#8212; one for prisoners of war and the other for non-prisoners of war.  The latter set would allow harsh interrogation techniques.  Despite the Administration's assertion, however, there are no gaps in the reach of at least some forms of Geneva law protection during any armed conflict to detainees of any status.  Additionally, the absolute rights, duties and responsibilities reflected in common Article 3 are among the customary international law and treaty-based requirements that apply to detainees of any status.  Further, customary and treaty-based human rights law and other customary and treaty-based international laws that, like the laws of war, are part of the constitutionally-based laws of the United States that all members of the Executive branch are bound faithfully to execute also prohibit the use of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment against any human being in any context for any purpose.  Adoption of the dichotomous scheme perpetuated in the draft military manual will predictably result in violations of international law and the congressional mandate set forth in the McCain amendment. <br /> <br /> Since every violation of the law of war is a war crime, denials of customary rights and protections reflected, for example, in common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions will create criminal responsibility of a universal nature for soldiers involved in interrogation that is violative of common Article 3.  Criminal responsibility would also be predictable for superior officers who are derelict in their duty under the knew or should have know test and who tolerate such violations of the laws of war.  In fact, because future violations are so foreseeable if the dichotomous denial is perpetuated, one can foresee complicitous criminal and civil responsibility, if not dereliction of duty, for civilian and military creators of a military manual that sets up future criminal denials of law of war rights and protections.  Related forms of responsibility are actually evidenced in the President's express authorization of the denial of Geneva law rights and protections contained in his February 7, 2002 memorandum &#8212; a memorandum that, contrary to Geneva law, authorizes the denial of absolute rights and protections whenever denials are allegedly "appropriate" or "necessary".<br /><br /> President Bush, tear up your military manual!<br /><br /><em>Jordan Paust is the Mike &amp; Teresa Baker Law Center Professor at the University of Houston and a former Captain, U.S. Army JAGC and member of the faculty at the Judge Advocate General's School (1969-1973).

Since early 2002, the United States has tenaciously maintained a lawless enclave at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, detaining more than 700 individuals (nearly 500 remain) without charge, without due process, and without legal protections against torture and other abuse.  Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo did not just contribute to the suicides; it robbed America of its ability to respond to them with legitimacy and moral force on the world stage.<br /><br />Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo had already been roundly condemned by the international community and foreign leaders.  The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4718724.stm">United Nations</a> recently called for the prison's closure, while the <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/APFeaturesManager/defaultArtSiteView.asp?ArtId=469">Council of Europe</a> condemned the prison and United States detention policies.  Last year, the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2004/icrc_report_iraq_feb2004.htm">International Committee for the Red Cross</a> described the treatment of Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees as "tantamount to torture."  The recent suicides have inflamed sentiment across Europe and the Arab world, underscoring the urgency of prior warnings about Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.  The insensitive response of U.S. officials, who called the suicides "a good PR move" and "an act of asymmetrical warfare," have reinforced perceptions about Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo's lawlessness and disregard for truth.<br /><br />For the first time in its history, the United States has created and institutionalized a system of indefinite detention without charge.  It is not, of course, the cement cell-blocks and barbed wire that make Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo exceptional among U.S. prisons.  Rather, it is Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo's legal foundations &#8212; the boundless definition of an "enemy combatant"; presumption of guilt; and imprisonment without trial.<br /><br />Freedom from physical detention, as the Supreme Court emphasized in <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=03-6696">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a>, "is the most elemental of liberty interests."  The safeguards to prevent unlawful detention by the Executive form a nucleus of the protections guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.  The Constitution forbids indefinite detention except in the most exceptional circumstances and, only then, when subject to rigorous procedural safeguards.  Due process does not simply prevent erroneous deprivations of liberty; it also preserves principled limits on executive power and reinforces the system's legitimacy when it deprives individuals of their freedom.<br /><br />Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo strikes at the core of these protections and values.  Initially, the United States detained prisoners at the base for more than two years without access to any court to challenge their detention.  When its position was squarely rejected by the Supreme Court in June 2004 in <a href="http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/28june20041215/www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/03pdf/03-334.pdf">Rasul v. Bush</a>, the government sought to block federal court hearings, creating in its place a sham process known as the Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT), which denies such fundamental safeguards as the right to see the government's evidence and confront witnesses; the right to counsel; and the right to a neutral decisionmaker.  Further, as a <a href="http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/gitmo/inregitmo13105opn.pdf">district judge</a> has found, the CSRT permits indefinite detention based on evidence obtained by torture.<br /><br />This system of indefinite detention not only produces legal injustice; it also results in human despair, as individuals face the prospect of never-ending imprisonment without a court judgment deciding their guilt or innocence and imposing a term of punishment.   That despair is magnified by the harsh and brutal conditions to which detainees have been subjected.  As the administration's now notorious "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/international/24MEMO-GUIDE.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin">torture memos</a>" suggest, Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo was born out of a desire to avoid any domestic or international legal constraints, including the Geneva Conventions, which prohibit torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  Evidence of widespread abuse of detainees has not only been reported by international organizations, but has also been corroborated by U.S. government documents, such as FBI memoranda that the government was forced to disclose by litigation under the Freedom of Information Act.<br /><br /> Less frequently publicized is the prolonged isolation of many detainees, who remain cut-off from the outside world, including their families, who they have neither seen nor spoken to for nearly five years.  The Supreme Court long ago warned of the dangers of prolonged isolation and sensory deprivation, describing it in the 1890 case <a href="http://www.vlex.us/caselaw/U-S-Supreme-Court/In-re-Medley-134-U-S-160-1890/2100-20057606,01.html">In re Medley</a> as "punishment of the most important and painful character."   Modern medical and scientific research confirms and deepens the Supreme Court's turn-of-the-century understanding about the dangers posed by prolonged social isolation, de-humanizing treatment, and reduced environmental stimulation.  Before the three suicides, there were at least 41 attempted suicides according to the government (a 2006 <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/docs/62chr/E.CN.4.2006.120_.pdf">U.N. report</a> says the number was much higher), as well as hundreds acts of "self-harm," mass hunger strikes and <a href="/forumy/2006/06/guantanamo-and-medical-ethics.php">mistreatment of hunger strikers</a>, and cases of serious mental illness.  Although the government describes the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detentions as preventive, and not punitive (for then, they would require a trial), the harsh and de-humanizing conditions belie the government's assertion that the detentions are "simple war measures."<br /> <br />In short, indefinite detention and mistreatment at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo has created a situation ripe for prisoner suicide.  More broadly, Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo's essential lawlessness has prevented America from responding to those suicides with legitimacy and conviction.   To be sure, the administration can call the three men terrorists, but it cannot say they were ever tried and convicted of anything.   It can also say that the men were treated humanely, but the administration cannot say they were treated in accordance with established domestic and international legal standards, since it maintained those standards did not apply to them.<br /><br /> America's lost legitimacy cannot be regained overnight.  The necessary first steps, however, are an independent investigation into the suicides and into the conditions at the prison generally, including the physical and mental health of the detainees; and the closure of Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, with all detainees promptly tried or released.   The sooner the United States can admit its
failed experiment of indefinite detention at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, the sooner it can begin to repair the damage. <br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Jonathan Hafetz is Associate Counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.

As with the abolition of slavery, it is not only a moral imperative; it is historically inevitable. <br /><br />While the Philippines is the latest country to scrap the death penalty, in the United States of America a debate continues about whether injecting lethal poison into a human being is inhuman and degrading, and whether executing mentally impaired persons is wrong.  According to the Gallup polls, most Americans believe the answer to both questions should be a resolute no. <br /><br />In contrast, American public opinion is shocked by recent reports of the massacre in Haditha and the allegations that such a crime has been committed by US Marines.  If the reports are true, the slain Iraqis were not killed in action but out of vengeance.  Haditha was an execution in retribution, but so is capital punishment.  The fact that in Haditha there was no court, no judge, no lawyers and no jury is a fault in form, not in substance.  It has been reported that the soldiers involved, if found guilty, may themselves face the death penalty.  This is sad beyond belief.  Two wrongs do not make a right, and death can never be justice.<br /><br />On the issue of death penalty, Europe is clearly taking a lead.  None of the 46 member states of the Council of Europe have executed anybody in the past decade.  All but one of the 46 countries have ratified Protocol 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights and formally abolished the death penalty.  The exception is the Russian Federation, which has had a moratorium on the death penalty for ten years and is legally and politically bound to follow to convert de facto into de jure abolition as soon as possible. This has been made clear by Russian Foreign Minister Serguei Lavrov, who has said publicly that it is only a matter of time.  The Russian Federation is a democracy, he said, and public opinion must be taken into account.<br /><br />I agree on both points, but there are some issues on which leaders should lead, and not simply follow.  Progressive politicians in abolitionist and non-abolitionist countries alike need to inform, educate and campaign for the abolition of capital punishment.  If they are short of arguments, they are free to use mine.  The death penalty is wrong because it is inhuman and degrading.  It is dangerous because it may kill innocent people.  It is unjustified because it does not deter crime any better than other forms of punishment.  And finally, it is pointless because it gets criminals off the hook.  When they are executed, they are no longer punished, they are simply dead.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Terry Davis is Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Europe&#39;s oldest political organization dedicated to protecting democracy, the rule of law and human rights</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Americans prepare to celebrate Independence Day on July 4, JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=152">David Crane</a> and Fred Bryant, former senior legal officials in the US Defense Department, say that the United States cannot win either the war in Iraq or the fight against international terrorism without holding fast to the rule of law that has made the country great...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidcranenew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/forumy/fredbryant.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>lmost 40 years ago, the Peers Commission investigating the tragedy of the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War found that the chain of command had failed to ensure America's fighting men and women adhered to the law of war. Some of the chain of command was held accountable, mainly for trying to cover up the massacre. In his 2004 report investigating the facts surrounding the Abu Ghraib prison torture allegations in Iraq, former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger pointedly said there had been a failure of leadership. To date, that chain of command is yet to be held completely accountable.<br /><br />Just before the Abu Ghraib incidents, the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, stated that the Geneva Conventions were "trite" law.  This comment was a reflection of the Bush administration's approach to the new challenges posed by the war on terror; the rules had changed in their minds.  In some respects the alleged odd comment by Coffer Black of the CIA summed up the administrations approach to fighting terrorists, "they'll have flies on their eyeballs".  It's been downhill from there related to how we conduct our operations against Al Qaeda and related targets under the law.<br /><br />The President of the United States is the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.  He is the top of the chain of command.  His attitudes, policies, and public comments, and those reflected by his appointees below him, set the tone by which our brave fighting men and women enter a military operation.  In the past, we entered combat with the rule of law clearly on our side, internationally and domestically.  We had learned from My Lai and spent decades ensuring the DOD Law of War program was properly developed and that all our fighting forces were trained in its principles.  Judge advocates and commanders worked side by side for almost four decades to ensure we did not repeat the horror of My Lai.  That team effort was a success and restored the United States to the moral high ground it had lost in Vietnam.  The world believed once again that Americans did not intentionally kill civilians, torture, or needlessly cause unnecessary damage or suffering.  We were admired around the world for how our military operations were conducted within the rule of law.<br /><br />No longer.  We have lost the moral high ground that comes with following the rule of law and the standing to fault other nations and groups who conduct themselves outside of the standards set out in the Laws of Armed Conflict, reflected in the Geneva Conventions, related protocols and treaties, as well as customary international law.  This is tragic and shameful. In the war on terror we have lost the initiative ideologically against the terrorists.  We kill innocents, torture, arrest without justification, and hold individuals outside the law.  So does Al Qaeda.  <br /><br />In a moving scene from a movie made in the 1970's about the incarceration of the late Admiral Jeremiah Denton as a POW during the Vietnam War, entitled "When Hell was in Session", then Captain Denton gathered all of the American prisoners of war together after their initial release from their cells at the Hanoi Hilton in 1973.  He had them gather around and hold hands and sing the Battle Hymn of the Republic in front of their guards.  Why did he do this he was asked? He allegedly stated that he wanted their North Vietnamese guards to know that they may have destroyed their bodies through torture, but they did not take their minds.  He also wanted to let them know that we were better than them as a nation.  Upon reflection what he was saying is that we still had retained the moral high ground.  We followed the rule of law.  Senator John McCain, a POW himself, has also reflected on this point.  <br /><br />Our wonderful armed forces reflect our society and we go into a combat situation with basic American values.  Our fighting men and women believe they are "the good guys" who are wearing the "white hats".  Trained in the law of war, confident in their chain of command, and the justness of their mission, they believe that they will prevail militarily and politically.  It's much easier to fight from that moral high ground.  It breeds confidence, enhances morale, and sustains a fighting spirit that allows us to be successful on the battlefield.  We have been doing this for two hundred years.  Not any more.  Right now we have Americans at all levels, from the paratrooper in Iraq, to the shopkeeper in Omaha, Nebraska questioning our moral right to be in Iraq.  Allegations of war crimes and torture undermine basic American values and confidence in our cause to fight the war on terror.<br /><br />In the end, we will not win this war in Iraq or the decades-long fight against mankind's enemy, international terrorism, without holding fast to what made this country great and admired around the world as the bright and shining castle on the hill, and that is rule of law.  As the world spun out of control in the Balkans, East and West Africa, South and Central America, the Middle and Far East, it always could be expected that the United States would be there as a beacon of hope related to peace and security under the rule of law.  The world no longer believes this and without this example by the United States, the future appears uncertain. <br /><br />Without law, the beast of impunity rears its ugly head and begins to feed around the periphery of civilization.  The innocent, the weak, and the downtrodden begin to disappear.  The United States was the final bulwark against the onslaught of impunity, terror, and tyranny.  That bulwark is crumbling; terror camps, GITMO, Abu Ghraib, and Haditha are examples of how much those walls have crumbled.<br /><br />It is not the basic soldier who decides to commit a war crime.  Though he may be held to be individually criminally responsible under domestic and international law for a war crime, it is the chain of command that sets the tone, the parameters about how we fight.  If they deviate from the concept of conducting all our military operations legally, a tragedy will happen.  It did at My Lai and now in Iraq at Abu Ghraib and Haditha.  It is hoped that we will not just hold accountable the Marines who actually were there in Haditha, but the chain of command up to the general officer level and even at the political level.  The additional tragedy of Abu Ghraib is that the world still feels there has been a cover-up to protect senior officers and politicians.  It is those senior officers and political leaders who failed in their duties as commanders and leaders.  They should be held accountable under the law.  <br /><br />Losing the moral high ground is not forever.  We can gain it back by using the legal process to account for and correct the various violations of international law committed by the United States thus far in the war on terror.  If we don't we will not win the ideological struggle against the terrorists.  We beat the Soviet Union in the Cold War, an ideological struggle, with this important idea, equal justice under law.  Our idea was better than theirs.  It can be a
gainst international terror.  Let's start to regain that moral high ground or we will lose this fight. <br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University]: &quot;Endangering international peace and security and defying international law, the Middle East is spinning out of control. The recent spiral of violence intensified when Palestinian militants captured an Israeli soldier and converted him into a bargaining chip for obtaining the release of thousands of prisoners, including women and children, rotting in Israeli prisons. Ever responsive Israel started bombing houses and bridges in Gaza. Israel has also threatened to kill Hamas leaders directing events from Syria. <br /><br />While the Gaza confrontation deepened, the Lebanese guerillas opened another front on the northern border of Israel. In a show of solidarity with predominantly Sunni Hamas, the Shia Hezbolla headquartered in Lebanon launched a daring daylight attack on Israeli forces, killing several Israeli soldiers and capturing two.  As Ze&#39;ev Schiff  puts it: Israel now faces an extreme foursome: Hamas, Hezbollah, Syria, and Iran. Israel has fired hundreds of missiles on numerous targets inside Lebanon, including the Rafik Hariri International Airport in Beirut. Domestic pressure is also building on Israeli government to hit Syria and possibly Iran. <br /><br />This time the stakes are high. If Israel attacks Syria or Iran, numerous guerrilla groups will emerge in the region, including Jordan and Egypt, opening a new chapter in the Middle Eastern conflict. Two distinct forces are at work. First, the stubborn guerilla resistance in Iraq and Afghanistan has emboldened militants in the Middle East, showing that even the mightiest military power can be reduced to an ineffective giant through a suicidal but unrelenting war of attrition. Second, a tacit understanding is emerging between governments and guerillas that a strategic gap should be maintained between the two entities. The governments would play by the rules of international law while guerillas plan and conduct hostilities. These developments however will produce no winners.<br /><br />Israeli strikes against Lebanon or Syria or Iran, even under the legal cover of self-defense, will spawn new guerilla groups in the region and beyond. The Hezbollah surprise attack on the IDF from across a settled international border exposes a new thinking. The militancy infrastructure is weighing to follow the ways of Iraq. If Iraqi insurgency continues, multiple guerilla groups will sprout at expected and unexpected places to challenge Israel.  A new coalition of the willing to die and kill will radicalize the Middle East, most assuredly to the detriment of international peace and security.    <br /><br />&quot;We do not negotiate with terrorists&quot; has been an ineffective policy. It has complicated international relations, and solved nothing. Military initiatives have killed dozens of militants and hundreds of civilians. But they have failed to curb militancy. I discuss this point in more detail in <a href="http://www.brill.nl/m_catalogue_sub6_id23888.htm">A Theory of International Terrorism (2006)</a><br /><br />The UN Charter prohibits the use of force in international affairs and mandates negotiated solutions for international disputes. The Charter incorporates a historically validated legal principle that the use of force does not resolve disputes, only complicates them. The illegal war in Iraq demonstrates the wisdom of the Charter that the Bush administration dismissed with superciliousness. Even the UN sanctioned war in Afghanistan reveals inherent deficiencies of using weapons rather than minds in resolving international disputes.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26"><strong>Michael J. Kelly</strong></a> [Creighton University School of Law]: &quot;Serbia has moved against a group of nationalist co-conspirators who have been hiding wanted war criminal Radko Mladic for about a decade. The Serb government, largely unresponsive to repeated requests to turn over such perpetrators to international tribunals, has responded in this case only because the European Union (E.U.) has taken the drastic step of breaking off economic talks with financially-strapped government in Belgrade.<br /><br />Mladic was the Bosnian Serb general in command of soldiers during the Bosnian civil war of the early &#39;90&#39;s who committed mass atrocities, including the bloody genocide of 8,000 of Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995. Indicted by the War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, Mladic was never captured. He fled to Serbia along with others wanted for crimes against humanity after the war when U.S. and NATO military commanders refused to collar indictees in occupied Bosnia, claiming that their soldiers were not police officers adequately equipped to carry out supboneas and arrest warrants. Although allied soldiers did a fine job of arresting Nazi and Japanese Imperial leaders after World War II, commanders in occupied Bosnia did not feel they had the wherewithall for such a task in modern times.<br /><br />Under Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia sheltered these criminals, refusing to cooperate with the West on principle. Under Milosevic&#39;s successor regimes, notably that of fellow-nationalist Vojislav Kostunica, noises of more cooperation were heard, but Mladic remained at large. Now, however, the E.U. has suspended talks with Serbia over associating with the community until Mladic is handed over. Under such economic pressure and the threat of Serbia remaining isolated as the only country in the Balkans without a growing E.U. relationship, Belgrade has finally decided to move on Mladic. That Brussels was prepared to use this leverage to bring such a war criminal to justice is lauditory. The E.U. historically only threatened non-association with countries in exchange for strengthening banking regulations, environmental laws, human rights, or eliminating the death penalty - as it forced Turkey to do recently.&quot;<br />

		<title>Cambodia 25 years after the Khmer Rouge</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL"><strong>Andrew Wood</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh School of Law 2L, in Cambodia]: &quot;With the Khmer Rouge tribunal beginning in less than a year, Phnom Penh is buzzing in anticipation of the proceedings. Preparation for the tribunal has been nearly a decade in the making. Although Pol Pot died in 1999, several other former Khmer Rouge leaders are expected to be indicted and held responsible for the deaths of over 1.5 million people during the Khmer Rouge rule over Democratic Kampuchea from 1975 to 1979. One cannot help but feel the sense of urgency when reading the daily updates in the local papers. With the recent deaths of KR leaders Thiounn Thiouenn and Ta Mok, and the uncertain condition of former KR foreign secretary Ieng Sary who was hospitalized last month, people in Cambodia are anxious to see the trials get underway.<br /><br />Considering current events in Cambodia, it seemed only appropriate to visit the Tuol Sleng prison (S-21) and the killing fields of Choeung Ek upon arrival to Phnom Penh. Nearly 20,000 men, women and children were tortured and killed at S-21 between 1975 and 1978, and the Khmer Rouge kept detailed records of the atrocities, including photos of all that were held at the prison. After being tortured, the victims of S-21 were transferred to the Cheung Ek extermination camp where they were killed and buried in mass graves. The Document Center for Cambodia (DC-Cam), established in 1995, is largely responsible for pouring through the documents left behind at Tuol Sleng, mapping mass grave sites, and preserving evidence against the Khmer Rouge.<br /><br />Though the Khmer Rouge were ousted by the Vietnamese over 25 years ago, the regime&#39;s impact continues to affect the people and the development of Cambodia. By eliminating nearly all of Cambodia&#39;s educated population &#8212; doctors, lawyers, professors, even those who merely wore glasses &#8212; the Khmer Rouge virtually succeeded in creating their desired &quot;year zero.&quot; Today, Cambodia is riddled with corruption as it tries to pick up the pieces. A striking statistic I have encountered as a legal intern is that there are currently only about 300 practicing lawyers in the entire country.<br /><br />During my first week in Phnom Penh I witnessed the controversial eviction of hundreds of families from a Phnom Penh community, marched to a prison in support of 3 men who were arrested during a separate eviction, and attended a rally held by local NGOs and villagers of the latter community, a centrally located village in Phnom Penh. Evictions of Phnom Penh communities are on the rise, and while the eminent domain laws of the US are relatively similar to the laws of Cambodia, the treatment of Cambodian evictees in practice is strikingly different. People are not generally compensated at all, or at best not adequately, and are relocated to empty plots of land 20 to 30 kilometers outside the city-center. The relocation sites resemble a refugee camp more than a community, with little or no housing, running water and toilets.<br /><br />Cambodia&#39;s Community Legal Education Center (CLEC) is currently working to support the victims of such land disputes, as well as to support workers rights regarding labor issues. I am working with CLEC&#39;s labor department. Cambodia&#39;s current labor law, created in 1997, is regarded as an excellent piece of legislation on paper. In practice, however, workers face many challenges. Although the labor law states that the Ministry of Labor shall set the minimum wage, only the garment sector has thus far achieved a minimum wage in Cambodia ($45 USD per month). Trade union leaders are the victims of violence by gangsters hired by employers and corruption in their struggle for basic rights. The rise of the relatively young Cambodian garment industry provides a hope for many that increased international business can help improve the lives of many in an impoverished nation. For me, working with leaders who are fighting to achieve this goal should prove to make for a very exciting month.&quot;<br />

		<title>The Hezbollah-Israel War: Narratives and &#039;Legal Truth&#039;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist and <a href="http://www.mallatforpresident.com/index.php">Lebanese presidential candidate</a> Chibli Mallat, professor of law and holder of the <a href="http://www.ceue.usj.edu.lb/">EU Jean Monnet Chair</a> at St. Joseph&#39;s University in Beirut, says that the historical narratives of the sides in the long-running Arab-Israeli conflict currently manifested in Lebanon stand to be reshaped by a legal order imposed by the UN Security Council, whatever that may turn out to be...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/chiblimallat.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>P</strong></font>eople familiar with the Arab-Israeli conflict know that one characteristic staple of the longest running conflict in modern history is its &#39;narrative&#39;. Each side has its own narrative, which is profoundly different from the other&#39;s. Speaking from different departing points, language goes off on tangential parallels that do not meet, and reinforce a dialogue of the deaf. This is particularly true of the legal narrative, as underlined in a seminal article by leading Palestinian lawyer Raja Shehadeh in the early 1990s, at a time when the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships were still seriously negotiating a solution to the conflict. <br /><br />In the recent outbreak of large-scale violence, the common terrain of the two narratives is even less available. The Hezbollah leader developed two main legal arguments in his first speech upon the abduction of two Israeli soldiers on July 12 after his militia crossed the UN-established Blue Line separating Lebanon from Israel: the first related to the abduction itself, which he compared with the protracted imprisonment of Lebanese nationals in Israeli jails. The second was a larger issue: told that morning by the UNSG representative in Lebanon that the abduction was a serious violation of the Blue Line as established and confirmed in 2000 by the Security Council, he advocated a &#39;natural rights&#39; argument instead. Conversely, the Prime Minister of Israel flagged counter-terrorism and self-defense under Art.51 of the UN Charter as the legal rationale for massive Israeli retaliation, adding also, in the first day, the full responsibility of the Lebanese government for Hezbollah&#39;s action.<br /><br />The different narratives have an even more difficult component: the further the protagonists go back in time, the larger the gulf. On the Palestinian-Arab-Islamic side, the fight is respectively over displacement of the Palestinians, occupation of Arab land, and the survival of Islam as a civilization threatened by the West by way of Israel. On the Israeli side, it is a right of self-determination over Biblically-defined land for the Jewish people, and the right for Jews to live within safe and recognized borders. Not surprisingly, the two narratives, which are coherent enough in and by themselves, talk in the main past each other. Even a common ground like &#39;proportionality&#39; or &#39;the use of prohibited weapons&#39; gets disputed ad nauseam, and both parties and supporters advance different facts and different sequencing to accuse the other and defend themselves from any wrongdoing under international law.<br /><br />I am not a nihilist, and do not think that the competing narratives prevent the truth from prevailing. There are two levels for this necessarily relative truth, since it is human, to come out. One takes place in public discourse, informed by legal expertise and occasionally fact-finding missions. I have for instance advocated from the very first day that Hezbollah was wrong in crossing the Blue Line, both from the point of view of international law and from a domestic Lebanese perspective. The first argument is simple: had Israel crossed the Blue Line and its soldiers been killed or abducted in Lebanon, the situation would be exactly opposite. The fact of the crossing is not denied, so there is no room for the narrative to be in dispute on that score. The domestic argument is also straightforward: how can a non-state party carry out violence, even against an acknowledged enemy, outside the permission and control of the national government ? <br /><br />There are more controversial arguments. One is the Shebaa farms, a territory which is in dispute since the Lebanese government expressed its reservations over its delineation south of the Blue Line. Against the grain of Lebanese nationalist sentiment upon Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000, I always considered the Shebaa farm to be Syrian territory under international law, and continue to fault the Lebanese leaders, including the Prime Minister, for flagging it out in a way that ensnared Lebanon in the Syrian narrative and its use of its Lebanese supporters to prevent a lasting peace on the Lebanese-Israeli border. The narrative here is less clear cut, however, and one has seen maps produced (some apparently &#39;doctored&#39;), as well as dozens of land titles flagged to defend the Lebanese entitlement to the Shebaa farms. On facts, and they are important as disputes over borders often depend on indicia of ownership when the border has not been fully demarcated, the main reason why the farms are not Lebanese is because they are prima facie Syrian owing to their coming under UN writ since 1974. That region is in the area patrolled by UNDOF troops, which were stationed on the Syrian Golan in the wake of the Syria-Israel war of 1973, as opposed to UNIFIL, which was deployed on the Lebanese border (but not in the Shebaa area) since the Israelis moved to occupy Lebanon in 1978. <br /><br />Examples can be multiplied, and get complicated over time. Conflicting narratives develop accordingly, and public discourse, or the general agreement of scholars, eventually define which narrative tends to prevail. Historical truth slowly takes its path with general indecisiveness. But another truth, at least as important, develops on the practical legal front by way of the Security Council. Mostly since the end of the Cold War, the Security Council has become the most powerful law-making and law-deciding power &#8212; and here it is a power, in the same way as a court represents judicial power &#8212; in the international arena. The battle over the Hezbollah-Lebanon war is presently waged over the next Security Council Resolution, which can be followed in the proposals and counterproposals tabled at various levels across the globe. Once the Security Council has decided over the order of priorities, and the formulation of its own narrative, it becomes law. For instance, will the 12 July abduction of the two Israeli soldiers be considered by the Council as an infringement of international law, and how will that formulation be carried out. Will the regional conflict be mentioned, or will the Council restrict its Resolution to Lebanon-Israel ? <br /><br />With this dual grid, the stakes appear more clearly in the Lebanese-Israeli crisis. Public discourse shapes law against conflicting and usually indecisive historical narratives. The Security Council eventually puts some order by producing a legal truth of sorts, as implementation is yet another story. <br /><br /><br /><em>Chibli Mallat is a Lebanese presidential candidate and EU Jean Monnet Professor of Law at Saint Joseph&#39;s University in Beirut.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/Steinbock/steinboc.htm">Daniel Steinbock</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that although watch lists may play a useful role in a broader terrorism prevention, their operation and consequences should be restricted and controlled in recognition of their limitations....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/danielsteinbock.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>M</strong></font>ost of us won't notice it, but taking a flight or crossing a border this summer will likely cause our names to be checked against terrorist watch lists.  These compilations of "known" or "suspected" terrorists existed even before 9/11, but are now being consolidated, expanded, and applied in a greater number and variety of settings.  Their use can deny visas, bar or delay access to air travel or transit into the U.S., interfere with financial transactions, and block employment in certain transportation sectors; additional applications are under active consideration.  As of February 2006, over 230,000 individuals were included in the database of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), the agency that decides on watch list inclusion.  All of this, of course, is part of the enlarged emphasis on prevention in U.S. anti-terrorism strategy since 9/11.<br /><br /> In theory, watch lists are a good idea, blocking those people who we have reason to believe will do us harm from especially vulnerable places and jobs -- or even, in the case of non-citizens, the entire country.  The names of at least three of the 9/11 hijackers, for example, were known to some of the intelligence community and thus potentially could have been placed on immigration watch lists.  And because watch lists embody individualized judgments, they are preferable to the ethnic or religious profiling that might otherwise be used as the basis for extra security precautions.<br /><br />At best, however, watch lists will never be more than one element in a multi-layered anti-terrorist strategy.  They are still in the early stages of composition and consolidation, and even their staunchest advocates would not describe them as close to complete.  Many of their targets are not based within the U.S., which means the collection of accurate intelligence is not easy.  The making of "terrorists" and "terrorist threats" is, in any event, a highly dynamic process, with new participants joining and old ones leaving all the time.  Because intelligence gathering will only ever be partially successful and will always lag behind events, watch lists will be far from completely accurate in identifying potential terrorists.  The July 2005 London bombings suggest that terrorists may consciously use (or emerge from) what the British call "cleanskins" or "lily-whites," people previously unknown to the security services.  In fact, by testing the watch list system a calculating group of terrorists could determine which of their members was not on it.  In short, watch lists will inevitably produce "false negatives" -- the failure to identify genuine threats.<br /><br />They will also result in a large number of "false positives," labeling innocent people as real or suspected terrorists.   One kind of false positive is the confusion of one person with another whose name (or a similar one) is on a watch list.  This is the kind of misidentification that has drawn the most public attention and complaint, with Senator Ted Kennedy's difficulties in boarding airplanes only the most notorious.  Just this week the Inspector General of the Homeland Security Department reported that border agents routinely detain innocent people for hours on the basis of a name match with a suspected terrorist, resulting in "an extremely inefficient use" of the border officer's time.  Not only do these mistakes distress the affected traveler, but, as this recent report illustrates, they misdirect valuable security resources.<br /><br />The more serious issue, and one that has received much less attention, is the placement on watch lists of people who in an objective sense should not be there.  The "standard of proof," if one is explicitly employed in listing decisions, is apparently quite low.  The Director of the Terrorist Screening Center has stated that, "to err on the side of caution, individuals with any degree of a terrorism nexus were included in the terrorist screening database."  Whatever the standard of proof, it is administered by officials in a completely secret process.  Bureaucratic risk avoidance undoubtedly pushes toward inclusion of questionable "candidates," for no one would want to be known as the official who kept off the watch list a person later involved in a terrorist incident. <br /><br />This kind of ex parte labeling is reminiscent of the McCarthy era of the late 1940's and 1950's, when apprehension of Communist infiltration of American government and industry saw two kinds of attempts to designate the allegedly dangerous:  blacklists assembled and used by private parties, and loyalty and security tests applied by government.   In both cases, people believed to be Communists or "fellow travelers" were barred from jobs and even entire professions.  In retrospect, few would call the use of these labeling mechanisms our country's finest hour.<br /><br /> Even more than the earlier blacklist and loyalty-security determinations, the watch list process combines a wide substantive reach with a bureaucratic and non-adversarial process.  This mix makes a substantial number of false positives inevitable.  Their costs are borne, of course, by those people who are wrongly identified as posing a threat.  How, then, to reduce the number of erroneous listings, or at least ameliorate their effects? <br /> <br />In an article forthcoming in the <em>Seattle University Law Review</em> (vol. 30, issue 1), &quot;Designating the Dangerous: From Blacklists to Watch Lists,&quot; I consider three possible ways.  One would be to tighten the substantive standards for watch list placement, or to reject certain kinds of evidence.  That is hard to do, however, and making the inclusion standards too stringent might undermine watch lists' usefulness as screening tools. <br /> <br />A second approach would be to allow some adversary process.  Providing notice and a right to be heard before a person's name is initially placed on a list would be impossible, but there should be a procedure for people who discover their inclusion and want to challenge it as erroneous.  This might entail an adversarial hearing, though the difficulty of conducting a fair hearing without disclosing sensitive intelligence information or sources must be acknowledged.  Another response to a complaint of wrongful presence on a list might be a more thorough and demanding review of the evidence by the NCTC.  <br />  <br />       A third, and preferred, alternative, I contend, is to restrict the consequences that follow from use of the lists &#8212; in other words, to put the watch back in watch lists.  It is simply unfair, and probably unconstitutional, to impose serious harms on the basis of a process of ex parte labeling, especially one with a bias toward inclusion in cases of doubt.  Anti-terrorist watch lists can serve to separate individuals deserving of increased investigative attention from those who are not.  They should not, however, be the ground for consequences more serious than certain visa denials (for practical and historical reasons), the initiation of investigation, or minor impositions on liberty involving delay (but not denial) of access to locations or transportation.  With those limitations, watch lists can be one limited but useful component of the new national security era we have been compelled to enter.<br /><br /><br /><em>Daniel J. Steinbock is Harold A.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Dr. Robbie Sabel of the <a href="http://law.mscc.huji.ac.il/law1/newsite/english.html">Hebrew University Faculty of Law</a> in Jerusalem, Israel, says that many of the international law issues in the current conflict between Israel and Hezbollah come down to matters of common sense...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/robbiesabelsmall.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s in most aspects of law, one should look for the rule of common sense, and in the overwhelming number of cases that will also be the legal solution. This is as true in international law as it is in internal legal systems. This yardstick also applies to the rules regarding the use of force and to the rules of armed conflict. <br /><br />The present armed conflict between Israel and Hezbollah raises a number of international law issues, among them:<ul><li>Do the laws of armed conflict apply to the situation in Lebanon?<br /><li>  Do the laws of armed conflict bind Hezbollah? <li>Is the Israeli response to the Hezbollah attack disproportionate? <li>What are legitimate targets in such a situation? <li>Is the Lebanese Government responsible for Hezbollah activities? <li>Is it illegal to cause civilian casualties?</ul><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/mideastconflict.php">Middle East Conflict</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2006/07/middle-east-crisis-meeting-un-security.php">Middle East crisis meeting</a> [UN Security Council]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><strong>Is the Israeli response to the Hezbollah attack disproportionate?</strong><br /><br />In <em>jus ad bellum</em> the right of a State to act in self-defense [<a href="#1">1</a>] is subject to the conditions of "necessity and proportionality." [<a href="#1">2</a>]   A minor border incident, created perhaps by an overzealous soldier, only entitles a State to take measures of self-defense compatible with the severity of the incident, but not more than that. A recent author has commented, however, that ''where such activities clearly form part of a sequence or chain of events, then the test of proportionality will be so interpreted as to incorporate this." [<a href="#3">3</a>]   Once armed conflict develops, a State is not, however, limited to responding only to measures chosen by its opponent. A State that takes aggressive armed action against another State, or permits its territory to be used for that purpose, cannot dictate the terms of the subsequent armed conflict. An aggressor State risks that its armed forces will be dealt a blow disproportionate to the attack it made. Except as regards civilian casualties [<a href="#4">4</a>],  proportionality is not part of <em>jus in bello</em> and wars may be fought to defeat the military capabilities of an enemy aggressor and not only as an actuarial exercise. <br /><br />In the context of the present Lebanon fighting, Hezbollah does not deny that the kidnapping of the Israel soldiers on July 12th was deliberate, premeditated and approved by the Hezbollah command. The attack was on an Israeli patrol in territory that is undisputed Israel territory. It was accompanied by a barrage of rocket attacks aimed against both military and civilian targets in Northern Israel. It followed a series of earlier Hezbollah attacks and attempts at kidnapping soldiers. It would clearly appear to have been an armed attack. [<a href="#5">5</a>]  Since the first Hezbollah barrage on the 12th of July, more than a thousand rockets have hit Northern Israel including the Israeli major town and port of Haifa. This is an armed conflict by any measure. In such an armed conflict it is legitimate for Israel to attempt to deal a critical blow to the military capabilities of Hezbollah. It has been said about Israel "it is a dangerous State; when attacked, it defends itself". Military actions by Israel are, of course, subject to the limitations set out in the laws of armed conflict.<br /><br /><strong>Do the laws of armed conflict apply to the situation in Lebanon and do they bind Hezbollah?</strong><br /><br />The laws of armed conflict in all circumstances bind all States. It is irrelevant that Israel was the victim of an armed attack. The laws of armed conflict apply equally to the victim and to the aggressor. Hence the Israeli Army is bound to comply with all the rules applicable to an armed conflict and it has not denied such an obligation.[<a href="#6">6</a>]   These rules include those relating to treatment of prisoners, treatment of wounded, prohibited means of warfare and weapons, prohibition of attacks against civilians and behavior towards civilian populations. The Lebanese army is, needless to say, likewise bound. Israel is obliged to apply these rules against all in Lebanon including Hezbollah fighters.[<a href="#7">7</a>]   This is an asymmetry peculiar to the laws of armed conflict, Hezbollah knowingly and deliberately targets civilians and civilian targets in Israel but this does not   exempt Israel from having to apply the rules to members of Hezbollah. Members of Hezbollah who commit war crimes or crimes against humanity are personally responsible and subject to universal jurisdiction.[<a href="#8">8</a>]   It makes little common sense however to talk about the legal obligations of an organization like Hezbollah, an organization defined in some States as a terrorist organization. Here again international law reflects common sense and organizations such as Hezbollah are not treated as a separate international legal entity.[<a href="#9">9</a>]    The responsibility for actions by groups such as Hezbollah rests with the territorial State.[<a href="#10">10</a>]    <br /><br /><strong>What are legitimate targets in such a situation?</strong><br /><br />In armed conflict legitimate targets are those "which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offer a definite military advantage."[<a href="#11">11</a>]   Hezbollah receives its armaments from Iran and Syria. These armaments include long-range missiles and missile launchers. During the present hostilities Syria has continued the supply of armaments. Roads, bridges and airports used in the supply of such weapons are legitimate military targets. Electric power stations and fuel depots are also considered legitimate targets though Israel has refrained from attacking them.[<a href="#12">12</a>]   Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut are a legitimate target. Civilian populations and civilian objects are not legitimate targets, and it would not be legal for Israel to attack Lebanese civilian government facilities that are not involved in the hostilities. <br /><br /><strong>Is it illegal to cause civilian casualties?</strong><br /><br /> The rules of armed conflict are unambiguous. "The civilian population as such, as well as individual citizens, shal
l not be the object of attack."[<a href="#13">13</a>]   "Civilian objects shall not be the object of attack or of reprisals."[<a href="#14">14</a>]   However again international law reflects common sense as the rule is: "The presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations."[<a href="#15">15</a>]   This is particularly relevant when military targets are situated in the vicinity of civilian population and civilian objects, as is the situation in the Lebanese context where Hezbollah armaments have been deliberately placed in civilian houses and installations. Missiles have been hidden in houses and mosques and Hezbollah headquarters were situated in a Southern suburb of Beirut. Common sense dictates that such positioning cannot grant the targets immunity from attack. In such circumstances the rule is that there must be proportionality as regards the amount of incidental or collateral civilian casualties. It is regretfully inevitable that there are likely to be civilian casualties when attacking such military targets. Armed forces however, are obliged to "refrain from launching any attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and military advantage anticipated."[<a href="#16">16</a>]    The attacking army must, moreover "take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects."[<a href="#17">17</a>]   The Israeli warnings to civilians to vacate Hezbollah controlled villages in Southern Lebanon were taken as a necessary step prior to attacking armaments in such villages. It saved countless lives of Lebanese civilian though the sight of villagers fleeing their homes has not added to Israel's public relations image.<br /><br /><strong>Is the Lebanese Government responsible for Hezbollah activities?</strong><br /><br />International law rules against aggression apply not only to attacks by regular forces but also to "the sending by or on behalf of a State of armed bands, groups, irregulars or mercenaries, which carry out acts of armed force against another State of such gravity as to amount to an actual armed attack conducted by regular forces" "or its substantial involvement therein."[<a href="#18">18</a>]   Hezbollah is part of the Lebanese Government and acts of Hezbollah can well be considered to be those of the Lebanese Government, notwithstanding that the Christian elements in the government have categorically disassociated themselves from the Hezbollah attack. Some elements of the Lebanese Army have collaborated with Hezbollah while as to the Lebanese government as such, at the very least it can be affirmed that they have taken no measures to prevent Hezbollah activity. Lebanon has a well-equipped army of some 50,000 soldiers however it has not even attempted to act against Hezbollah activities. Furthermore Lebanon is not in compliance with the UN Security Council resolution that called for "the disbanding and disarmament of all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias" and supporting "the extension of the control of the government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory."[<a href="#19">19</a>]   Notwithstanding the direct responsibility of Lebanon, Israel has refrained from attacking Lebanese targets other than those directly involved in support of Hezbollah activities such as roads bridges and airports used for as routes for bringing military supplies to Hezbollah.<br /> <br />It should be added that even if Lebanon could prove that it had done all within its power to prevent Hezbollah activities but failed, this would not negate Israel's right to take military action against Hezbollah and its support mechanism. If a State fails to prevent armed bands in its territory from attacking a neighboring state, the neighboring State, subject to the attack, is entitled to the right of self-defense against those armed bands.<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes<br /><br /><a name="1">1</a>. In its Advisory Opinion on <em>Legal Consequences Of the Construction Of A Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory</em> (2003-2004) the ICJ ruled that Israel had no right of self-defense as regards acts emanating in the Occupied West Bank since it was not an armed attack by a State. In the opinion of this author it is an incorrect ruling however it is not relevant to the Lebanese situation, Lebanon being undisputedly a sovereign State. <br /><br /><a name="2">2</a>.  Advisory Opinion, <em>The Legality of the Threat or use of Nuclear Weapons</em>, ICJ Reports 1996 p.226, 245. See also <em>Nicaragua</em> case ICJ Reports 1986. Para. 176.<br /><br /><a name="3">3</a>.  Malcolm N.Shaw, <em>International Law</em>. Fifth ed., Cambridge (2003) p. 1032. Brownlie refers to an armed attack as including attacks by "powerful bands of irregulars' in a "coordinated and general campaign." I.Brownlie, <em>International Law and the Use of Force by States</em>, Oxford (1963). P.279.<br /><br /><a name="4">4</a>.  See discussion of this issue below.<br /><br /><a name="5">5</a>.  On Hezbollah preparations with the aid of Iran: <em>Jomhouri-ye Eslami</em>, speech given by Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nassrallah on May 23, 2006: &quot;We can hit Israel&#39;s entire northern region with thousands of rockets... All of Israel is now within the range of our missiles. Its seaports, [military] bases, industrial plants and everything else are all within our range...&quot;.<br /><br />Iranian military source close to the Revolutionary Guards leadership revealed to the London Arabic daily <em>Al-Sharq Al-Awsat</em> details concerning Iran&#39;s role in training and arming Hezbollah: &quot;The Revolutionary Guards established 20 permanent missile bases within the strip [running along] the Israeli border. They also equipped Hezbollah with mobile bases, [i.e.] medium-sized trucks that can carry and launch missiles. Between 1992 and 2005, Hizbullah received approximately 11,500 missiles and rockets, 400 short- and medium-range pieces of artillery, [and] Aresh, Nuri and Hadid rockets. Last year, Hizbullah first received a shipment of large &#39;Uqab missiles with 333-millimeter warheads, and an enormous supply of SAM7 shoulder-[fired] anti-aircraft missiles as well as C802 missiles, copied from Chinese missiles, two of which were used in the attack on the Israeli ship the day before yesterday.&quot; <em>Al-Sharq Al-Awsat</em> (London), July 16, 2006.<br /><br /><a name="6">6</a>.  There has been no attempt for instance to deny applicability of Common Article 3, see debate in the US on this issue.<br /><br /><a name="7">7</a>.  Members of Hezbollah however are not entitled to POW status on capture. They manifestedly do not comply with the conditions of Article 4 of the IIIrd 1949 Geneva Convention. Israel is not a party to the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, and, furthermore, Hezbollah does not comply with the requirements of Articles 43 and 44 of the Additional Protocol.<br /><br /><a name="8">8</a>.  Neither Israel nor Lebanon are parties to the Statute of the ICC hence the Court has no jurisdiction unless such crimes are referred to the Court by the UN Security Council.<br /><br /><a name="9">9</a>.  In some conflicts the ICRC has encouraged non-State guerilla movements to declare that they will abide by the rules of armed conflict. The Hezbollah has taken no such step and they have avowedly declared that they are attacking civilian targets.<br /><br /><a name="10">10</a>.  The Palestinian Authority is in this context in some ways <em>sui generis</em> since it does not operate in the territory of a sovereign State and it itself has many of the attributes of a sovereign State.<br /><br /><a name="11">11</a>.  Article 52, Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.<br /><br /><a name="12">12</a>.  Apparently with the exception of a fuel depot at Beirut airport atta

Last October, the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced its first indictments, of Kony and four of his top commanders, transforming the cult-like, mysterious and violent rebel leader into one of the world&#39;s most wanted war criminals. But President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, who referred the case to the ICC in the first instance, is now offering amnesty to Kony and his fellow indictees. Amnesty, however, is antithetical to the ICC&#39;s mandate. Those seeking peace and justice in the region face more than a dilemma: they face a Catch-22.<br /><br />Will the ICC&#39;s threats of arrest disrupt the prospects for peace? Or has the ICC&#39;s intervention pushed Kony towards negotiation? If Kony negotiates, can the international community and an ICC still in its infancy tolerate an amnesty that allows him to escape judgment for his many crimes? The problems and solutions are so intertwined that at this juncture, neither prosecution nor a peace deal appears feasible.<br /><br />The violence in Northern Uganda has persisted for two decades, has cost thousands of lives and forced as many as two million people from their homes.<br />The chaos has spread into neighboring countries, with the LRA fighting in Southern Sudan, where an uneasy peace between Southern rebels and the government has just begun to be implemented. Having his lost refuge in Sudan, Kony moved to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country only partially emerging from conflict (and the site of one of the ICC&#39;s other &#39;situations.&#39;)<br /><br />While previous rounds of peace talks between the LRA and the Ugandan government have failed, the new government in South Sudan has initiated negotiations this week in what some have described as the &quot;last best chance&quot; at peace, for Uganda and its fragile neighbors.<br /><br />Demands for peace are strong, most vocally expressed by civil society and local leaders representing the estimated 1.6 million Ugandans forced into Internally Displaced Persons camps, where the United Nations has estimated an &#39;excess mortality&#39; rate of more than 1,000 persons per week (a figure nearly twice the estimated rate in Darfur).<br /><br />The ICC has stepped into this disaster, with the mandate to prosecute crimes of international concern. If the demands for peace are apparent, so too are the demands for justice, and the scale of atrocities committed by the LRA is virtually unquestioned, save by Kony himself, who dismisses them as fictions invented by the Ugandan government. The government, international human rights groups, and the International Criminal Court (ICC), are clear: the actions of Kony and many of his followers constitute international crimes.<br /><br />The ICC took action against Joseph Kony following Museveni&#39;s referral of the situation in Northern Uganda. For the ICC, the invitation was a blessing: a so-called &#39;state-party referral&#39; was seen as the best means for the ICC to take action, much prefered to the &#39;trigger&#39; mechanism by which the prosecutors would move on his own (<em>proprio motu</em>). For the newly established ICC, conscious of its critics (including the US administration), acting at the invitation of a government was far preferable to being seen as intervening in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.<br /><br />But then, what once seemed like a blessing could be a curse. By accepting Musevini&#39;s invitation to investigate the LRA (announced in London at a press conference where Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo and President Museveni stood side by side), Moreno-Ocampo appeared to the people in Northern Uganda as having taken Museveni&#39;s side. As such, the ICC became viewed locally as a protagonist in the conflict rather than a promoter of peace. An organization of NGOs and representatives of civil society has actually asked the ICC, point-blank, to withdraw its indictments in order that an extremely popular amnesty program could tempt combatants (many of whom were abducted as children and forced to fight) out of the bush.<br /><br />Now, amnesty and prosecution are both in play. In advance of peace talks, which were initially to begin in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, on 12 July, Uganda&#39;s President Museveni declared that he would grant Kony an amnesty if he reached a peace agreement and renounced terrorism. A condition of government participation was that the top LRA leader attend the talks. Kony refused to participate, apparently due to his fear of arrest and international prosecution. <br /><br />Kony meanwhile &quot;invited&quot; ICC investigators to his hideout in DRC to hear his side of the story, an offer declined by Moreno-Ocampo. He emphasized &quot;This is a court. The Court has to respect the law.... If these people want to give their version, they have to come to the court.&quot; Moreno-Ocampo has insisted that the ICC is under no obligation to respect an amnesty issued by the Ugandan government. He emphasizes the legal duties of the court, as against the political concerns now being raised. <br /><br />But the ICC has been embroiled in politics from the time it responded to Uganda&#39;s invitation. Its investigations have focused only on the LRA, and not the atrocities committed by the Ugandan military, contributing to the appearance that it lacks impartiality. A recent UN report noted that more than 90% of the fatalities in Northern Uganda are the reult of the policy of forced displacement, with 9% attributed to attacks by the LRA. <br /><br />For the communities closest to the violence, returning to their villages and therefore their livelihoods is paramount. The role of international prosecutions in this is unclear. <br /><br />Many observers suggest that Museveni simply saw the Court as another weapon in his arsenal against the LRA, and some Acholi tribal leaders have raised concerns that ICC indictment might actually intensify fighting, kidnapping, and atrocities. Museveni&#39;s cavalier attitude towards anything resembling justice can be seen in his one-sided request for investigation, carefully shielding his own officials, in his call for an amnesty, and indeed in the very way in which he called for an amnesty.<br /><br />Museveni has announced that he is prepared to revoke the arrest warrants -- a dubious statement given that the warrants are not his to revoke, and indeed Uganda is under a legal obligation to arrest Kony and the other indictees should the opportunity arise. Museveni railed against the Court and the United Nations, for having failed to arrest Kony and the other indictees just nine months after the warrants were issued. He suggested that, having failed to do so, the UN and the ICC had lost all moral authority to demand that cases be tried. <br /><b
r />It is unclear what Museveni&#39;s agenda is in offering amnesty. He could be seeking to draw Kony into the open so that he can be captured and turned over to the ICC, or killed. Or he could simply be feigning interest in a peace process to enhance his international standing, whilst remaining certain that Kony will refuse to meet. The latter explanation is often invoked by experts, who see in Kony, Museveni&#39;s justification for remaining in power.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the amnesty offer has been repeatedly extended, and the government sent its Security Minister to ask the ICC to quash the indictments. At the time of this writing, the Ugandan government had revised its demand that Kony and top leadership attend talks in Juba, indicating that they would negotiate with any legitimate LRA representatives. On the 14th of this month, an LRA delegation arrived to begin talks, but few have actually fought, and many were from abroad, meaning their authority to take decisions was unclear.<br /><br />The Vice-President of South Sudan, Riek Machar, who is convening the talks, has issued a plea to the ICC to refrain from pursuing Kony, stating &quot;...there is the need to separate the peace process from the legal process.&quot; But therein lies the problem: the legal and political processes are intimately linked. Amnesty might just help bring an end to the bloody fighting and might well be popular locally. Yet the ICC cannot support an amnesty, nor is Kony likely to put himself in a position where arrest is feasible in the absence of one.<br /><br /><br /><em>Amy Ross is Assistant Professor of Geography at the University of Georgia, and currently conducting research at the ICC in the Hague.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/about_us/aboutus_bios.html#jonathan">Jonathan Hafetz</a>, Associate Counsel with the <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a> at New York University School of Law and co-author of amicus briefs in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> and the Guantanamo detainee litigation, says that although <em>Hamdan</em> directly addressed only the handful of cases in which the administration has charged individuals before military commissions, the ruling reinforces why individuals cannot be detained at Guantanamo without a lawful process and undermines the administration's overall position on detentions in key respects...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/jonathanhafetz.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Supreme Court's recent decision in <a href="http://www.hamdanvrumsfeld.com/05-184.pdf">Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</a> marks a significant setback for the President's claims of unchecked executive power.  In <em>Hamdan</em>, the Supreme Court invalidated the military commissions established by the President at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo to try suspected terrorists of war-related crimes.  Yet, Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo's future remains uncertain.  <em>Hamdan</em> directly addressed only the handful of cases in which the administration has charged individuals before commissions; two lead lawsuits affecting the 460 detainees held indefinitely without charge and without due process are still pending in the District of Columbia Circuit, while potential legislation affecting both detention and trials at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo looms on the horizon.  Still, <em>Hamdan</em> reinforces why individuals cannot be detained at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo without a lawful process and undermines the administration's overall position in key respects.<br /><br />In <em>Hamdan</em>, the Court recognized the President's power to create military commissions generally, but concluded that the commissions established at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo were unlawful because they violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and Geneva Conventions of 1949.  Specifically, the Court found that the commissions violated <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj.htm#836.%20ART%2036.%20PRESIDENT%20MAY%20PRESCRIBE%20RULES">Article 36(b) of the UCMJ</a> because the rules prescribed by the President deviated significantly and without justification from the procedures used in courts-martial, the benchmark of military justice.  The Court further concluded that the commissions violated Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which establish minimal safeguards for the treatment of prisoners during wartime, because they were not "regularly constituted" courts.<br /><br />But Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo is not principally a site for military commissions; indeed, as noted above, only a handful of detainees have been charged.   Still, for the remaining 460 detainees, held in legal limbo and without any lawful process, the decision is significant in several respects.  First, as a threshold matter, the Court rejected the government's contention that the recently enacted <a href="/gazette/2005/12/detainee-treatment-act-of-2005-white.php">Detainee Treatment Act of 2005</a> ("DTA") eliminated federal habeas corpus jurisdiction over pending cases, describing the administration's construction of the statute as "insupportable."  In light of <em>Hamdan</em>, the D.C. Circuit, which is now considering the DTA's impact on challenges by Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees, must hold that habeas jurisdiction remains over pending habeas cases.<br /><br />Second, <em>Hamdan</em> casts doubt on the merits of the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detentions.  The Court rejected the administration's asymmetrical approach which invokes the law of war to justify unprecedented detention powers, but deliberately circumvents the very limits the law of war and domestic statutes incorporating it impose.  In <em>Hamdan</em>, the Court invalidated the commissions because they violated the UCMJ and the 1949 Geneva Conventions.  Previously, in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-6696.ZS.html">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a>, Justice O'Connor indicated that the detention of "enemy combatants," there defined narrowly as individuals seized on the battlefield while engaged in combat against American or allied troops, could not deviate from longstanding law-of war principles; otherwise, she suggested, the basis for such detentions would "unravel."  By reaffirming the constraints imposed on the administration by the law of war, <em>Hamdan</em> endorses the proposition that individuals may be held as long as they are properly subject to law of war and their detention is pursuant to a lawful process.<br /><br />Third, the Court's analysis of the uniformity requirement under Article 36(b) of the UCMJ undermines the administration's position on Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detentions.  In discussing how the commissions deviated fundamentally from courts-martial, the Court focused on their procedural shortcomings, particularly the reliance on hearsay (including information obtained through coercion) and denial of a defendant's fundamental right to be present.  Yet, Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees (including Hamdan himself) are all being held indefinitely based upon a determination by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal ("CSRT") that lacks those very protections.  Further, the detainees have not even been afforded the various safeguards provided to military commission defendants under the rules <em>Hamdan</em> invalidated.  Among other things, the CSRT denied detainees the assistance of counsel and the presumption of innocence.<br />  <br /><em>Hamdan</em>, in short, would be meaningless if individuals can be held indefinitely (indeed, potentially for life) without a meaningful opportunity to test the factual and legal basis for their detention.  The Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution permits indefinite detention only in narrow circumstances and based upon rigorous procedural safeguards &#8212; precisely the opposite of the CSRT's sweeping definition of "enemy combatant" and woefully inadequate fact-finding process.  And, the Supreme Court already ruled two years ago in <em>Rasul v. Bush</em> that detainees are entitled to their fair day in court.  It is only persistent government stonewalling that has prevented them from having that opportunity.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the Court found that <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm">Common Article 3</a> applies to the conflict with al Qaeda.  In addition to imposing constraints on the use of military commissions, Common Article 3 prohibits "[o]utrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment," which the United Nations and others have documented at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.  Even suspected terrorists are necessarily entitled to certain fundamental safeguards and federal officials (including the CIA) can be prosecuted for war crimes under 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 2441 for grave breaches of the Conventions.  Thus, no longer can the administration claim, as it did in the now infamous "torture memos," that U.S. law permits treating prisoners in derogation of Common Article 3.<br /><br /> By striking down the President's unprecedented system for trying terrorist suspects, the Supreme Court exposed the military commissions for what they are: the appearance, but not the reality, of a lawful process.  Just as the executive cannot disregard the nation's Constitution and laws in trying alleged terrorists, it cannot cast aside those legal protections by detaining them indefinitely with even fewer safeguards to prove their innocence.<br /> <br /><br /><em>Jonathan Hafetz, an attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, co-authored amicus

		<title>Israel v. Hezbollah: Article 51, Self-Defense and Pre-emptive Strikes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law says that Article 51 of the UN Charter is probably broad enough to cover Israel&#39;s actions against Hezbollah in Lebanon following the kidnappings of its soldiers but would not have excused a pre-emptive strike...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kellyupdated.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>t has been suggested that an overly punitive form of self-defense is now operating in international law, most recently manifested by the muscular Israeli military response to Hezbollah in Lebanon, but begun by the U.S. invasion of Iraq.  Those who suggest this fear that the U.N. Charter will be undermined and the right of self-defense under Article 51, traditionally regarded as limited, will be rendered meaningless.  I fully share that fear.<br /><br />But let&#39;s not confuse doctrines and threats.  The real threat to Article 51&#39;s continued vitality as a limit on aggressive military action is the re-emergence of the pre-emptive strike doctrine much more than a rather expansive interpretation of self-defense in response to an attack.<br /> <br />Article 51 provides simply: &quot;Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.&quot;  These terms were universally acknowledged to cover America&#39;s invasion of Afghanistan and toppling of the Taliban government after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the U.S. by al Qaeda.  No U.N. Security Council resolution was necessary to cover the military action since Article 51 had been triggered and Article 5 of the North Atlantic Charter brought NATO into play working in concert with U.S. forces.  It was inconsequential that neither Afghanistan proper, nor the Taliban government in particular, actually carried out the attacks on New York and Washington; the tolerance and support of the al Qaeda terrorist organization gave rise to an agency type of relationship that imputed liability back to Afghanistan.<br /> <br />In contrast, President Bush could not muster support from either the Security Council or NATO for invading Iraq.  Consequently, he had to fit that invasion into the terms of Article 51.  The main problem was that the U.S. had not suffered an armed attack.  The president&#39;s lawyers cleverly argued that the word &quot;inherent&quot; in Article 51 bootstrapped in all the self-defense doctrines that existed at the Charter&#39;s signing in 1945.  Thus, the pre-emptive strike doctrine (used by Japan against the U.S. in 1941 at that time) survived the Charter and existed within Article 51.  However, even that stretch wouldn&#39;t cover invading Iraq because the doctrine required the showing of an imminent threat to justify the pre-emptive strike, and Iraq by any measure posed no such threat to the U.S.  So it was that the president manufactured the WMD allegations and unilaterally altered the triggering mechanism of the doctrine - lowering it to an emerging threat, which Iraq plausibly would be if it indeed possessed or was creating nuclear weapons.<br /> <br />Israel&#39;s invasion of Lebanon is more like the Afghanistan scenario and less like the Iraq scenario.  The kidnapping of two Israeli soldiers and killing of three others was an attack, however small, that occurred on Israeli soil and was carried out by a terrorist organization (Hezbollah) tolerated if not supported by Lebanon.  Israel&#39;s invasion of Lebanon is not a pre-emptive strike.  <br /><br />So does Article 51 cover Israel&#39;s action against Lebanon just as it did America&#39;s invasion of Afghanistan?  Probably.  The fundamental question here is what constitutes an &quot;armed attack&quot; sufficient to draw a massive military response?  Killing 3 people and kidnapping another 2 at the border is not the equivalent of killing 3,000 people and destroying two skyscrapers in downtown Manhattan.  So if this becomes a question of scale, is Hezbollah&#39;s provocation the same as al Qaeda&#39;s?  No.  But al Qaeda did not continue attacking the U.S.  Hezbollah continues attacking Israel causing more death and destruction with its hundreds of rocket firings all the way to Haifa.  Consequently, the question of scale eventually becomes moot, as more and more armed attacks bolster Israel&#39;s reliance on Article 51&#39;s terms.<br /> <br />That Lebanon suffers for Hezbollah&#39;s actions is a point of state responsibility in international law.  States are responsible for harmful elements leaving their territory and damaging other states, as was established many years ago in the Trail Smelter case.  Before the Charter, reprisal would have been an option.  But I don&#39;t believe that reprisals or pre-emptive strikes survived the Charter, which now legally occupies the field despite what President Bush asserts to the contrary.  Short of a customary norm emerging to support the redirection of Article 51, that provision holds.  And it continues to hold and cover situations such as the Israeli invasion.  Until the Security Council intervenes, Israel&#39;s right of self-defense remains intact.  That the U.S. can handily veto Security Council resolutions that seek to terminate Israel&#39;s right is an accident of history and lucky for Israel.  When Syria was a client state of the Soviet Union years ago, a similar relationship would have been in play.<br /> <br />Disproportionate military responses to armed attacks are not good for the system and not wise to carry out in that they can provoke stronger retaliatory strikes - as Israel has unfortunately witnessed with increasing Hezbollah rocket attacks.  However, it is for the initial attacker to judge the likely response and bear the consequences of his attack.  Israel&#39;s historic responses to armed attacks and strong military capacity speak for themselves, so whoever attacks them should be on notice of what they can expect in return.  Attacking the Cayman Islands would draw a much weaker response of course.  There are no factual equals among states in this regard, despite the legal maxim that all states are equal under international law.  <br /><br />The lesson:  be careful which beehive you whack with a stick.  The larger one will produce more stings in response and Article 51 allows for that.  What Article 51 does not allow is for the bees to sting you first.  Thus, Israel&#39;s pre-emptive strike in 1981 against the Osarik nuclear reactor in Baghdad was universally condemned, even by the U.S.  However, Israel&#39;s recent invasion of Lebanon has not even been condemned by the Arab League and is tacitly supported by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan.<br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ndlaw/faculty/facultypages/oconnell.html">Mary Ellen O&#39;Connell</a> of Notre Dame Law School says that the principle of proportionality in the use of force is a necessary, sensible and humane doctrine of international law that Israel and Hezbollah would do well to respect in the latest Middle East conflict...<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/oconnellnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font> number of world leaders responding to Israel's forceful reaction to the Hamas and Hezbollah raids in recent weeks have called it justifiable but disproportionate.  Applying the international law on the use of force supports both assessments.  International law regulates both when force may be initiated (<em>jus ad bellum</em>) and how it must be conducted (<em>jus in bello</em>).  The most important rule in either category may well be the principle of proportionality.  Any use of force, to be lawful, must be proportionate.(<a href="#1">1</a>)<br /><br />At the end of June, Hamas militants conducted a raid on Israel from Gaza, kidnapping an Israeli soldier.  About two weeks later, Hezbollah militants based in southern Lebanon launched rockets into northern Israel and also conducted a raid, capturing two Israeli soldiers, killing three and wounding two.  Israel responded to the first incident with heavy bombardment of Gaza, destroying the power station in addition to other civilian infrastructure and killing civilians.  In response to the Hezbollah raid, Israel bombed Lebanon, including the city of Beirut in central Lebanon, Beirut's port and airport.  It imposed a maritime blockade.  A week after the bombing of Lebanon began, Israeli tanks crossed into the southern Lebanon. Hundreds of Lebanese civilians had died by July 19, with no end to the Israeli action in sight.  Hezbollah has launched counter-attacks, killing scores of Israeli civilians.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/mideastconflict.php">Middle East Conflict</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2006/07/middle-east-crisis-meeting-un-security.php">Middle East crisis meeting</a> [UN Security Council]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />Israel had the right under international law to take defensive measures in response to the Hamas and Hezbollah raids.  Any use of military force, however, must respect the principle of proportionality.  This is a general principle of international law, meaning it is inherent to the system.  It is also reflected in both treaties and customary international law.  There is no question that it is binding on all parties using force. The principle prohibits attacking a military objective if doing so will result in a loss of civilian life, damage to civilian property or damage to the natural environment that outweighs the value of the objective.  Our contemporary understanding of proportionality is informed by Article 51(5)(b) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions defining an indiscriminate attack.  Such an attack is one "which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated."  <br /><br />The principle of proportionality works in conjunction with other fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, including the principles of discrimination, necessity, and humanity.  The principle of discrimination prohibits the intentional targeting of civilians, persons no longer taking part in fighting because of injury, surrender and the like, and civilian property.  Additional Protocol I, Article 51(2) provides, "The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack.  Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited."  Parties using armed force may only intentionally target military objectives, and, even then, the proportionality calculation must be applied: Will the "collateral" damage be too great to justify the attack?<br /><br />Additional Protocol I Article 52(2) identifies military objectives, incorporating the principle of necessity:  "Attacks shall be strictly limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage."  <br /><br />Basic humanity must also always be observed.  The excessive use of force, targeting civilians, destroying civilian infrastructure and so forth are not only considered disproportionate, unnecessary, and indiscriminate, but also inhumane.<br /> <br />Closely related to these principles is the principle of proportionality as it relates to the decision to resort to force in the first place.  It is important to note that the legal context in which the two raids took place differs.  Israel had a stronger basis for sending troops into Gaza than into Lebanon. In both cases, Israel had the right to take responsive action of a defensive nature, but the right did not arise to the right of self-defense as that term of art is understood in international law.  By deciding to use force of an extensive nature, including sending troops into Lebanon, Israel acted disproportionately.<br /><br />Self-defense in international law is governed by United Nations Charter Article 51.  Article 51 gives states the right to use force in self-defense if an armed attack occurs.  This means, as the International Court of Justice clarified in its 2004 <em>Wall</em> advisory opinion, that a significant armed attack for which a sovereign state is legally responsible may be met with the military force necessary to defend the victim from the attacker.  The defense may be taken to the territory of the attacker and the ability to attack again eliminated.  The defense of Kuwait after the invasion by Iraq in 1990 is the textbook case.  Pushing the Iraqi army out of Kuwait and creating a buffer zone was what was necessary to defend Kuwait.  Going all the way to Baghdad was not necessary and would have involved, therefore, a disproportionate use of force.<br /><br />By contrast to the Kuwait case, the case of Hamas in Gaza is much more complicated.  It seems most accurate to continue to treat Gaza as an area of occupation.  Palestine as a whole is not yet a sovereign state, in part because Israel is still in occupation of the West Bank.  Israel pulled its settlements from Gaza but seemed to continue to exercise a sort of quasi-occupation of Gaza.  Israel has the legal obligation to end its occupation, but, while the occupation continues it has the right to keep order.  Thus, Israel may have had a lawful basis for responding to Hamas that included sending forces into Gaza.
  The forces needed to respect the principle of proportionality in using force to respond to Hamas.      <br /><br />The situation is different respecting Hezbollah and Lebanon.  Lebanon is a sovereign state.  Under the current publicly available facts, Lebanon is not legally responsible for Hezbollah's raid into Israel.  Hezbollah's acts were not those of a sovereign state and thus do not give rise to the right of self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter.  Even if the facts later show that Lebanon was responsible, the Hezbollah raid would still not give rise to the right of self-defense.  Such low-level acts of violence are considered "incidents". <br /><br />The ICJ made this point in the 1986 <em>Nicaragua Case</em>.  The Court distinguished minor armed exchanges or "frontier incidents" from attacks that give rise to the right of self-defense.(<a href="#2">2</a>) In 2005, the Ethiopia-Eritrea Claims Commission found that the armed exchange between Ethiopian and Eritrean troops in the town of Badme did not give rise to the right of Eritrea to use the level of force permitted in self-defense.(<a href="#3">3</a>)  World leaders calling Israel's conduct disproportionate seem to be reflecting this understanding.  Israel could react to the raid and the kidnapping of its two soldiers, but to launch a major assault as far as Beirut in response to this crime was disproportionate.<br /><br />Subsequent to initiating force against Lebanon, Israeli leaders have stated their goal in using force was to cripple Hezbollah.  This is much the same reason it gave for invading Lebanon in 1982.  In 1982, however, Lebanon was in the midst of a civil war.  <br /><br />The country was in no condition to control events on its territory.  In such a situation, Israel likely did have the right to use force in self-defense on the territory of Lebanon.  When Israel advanced all the way to Beirut, however, far from the area where the attacks on it originated, it violated the principle of proportionality.  This is the position that even the United States government took at the time.<br /><br />Prior to Israel's latest incursion, Lebanon was not in a civil war.  No one would say it had achieved an adequate level of stability and self-government, but neither was it a situation of chaos as in 1982.  It was under a Security Council mandate in Resolution 1559 to disarm Hezbollah.  That needed to be done, but this failure did not mean the territorial integrity of Lebanon could lawfully be disregarded.  Nor did Israel have a unilateral right to enforce the Security Council resolution.<br /><br />In the <em>Nicaragua Case</em>, the International Court of Justice said the victim of wrongdoing in a border incident must use counter-measures in response as there is not right of self-defense.  Counter-measures are otherwise unlawful acts, not involving the use of significant armed force, taken in response to a prior unlawful act as long as they are proportional to the harm caused by the wrong.  The most common forms of counter-measures are economic sanctions, but the potential range is wide.  For example, attempting to rescue the kidnapped soldiers would have violated Lebanon's territorial integrity&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;a wrong, but Lebanon is at least guilty of a failure of due diligence regarding Hezbollah for which such a counter-measure might have been an appropriate response.<br /><br />This brings us back to proportionality.  Counter-measures are also governed by a principle of proportionality.  The measure taken in response must be proportionate to the harm caused by the wrong.  Proportionality requires assessment of the means to accomplish the lawful objective.<br /><br />When states have no right to resort to force or no right to resort to force to the extent they do, the principle of proportionality governing the conduct of force still applies.  Lawful targets are targets that help to achieve the military purpose of the state using force even if that purpose is unlawful.  When the United States and its coalition partners invaded Iraq in 2003, for example, they had no legal right to do so.  Still, we judge the proportionality of the use of force against the stated purpose of changing the regime in Iraq.  It is probably the case, however, that in assessing military objectives and the proportionate use of force in achieving them, an unlawful purpose colors the assessment.  <br /><br />Israel's purpose in attacking Lebanon is apparently to disable Hezbollah as a militant force.  As indicated above, this purpose is arguably impermissible under the <em>jus ad bellum</em>.  Nevertheless, we need to distinguish between targeting Hezbollah rocket sites, a lawful military objective, from targeting Beirut's port, airport, power stations, bridges, residential areas, and the like.  Even with regard to the rocket sites and stockpiles, the proportionality of the attacks must be weighed.  World leaders likely had in mind this calculation but also the sense that responding to Hezbollah for the raid was justifiable; using force on a major scale to respond to another problem rendered the force used disproportionate.  <br /><br />Israel's ambassador to the United Nations speaking at a pro-Israel rally responded to charges that Israel was using disproportionate force.  He said, "You're damn right we are."(<a href="#4">4</a>)  This statement was not only an admission that Israel has acted unlawfully, it is also a prediction that Israel is unlikely to achieve the peace its people surely desire.  The principle of proportionality is one of those principles of international humanitarian law that reflects basic moral consensus and as such is linked to achievement of peace and conflict prevention.  <br /><br />As long ago as St. Augustine (354-430 A.D.) it has been understood that waging war in a way that respects shared understandings of acceptable conduct helps to win the peace.  Augustine taught that war should always be conducted with an eye on the peace.  It was with this perspective in mind that Abraham Lincoln ordered the first codification of the law of land warfare to govern the conduct of Union forces in the field.  It did not matter that the Confederacy would not be abiding by those rules.  What mattered for Lincoln was that the war would end and that the belligerents would be able to live together in peace.  Treating the enemy proportionately, in accord with ancient principle, helped achieve that goal. <br /> <br />------------------<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes<br /><br /><a name=1>1</a>.

US Army (Ret.) and former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters, now a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that use of force in Lebanon and other conflict zones is legally governed by fundamental &quot;targeting principles&quot; that must be applied in good faith based on what is known before an attack is ordered....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/cornforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel taking place primarily in Lebanon and the resulting media images of the devastating effects of modern weaponry have triggered a number of timely and excellent legal commentaries on the principles of the law of armed conflict and potential criminal responsibility for violations of this law harming civilians and other non-combatants.  Several of these have already been published on JURIST.  As reflected in these commentaries, it is clear that the use of force during this conflict must be regulated by fundamental legal principles.<br /><br /> Most military legal advisers are well versed in these rules, often referred to within the military community as "targeting principles".  This characterization reflects the legal framework they provide for assessing the legality of employing military force to achieve a given military objective (traditionally understood as bringing to submission your military opponent).  While much commentary to date has focused on the principle of proportionality, assessment of whether a contemplated application of combat power violates that principle is only one of several steps in this target analysis process.  Outlining the overall target analysis framework aids in placing the principle of proportionality as it is applied in contemporary military operations into a broader and more comprehensive perspective.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/mideastconflict.php">Middle East Conflict</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2006/07/middle-east-crisis-meeting-un-security.php">Middle East crisis meeting</a> [UN Security Council]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />Before discussing this framework, however, it is important to note that the analysis military lawyers and commanders are taught to conduct is prospective in nature.  With all the discussion related to whether the conduct in this conflict will provide a basis for individual criminal responsibility, it seems important to emphasize this basic aspect of the target analysis process.  There is certainly no question that individuals who violate this law are subject to such criminal responsibility.  But focusing on the question of liability has potential to distort the functional application of this law.  Commanders bear an obligation to assess target legality based on the best information available, applying the law in good faith.  Ultimately, any assessment of criminal responsibility must be based on the facts available to the military decision-maker when the attack was ordered.<br /><br />The effectiveness of this framework is absolutely contingent on the two elements mentioned above: seeking out and considering all available information related to the potential target; and applying the legal standard in good faith.  Ignoring either of these components will severely compromise the utility of this law.  In United States practice (and that of several other nations), the participation of legal advisers in the targeting process is intended to help ensure such compromise does not occur.  In fact, one lesson learned by the U.S. armed forces has been that establishing an effective process for target selection is a critical aspect of ensuring compliance with the law.  While the extent of this process will certainly vary between levels of command and types of operations, this basis target legality assessment is integral to the effective command of combat power.<br /><br />All targeting decisions begin with the initial application of the rule of military objective.  This rule is intended to effectuate the principle of distinction by ensuring that the destructive effects of combat power are applied only against those people, places, and things whose destruction or neutralization offer a definite military advantage.  This rule of military objective is understood as a binding norm of customary international law.  For this United States, this conclusion is reflected by the fact that one year prior to the rule appearing in Article 52(2) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, it was included in a change to Field Manual 27-10, the U.S. military's statement of the law of land warfare.  According to that change:<blockquote>Military objectives&acirc;&#8364;&#8221; i.e., combatants, and those objects which by their nature, location, purpose, or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;are permissible objects of attack (including bombardment).</blockquote>While a detailed discussion of this rule is beyond the scope of this commentary, it is important to point out two critical aspects.  First, is the emphasis on "circumstances ruling at the time".  This is understood as a clear mandate to military decision-makers that speculative advantage does not justify treating something as a military objective.  In addition, the term "definite" in relation to military advantage is also understood to limit speculation in this process.<br /><br /> In practice, these decisions are often made in the extremis of combat.  But such reality was well understood by the drafters of Additional Protocol I, which contains the authoritative statement of the rule.  In a normal targeting process, the staff intelligence officer plays a critical role in aiding the commander to assess the potential value of a target.  In many cases, this determination is made at higher levels of command &#8212; with designated target "sets" provided to tactical commanders.  However, it is an inherently flexible process, and even at the lowest levels of command application of the rule relies fundamentally on the judgment of military commanders based on the best information available.  The targeting process is therefore designed to rapidly inform the decision-maker of the purported value of target destruction; the means available to achieve such destruction; the potential collateral consequences of such destruction; and the alternatives to target engagement.<br /><br /> What is clear from this history related to this rule is that international law does not condone characterizing as a military objective anything that might offer some slight advantage to an enemy.  The intent of the rule is to limit this designat
ion of military objective to military objects and other non-military objects that directly and meaningfully contribute to the enemy's military capability.  Thus, while the concept of "dual use" targets &#8212; targets that are used by both civilians and enemy military forces &#8212; can indeed justify designation as a military objective, the value to the military of the target must be more than marginal or speculative.  Once again, good faith is essential, for only good faith application of this principle provides a barrier to designating everything in enemy territory as a military objective.<br /><br /> Once it is determined that something is a lawful military objective, the second principle of the targeting process must be applied.  This principle, often referred to as the principle of "proportionality", is intended to prohibit an otherwise lawful application of combat power to essentially become "indiscriminate" as a result of the unintended harmful effects.  It is this principle that mandates assessment of potential collateral damage and incidental injury resulting from an attack.<br /><br /> It is important to note, however, that although "proportionality" is often used to characterize this principle, Additional Protocol I, which includes the most authoritative codification of these targeting principles under a section of the treaty developed to protect the civilian population, does not include a rule of proportionality.  Instead, the principle is a sub-component of the broader prohibition against launching indiscriminate attacks.  Such attacks are clearly prohibited by both treaty and custom.  However, "disproportionate" collateral damage is only one type of prohibited indiscriminate attack.  Others include using a weapon that is not or cannot be directed to a military objective; using a weapon the effects of which cannot be effectively controlled therefore disabling the ability to distinguish between lawful and unlawful objects of attack; treating as one military objective for purposes of bombardment a group of distinguishable objectives in a civilian populated area (saturation bombing).  <br /><br /> What is commonly referred to as "proportionality" is in fact best understood as an "imputed" indiscriminate attack.  When an attack on an otherwise lawful military objective inflicts excessive collateral damage or incidental injury, it is treated for purposes of the law of armed conflict as indiscriminate, and therefore prohibited.  Note that the key term in this analysis is not disproportionate, but instead excessive.  This term is used both in Additional Protocol I, and in Field Manual 27-10, which again predated the Protocol when it was amended to include the following provision:<blockquote>Unnecessary Killing and Devastation<br /><br />Particularly in the circumstances referred to in the preceding paragraph (the rule of military objective), loss of life and damage to property incidental to attacks must not be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained. Those who plan or decide upon an attack, therefore, must take all reasonable steps to ensure not only that the objectives are identified as military objectives or defended places within the meaning of the preceding paragraph but also that these objectives may be attacked without probable losses in lives and damage to property disproportionate to the military advantage anticipated.</blockquote>This extract reflects the "proportionality" standard that is taught and applied to U.S. military legal advisers, and many others around the world (having studied with several IDF legal advisers, it is my understanding that Israel applies this same standard).  It emphasizes that commanders bear an obligation to balance probable loss of civilian and damage to civilian property against concrete and direct expected military advantage.  But the assessment is ultimately a question of whether the collateral damage or incidental injury will be excessive, a term used in both the U.S. Army Field Manual and Additional Protocol I.<br /><br /> There are many other principles related to the targeting process.  These include qualified warning requirements, and the principle that an enemy does not gain immunity from attack by locating military objectives in the midst of civilians or civilian objects (itself a violation of the law, as pointed out by Professor D'Amato).  However, it is the relationship between the principle of military objective and the prohibition against indiscriminate attacks &#8212; to include those that are considered indiscriminate by imputation &#8212; that form the framework of this process, which is essentially a mechanism to ensure distinction between lawful and unlawful objects of attack.  It is this framework that operational legal advisers rely on to assist commanders and other military decision-makers struggling through the challenge of real time decisions related to the application of combat power during armed conflict.  <br /><br />Good faith is the essential foundation of this framework. While the law of war undoubtedly includes a degree of flexibility to address unusual battlefield challenges, good faith must inevitably mandate restraint when a potential target lies at the fringe of reasonableness.  Any other interpretation has the potential to set the clock back to the unacceptable notion of "total war", where distinction between an enemy force and an enemy people became meaningless in the name of military necessity.<br /> <br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S.

The most surprising and most significant of these came in New York, where the Court of Appeals rejected state constitutional claims to same-sex marriage. I want to explore some effects of the decision on the cause of same-sex marriage.<br /><br />First, the New York decision may be followed by other state courts. Right now, litigation is pending in 8 state court systems. We await decisions from the high courts of two states, New Jersey and Washington. New York is a large state and its courts are well regarded.<br /><br />At the same time, it's a politically liberal state. The New York decision could provide cover, jurisprudentially and politically, to judges in other states who want to reject gay-marriage claims but who are concerned about the perception of legal elites that they are denying the next great civil-rights cause. If New York's high court can do it, it can't be blind bigotry or ignorance to reject these claims, can it? <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">Same-sex marriage</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2006/07/new-york-same-sex-marriage-ban-ruling.php">New York same-sex marriage ban ruling</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />The New York decision could be influential on this issue in a way that, say, the Alabama Supreme Court would not be. The New York opinion may therefore damage the prospects of gay-marriage litigants elsewhere.<br /><br />I would not make too much of this, however. Judges will tend to have a view of the issue going in, and I doubt that they'll be converted by the opinion of four judges in Massachusetts in one direction or four judges in New York in the other direction.<br /><br />A second effect may be to soften the remedial demands made by future gay-marriage litigants. Instead of insisting on full marriage or nothing, as the New York plaintiffs did, perhaps litigants will be more likely to settle for an alternative status, like civil union or domestic partnership, that offers the benefits and rights of marriage without the name.  This might marginally increase their chances for success.<br /><br />Future state courts might see the current landscape as offering three models for resolution of gay-marriage claims: Massachusetts (full marriage), New York (nothing), and Vermont (civil unions, with directions to the state legislature to work out the details). They might see the Vermont resolution as a middle position between the extremes of New York and Massachusetts, allowing them to give gay couples the benefits and protections of marriage without risking the political backlash that comes with the word "marriage."<br /><br />A third effect should be to reduce and to delay litigation arising from inter-state conflicts in marriage law. New York is the third most populous state, with a high concentration of homosexuals. Its residents, especially in New York City, are highly mobile. In short order, its gay married residents would have moved to or traveled in other states, gotten into legal conflicts with each other or with third parties, and sought some out-of-state recognition for their relationships.<br /><br />I think discordant state policies in this area can be dealt with under traditional legal principles. And these conflicts will occur anyway, since we already have gay marriage and alternative statuses in a few states.  But there is no doubt the sheer number of such issues coming from New York would have heightened tensions over the gay-marriage issue very quickly and added to calls for a national resolution via constitutional amendment.<br /><br />Fourth, perhaps there's a silver lining in the New York loss for gay-marriage advocates. Losing such an important judicial decision may force the gay-marriage movement to emphasize legislative progress, which will produce gains that are more durable and less likely to infuriate opponents than are court victories.<br /><br />Will the New York decision in fact re-order priorities toward legislation? Certainly in New York the legislature is for now the only available arena. But with Republicans fairly comfortably in control of the state senate and presently the governor's mansion, gay marriage is not coming to New York anytime soon. Instead, New York will have to be one of the states where, if progress is to be made in the near-term at all, it will have to be made by degrees.<br /><br />Outside New York, the decision might indeed signal the beginning of the end for the strong emphasis on litigation that has marked the early stage of the gay-marriage cause. Despite the exaggerated claims of some federal amendment supporters, there aren't that many state court systems likely to be hospitable to gay-marriage claims for the foreseeable future. (The federal courts are hopeless, as litigation strategists know.) While gay-marriage litigation strategists might once have hoped to build momentum for a state-by-state judicial sweep, producing a few initial court victories in very friendly states that would lead to later court victories in less friendly states, that hope has been diminished by the New York defeat and even more by the political backlash to gay marriage.<br /><br />Once existing litigation has worked its way through those few state court systems where litigants have a reasonable prospect of success, as such litigation is now doing, gay-marriage advocates will have to turn primarily to legislatures.<br /><br />As in other social and political movements in this country, the courts will have helped along the way by highlighting the strength of the principled arguments and especially by getting some isolated experiments started. But there will be no substitute for making the case to the people and their representatives.<br /><br /><br /><em>Dale Carpenter is the Julius E.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.fiu.edu/faculty/faculty_foley.htm">Elizabeth Price Foley</a> of Florida International University College of Law says that President Bush&#39;s veto of stem cell research legislation is an abuse of his constitutional authority antithetical to the rulings of the US Supreme Court...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/elizabethfoley.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>F</strong></font>or the first time in his presidency, President Bush last week exercised raw power to veto legislation, rejecting a bill that would have expanded federal funding for stem cell research cells from discarded embryos created by in vitro fertilization (IVF).  He explained that a veto was necessary to prevent "the taking of innocent human life" because "each of these human embryos is a unique human life with inherent dignity and matchless value." By exercising the veto in this manner, the President has abused his Executive Power and violated his Article II oath to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."  <br /><br />The Constitution, as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court for the last thirty-three years, does not recognize pre-viable embryos as "human life."  Although there has been fierce continuing debate about when constitutionally cognizable life begins, the law has remained essentially unchanged since the 1973 decision in <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, when the Court declared that "the word 'person,' as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn."  The Court further concluded that the government's interest in protecting a "potential" life is not sufficiently compelling to justify infringing the fundamental liberty to choose parenthood until the point of viability, "because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb."  At the point of viability, in other words, there are two lives deserving of governmental consideration and protection; prior to that time, the liberty of the already born is paramount.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Video: <a href="/monitor/2006/07/bush-stem-cell-research-statement.php">Bush stem cell research statement</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2006/07/stem-cell-research-funding-bill-us.php">Stem cell research funding bill</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />The basic analytical framework of Roe has been reaffirmed numerous times by arguably much more conservative Supreme Courts, most notably in the 1992 decision in <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</em> and again in the 2000 decision in <em>Stenberg v. Carhart</em>.  These decisions make it clear that under the Constitution of the United States, parental liberty trumps any interest government might have in protecting pre-viable human embryos.  And whether President Bush supports the Court's constitutional interpretation or not, it is undeniably the law of the land.<br /><br />What does all of this mean for stem cell research and President Bush's veto?  First, it means that those who donate sperm and eggs to create IVF embryos have a constitutional liberty, subject to contractual modification, to decide whether those embryos should be born &#8212; thus making them parents. They can choose to implant the embryos and attempt pregnancy, freeze them indefinitely, discard them, donate them to others for adoption, or even donate them for medical research (including stem cell research).  Under the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court, giving these choices to potential parents is necessary in order to honor the "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clauses.  This word "liberty" is the source of our freedom to use contraceptives, avoid involuntary sterilization, and even employ IVF or other reproductive technologies in the first place.  We have, in short, a constitutional right to decide whether we want to bear or beget children.  And there is no such thing, constitutionally speaking, as a pre-viable "child."<br /><br />Second, it means that when President Bush justified the use of his veto power to prevent "the taking of human life," he was using Executive power to effectuate a personal moral view that is fundamentally antithetical to the law as declared by the Constitution and interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. He was defeating a legislative act &#8212; thwarting the will of "We the People" &#8212; to pursue an agenda contrary to our declared Constitution. <br /><br />I am not suggesting that the President abuses his power by holding intense moral beliefs and working for their enactment into law.  Presidents may (and should) lobby for legitimate constitutional change when they believe it desirable, as well as appoint federal judges who embrace harmonious views regarding constitutional interpretation. These kinds of activities are legitimate because they reflect presidential acceptance of and respect for the rule of law and the obligation, as the Chief Executive, to faithfully execute those laws while they are in effect.  <br /><br />But when a President vetoes a law because he disagrees with the constitutional rights the law acknowledges, he violates his oath of office and assumes near dictatorial power over both the legislative and judicial branches.  By vetoing the stem cell bill, President Bush was not preserving, protecting, and defending our Constitution: he was giving it the finger.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Elizabeth Price Foley is Professor of Law at Florida International University College of Law, where she teaches health care law and constitutional law.

Its criminal and brutal acts have been carried out while the international community has stood by and watched.<br /><br />Throughout our history, Lebanon has been subject to many wars which started on its soil and beneath its sky, sometimes for a reason and sometimes without a reason. Lebanon has been the victim of conflict, and disorder has only been fed by Middle East policymakers aiming to manipulate small countries for their own benefit. But the Lebanese people with their determination and their willingness to fight to rebuild their nation have always recovered.  <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/mideastconflict.php">Middle East Conflict</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2006/07/middle-east-crisis-meeting-un-security.php">Middle East crisis meeting</a> [UN Security Council]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />Now we have witnessed the evacuation of all foreign nationals from Lebanon, a situation that suggests an imminent war on an even bigger scale, once the evacuation is completed, that will leave Lebanon behind to be unfairly destroyed by Israel. <br /><br />By killing civilians in Lebanon, Israel is breaching all the treaties and international humanitarian laws that stipulate that it is only legal and ethical to attack valid military targets by distinguishing them and attacking them separately (i.e. dividing a district containing several military objectives into sub-targets and consequently attacking each target separately, rather that attacking the whole area).  Israel is using what is often called in the war dictionary "carpet bombing" or "area bombardment". To quote from an article by international law scholar Horst Fischer in the book <em>Crimes of War</em>:<blockquote>An explicit ban on area bombardment was first codified in the 1977 Additional Protocol 1, which applies to bombardments of cities, towns, villages, or other areas containing a concentration of civilians. <u>An attack by bombardments by any methods or means that treats as a single military objective, a number of clearly separated and distinct military objectives is considered to be an indiscriminate attack and is prohibited.</u> Launching such an attack in the knowledge that it will cause excessive loss of life, injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects is considered a grave breach". [emphasis added]</blockquote>Israeli forces are committing indiscriminate attacks by attacking civilians, innocent women and children, thus ignoring all the ethics of war specified in the Geneva Convention as well as in other war protocols and violating humanitarian law. The Hezbollah resistance militia has likewise violated the safety of civilians by firing sporadic Katyucha rockets on Israeli towns and villages. <br /><br />We believe that what is happening today stretches far beyond the issue of the prisoner exchange; Israel is imposing a collective sentence upon innocent Lebanese people for the wrong reasons.<br /><br />Although Lebanon informed Israel that the Lebanese government and the Lebanese people were not aware of, and did not approve the kidnapping of the two Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah, Israel has not recognized this fact, and is still insisting on holding all the Lebanese people responsible for a politically motivated decision taken by a specific party with regional affiliations.<br /> <br />We believe that the current chaos is the result of an international policy which manages the crisis in Lebanon specifically and in the Middle East in general in favor of some countries, instead of stopping it from spreading and  solving the problem at its roots. <br /><br />The main reason of the crisis and disorder in the Middle East is the adoption of a double standard, so that victims from one side do not have the same value as those on another side! Accountability is not universal in this Middle East, and the rule of law does not always prevail always as a universal principle. Many policymakers brainwash countries and communities and manipulate them, making them believe that they are fighting for their rights and existence while they are in reality serving other peoples&#39; interests. <br /><br />Despite the fact that leaders from all countries agree that true democracies should prevail in the Middle East and that peace and freedom and the rule of law should arise, we still find them adopting double standards, thus violating the principle of justice known as impartiality, based on the assumption that the same standards should be applied to all people, without regard to subjective based on ethnicity, class, gender or other distinction. In this respect we find some recent political speeches which have appeared to distinguish between the civilians killed in Lebanon and Israel to be outrageous, emphasizing the double standard principle instead of neglecting it. <br /><br />In line with the above, we would like to remind the international community that the war decision in Lebanon was not taken by the government and therefore it does not involve the country as such, and for that reason more restraints must be considered in this situation.<br /><br />We as Lebanese lawyers and citizens ask the United Nations to help us reach an immediate ceasefire and to help us impose the Lebanese government&#39;s sovereignty on all its territories in order to save the Lebanese people from the violent military campaigns conducted by Israel, as well as to save our country from serving other countries&#39; interests aiming to destroy its industry and devastate the entire population.<br /><br />A very relevant remark was made on CNN recently by an Israeli whose house in Haifa was hit by a Hezbollah missile. The reporter asked him, "What are your feelings?" He answered: "We have to talk to the enemy. The violence will never end this way. I still believe that negotiation and peace is the only way". Violence in the Middle East will never end until real negotiation takes place and a truly
neutral mediator seeks real understanding of the needs of each party.<br /><br /><br /><em>Gaby El Hakim is a lawyer in Beirut, Lebanon, and a board member of the <a href="http://www.bba.org.lb/templates/controls/index.aspx">Beirut Bar Association</a> Commission on Sport. <br /><br />Joe E.

John Radsan</a> of William Mitchell College of Law, president of the Iranian-American Bar Association, says that while the silence of Iranian-Americans in the midst of rising tensions between the US and Iran may have been benign up until now, recent history suggests that members of the community may soon need to speak up for themselves and for their rights...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/johnradsan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>f silence is significant, Iranian-Americans have made great news by having little to do with official relations between the United States and Iran.  As the two governments exchange proposals and threats about Iran's enrichment of uranium, a group with over 500,000 people has not done much to influence policies that affect their homelands.  Even if Iranian-Americans have not shaped a strategy to deal with Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, they should at least be commended for not helping either the United States or Iran make a case for war.<br /><br />Even by the low standards of the Middle East, we Iranian-Americans are disorganized.  As tragedy unfolded on September 11, we knew before others that Iranians had nothing to do with those attacks.  Unlike the Saudis in the plot, Iranians would have argued about who should fly the planes.  Some Iranians, dissatisfied with their titles, would have huffed off before take-off.  In our dark humor, we recognized our lack of team play, our pathology in preferring to be the president of a small group rather than the vice president of a much larger group.  For better or worse, we have mainly rendered ourselves neutral.<br /><br />Iranian-Americans differ from the Iraqi exile community that helped to shape (or to distort) American policy toward Iraq.  Yes, most of us follow the news in Iran.  Yes, some of us travel there.  But very few of us affect policies in Tehran or Washington.  We talk more than we accomplish.  At home, we dream to be like other ethnic groups: Indian-Americans and Mexican-Americans.  Rarely do we network as they do.  When we do, it leads more often to arguments than to deals.  Iranian-Americans who have succeeded in business&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;Ebay founder Pierre Omidyar and many others&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;keep a careful distance from the group.  Not many Iranian-Americans have been elected to public positions, and not many have been appointed.    <br /><br />Iranian-Americans split along many lines.  Some came here before the 1979 revolution in Iran.  Some came during the revolution.  Some came much later.  Some are citizens, some resident aliens.  Some are rich, some poor.  Some are secular, some devout.  Of the religious, most are Muslim, but some are Christian, some Jewish.  Most are Persians, but some are Azeri, Arab, Kurdish or Baluchi.  The Iranian-American scene in Washington differs from the scene in Texas.  And Los Angeles, renamed "Tehrangeles," is a world apart.  <br /><br />The Bush Administration has not necessarily ignored us.  Sometimes it has considered how it can use us.  But as a senior State Department official once told me, back when I ran an "Iran Commercial Initiative" for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, there may not be anyone who speaks for a unified Iranian-American community.  One group that is organized, the Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MKO), is on the American terrorism list and does not have much support in Iran.<br /><br />Iranian-Americans, in California and elsewhere, do have a diffuse influence on the Iranian nation.  Between the United States and Iran, there is a two-way flow of people, books, movies, radio programs, and satellite television.  As a result, Iranians are probably more pro-American than people in Saudi Arabia, America's supposed ally in the region.  <br /><br />By our inaction, Iranian-Americans may actually be doing a service.  We have learned from the Iraqi quagmire.  For us, it would be irresponsible to feed the fantasies of an instant change in Iranian regimes.  Democracy is not easily transplanted to the Middle East.  Change is more likely to come gradually from within than to be imposed from without.  Those are some of our lessons.<br /><br />Unlike the time when Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Iran from exile, it is not possible today for an Iranian who has lived away from his homeland to return there as a leader.  Iranians have been through too much &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a long war with Iraq, sanctions, economic stagnation, and oppression &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; to accept a Pahlavi prince from Virginia.  The powerful Iranian regime, led by a "Supreme Leader," still divides the country into two groups: insiders who are part of the clerical establishment and outsiders who are not.  Iranian-Americans, cast between two countries, are not a part of that equation.<br />  <br />For our two countries, we will hope for the best.  Perhaps the United States and Iran can negotiate through the impasse.  But we should also plan for the worst.  Perhaps the United States will attack Iran.  In that event, learning from our experiences during the 444 days of the hostage crisis, we should be organized enough to prevent ourselves from being scapegoats for angry Americans at home.  The risk is that the slurs and insults that were common here in 1979-1981 will descend into American internment camps.  For us, from international politics to domestic politics, silence has its limits.<br /><br /><br /><em>A.

The distinction is not just one of convenience, however; it has a substantive aspect.  For the legality of the conduct of the war has nothing to do with the question of who started it.  <em>Jus in bello</em> applies equally to all sides of a conflict.  This is sometimes hard for people to understand, but it is of critical importance.<br /><br /> Last week my <a href="/forumy/2006/07/international-law-aspects-of-mideast.php">editorial for JURIST</a> addressed the <em>jus ad bellum</em> aspects of the current Mideast conflict.  Today I examine allegations of war crimes committed by the parties to the conflict.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/mideastconflict.php">Middle East Conflict</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2006/07/middle-east-crisis-meeting-un-security.php">Middle East crisis meeting</a> [UN Security Council]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><strong>1.  Hezbollah</strong><br /><br /> There can be no doubt that every active member of the Hezbollah organization in Lebanon is guilty of participating in the war crime of crossboundary artillery fire on civilian targets.  The rocket attacks on Israeli towns and cities launched from within Lebanon violate one of the earliest and most explicit of war crimes: Article 25 of the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907:  "The attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings which are undefended is prohibited." <br /> <br /> It is no defense, as we have already seen by the distinction between <em>jus ad bellum</em> and <em>jus in bello</em>, for Hezbollah to say they are engaged in indiscriminate rocket attacks because Israel is doing the same thing, or because Hezbollah has no military alternative.  The Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah recently stated: "When the Zionists behave like there are no rules and no red lines and no limits to the confrontation, it is our right to behave in the same way."  He is suicidally incorrect.  He and his followers are committing war crimes for which the punishment is death or life imprisonment.    <br /><br /><strong>2.  Israel</strong><br /><br /> In April 2002, Israeli soldiers, preceding an invasion by ground troops, lobbed explosive artillery shells into the crowded Jenin refugee camp located in the West Bank.  This clear violation of Article 25 of the Hague Convention was met with silence from other states.  The government of Israel took no action against the artillery personnel.  A few American international lawyers called attention to the war crimes and were promptly excoriated as anti-Semites.  <br /><br /> The same thing happened more recently when heavy Israeli artillery shells were fired into Gaza.  Here there was perhaps a slight justification compared to Jenin.  The inhabitants of Gaza were shooting primitive home-made rockets across the border into Israel, causing, however, only slight damage.  Again, the Israeli government took no court-martial action against the soldiers who fired the explosive shells into Gaza.  <br /><br /> The idea that civilians in Gaza were participating in the terrorist war against Israel &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the so-called "dual use" argument &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; brought to mind a talk I gave a West Point a few years ago.  I argued that the greatest single war crime of the Second World War was the napalming of the north Tokyo suburbs &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the most densely populated areas in the world at that time, consisting solely of women, children, and the elderly living in wooden, flammable homes &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; by General Curtis LeMay and the Army Air Force.  It was a sheer act of terrorism, I argued, because of the absence of a modicum of military necessity.  A colonel, who had done an extensive study of the incident, replied that it was a dual-use area in which civilians were taking part in the war effort.  When I asked him to explain, he said that there was conclusive evidence that the women were darning socks and mending uniforms for the Japanese armed forces.<br /><br /> Whether the shelling of Jenin and Gaza amounted to "war crimes" importantly depends on characterizing Israel as an "occupying power," a designation that Israel does not accept.  Certainly the shelling amounted to murder under Israeli law, but what prosecutor would  have  the nerve to charge soldiers for common crimes?  In any event, when Israel started bombing Lebanon ten days ago, there could be no doubt that the conflict was legally subsumed under the laws of war.  For an international border&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;between Israel and Lebanon&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;was crossed, and thus under current international law the humanitarian laws of war fully apply to the situation.  This is an a fortiori argument from recent decisions of the Hague Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia, holding that even some within-border conflicts may be characterized as international conflicts.  <br /><br /> The armed conflict with Lebanon, involving as it did a transboundary attack, brought it immediately under the glare of the world media.  In the first few days, Israel seemed cautious in its air warfare against the Hezbollah.  Bombs were directed against known Hezbollah enclaves, power stations (to disrupt Hezbollah communications), and anything that looked like a rocket launcher.  In addition, Israel was justified in bombing ports, airports, bridges, and highways, and imposing a sea blockade against Lebanon, so as to prevent the Hezbollah from acquiring more missiles from friends abroad.  There was quite a breadth of permissible targets.  At the time I wrote my first Jurist editorial a week ago, it was not at all clear whether Israel had been violating any of the laws of war.<br /><br /> But in the last week it became evident that the Israeli bombardments were not succeeding in diminishing the number of daily Hezbollah rocket attacks against Israeli towns and cities.  Frustration set in.  It was apparent to all observers that Israel's air campaign was not doing the job of destroying the enemy's military capabilities.<br /><br /> Was this because Israel's vaunted intelligence services did not know that Hezbollah's missile centers were underground?  Bunker complexes connected by tunnels had been built over the past decade in numerous scattered locations in
 Lebanon.  They are camouflaged so that they cannot be seen from the air.  A ground-level door swings open when a missile is ready to be fired.  The bunker is "hardened" in the sense that only a direct hit would destroy it.  But in order to have a direct hit, the exact location of the bunker must be known.  Mossad and the other Israeli intelligence services had numerous agents wandering freely all over Lebanon during the past decade.  Why hadn't they pinpointed the location of each of those bunkers as they were being built?<br /><br /> The only feasible way in the absence of positional knowledge of getting rid of the bunkers and the missiles they contain is by a comprehensive search-and-destroy mission carried out by ground troops.  This has begun to happen, although on a curiously limited scale.  After three days of fighting, the Israeli Defense Forces have secured the town of Maroun al-Ras, a few miles inside the Lebanese border north of the Israeli town of Avivim.  In the process they located and destroyed a bunker complex that had been used to launch rockets into northern Israel.  Israel's IDF is large, and in addition reservists are being called into duty.<br /><br /> Israel thus has a militarily efficient way to get rid of Hezbollah's bunkers: an inexorable and comprehensive advance by ground troops.  Israel would also be well advised to use aerial surveillance to locate bunkers when they are launching missiles, spotting, if nothing else, the flash-fire.  But to be simultaneously engaging in a bombing campaign can obscure if not interfere with aerial reconnaissance.  Why, then, is Israel continuing to drop bombs on Lebanese territory?  For it is this very continuation of the bombing attack, rather than what occurred during the first few days of the attack, that could amount to a war crime implicating all of Israel's leaders on the theory of command responsibility.  For Israel surely knows by now, if it did not know earlier, that a bombing campaign is ineffective against missiles hidden in camouflaged bunkers.  Therefore the traditional war-crimes defense of "military necessity" to support the continuation of the bombing campaign can no longer be open to Israel. <br /><br /> Although statements and reports out of Lebanon are notoriously unreliable, there appears to be a sufficient confluence of internet posts that Israeli planes are now dropping their bombs and firing their missiles indiscriminately against civilian targets.  Grain silos, food production, and storage plants have been destroyed.  Bombs have reportedly been dropped on hospitals and on convoys of villagers fleeing from the Israeli shelling.  It is getting close to the kind of carpet bombing that occurred during the Vietnam war against Hanoi.  At that time, pilots were repeatedly sent out on bombing missions, told to return without any bombs, and not to disclose their targets.  The result, after the first visible military targets were bombed, was the bombing of civilian targets such as schools, hospitals, and the Hanoi dam.  These, too, were war crimes, and although the perpetrators were never prosecuted, at least the United States has never condoned them.  <br /><br />  Israel appears to be continuing its bombing campaign out of a sense of frustration, bitterness at the failure of the bombs to slow down Hezbollah's rocket launchings, and perhaps a homegrown political need to demonstrate to the Israeli public that "something is being done" about the rocket attacks.  The militarily inexperienced Olmert-Peretz government may think that its political future is at stake if the public is not reassured by daily bombardment of Lebanon.  But if these are the reasons for the continuation of the aerial campaign, they are among the feeblest of excuses for the commission of war crimes.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Anthony D.Amato is Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University, where he teaches international law and human rights. He was lead counsel for Milan Kovacevic, the first person charged with the crime of genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia at The Hague. </em><br />

But the status of the conflict under international law is not as easily encapsulated.  <br /><br /> The governing principle of international law does not use the term "war," but rather uses the term "armed attack."  This principle is found in Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter:<blockquote>Article 2(4).  All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.</blockquote>As all-encompassing as this principle seems on first reading, in fact it does not apply to the Lebanon-Israeli conflict.  <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/mideastconflict.php">Middle East Conflict</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2006/07/middle-east-crisis-meeting-un-security.php">Middle East crisis meeting</a> [UN Security Council]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /> Although it is true that both Lebanon and Israel are Member states of the United Nations, neither state regards the conflict as coming within the terms of Article 2(4).  The Lebanese government has disavowed the strikes by Hezbollah.  And Israel is taking pains to distinguish Lebanon from Hezbollah.  Indeed, Israel's primary condition for a cease-fire is that the Lebanese army occupy Lebanon's southern border (displacing the Hezbollah forces deployed there).  This is not a condition that Israel would insist upon if its target were the state of Lebanon.  <br /><br /> In addition, neither Lebanon nor Israel is attempting to strike against the other's territorial integrity or political independence.  <br /><br /> It is true that the Security Council, if it wished to be seised of this situation, would not be constrained by the wording of Article 2(4).  All that is needed is for the Security Council to determine is that there has been a threat to the peace, a breach of the peace, or an act of aggression (Article 39).  This would be an easy determination to make.  However at the present time neither China nor Russia are willing to make such a determination in the Security Council.  Their veto power ensures that the Security Council's hands are tied.<br /><br /> Thus we need a legal principle to characterize the Mideast conflict that is narrower than Article 2(4).  The principle is the recently minted Bush Doctrine.  In a National Security paper of September 2002, President Bush stated that the United States would target terrorists wherever they are found.  He went on:<blockquote>Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, control, and communications; material support; and finances.</blockquote>The community of nations quickly reached consensus as to the validity of this strategy under international law.  Hardly any nation has voiced an objection.  We may safely say that the Bush Doctrine is Israel's legal justification for the bombardment it is inflicting upon Lebanon.<br /><br /> A second aspect of the Bush Doctrine is that the United States will hold accountable any nation that harbors terrorists.  But it's a debatable question whether Lebanon is intentionally harboring Hezbollah; Lebanon would like to rid itself of this terrorist group.  Unfortunately for the Lebanese government, Hezbollah is too strong: it assassinates Lebanese leaders who voice a position against it; and it is also an elected minority party within the government itself.  <br /><br /> Although Israel could invoke this second (harboring) aspect of the Bush Doctrine, it does not at present wish to do so.  Israel has some hope that the moderate Lebanese in nominal control of the government will join Israel's fight against Hezbollah in a kind of Lebanese civil war.  More importantly perhaps is the consideration that an attack against an Arab state per se might provoke other Arab states in the region to give indirect aid to Hezbollah by giving direct aid to Lebanon.  One of the more curious political aspects of this conflict is the present unwillingness of all other Arab states to condemn Israel's military campaign.  <br /><br /> Israel is seeking the complete extermination of Hezbollah.  Any cease fire would give Hezbollah the chance to regroup and secure new weapons.  But in my opinion Israel's goal cannot be met.  For Hezbollah is in possession of some 12,000 missiles (as Israel concedes), the most powerful of which are two-stage rockets.  Israel also concedes that these rockets can reach downtown Tel Aviv.  It is less well known, and not openly conceded, that some or many of these rockets carry chemical and biological payloads.<br /><br /> For Hezbollah to send WMDs into Tel Aviv or Haifa (Israel's 2nd and 3rd largest cities) would invite nuclear retaliation.   <br /><br /> Yet the closer Israel gets to achieving its goal of destroying Hezbollah, the more likely the WMDs will be launched.  Suppose Israel comes close to annihilating Hezbollah to the point when only a few fanatics are left.  As they await their turn to die, what would they lose if they launched the WMD missiles?  Nothing.  What would they gain?  The virginal delights of heaven.<br /><br /><br /><em>Anthony D.Amato is Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University, where he teaches international law and human rights.</em><br />

Like the White House's negotiations with Saddam Hussein, this was a one-sided conversation. This bill is not a compromise. It is a sell out, of both Congress and the American people, and Specter's motivations for proposing it are utterly mystifying.<br /><br />The bill covers a number of areas. First, it provides that challenges to the NSA program and programs like it will may be transferred by the government to a secret intelligence court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review established under the 1978 <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA). Second, it opens the door for courts to decide that the president has surveillance powers not specified by statute. Third, it allows the FISA courts to approve of not just individualized wiretap warrants but of whole programs of warrantless surveillance, expressly approves of new forms of warrantless surveillance, and waters down the criminal prohibitions on wiretapping in violation of FISA.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">Surveillance</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><strong>Transfer of existing cases challenging the NSA Program</strong><br /><br />My colleagues and I at the Center for Constitutional Rights filed our <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/govt_misconduct/govtArticle.asp?ObjID=RovrtPD8Bc&Content=694">challenge to the NSA domestic spying program</a> in January, and the case will be fully briefed for resolution in a few weeks. Yet Specter's deal would move our case into the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review without any clear explanation for why such a move is in the public interest. <br /><br />These transfer provisions amount to a desperate last-minute maneuver to avoid review by the federal judges already hearing these cases. These judges have already held oral arguments and made some preliminary rulings in several of the cases challenging domestic spying.  Perhaps the Justice Department sees that the judges in these cases are ready to weigh the arguments on their merits, not blindly issue blank checks to executive authority.  Senator Specter's proposal basically allows "judge shopping"&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the government will trade the existing judges, who have all shown hints of their skepticism of the broadest claims of presidential power, for a new set of friendlier judges (all named to their posts by William Rehnquist) in a court that ordinarily only hears arguments from one side (the government), and oversees a system that has approved all but 5 of 19,000 wiretapping applications presented to it. (This part of the "compromise" bill parallels the administration's recent, last-minute attempt to transfer and consolidate our case with other, distinct cases against private telephone companies&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the latest in a series of delaying tactics designed to hold off a decision that the Program is illegal before Congress can rubberstamp it.)<br /><br /><strong>Weakening FISA's assertion of Congressional control over wiretapping</strong><br /><br />The text of this proposed deal eliminates the restrictions Congress put on Presidential surveillance power in FISA, and attempts to delete the language that makes Congress' wiretapping statutes &#8212; FISA and the 1968 Wiretap Act &#8212; the "exclusive means" for conducting surveillance.  Senator Specter's proposal would also expand surveillance powers, enabling the President to target anyone believed "to have communication with or be associated with" any organization "believed" to be preparing for terrorism, or any persons associated with them. That description includes more or less every attorney I work with at the Center for Constitutional Rights, according to the government's claims about our clients.<br /><br />The legislation also asserts that "nothing in this act shall be construed to limit the constitutional authority of the president" to conduct surveillance on foreign powers and their agents. Similar language existed in the original 1968 wiretap act before FISA was passed; it was intended to leave unresolved the question of whether the president has power to carry out surveillance without warrants under that act in furtherance of national security interests (as opposed to criminal investigations). The Supreme Court ruled in 1972 that the President did not have the power to carry out warrantless surveillance against domestic groups, and left unresolved the question of whether such power existed to eavesdrop on foreign powers. <br /><br />When Congress passed FISA, it removed this "constitutional authority" language from the statute books, since FISA was intended precisely to regulate the president's ability to carry out surveillance on foreign powers. Why would Congress now want to imply that the President might have "inherent" constitutional authority to conduct foreign intelligence gathering in a statute designed to limit just that power? Congress doesn't usually say that its statutes apply only to the extent they aren't unconstitutional; that much should be obvious. And the Constitution says nothing at all about surveillance powers; why muddy the waters this way?<br /><br />I suppose one explanation might be that this language is an invitation to extremist pro-executive judges to rule that Congress really has no power to regulate Presidential wiretapping for national security purposes. (The much commented-upon language in the bill saying the court could dismiss challenges to the program "for any reason" may also be there to open the door for extreme readings.) Luckily, only one obscure lower federal court had ever even implied (in nonbinding dicta) that Congress might lack the constitutional authority to regulate foreign intelligence surveillance. Of course, that Court was the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, to which the Specter compromise would transfer our case challenging the NSA Program.<br /><br />In some ways such language begs the Courts to tell Congress it has no power over such surveillance. This shouldn't surprise us given the last h
alf-century of steadily-expanding executive power over war and national security. The founders wanted Congress to have and responsibly exercise important powers over war, foreign relations and national security. But unfortunately, individual congressional reps generally believe they have little to gain individually from exercising these constitutional prerogatives: they believe the public will credit the executive with any successes in foreign wars, diplomacy, or prevention of terrorist attacks, and that they as individual legislators can only reap blame when something goes wrong in those areas. Thus Congress has abdicated its war powers to the President over the years; this bill may mark a similar withdrawal from the field of surveillance as well.<br /><br />If Specter's bill is a general retreat from responsibility over wiretapping, the timing is astonishing, given that the Supreme Court just ruled (in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>, the watershed military tribunals case) that where Congress has legitimately legislated in a field where power is shared by both political branches, the President must obey. (Although the DOJ argued that this ruling meant nothing for the NSA program's legality &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; an opinion Yale Law&#39;s Jack Balkin accurately <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2006/07/bush-administration-to-justice-stevens.html">characterized</a> as the administration announcing its response to <em>Hamdan</em> would be to wait for John Paul Stevens to die &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a bipartisan group of prominent constitutional law scholars and former government officials have <a href="http://www.acslaw.org/files/Implications%20of%20Hamdan%20for%20NSA.pdf">spelled out the obvious</a> [PDF]: that <em>Hamdan</em> confirms that the NSA program is illegal.)<br /><br /><strong>Allowing the FISA court to approve of surveillance programs</strong><br /><br />Section 702 of Specter's bill allows the FISA court to approve not just individual wiretap orders allowing surveillance of specified individuals, but also allows the court to approve whole "programs," whatever that means. Much commentary in the blogosphere has speculated as to what Specter might have in mind with this. I think the clearest explanation is simply that he expects this provision will allow the secret FISA court to do the dirty work of legislating for Congress. The president will ask the court for approval of all sorts of wide-ranging surveillance experiments like the NSA Program, and the FISA judges will decide if such programs sound like they might "protect against international terrorism," with no guidance from the branch of government the founders thought should be most responsive to the people and most responsible for setting long-term policy: Congress. <br /><br />Since the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> demands warrants specify with "particularity" the objects of the search, such review of broad surveillance "programs" would have no relationship to the conventional warrant process. And since FISA Court orders are never routinely made public, this would be not just unelected judges legislating, but making secret legislation. And Congress will continue its long trend of avoiding responsibility for making any of the policy decisions about whether such executive practices are good for our democracy and our security&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;a trend interrupted only briefly by Watergate. <br /><br />One well-hidden section of the bill comes close to gutting FISA entirely. Section 10(c) of the bill stealthily adds provision for warrantless wiretaps lasting up to a year intended to intercept the contents of calls where one party is an agent of a foreign power, so long as that agent is not a U.S. person. I say "stealthily" because it does so by modifying a provision (FISA &Acirc;&#167; 1802(a)) that allowed for 90-day warrantless surveillance of communications between agents of foreign governments.<br /><br />For good measure, the bill would also eliminate the criminal liability of the President and all his minions who ordered or participated in warrantless surveillance if they could convince a court that the surveillance fell within the inherent Presidential Constitutional power that the administration claims justifies the NSA Program.<br /><br />Finally, the bill's Congressional oversight provisions are even weaker than anything proposed to date: reporting to the Congressional intelligence committees must be made only once every six months. Whereas earlier bills could be characterized as Congress giving the president permission to break the law so long as it could watch (and calling that oversight), this bill decides that even the oversight is not so important. Let the President ask the FISA Court to decide the policy issues; just make sure you keep us posted twice a year.<br /><br /><strong>The ultimate question: Why?</strong><br /><br />What could Specter's motivation be here? I have, frankly, no idea. The introduction to most bills usually explains the perceived need that motivated its passage. In this bill, the legislative findings are most notable for repeating the lie that the FBI could not search 20th hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui's computer because FISA stood in the way &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a claim Senator Specter knows to be untrue. <br /><br />Unlike the <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/NSA%20Specter%20Draft.doc">last bill</a> [DOC] proposed by Specter (with Dianne Feinstein, on May 24th), which was very clearly focused on addressing specific complaints Alberto Gonzales and others voiced about the existing FISA scheme, this new bill seems motivated only by the administration's determination to expand executive power. In contrast, the earlier Specter-Feinstein bill provided for more personnel to process wiretap applications under FISA: More NSA and FBI staffers and Justice Department lawyers to write the applications up, and more FISA judges (as needed) to process the applications. Whether or not it is warranted by current workloads, the Specter-Feinstein proposal would give the lie to the administration's argument that it needed to go around the FISA court because it was simply too burdensome to fill out the vast number of individual wiretap applications required after 9/11. (The bill also mandated an official study of the efficiency of the application process, and development of an electronic system for classified document handling related to FISA applications, and allowed the Attorney General to tweak the application process by regulation, all of which should streamline the system and preempt any future President from arguing that the FISA court is just too slow to respond to a 9/11-style crisis. The new Specter bill doesn't do any of that (although it does relieve the Attorney General of the supposedly-onerous requirement to personally approve emergency warrantless surveillance, and extends the retroactive warrant period for such emergencies from 72 hours to 7 days).)<br /><br />The difference between the approaches in these two Specter bills illustrates a larger point: In the main, legal (and technological) short cuts don&#39;t stop terrorists. Good traditional law enforcement does. What we need is not less legal supervision but more flesh-and-blood agents doing a better job under more effective management. Profiling and other broad-brush measures like warrantless wiretapping may have some intuitive popular appeal but they have a historical track record of producing lousy results (as, apparently, does the NSA program). <br /><br />Blaming the law is always a convenient shield for incompetent management to hide behind. After 9/11, an honest assessment by the FBI would have focused on bureaucratic management failures: that they failed to share intelligence with other agencies or devolve sufficient power to field offices. Instead, the loudest voices in the public debate were complaining that federal judges and wiretap laws were a drag on law enforcement's efficiency, and urging Congress to pass the PATRIOT Act to make everything better by lessening judicial oversight. Inside the White
House, OLC lawyers argued that eliminating judicial oversight entirely was the best way to defend the country. In fact, the opposite is true: judicial oversight of wiretapping results in more efficient law enforcement because the probable cause requirement focuses law enforcement&#39;s efforts on threats that are real. For 200-plus years having judges review the evidence creating cause for suspicion before issuing search warrants is a system that has worked to ensure not only that the innocent don&#39;t get searched, but also that law enforcement doesn&#39;t waste its time with irrational profiling. Senator Specter and Congress had best relearn this lesson before it is too late.<br /><br /><br /><em>Shayana Kadidal is a staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights and one of the lead attorneys on the Center's challenge to the NSA Surveillance Program, </em>Center for Constitutional Rights v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law2.byu.edu/Faculty/Profiles/wardle.htm">Lynn Wardle</a> of J. Reuben Clark School of Law at Brigham Young University says that the 2006 House and Senate votes on the Federal Marriage Protection Amendment may not have been sufficient to send the amendment to the states for ratification, but they do show that the movement to protect marriage as a human right is making slow but certain national progress...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/lynnwardle.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n Tuesday, July 18, a majority of the U.S. House of Representatives voted for H.J. Res. 88, in favor of sending the proposed Federal Marriage Protection Amendment (FMPA) to the states for ratification, with 236 yeas, 187 nays, and one "present."  The FMPA received 55.6% of the votes cast, and had a 49-vote margin for passage.  While that is an impressive majority, two-thirds vote of each house of Congress is required to propose constitutional amendments, so the proposed amendment failed by 46 votes to move ahead toward ratification.  <br /><br />Last month, a majority of U.S. Senators voting on S.J. Res. 1, the Senate version of the FMPA, also voted for the marriage amendment, with 49 yeas and 48 nays.  Again, the vote was far short (up to 18 votes) of the two-thirds required to propose a constitutional amendment. <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">Same-sex marriage</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2006/06/marriage-amendment-debate-us-senate.php">Marriage amendment debate</a> [US Senate] | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2006/05/same-sex-marriage-and-religious.php">Same-sex marriage and religious liberty</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />The 2006 votes in the House and Senate on the Federal Marriage Protection Amendment have great but subtle political and constitutional significance.  Politically, both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage have claimed victory in the congressional votes on the FMPA.  Credible arguments can be made for both claims.  <br /><br />Advocates of same-sex unions emphasize that the votes in both houses were far below the two-thirds required to send proposed amendments to the states.  The procedural context may have masked even greater opposition in the Senate.  Also, there were fewer votes for the FMPA than some commentators had been predicting.  These statements are completely accurate and support the conclusion that passage of an FMPA is not an immediate threat to the same-sex marriage movement.  A federal proposed amendment is not likely to pass Congress in the near future (e.g., certainly not in the next 2-3, or perhaps 4-5 years).  <br /><br />On the other hand, no one expected that the FMPA would get two-thirds of the votes (or even to come close to that) in either house of Congress.  The votes in the House and Senate this summer were meant to require elected members of Congress to take a yes-or-no stand on the issue in an election year.  That was clearly a positive step forward for supporters of the Federal Marriage Protection Amendment.  <br /><br />Support for the FMPA in the House of Representatives in 2006 increased by nine votes over 2004, when 227 representatives (55%) voted for the 2004 version of the federal marriage amendment.  Of the ten additional representatives to vote yea or nay on the FMPA in 2006, nine voted for the amendment.  The trend of new votes is 90% in favor of a federal marriage amendment, and that suggests bright prospects for the amendment.  <br /><br />Likewise, more Senators voted for the FMPA in 2006 than against it (49-48), while in 2004  opponents won 48-50 (with 2 additional opponents abstaining).  While Senate supporters of the FMPA picked up one more vote in 2006 than in 2004, opponents of the marriage amendment in the Senate lost two votes since the last vote (arguably lost four votes, if Kerry's and Edwards' 2004 abstentions are considered no votes).  Moreover, many of those who opposed the FMPA expressed a "wait-and-see" or "states&#39; rights" position that will probably lead most of them to support the FMPA if courts legalize same-sex unions or rule against the federal DOMA. <br /><br />Compared to 2004, when 13 states passed state marriage amendments (SMAs) barring same-sex marriage in just a few months (most also prohibiting marriage-equivalent same-sex civil unions or domestic partnerships), and when voters in 11 states approved SMAs on the same day, the modest progress evident in the 2006 votes in Congress may create the perception that the movement for a federal marriage amendment is running out of steam.  However, a more accurate description of what is happening is that the "easy" part of the same-sex marriage battles is over, and the slower, more hard-fought battles on the opponents' political territory have begun. <br /><br />"D-Day" for supporters of constitutional protection for marriage in America was November 3, 2004, when voters in nearly one-quarter of the states approved SMAs.  It was a massive, impressive step towards ultimate victory, constitutionalizing marriage protection in most of the conservative states and signaling the beginning of a new phase of the same-sex marriage political wars. After more than ten years of steady gains for the same-sex marriage movement (beginning with the Hawaii Supreme Court decision in Baehr v. Lewin in 1993, and continuing after the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health legalizing same-sex marriage in 2003), the overwhelming electoral rejection of same-sex marriage in 2004 was stunning.  For more than one-fourth of the states to adoption constitutional rules banning same-sex marriage that year, with voter support for the amendments averaging 70%, was a major turn-around in momentum. It marked the beginning of the end of the political quest for national legalization of same-sex marriage. <br /><br />After the 2004 state marriage amendments, the same-sex movement has continued to move ahead in a few places, and gay leaders have tried to regain the momentum.  For example, a federal court in Nebraska declared Nebraska marriage amendment unconstitutional, the Connecticut legislature legalized "civil unions," and trial judges in New York, California, and Maryland ruled in favor of same-sex marriage.<br /><br />Yet generally in 2005 and 2006, the tide has continued to rise in favor of constitutional protection for same-sex marriage. The New York Court of Appeals decisively rejected same-sex marriage claims, as did intermediate appellate courts in Indiana and New Jersey, and a Connecticut trial court; the Georgia Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that held the Georgia SMA invalid; top courts in Tennessee and Massachusetts rejected gay activist attempts to invalidate and prevent voters from voting on proposed state marriage amendments; and the U.S. Court of Appe
als for the Eighth Circuit reversed on all counts the district court ruling that the Nebraska marriage amendment was unconstitutional. The political backlash against judicial activism legalizing same-sex unions has been heard by courts around the country.  Moreover, since 2004 voters in three more states already have overwhelmingly approved state marriage amendments, and SMAs will be on the ballot in eight more states this Fall.  Massive electoral rejection of same-sex marriage is expected.  <br /><br />Thus, the 2006 congressional votes with their modest gains for an FMPA are part of a broad movement for protection of marriage.  That movement is growing, as the state focus and initiative strengthens.  (The congressional votes may indicate preference for that venue.)  <br /><br />Constitutionally, the movement for a constitutional amendment protecting marriage in the United States is hardly novel.  It has been happening for decades in other countries. Protection of marriage is a matter of basic human rights, and constitutional protection for marriage is the growing trend in international constitutional law. <br /><br />Of the 191 sovereign nations in the world, 78 nations give explicit protection to marriage or family or both in their national constitutions. At least 32 nations have amended or written their constitutions to provide explicit constitutional protection for marriage as the union of a man and a woman.  Conceptually (if not literally), those provisions are similar to the state marriage amendments or the FMPA in the USA.<br /><br />The United States, which historically was the world leader in defining and protecting basic human rights, has fallen behind many nations in protecting the fundamental human right (and basic social institution) of marriage.  The FMPA votes in Congress this summer represent an ongoing commitment to secure such human rights protection by constitutional amendment.  <br /><br />By the end of 2006, over half of the states will have state constitutional amendments protecting marriage. Even in Massachusetts, the people have repeatedly petitioned their unresponsive legislature to give voters the chance to vote on an amendment to ban same-sex marriage.   <br /><br />The House and Senate votes on the FMPA in 2006 are significant steps in the process of securing constitutional protection for the institution of marriage.  While passage of a federal marriage amendment is not imminent, those congressional votes insure political accountability and show the slow but certain national progress of the movement for constitutional protection of marriage.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Lynn D.

		<title>A proposed UN resolution on the Middle East</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/fulltime/damato/damato.html"><strong>Anthony D&#39;Amato</strong></a> [Northwestern University School of Law]: &quot;I suggest below a very simple UN resolution for the Middle East conflict. <br /><br /> On the table right now is the draft resolution proposed by France and the United States.  It has run into serious objections from all quarters.  The drafters apparently believe that by tinkering with it, they can come up with a resolution that would be in the interests of Israel, Lebanon, the Hezbollah, Syria, and Iran.  I hope they do, but I think it is unlikely.  I&#39;ve written an <a href="/forumy/2006/08/draft-un-middle-east-ceasefire.php">editorial</a> for JURIST on some of the near-intractable strategic factors in the present draft resolution.<br /><br /> Instead of making it more and more complicated, why not consider a very simple resolution?  It would not have to be the only one.  More can be drafted and enacted.  But a simple resolution at the outset could jump-start the peace process.  Here is my suggestion:<br /><br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /> <br /> The Security Council,<br /><br /> Recalling all its previous resolutions on Lebanon, in particular resolutions 425 (1978), 426 (1978), 520 (1982), 1559 (2004), 1655 (2006) and 1680 (2006), as well as the statements of its President on the situation in Lebanon, in particular the statements of 18 June 2000 (S/PRST/2000/21), of 19 October 2004 (S/PRST/2004/36), of 4 May 2005 (S/PRST/2005/17) of 23 January 2006 (S/PRST/2006/3) and of 30 July 2006 (S/PRST/2006/35),<br /><br /> Emphasizing the need for an end of violence,<br /><br /> Mindful of the need for further resolutions with an aim to securing peace and security, <br /><br /> Calls for a full cessation of aerial hostilities over Lebanon and Israel, based upon,in particular, the immediate cessation by Hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by Israel of all aerial bombardments.<br /><br /> Decides to remain actively seised of the matter.<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /> The reasons for adopting a resolution of this kind are:<br /><br /> 1.  More complex resolutions tend to invite an infinite regress of added strategic complications.<br /><br /> 2.  There is a need to first establish the relevance and importance of the Security Council in this conflict; in other words, to jump-start the peace process.<br /><br /> 3.  As complexities arise, the Security Council can make decisions about them.  In particular, the Security Council can be negotiating for the establishment of a multilateral peacekeeping force.  Moreover, the question of Israeli ground forces in Lebanon may be assessed as events unfold.<br /><br /> 4.  The most important international interest is the prevention of harm to civilians.  By far the greatest number of civilian injuries and deaths, both in Israel and in Lebanon, are due to aerial attacks by both sides.<br /><br /> 5.  The Hezbollah rocket attacks upon Israeli population centers are the clearest example of actions that must be interdicted by the international community.  The Israeli bombardment and air-to-ground missile fire over Lebanon, while theoretically aimed at Hezbollah bunkers and infrastructure, have in fact caused extensive fatalities among Lebanese civilians, exceeding the number of civilian deaths in Israel.  The innocent people of Israel and Lebanon who are the victims of this conflict must be protected from further harm.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/fulltime/damato/damato.html"><strong>Anthony D&#39;Amato</strong></a> [Northwestern University School of Law]: &quot;Israel&#39;s decision to launch a massive ground attack on Lebanon appears to entail  an unnoticed and unintended effect.  <br /><br /> In the past weeks the Security Council had been scrambling to come up with enough national pledges for troops to constitute a U.N. peacekeeping force for southern Lebanon.  At first, Turkey seemed to be the most willing to supply troops.  Next came France.  <br /><br /> Then on Monday, August 7th, the Lebanese government said it would send its own troops, numbering perhaps 15,000, to police the border areas in southern Lebanon.  This proposal would obviate the need for an international peacekeeping force.  The major parties, including Israel and the United States, were delighted with the proposal, as it seemed to bypass the extremely difficult task of amassing an international force.<br /><br /> But there was a catch to it.  Lebanon said it would not deploy its troops unless Israel withdrew all its ground troops from Lebanon.<br /><br /> However, upon reflection, it is not a &quot;catch&quot; but a necessity.  <br /><br /> If any peacekeeping forces, whether from Lebanon, Turkey, France, Canada, etc., were to be deployed in southern Lebanon, that deployment would simply replace an equal number of Israeli forces now stationed there.  The Israeli troops would then be free to join the Israeli army moving up toward Beirut and the Bekaa valley.  <br /><br /> Thus the injection of Lebanese or international peacekeepers into southern Lebanon would constitute direct military assistance to Israel.  So long as Israel maintains ground troops in Lebanon (and the prognosis is that they will be there for at least 30 days), the idea of a peacekeeping force is lopsided and could not be acceptable to the Arab states.<br /><br /> I argued in a recent <a href="/forumy/2006/08/draft-un-middle-east-ceasefire.php">JURIST editorial</a> that the draft UN resolution was unlikely to bring about peace in Lebanon.  Subsequent events appear to have made it even more unlikely.&quot;<br />

		<title>A front row seat to history in Kosovo</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2006/08/front-row-seat-to-history-in-kosovo/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong>Katerina Ossenova</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh School of Law 2L, in Kosovo]: &quot;Kosovo is at a remarkable moment in history, witnessing both state-building and interaction and cooperation between the world&#39;s largest international organizations. My internship position for the summer is with the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), at the Department of Justice, Legal Policy Division. UNMIK was created by United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) with the mandate to provide interim administration for Kosovo. UNMIK was formed in response to the war in Kosovo in 1999 between Serbia and ethnic Kosovo Albanians who for years struggled for win autonomy for Kosovo, independent from Serbia proper. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic&#39;s military crackdown against the armed resistance by the Kosovo Liberation Army resulted in hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled to Albania, Macedonia, and Montenegro as well as the deaths of thousands of people. Serbian forces were driven out of Kosovo by NATO air strikes in the summer of 1999 and UNMIK took over administration of the province. The administration of Kosovo was divided into four components: the UN was to head civil administration, the European Union was to oversee reconstruction, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was charged with institution-building and democratization, and the UN High Commission for Refugees was tasked with humanitarian affairs. Ultimate authority rests with the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the UN, who reports directly to the Secretary General of the United Nations. Since UNMIK assumed control of the transitional civil administration in Kosovo, KFOR forces, made up of troops from all over the world, maintained control over military and security matters. Since 1999, UNMIK has reserved certain powers and competencies but has gradually transferred powers to the Provisional Institutions of Self Government. Currently, negotiations are ongoing in Vienna to determine the final status of Kosovo. <br /><br />My first impression upon my arrival in Prishtin&euml;/Pri&Aring;&iexcl;tina was the striking similarity between Kosovo and my native Bulgaria. From the Soviet-like buildings to the ever crowded cafes, this was another Balkan country struggling to free itself of the legacy of its past while trying to define its future in Eastern European politics. In a strategic location amongst former Yugoslavian nations, as well as rich in mineral resources, this territory of approximately one million people will greatly influence the stability and democratization of the region. The Legal Policy Division of UNMIK DOJ has the important task of facilitating international judicial cooperation and assistance between Kosovo and other jurisdictions, nations, and Kosovo&#39;s judicial system. LPD is divided between the external relations section (ERS), the policy legislation section (PLS), and litigation. ERS focuses on coordinating, negotiating and facilitating criminal matters that concern Kosovo residents and other nations and jurisdictions. LPD is concerned with drafting legislation, policies, and procedures that govern Kosovo. The office is comprised of local Kosovo Albanians along with a staff of international experts and managers. <br /><br />My work at LPD has been both surreal and fascinating. After just completing my first year of law school, I did not expect to be assigned complicated and politically charged criminal cases or to have the opportunity to draft actual legislation. I have been able to work on an extradition case concerning the transfer of a Kosovo resident to a foreign nation upon the issuance and execution of an international wanted notice.  My work has also included drafting and implementing an international wanted notice, negotiating with the Belgrade War Crimes Council, as well as requesting for the transfer of a sentenced person from Kosovo to Serbia and Montenegro. I attended senior legal officer meetings, wrote interoffice and action memos for the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations, and drafted and revised legislation.   <br /> <br />My interaction on a daily basis with a variety of people from all over the world has made my internship unique. On any given day, I work and meet with people from USAID, the Supreme Court of Kosovo, Council of Europe, OSCE, NATO, the European Union, the Ministry of Justice, etc. However, the best part of my experience so far has been my rapidly growing friendships with the local staff. Their willingness and desire to tell me about their personal experiences during the war or to show me Kosovo&#39;s beautiful towns and national treasures adds so much depth and understanding to the situation here. Visiting Kosovo&#39;s larger towns, including Gjakov&euml;/&Auml;akovica, Pej&euml;/Pe&Auml;&#8225;, Istok/Istog, Prizren, Gjilan/Gnjilane, and Mitrovic&euml;/Mitrovica, has given me the opportunity to see first hand not only the remains of a devastating war but also the re-building and development efforts taking place throughout the territory.  <br /> <br />I believe being here this summer is a once in a lifetime opportunity since I&#39;m literally living in what inevitably will be an important moment in history. Since the negotiations about the final status of Kosovo could finish by the end of the year, UNMIK is scaling down its operations and more power and authority is being transferred to the local government. The referendum in Montenegro that took place on Sunday, May 21, 2006  that resulted in over 55% of the population voting for an independent state had a very favorable response here as yet another nation separated itself from Serbia. There are many places around the world that are closely watching Kosovo&#39;s progress toward independence and will act in its footsteps if the result is an independent and sovereign state. Boundaries and borders continue to change and new nations are created &#8212; even in regions as old as the Balkans. What has taken place in Kosovo since 1999 and will take place over the next few years will not only dramatically impact the stability and security of Eastern Europe but will also influence the development of new nation states. Also of importance is the ability of international organizations and agencies &#8212; such as the EU, UN, Council of Europe, and OSCE among others &#8212;to actually direct, monitor, and govern international crises, disputes, and relations. The most valuable part for me is having a front row seat to this whole process!&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to JURIST&#39;s <em>Hotline</em>, where you can publish your insights on legal news as it happens.<br /><br />We&#39;ve designed this service to do two things: <ol><li>to give lawyers, law professors, policy experts, and people caught up in legal events a platform where they can quickly and easily share legal news views with others without having to maintain their own weblogs or websites;<br /><br /><li>to provide JURIST&#39;s readers with expert legal commentary that might complement and even match the pace of our continuous <a href="/paperchase/">Paper Chase</a> legal news coverage</ol>Scholars who have their own blogs are welcome here too. We hope that <em>Hotline</em> can help those of you already blogging to bring some of your original perspectives on legal news to the attention of a new audience.<br /><br />If you have comments on a legal news development, just e-mail <a href="mailto:JURIST@law.pitt.edu">JURIST@law.pitt.edu</a> for passwords to this blog and you&#39;ll be online in minutes. You can say your piece and be on your way. Frame your remarks so that they can stand alone as independent contributions that can be easily understood and referenced later. <br /><br />The idea here is succinct analysis rather than continuous discussion - two or three off-the-cuff paragraphs, perhaps, that summarize your thinking or reaction for busy professionals. If some readers (or other contributors) want to discuss what you say, they can leave comments on your post, and of course you&#39;re welcome to comment on those comments or on other posts (by leaving comments on those) at any time. Otherwise we hope you&#39;ll keep your passwords and sign in again next time you have a few minutes and a perspective you&#39;d like to share. <br /><br />Publishing your insights on legal news on JURIST is a simple and efficient way to enhance the visibility of your ideas and your law school while contributing to public discourse and education. Tie the latest legal news development into an article or book you&#39;re writing or have just published (and cite it!). Pen a couple of paragraphs as a trial balloon for a talk, paper or a more formal op-ed down the line.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> [University of Houston Law Center]: &quot;Recent litigation re: GTMO detainees in a Circuit Court has raised the issue whether the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) is relevant to requirements of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that provide detainee rights and Executive duties.  As noted in a previous JURIST <em>Forum</em> essay, <a href="/forumy/2005/12/not-authorized-by-law-domestic-spying.php">Not Authorized By Law: Domestic Spying and Congressional Consent</a> (Dec. 2005):<BLOCKQUOTE>The word &#39;appropriate&#39; [in the AUMF] creates a statutory limitation that necessarily requires Executive compliance with relevant constitutional, international, and other federal laws, especially since Supreme Court opinions have long recognized that relevant international law and prior federal statutes are a necessary background more generally for interpretation of newer federal statutes.<br /><br />    Indeed, under Article II, Section 3 of our Constitution the President has an express and unavoidable duty to faithfully execute the &#39;Laws&#39; and has no power to violate them.  As Richard Nixon learned, presidential authorizations to violate the law are, in the words of the House Judiciary Committee, &#39;subversive of constitutional government.&#39;  Additionally, since 1800 Supreme Court opinions have recognized the power of Congress to limit certain Commander in Chief powers during actual war (see, e.g., 43 <em>Columbia J. Transnat&#39;l L.</em> 811, 842 n.114 (2005)&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;.</BLOCKQUOTE>Quite clearly, in the AUMF Congress has limited presidential authority to act merely in &quot;appropriate&quot; ways and it would be most inappropriate for the Executive to attempt to authorize, order, abet, condone, etc., violations of customary or treaty-based international law since the President is bound by and must faithfully execute international law.  See, e.g., 43 <em>Columbia J.</em>, <em>supra</em> at 856-61; Jordan J. Paust, <em>International Law as Law of the United States</em> 7-11, 169-73, 180-87 nn.2-42, 489-90, 493-95, 499-502 nn.23-31, 507-10 nn.82-103 (2 ed. 2003).&quot;<br />

		<title>Illusion and reality in Argentina</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong>Lisl Brunner</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh School of Law 2L, in Argentina]: &quot;The Casa Rosada, which houses the offices of the President of Argentina, has a pristinely pink fa&ccedil;ade: the yellowish brown hue of its other three sides, however, marks the point at which the project to refurbish the exterior ran out of funds.  Commentators say this idiosyncrasy reflects many aspects of Argentina, where grandiose buildings and polo fields quickly give way to shantytowns, and where attention on high-profile trials of septuagenarians can obscure other critical legal problems.<br /><br /><img src="/hotline/madres.jpg" /><br /><br /> In addition to the trial of Miguel Etchecolatz, I observed some of the trial of Julio Sim&oacute;n, who two weeks ago became the first defendant accused of crimes during Argentina&#39;s last military junta to be sentenced to prison since the Supreme Court struck down the 1986-87 amnesty laws last June.  Perhaps due to Sim&oacute;n&#39;s lower rank in the police department, his ordinary federal hearing had none of the circus-like spectacle of the Etchecolatz trial.  Yet it was a notable step in the twenty-year campaign to hold participants in &quot;The Process&quot; (the junta&#39;s term for its rule) accountable for their crimes, which has mirrored the judiciary&#39;s own crusade for legitimacy in Argentina.  <br /><br />Between 1976 and 1983, judges who did not summarily reject habeas corpus petitions brought by families of the disappeared or lawyers who pursued them too doggedly were themselves carried away in the middle of the night, seldom to reappear. Although democracy brought a truth commission and trials of a handful of generals who oversaw &quot;The Process,&quot; the subsequent amnesty laws and presidential pardons thwarted those attempts to rekindle the rule of law.  Now that both the pardons and the amnesty laws have been overturned, courts have held that the kidnappings and murders constitute crimes against humanity, and as such, they can never be subject to statutory limitations.  Critics, however, cite the legality principle, recalling that Argentina only signed the international treaties that codified the concept of crimes against humanity and their imperviousness to statutory limitations in the 1990s.  Today, the prevailing argument holds that international custom dating back to Nuremberg and the Geneva Convention defined the junta&#39;s methods as crimes against humanity, which must be punished regardless of when they were committed; the fact that this was not written into Argentine law until later is immaterial.  Many are proud of Argentina&#39;s advances, but the debate surrounding this particular approach continues.<br /><br />Other aspects of the Argentine legal landscape include a reverence of the judge as protagonist and principal investigator (subject to checks and balances), which seems to avoid some of the pitfalls of the adversary system.  However, the discovery process often takes seven years, during which time probable cause justifies the internment of many suspects in preventive prison.  This thought is even more disturbing when one considers the constant complaints of inhumane prison conditions and police brutality.  APDH, the group for which I interned, is currently bringing a class action to address this issue, and I also collaborated on a letter to the UN Human Rights Council asking for an investigation into the deaths of three inmates at a Mendoza prison.  Their throats had been cut a few days before they were scheduled to testify against police officers.  <br /><br />On an encouraging note, we celebrated the passage International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance by voice vote during the first session of the Human Rights Council.  As an organization with NGO consultative status at the Economic &amp; Social Council of the United Nations, APDH sent a representative to Geneva to champion the agreement, termed by many as &quot;the Argentine Convention.&quot;  If the General Assembly votes in favor of it next month, it will need the ratification of 20 countries to become binding international law.  <br /><br />As more of the international community comes to admire the pink fa&ccedil;ade, I expect that Argentina will gradually take steps to paint the other three sides.&quot;<br /><br /><img src="/hotline/lisl2.jpg" /><br />

It was a legal tool to go after those who committed war crimes against Americans, particularly our fighting men and women.  Ten years ago, America's armed forces followed the laws of armed conflict.  Their military chain of command held their soldiers to a high standard in following the law.  The Department of Defense's Law of War Program, so meticulously put together after the tragedy of the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War, was emulated by professional armies around the world.  It was unthinkable that we would conduct operations that even came close to a violation of the laws of war.  We were universally admired for this policy.  We held the moral high ground then. No longer.<br /><br />How low the country has sunk legally and morally in waging this war, due to the na&Atilde;&macr;ve guidance of the Attorney General of the United States, who characterized the Geneva Conventions as &quot;quaint&quot; during the review of legal policy in handling the war on terror a few years ago.  Statements coming out of the Bush administration at that time, such as "the rules have changed", "they'll have flies on their eyeballs", and "we want them dead or alive", permeated downward to the war fighters in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Ignoring warnings by both military and civilian lawyers within the Departments of Defense and some at State, detention and interrogation policies were crafted which have now been found, for all practical purposes, to be in violation of the laws of armed conflict. <br /><br />As a result of this command climate that permeated down from our political leadership, tragedies took place at Abu Ghraib, Haditha, Afghanistan, the camps of Eastern Europe, and at Guantanamo to name a few.  War crimes are committed by individual soldiers, but most of the circumstances that create these scenarios are generally failures in command, top to bottom.  Command responsibility for these alleged crimes has yet to be fully vetted, only lower ranks punished.  The apparent climate of lawlessness has now opened up soldiers, interrogators, commanders, and contractors to potential criminal liability under the War Crimes Act of 1996.  The administration wants to change all this.<br /><br />Concerned that charges will be sought by prosecutors and independent counsel, all in the name of the law, the Attorney General is seeking to amend the War Crimes Act to carve out those who may have committed outrages upon personal dignity, among other possible war crimes.  Coupled with the efforts to limit due process still for the detainees worldwide, despite Supreme Court concerns in <em>Hamdan</em>, this effort is indicative that this administration still feels that the rules have changed, that in many respects the Geneva Conventions are still quaint -- they want to "have their cake and eat it too".<br /><br />Let us not underestimate how important the laws of armed conflict are in ensuring that we are conducting a just war. It is critical in achieving international political backing. We also have to understand that following the laws of armed conflict, still good law, and not necessarily in need of revision, saves American lives.  Simply put, if we treat our enemies fairly, humanely, and under the rule of law, the enemy may be compelled to do the same.  It literally puts the "ball in their court".  Granted we are not fighting the type of combatant originally contemplated by the laws of armed conflict, but the rules are flexible enough for commanders and their judge advocates to conduct operations within its parameters and to ensure that all persons found on the battlefield, civilian, lawful combatants, and unlawful combatants are treated with the appropriate legal standard clearly set out in the Geneva Conventions.  The standard is found in Common Article 3.  Humane treatment is a minimum.  Clearly the Attorney General, never having trained in or having practiced in this realm, does not understand and he is providing a disservice to this country.  In the military, commanders and their soldier/lawyers, judge advocates, do understand.  He needs to listen to the professionals in this area of the law, not the politicos.<br /><br />The laws of armed conflict have worked for decades and have shaped our effective use of force under the law. Yet if this administration and its civilian lawyers persist in shaping and trying to change good law for their own political/personal reasons, these policies will cause us to sink lower in the eyes of the world.  The world will question the moral and legal basis for the war on terror being waged almost by the United States alone, a huge mistake. For this we will put this decades long ideological struggle with international terrorists in jeopardy. The administration may want to &quot;have our cake and eat it to&quot;, but if it changes the law to protect/cover itself from liability under the laws of war, we could well choke on the crumbs.<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes<br /><br /><a name="1">1</a>.

After the widely reported arrests in connection with an alleged plot to blow up passenger planes flying from the UK to US airports, that's hardly surprising, particularly when a particular faith community seemed to contribute the suspects. <br /><br />Such enemies within do exist; in fact, there are several.<br /><br />One such enemy - the most widely acknowledged within Britain in general, and within the Muslim community in particular - is a deviant doctrine that allows wanton violence. Normative Islamic teachings do not justify this, and Muslims know it.<br /><br />That does not translate into most of them being able to do a heck of a lot about the really extreme end of it in the short-term. Heretics hide their views most completely from the orthodox within their own flock; after all, they have no compunction in killing them and considering their deaths collateral damage. <br /><br />Some British commentators complain that Muslim organizations are not angelic and are not wholly representative of the communities they claim to represent. Well, Muslim organizations might not be perfect (what organizations are?), but no one should be in any doubt that radical extremists would wipe most of them out without the slightest bit of hesitation. We should criticise them, certainly, but not unreasonably so. After all, in the long term, many Muslim organizations and voluntary sector organizations with sufficient resources could probably make a huge positive difference. But that is in the long term, and the British better get cracking now on helping them. With a critical eye, certainly, but not castigating them wholesale. <br /><br />In the short term, many within the Muslim community already actively assist in the counter-terrorist effort; just because they're not on the 6 o'clock news (and probably don't care to be on) doesn't mean they don't exist. Representational appropriateness and professional ability is seldom the same thing. Those unsung heroes exist, and could use much more support. We should not expect they are in representational roles: that's a different arena altogether, and if it weren't, we'd all elect every member of our civil services. If the Home Secretary's assessment that so many terrorist plots have been broken is correct, its safe to assume it was with Muslim involvement. Ask the London Metropolitan Police. Of course, if the British start racial profiling and allow standards of policing to drop, that might begin to change. Ask the London Metropolitan Police that too. <br /><br />But another enemy within Britain - and a moral depravity on no less a scale - is the perception that our &quot;national interest&quot; permits us to perpetrate incredible injustices upon innocent civilians abroad. British foreign policies give violent extremists a motive to commit criminal acts and attack our society; there's no excuse for it, but that's the way it is. Does that mean the British government should change its policies because of terrorists? In a word, no. Bad policies should not be changed because of threats. Bad policies should be changed because they&#39;re bad. <br /><br />But criminal acts give other types of extremists - other enemies within - the excuse to mar British society, in the short-term and the long-term, by pushing Britons further away from the principles of respect, decency and justice. What makes this particularly distasteful is that it is on the disingenuous pretext of protecting our values as Britons.<br /><br />The future of Britain is being built on a marriage between esteem for diversity and respect for a common citizenship: a multiculturalist patriotism, or a patriotic multiculturalism, if you will. [In truth, Britain has always been based on that relationship to some extent. Modernity makes everything go a bit too fast for people to catch their breath, but that's another story entirely.] Taking advantage of a threat on our country to push for some sort of narrow vision that excludes huge numbers of Britons, instead of bringing them together in a real cohesive social contract, is not the action of a patriot. On the contrary.<br /><br />Britain as a whole has to renew her sense of self, without failing to uphold the sense of integrity that makes all Britons &#8212; Muslims and non-Muslims alike - grateful to be British.  It&#39;s not going to be easy, but it&#39;s got to be done. Britain is still a country worth fighting for. Lets make sure we're fighting the right enemies in the right way. Otherwise, the Britain that prevails will be a poor shadow of what we are fighting for today; and then, indeed, the &quot;enemies within&quot; will have won. <br />   <br /><br /><em>Based at the Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations, University of Warwick (UK) as an Associate Fellow, H.A Hellyer is also a Visiting Professor in the Department of Law, American University in Cairo (Egypt) and a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of International Integration Studies, Trinity College Dublin (Ireland).

		<title>Smoke and Mirrors: The Geneva Conventions in the 21st Century</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=152">David Crane</a> of Syracuse University College of Law says that as we celebrate the universality of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, we must recognize that the murder, rape, maiming, mutilation, and pillaging of non-combatants worldwide goes on unabated while the United States, once a champion of the Conventions, has stumbled and committed multiple breaches of their provisions in its single-minded conduct of the war on terror...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidcranenew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ast week the International Committee of the Red Cross announced that the island nation of Nauru and the Balkan nation of Montenegro have become the most recent states to sign the Geneva Conventions of 1949.  All the nations of the world have now signed this treaty that ensures humane treatment in conflict, embodying centuries of law, custom, and the practice of placing warfare under the rule of law.<br /><br />The Geneva Conventions were promulgated in the middle of mankind's bloodiest century.  The beast of impunity fed well and often around the periphery of civilization consuming over 200 million lives many at the hand of their own governments.  The 21st century does not bode well in this regard.  <br /><br />In the year where we solemnly remember the 60th anniversary of the judgments at Nuremberg, and next year the 100th anniversary of the Hague Rules that laid out guidance for armies as to how they target and use their weapons humanely, under the concepts of military necessity, proportionality, and unnecessary suffering, it is both right and proper that we pause on this occasion and ask this question:  Are the Geneva Conventions being used and abused by nations as a shield to cover their own inequities in human rights or to put it simply are these important legal principles only smoke and mirrors as we plunge in to a new century where it appears that the beast of impunity still lurks unchecked?<br /><br />The answer to this rhetorical question is illusive and imprecise.  In many ways the international community has made significant strides in facing down impunity.  Since the Geneva Conventions nations have entered into numerous agreements limiting or outlawing such things as torture, genocide, the use of bacteriological and chemical weapons to name a few.  Key human rights instruments have also been established, such as the Universal Declaration of Human rights.  The creation of important institutions like the United Nations, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court, the various international criminal tribunals, as well as the rise of nongovernmental institutions and civil society allow for mechanisms to be created to seek justice and monitor impunity. So the answer to the extant question can be a positive one in that the Geneva Conventions are not being abused, that they are taken seriously and used to counter evil.<br /><br />Yet, despite all of this, the murder, rape, maiming, mutilation, pillaging, destruction of non-combatants worldwide goes on unabated.  In such places as Darfur, Iraq, the Congo, Uganda, and Columbia human suffering continues.  The sole super power, the United States, once the champion of the Geneva Conventions, has stumbled and committed breaches of their provisions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo, and Eastern Europe in its single-minded conduct of the war on terror.  Na&Atilde;&macr;ve statements by senior policy makers and lawyers within the Bush administration that the Geneva Conventions are obsolete and quaint, as well as to modify existing domestic law to remove them from liability are public confessions to their complicity in these violations.  Their ignorance of the Geneva Conventions has led them to do harm to the prestige of the United States around the world that once was a nation of laws.  In some sense the United States has lost the moral high ground by ignoring the important principles laid out in the Geneva Conventions.  There is an abuse here to be sure.<br /><br />The Supreme Court of the United States in their recent decision in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> certainly refocused US policy on conducting the fight against international terror under the rule of law.  This ruling clearly recognized the relevance and importance of the Geneva Conventions.  The Bush administration "smoke and mirrors policy" related to international humanitarian law has set the tone for how we will take on terrorists and other national threats in the 21st century.  The Hamden decision certainly has given them pause.  The administration talks the talk about freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, yet they don't walk the walk.  Using torture as a weapon, killing noncombatants, and actively seeking to destroy the 21st century's legal cornerstone in accounting for atrocity, the International Criminal Court, are but a few clear and sad examples.<br /><br />The Geneva Conventions are as relevant today as they were in 1949.  They are the moral thread that now binds all nations into a common legal purpose to regulate conflict, to treat humanely all persons caught up in the conflict, and to punish those who breach their principles.  The rules have not changed, only the threat.  The Geneva Conventions are mankind's one true hope in ensuring that the beast of impunity is faced down wherever it rears it ugly head in this new century.  Let us rejoice in their universality.  194 nations joined together is a powerful statement in accountability.  <br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/fulltime/damato/damato.html">Anthony D&#39;Amato</a> of Northwestern University School of Law offers his analysis of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities in the Middle East conflict involving Israel, Hezbollah and Lebanon...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/damato3.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>H</strong></font>ezbollah&#39;s surprising television announcement accepting the terms of the UN Ceasefire Resolution means that the precise wording of the Resolution will be under strict diplomatic scrutiny for weeks or months to come.   The following is my paragraph-by-paragraph commentary (in regular text) on the complete text (in italics) of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 (11 August 2006).<br /><br /><em>The Security Council, <br /><br />PP1.  Recalling all its previous resolutions on Lebanon, in particular resolutions 425 (1978), 426 (1978), 520 (1982), 1559 (2004), 1655 (2006) 1680 (2006) and 1697 (2006), as well as the statements of its President on the situation in Lebanon, in particular the statements of 18 June 2000 (S/PRST/2000/21), of 19 October 2004 (S/PRST/2004/36), of 4 May 2005 (S/PRST/2005/17) of 23 January 2006 (S/PRST/2006/3) and of 30 July 2006 (S/PRST/2006/35),</em> <br /><br />These previous resolutions are all superseded by the present resolution.<br /><br /><em>PP2.  Expressing its utmost concern at the continuing escalation of hostilities in Lebanon and in Israel since Hezbollah&#39;s attack on Israel on 12 July 2006, which has already caused hundreds of deaths and injuries on both sides, extensive damage to civilian infrastructure and hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons,</em><br /><br />Hezbollah&#39;s attack on 12 July 2006 was a border incident that under international law does not amount to an armed attack against a nation.  Violent border incidents occur between India and Pakistan almost on a daily basis.  If either side regarded these as armed attacks, the two sides right now would be engaged in total war, perhaps even using nuclear weapons.  Constant border incidents also occur between a number of nations in Africa.   None of these are regarded in international law as a casus belli. Israel&#39;s immediate and massive retaliation, however, was arguably an act of aggression.   Nevertheless, this paragraph PP2 casts the blame on Hezbollah.  Since it is not an operative paragraph (OP), but merely a preparatory paragraph (PP), its inclusion was a probably a sop to Israeli sensibilities.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/mideastconflict.php">Middle East Conflict</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2006/08/middle-east-resolution-vote-un.php">Middle East resolution vote</a> [UN Security Council]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><em>PP3.  Emphasizing the need for an end of violence, but at the same time emphasizing the need to address urgently the causes that have given rise to the current crisis, including by the unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers,</em><br /><br />This paragraph does not call for the immediate release of the abducted Israeli soldiers.  Its main purpose seems to be the decoupling of Israeli prisoners from Lebanese prisoners, so that the final settlement does not appear to be a trade.  Israel has made it clear that a &quot;trade&quot; would be humiliating under the circumstances.<br /><br /><em>PP4.  Mindful of the sensitivity of the issue of prisoners and encouraging the efforts aimed at urgently settling the issue of the Lebanese prisoners detained in Israel,</em> <br /><br />For the same reason as above, this paragraph finishes the job of decoupling.<br /><br /><em>PP5.  Welcoming the efforts of the Lebanese Prime Minister and the commitment of the government of Lebanon, in its seven-point plan, to extend its authority over its territory, through its own legitimate armed forces, such that there will be no weapons without the consent of the government of Lebanon and no authority other than that of the government of Lebanon, welcoming also its commitment to a UN force that is supplemented and enhanced in numbers, equipment, mandate and scope of operation, and bearing in mind its request in this plan for an immediate withdrawal of the Israeli forces from Southern Lebanon,</em> <br /><br />This is now a sop to the sensibilities of the Lebanese government.  <br /><br /><em>PP6.  Determined to act for this withdrawal to happen at the earliest,</em> <br /><br />The Security Council could have decreed that the withdrawal begin immediately.  However, to do so would have meant that the Security Council was acting within its mandatory powers of Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.  This paragraph PP6 indicates that the Council is acting under Chapter 6, which is limited to making recommendations to the parties.  As we shall see, this entire Resolution creates profound ambiguities as to whether it is authorized by either Chapter 6 or Chapter 7.  Different paragraphs seem to shift from one to the other.<br /><br /><em>PP7.  Taking due note of the proposals made in the seven-point plan regarding the Chebaa farms area,</em> <br /><br />The Chebaa Farms is a small strip of territory on the border between Israel and Lebanon.   Israel has occupied it since defeating Syria in the 1967 war, but it belongs either to Syria or to Lebanon.  Under international law, territory can no longer be obtained by military conquest, and hence it does not legally belong to Israel.   Heated diplomatic disputes between Lebanon and Israel in the past week over this territory almost killed the UN draft resolution.  The accommodation in PP7 allows UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to determine the status of the Chebaa Farms.  This was not acceptable to Israel.  In a side deal between the United States and Israel, brokered by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the United States pledged to use its veto power in the Security Council to block any decision by Annan to hand the territory directly over to Lebanon.   This side deal appears to have sandbagged the Lebanese government.  Yet it does not contradict the language of PP7 and therefore appears to be lawful.   Perhaps Lebanon should have had better lawyers representing it at the United Nations.  Or maybe Lebanon liked the rest of the Resolution so much as to induce it to let the Chebaa Farms go for the time being.<br /><br /><em>PP8.  Welcoming the unanimous decision by the government of Lebanon on 7 August 2006 to deploy a Lebanese armed force of 15,000 troops in South Lebanon as the Israeli army withdraws behind the Blue Line and to request the assistance of additional forces from UNIFIL as needed, to facilitate the entry of the Lebanese armed forces into the region and to restate its intention to strengthen the Lebanese armed forces with material as needed to enable it to perform its duties,</em> <br /><br />This langu
age tilts the resolution toward Chapter 6 (recommendations).  The Security Council could have ordered Lebanon to deploy such an armed force if the Council wished to invoke Chapter 7 (decisions).   But inasmuch as the government of Lebanon agreed in advance to deploy such an armed force, it was prudent here for the Council to use the honey of Chapter 6 instead of the vinegar of Chapter 7.<br /><br /><em>PP9.  Aware of its responsibilities to help secure a permanent ceasefire and a long-term solution to the conflict,</em> <br /><br />This is probably meant for the average American high-school student who says, &quot;What&#39;s the United Nations and why should I care?&quot;<br /><br /><em>PP10.  Determining that the situation in Lebanon constitutes a threat to international peace and security,</em> <br /><br />Suddenly, almost as an afterthought, come these remarkable words.   Up to now it has appeared that the Security Council was acting under the recommendatory powers of Chapter 6.  But PP10 directly invokes Chapter 7 by the use of the key words &quot;determine,&quot; &quot;constitutes,&quot; &quot;threat,&quot; and &quot;international peace and security,&quot; all found in Article 39 of the Charter.   Why would Israel consent to PP10 when all along it had been insisting on its right to accept or reject the pending UN resolution?  (Note that Israel could reject a &quot;recommendation&quot; under Chapter 6, but would have no choice in the matter if the Security Council were to act under Chapter 7).  The reason is probably that Israel for the past month has complained that the 2,000 UNIFIL force in southern Lebanon (United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon) has from its inception in 1978 been nothing but a see-no-evil vacation spot for lazy peacekeepers.  Israel&#39;s insistence that a UN force have full military powers to use force if necessary to back up UN recommendations may have been interpreted as a concession on Israel&#39;s part that the UN peacekeeping force can be nothing other than a UN Army with full enforcement powers under Chapter 7.  <br /><br /><em>OP1.  Calls for a full cessation of hostilities based upon, in particular, the immediate cessation by Hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by Israel of all offensive military operations; </em><br /><br />Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah has called this provision unfair: it only bars &quot;offensive&quot; military operations by Israel while prohibiting &quot;all&quot; Hezbollah attacks.   Yet this is what lawyers would call a distinction without a difference.   So long as Hezbollah ceases all attacks, Israel would not have any justification for offensive or defensive operations.<br /><br /><em>OP2.  Upon full cessation of hostilities, calls upon the government of Lebanon and UNIFIL as authorized by paragraph 11 to deploy their forces together throughout the South and calls upon the government of Israel, as that deployment begins, to withdraw all of its forces from Southern Lebanon in parallel;</em> <br /><br />Just as the ink was drying on the UN Resolution, Israel hurriedly moved 20,000 of its ground forces across the border into Lebanon.  This action shocked many of the members of the Security Council in New York.  They should have seen it coming.   Israel&#39;s decision seems to have been triggered by the &quot;in parallel&quot; language of OP2.  With a total now of 30,000 soldiers in Lebanon, Israel is in a position of withdrawing them one-for-one only with each replacement soldier from the UN or from Lebanon.  The UN peacekeeping force is capped at 15,000 (see below, OP 11), and Lebanon has amassed 15,000 troops for deployment in its southern area.  <br /><br /><em>OP3.  Emphasizes the importance of the extension of the control of the government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory in accordance with the provisions of resolution 1559 (2004) and resolution 1680 (2006), and of the relevant provisions of the Taif Accords, for it to exercise its full sovereignty, so that there will be no weapons without the consent of the government of Lebanon and no authority other than that of the government of Lebanon;</em><br /><br />This is one of the many paragraphs of the Resolution that is premised upon the assumption that the Lebanese government wants to disarm and render inoperative the Hezbollah fighters.  But what if the Lebanese government and Hezbollah in the past few days have reached a secret accommodation between themselves so that they are no longer in opposition to each other?  Then many of the provisions of this Resolution could fall apart.  I will take up this possibility in greater detail as we proceed through the operative paragraphs of this Resolution.<br /><br /><em>OP4.  Reiterates its strong support for full respect for the Blue Line;</em> <br /><br />With Israel having so many boundary disputes, it comes as a relief to all sides that at least the Blue Line between Lebanon and Israel is being made permanent.<br /><br /><em>OP5.  Also reiterates its strong support, as recalled in all its previous relevant resolutions, for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized borders, as contemplated by the Israeli-Lebanese General Armistice Agreement of 23 March 1949;</em> <br /><br />This provision could backfire if Hezbollah becomes integrally associated with the government of Lebanon.   The parallel with Palestine is striking: Hamas became the democratically elected government of the Palestinians to the utter dismay of Israel.  Now the four-week war between Lebanon and Israel has moved the majority of the Lebanese public to support Hezbollah, as if there has been a virtual election of Hezbollah to the government.  <br /><br /><em>OP6.  Calls on the international community to take immediate steps to extend its financial and humanitarian assistance to the Lebanese people, including through facilitating the safe return of displaced persons and, under the authority of the Government of Lebanon, reopening airports and harbours, consistent with paragraphs 14 and 15, and calls on it also to consider further assistance in the future to contribute to the reconstruction and development of Lebanon;</em> <br /><br />A sound humanitarian provision to which no one could object.<br /><br /><em>OP7.  Affirms that all parties are responsible for ensuring that no action is taken contrary to paragraph 1 that might adversely affect the search for a long-term solution, humanitarian access to civilian populations, including safe passage for humanitarian convoys, or the voluntary and safe return of displaced persons, and calls on all parties to comply with this responsibility and to cooperate with the Security Council;</em> <br /><br />This is more than precatory language.  It enables the Security Council to enforce its provisions under the Chapter 7 authorization of this Resolution that was inserted above in PP 10.<br /><br /><em>OP8.  Calls for Israel and Lebanon to support a permanent ceasefire and a long-term solution based on the following principles and elements:<ul><li>full respect for the Blue Line by both parties, <br /><br /><li>security arrangements to prevent the resumption of hostilities, including the establishment between the Blue Line and the Litani river of an area free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those of the government of Lebanon and of UNIFIL as authorized in paragraph 11, deployed in this area,</em> <br /><br />Whether or not it occurred to the Security Council, this provision could turn into an economic bonanza for Lebanon in partial compensation for the suffering and losses it has endured for the past four weeks.  The area between the Blue Line and the Litani river will be one of the most secure places in the Middle East, with 30,000 soldiers guarding it.   Moreover, the soldiers will bring foreign money into the area to purchase food, supplies, clothing, recreational gear, services, accommodations, bars, etc.  Not only will displaced Lebanese civilians return to the area, but Palestinian refugees might also emigrate there to take up the many jobs that will be
 created.   <br /><br /><em><li>full implementation of the relevant provisions of the Taif Accords, and of resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006), that require the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon, so that, pursuant to the Lebanese cabinet decision of July 27, 2006, there will be no weapons or authority in Lebanon other than that of the Lebanese state,</em><br /><br />It is clear that the authors of this provision intend the disarmament of all members of Hezbollah.  But this is where common sense must interrupt our formal analysis of the Resolution and ask: what group in its right mind would consent to a Resolution that calls for its disarmament to be likely followed by arrests and prosecutions for war crimes?  (See my <a href="/forumy/2006/07/war-crimes-and-mideast-conflict.php">JURIST editorial on war crimes</a>.)  The only reasonably conceivable reason Hezbollah has agreed to this Resolution is that it has been assured, by secret agreement with the government of Lebanon, that its members will not be disarmed, arrested, or prosecuted.  My best guess is that the agreement calls for members of Hezbollah to be smoothly integrated into the armed forces of the Lebanese government.  <br /><br /><em><li>no foreign forces in Lebanon without the consent of its government,</em><br /><br />No problem if Hezbollah becomes a governmental force instead of a foreign force.<br /><br /><em><li>no sales or supply of arms and related materiel to Lebanon except as authorized by its government,</em><br /><br />In my <a href="/forumy/2006/07/qana-war-crimes-and-pending-un.php">JURIST editorial</a> last week, I focused upon the importation of rockets and rocket launchers by Hezbollah as the most important issue that Israel faces in this conflict.  So long as Syria and Iran supply increasingly sophisticated rockets to Hezbollah, Israel&#39;s security diminishes with each shipment.  What would be ideal, from Israel&#39;s point of view, is a blockade on all arms and military equipment to Lebanon.  But instead Israel has settled for a loophole: there is no blockade to arms and military equipment if authorized by the Lebanese government.  In my view, this is the reason why Hezbollah has agreed to the UN Resolution.  Hezbollah must believe that it can look forward to importing sophisticated armaments and rockets under the authority and permission of the government of Lebanon.  By the same token, the magnitude of this concession makes it appear that Israel has thrown in the towel. <br /><br /><em><li>provision to the United Nations of all remaining maps of land mines in Lebanon in Israel&#39;s possession;</em></ul><em>OP9.  Invites the Secretary General to support efforts to secure as soon as possible agreements in principle from the Government of Lebanon and the Government of Israel to the principles and elements for a long-term solution as set forth in paragraph 8, and expresses its intention to be actively involved; <br /><br />OP10.  Requests the Secretary General to develop, in liaison with relevant international actors and the concerned parties, proposals to implement the relevant provisions of the Taif Accords, and resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006), including disarmament, and for delineation of the international borders of Lebanon, especially in those areas where the border is disputed or uncertain, including by dealing with the Chebaa farms area, and to present to the Security Council those proposals within thirty days; <br /><br />OP11.  Decides, in order to supplement and enhance the force in numbers, equipment, mandate and scope of operations, to authorize an increase in the force strength of UNIFIL to a maximum of 15,000 troops, and that the force shall, in addition to carrying out its mandate under resolutions 425 and 426 (1978):</em><br /><br />Is the UNIFIL force, which has been at 2,000 troops since 1978, a Chapter 6 or a Chapter 7 force?  It has certainly behaved as if it were an entirely defensive Chapter 6 force.  Yet Resolutions 425 and 426 (1978) contain language that fixes UNIFIL within Chapter 7.  It appears that Hezbollah, in accepting this Resolution, has abandoned the area between the Blue Line and the Litani river.   This area was extremely important to Hezbollah because of its proximity to the northern Israeli cities, making it possible for Hezbollah to use short-range Katyusha rockets against Israel.  But with Hezbollah&#39;s success in holding out against Israel for four weeks, Hezbollah can now look forward to importing more sophisticated and deadly rockets from Iran and Syria.  The Katyusha rockets, after all, are World War II models.  The new ones can be fired from a much longer range with greater accuracy and a greater payload, over the heads, so to speak, of the peacekeepers in southern Lebanon.<br /><br /><em>     a.  Monitor the cessation of hostilities; <br /><br />     b.  Accompany and support the Lebanese armed forces as they deploy throughout the South, including along the Blue Line, as Israel withdraws its armed forces from Lebanon as provided in paragraph 2; <br /><br />     c.  Coordinate its activities related to paragraph 11 (b) with the Government of Lebanon and the Government of Israel; <br /><br />     d.  Extend its assistance to help ensure humanitarian access to civilian populations and the voluntary and safe return of displaced persons; <br /><br />     e.  Assist the Lebanese armed forces in taking steps towards the establishment of the area as referred to in paragraph 8; <br /><br />     f.  Assist the government of Lebanon, at its request, to implement paragraph 14;</em><br /><br />It is clear from all these provisions of OP 11 that something decisive must have happened between Hezbollah and the government of Lebanon in the past few days.  I have no evidence of any such thing.  But purely from inference, it seems to me that the two have joined forces for the following reasons:  (a)  Israel&#39;s ill-advised indiscriminate bombing campaign in Lebanon, reminiscent of Operation Barbarossa in World War II which turned the citizens of Russia against the German armies, has elevated Hezbollah to the heights of popularity among the Lebanese people; (b)  half of the Lebanese army is composed of Shiites, who are of the same faith as Hezbollah; (c)  many of the senior officers of the Lebanese army are members of Hezbollah; (d)  Hezbollah is already a minor party that is officially part of the Lebanese government; (e)  Hezbollah is already more powerful than the Lebanese government and its army; (f)  Hezbollah is increasing its power due to training, funding, and arms shipments from Iran and Syria; (g) one may reasonably assume that many Hezbollah fighters will now enlist in the Lebanese army, thus averting &quot;disarmament&quot; while simply changing their uniforms.      <br /><br /><em>OP12.  Acting in support of a request from the government of Lebanon to deploy an international force to assist it to exercise its authority throughout the territory, authorizes UNIFIL to take all necessary action in areas of deployment of its forces and as it deems within its capabilities, to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind, to resist attempts by forceful means to prevent it from discharging its duties under the mandate of the Security Council, and to protect United Nations personnel, facilities, installations and equipment, ensure the security and freedom of movement of United Nations personnel, humanitarian workers, and, without prejudice to the responsibility of the government of Lebanon, to protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence;</em> <br /><br />The use of the term "authorizes" in OP 12 means that the Security Council is acting here under its Chapter 7 powers.  In other words, UNIFIL is a lot more than a conventional peacekeeping force.  It is an Army acting under the direct authority of the Security Council.  <br /><br /><em>OP13.  Requests the Secretary General urgently to put in place measures to ensure UNIFIL is able to carry out the functions envisaged in this resolution, urges Member States to consider making appropriate contributi
ons to UNIFIL and to respond positively to requests for assistance from the Force, and expresses its strong appreciation to those who have contributed to UNIFIL in the past;</em><br /><br />The Chapter 7 mandate to the new UNIFIL has already made it so attractive that OP 13 became unnecessary as soon as it was written.  Nations are now vying to send their own soldiers to UNIFIL.  It was only a week ago that most nations expressed their reluctance to send any of their ground troops into Lebanon.<br /><br /><em>OP14.  Calls upon the Government of Lebanon to secure its borders and other entry points to prevent the entry in Lebanon without its consent of arms or related materiel and requests UNIFIL as authorized in paragraph 11 to assist the Government of Lebanon at its request;</em> <br /><br />The important thing here is what is not mentioned.  UNIFIL is not authorized to act outside its assigned territory.  Thus, if UNIFIL wishes to add to the blockade of weapon shipments into Lebanon originating in Syria or Iran, it must receive authorization from the Lebanese government.  This effectively means that if the government wants to import such weapons, UNIFIL cannot interfere with it.<br /><br /><em>OP15.  Decides further that all states shall take the necessary measures to prevent, by their nationals or from their territories or using their flag vessels or aircraft, <br /><br />     (a) the sale or supply to any entity or individual in Lebanon of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary equipment, and spare parts for the aforementioned, whether or not originating in their territories, and <br /><br />     (b) the provision to any entity or individual in Lebanon of any technical training or assistance related to the provision, manufacture, maintenance or use of the items listed in subparagraph (a) above, except that these prohibitions shall not apply to arms, related material, training or assistance authorized by the Government of Lebanon or by UNIFIL as authorized in paragraph 11;</em><br /><br />Notice the huge ambiguity between these paragraphs (a) and (b).   Paragraph (a) seems to require any country, such as Iran for example, to prevent its nationals from sending missiles. for example, to Lebanon.  Paragraph (b) allows Iran to send technical trainers to Lebanon if the government of Lebanon authorizes it.  The ambiguity arises from the "except" clause in (b): does it apply just to the technical trainers mentioned in (b), or does it also relate back to (a) and allow missiles to be sent to Lebanon if authorized by the government of Lebanon?  Furthermore, on either interpretation, what happens if a state violates OP 15?  The Resolution does not contain any provision for enforcement of OP 15.  Thus the Security Council would have to enact a further Resolution to use force to impede any state from sending missiles to Lebanon.  But this further Resolution might be vetoed by Russia or China, for example, who may not want to accept any restrictions on their power to freely export goods or services.  The reader may ask how such basic ambiguities find their way into international resolutions and treaties when the drafters are surely intelligent enough to spot them and to clarify the language.  The straightforward answer is that the drafters were unable to agree on any plain language and so they intentionally adopted ambiguous language in order to "give something" to both sides.<br /><br /><em>OP16.  Decides to extend the mandate of UNIFIL until 31 August 2007, and expresses its intention to consider in a later resolution further enhancements to the mandate and other steps to contribute to the implementation of a permanent ceasefire and a long-term solution; <br /><br />OP17.  Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council within one week on the implementation of this resolution and subsequently on a regular basis; <br /><br />OP18.  Stresses the importance of, and the need to achieve, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, based on all its relevant resolutions including its resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973; <br /><br />OP19.  Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.</em><br /><br />POSTSCRIPT.   Hezbollah&#39;s rockets have been a wake-up call to Israel.  Or, more accurately, it is like a dream in which you dream you are waking up only to fall into a deeper nightmare.  The rockets will not uninvent themselves.  The UN Resolution is not going to keep them away.  Israel&#39;s best defense, in my humble opinion, is to return to strict adherence to international law, to move its <a href="/forum/damato1.php">Wall</a> from Palestinian property and either dismantle it or erect it on its own property, and to cease and desist from <a href="/world/israelborders.php">land-grabbing</a>.  For what is vital to me, a non-Jew, is Jewish morality, its teachings on justice, its immense contribution to civilization, the music of Gershwin and Weill that daily runs through my mind, and even its incomparable humor.  These must survive.  War is not the way.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Anthony D.Amato is Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University, where he teaches international law and human rights.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/damato.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='120' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<title>Fighting Words: The Abuse of Islam in Political Rhetoric</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that politicians&#39; increasing use of abusive language to describe Islam in the context of the war on terror is symptomatic of multiple problems in Anglo-American democracy and culture...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>t is becoming fashionable for elected officials in the Anglo-American world, notably in the United States and the United Kingdom, to employ abusive language involving Islam. Phrases such as &quot;Islamic terrorism,&quot; &quot;totalitarian Islam,&quot; &quot;crimes of Islam,&quot; and &quot;Islamic fascism&quot; are freely used, with sadist disrespect, to condemn real and imagined terrorists who practice the faith of Islam.  For years, and long before the 9/11 attacks, neo-conservative scholarship has been determined to popularize the concept of the <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/wlj/45-1/articles/khan-liaquat.pdf">essentialist terrorist</a> [PDF] who purportedly draws his deepest inspiration from the puritanical beliefs of Islam and equipped with cruelty, commits violence against innocent Jews and Christians. According to this, occupations, invasions, territorial thefts, assassinations, house demolitions, human rights violations, and other such grievances have nothing to do with Islamic resistance. Islamic terrorism, according to neo-conservative scholarship, stems from the Sharia, from passages of the Quran, and from a puritanical mindset that manufactures pretexts to maim and kill. These killers, it is further contended, wish to impose Islamic law over the entire world. <br /><br />Gradually but successfully, the propagandized essentialist terrorist and the attendant abusive language against Islam have entered political rhetoric. Presidents, prime ministers, congressmen, senators, and other officials are now freely using abusive language to malign Islam, not through uncaught moments of Freudian slips but as a policy of expressive audacity. <br /><br />Commenting on the alleged plan of British nationals of Pakistani descent to blow up US-bound planes over the Atlantic, President Bush said: &quot;This is a stark reminder that this nation is at war with Islamic fascists.&quot; Senator Rick Santorum distinguishes between terrorism and Islamic fascism, arguing that terrorism is a tactic but what the West is fighting is "Islamic fascism" which is "truly evil" and which is "as big a threat today as Nazism and communism."  <br /><br />This new trend to openly curse Islam echoes the words of UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, who said: &quot;We should not be apologetic or defensive in defining the problems of terrorism.&quot; <br /><br />One wonders why elected officials in supposedly democratic nations, which tout the principles of equal respect and dignity for all, use abusive language to wound the sentiments of more than a billion people across the world. Several explanations come to mind. <br /><br />First, the abusive language may be described as an effect of an over-generalization. Suppose that Muslim militants indeed wish to impose Islam on the Anglo-American world, a supposition that even the militants would ridicule as blatant propaganda to infuriate domestic audiences. Though mounted on a questionable supposition, the label is accurate to the extent that the use of violence to forcibly modify the values of a foreign nation is indeed fascism - a definition that, ironically, would also paint President Bush as an American fascist for his forcible democratization of Afghanistan and Iraq. Even if President Bush were declared a fascist, it would be wrong to describe his foreign policy as American fascism because that is tantamount to over- as well as mis-generalization.<br /><br />Islamic fascism as a descriptive label also fails to capture the limited meaning of describing militants who are supposedly fascists. The label comes across as a prescriptive indictment, suggesting that Islam is intolerant, violent, and aggressively self-righteous in imposing its values on non-Islamic cultures. If Anglo-American politicians are using the label in this broad sense, and thus accusing Islam and not merely the militants, they should say so. If they are using the label in a limited sense and do not wish to antagonize the entire Muslim world or malign the faith of Islam, they must abandon the label.  The label of Islamic fascism even in a limited sense is not an intelligent use of the language, for it is susceptible to multiple interpretations. Its use in the broad sense is highly provocative and counterproductive to the war on terrorism. It foolishly alienates all Muslims.<br /><br />Second, there might be a democratic argument for politicians using abusive language involving Islam. But no American politician would describe pedophilia scandals in some Catholic churches as Catholic pedophilia. Such an over-generalization would be politically unwise because no prudent politician would want to lose Catholic money and votes. Likewise, no politician would use abusive language against Jews or Judaism for fear of alienating that community, not to mention the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which keeps a close tab on what American politicians are saying and doing. Because American Muslims do not have loads of money, lobbying clout, or votes, however, they constitute a minority that can be easily sacrificed and trashed. If this is the reason behind abusive rhetoric against Islam, however, it reveals a sad truth about democracy in general and American democracy in particular which has had a tainted record when it comes to the abusive treatment of minorities including native Indians, Blacks, and others.<br /><br />Third, there seems to exist an unexamined assumption in American political circles that Islam is a foreign religion, an outsider, the other. Politicians who use abusive language against Islam do not see Islam as part of American multi-religious fabric. Despite their enchantment with secularism, they still see this nation as Christian, perhaps Judeo-Christian, ignoring the fact that millions of Muslims, immigrants and native born, now live in all states of the United States. Hundreds of mosques in America, though under surveillance, furnish indelible signs that Islam has arrived in this country, not to forcibly convert anyone but to enrich American culture, diversity, history, architecture, sciences, and, yes, laws. Let American politicians greet Islam and Muslims with <em>Assalaam ulaikum</em> (peace be upon you) if for no other reason than to remind them that their religion is one of peace and not of violence.<br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan is a professor at Washburn University School of Law in Kansas.

If the Security Council adopts the resolution, its language indicates that the Council will be acting under its Chapter 7 powers, which does not require any country's consent.  Israel, however, contends that multilateral peacekeeping forces require the consent of the parties to the conflict.  This has been true historically only because there has not been a Chapter 7 multilateral force up to now.<br /> <br /> Here is a brief analysis of the key provisions of the draft resolution:<br /><br /> <strong>Ceasefire</strong><br /><br /> The draft resolution calls for a "full cessation of hostilities."  Hezbollah must cease all attacks.  Israel must cease "all offensive military operations."  <br /><br /> If this were the only provision in the resolution, it would probably be acceptable to Hezbollah but not to Israel.  For Hezbollah could use the ceasefire to replenish and upgrade rockets imported from Iran and Syria, and to build new rocket launchers and repair those damaged by the Israeli bombing campaign.  <br /><br /> To make the draft resolution palatable to Israel, it adds additional provisions, though they are tucked under the heading of  "a long-term solution."  But the resolution itself does not distinguish between short term and long term.  Hence under the kind of loose interpretation of Security Council resolutions pioneered by the Bush Administration, these "long-term" provisions might be implemented as soon as the ink on the resolution is dry.  <br /><br /> The two provisions in the resolution that are of most help to Israel are:<br /><br /> <strong>Removal of Hezbollah from Southern Lebanon</strong><br /><br /> The area between Lebanon's southern boundary and the Litani river, which is now being attacked by Israeli air and ground forces, is the closest in proximity to various Israeli towns and cities which have been under constant attack by Hezbollah's rockets.  If Security Council forces intervene to finish Israeli's task of clearing the area, then Israel's oft-stated goal of driving Hezbollah out of this sensitive area could be accomplished.  My guess is that Hezbollah is resigned to this result anyway: it should make no difference to Hezbollah whether the troops used against it are Israeli's or foreign.<br /><br /> But in the weeks of the conflict that began on July 13th, Hezbollah has proven its staying power to its supporters Iran and Syria.  It's quite possible that new rocket shipments to Hezbollah will have a longer range and greater explosive power than the shorter-range types like the Katyushas that Hezbollah has primarily used up to now.  Indeed, Iran has just admitted that it has supplied Hezbollah with some Zelzal-2 rockets which can reach as far as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.  Hence Hezbollah may not need the southern Lebanon "staging area" to continue its rocket attacks against Israel.  <br /><br /> <strong>Embargo</strong><br /><br /> The draft resolution provides for the "establishment of an international embargo on the sale or supply of arms and related material to Lebanon except as authorized by its government."  This is perhaps the "kicker" in the resolution that might make it acceptable to Israel.<br /><br /> Yet the kicker might be too strong, leading Hezbollah to reject the ceasefire.  In that case, Israel could hardly accept the ceasefire unilaterally, allowing Hezbollah to continue firing rockets at Israeli cities and towns.  For its part, Hezbollah cannot afford a cut-off of its rocket imports from Iran and Syria.  Hence Hezbollah's strategic considerations may turn on its intelligence estimate of whether the international blockade might be circumvented.<br /><br /> An international blockade would be extraordinarily expensive for the international community to establish and maintain.  Lebanon's long seacoast on the Mediterranean with its dozen good ports would be hard for the Security Council's forces to monitor and police.  Even satellite reconnaissance might not be able to detect submarines with cargoes of rockets that could enter Lebanese ports at night.  On Lebanon's eastern side, its long Lebanese-Syrian border is permeable.  Even if the highway from Damascus is blocked, a Ho Chi Min Trail might be constructed for nighttime transport of rockets and munitions from Syria into Lebanon.  <br /><br /> <strong>Sovereignty for Lebanon</strong><br /><br /> Throughout the draft resolution, references are made to the territorial integrity, political independence, and sovereignty of Lebanon.  The authority of the Lebanese army will be co-extensive with that of the multilateral force.  <br /><br /> Yet this provision may backfire.  Although the Lebanese government has traditionally been hostile to Hezbollah, the latter is an elected minority party within the government.  More importantly, popular support of Hezbollah has skyrocketed since the fighting began.  The Lebanese people have become increasingly vocal in their condemnation of Israeli air attacks that have demolished homes, hospitals, ambulances, schools, and even whole neighborhoods.  There is a small possibility that by the time the Security Council begins to actively implement any resolution on the Middle East Crisis, the government of Lebanon will have come into the de facto if not de jure control of Hezbollah itself.<br /><br /> The resolution simply assumes that this will not happen.  As we have seen from its quotation above, the embargo provision is subject to an exception for imports authorized by the government of Lebanon.  That exception would swallow the rule if Hezbollah attains decisive political power within Lebanon.<br /><br /> <strong>Parties in Interest</strong><br /><br /> Every nation has a stake in the cessation of armed hostilities.  But the real parties in interest in the Middle East crisis are Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, Lebanon, and Israel.  Without the presence of the first three of these sitting around a table, the chances of a negotiated peace are low.  The United Nations must pass some kind of ceasefire resolution; not to do so would be unthinkable.  Yet the resolution as currently drafted does not have an aura of success.  <br /> <br /><br /><em>Anthony D.Amato is Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University, where he teaches international law and human rights.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/damato.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='120' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<title>The Security Council on Iran: Fiddling While the Middle East Burns?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/staff/academic/joyner/">Daniel Joyner</a> of the University of Warwick School of Law in the United Kingdom says that the timing of the UN Security Council&#39;s passage of a Chapter VII resolution on Iran in the midst of an escalating Middle East conflict and in the face of an existing Iranian commitment to respond to a Western diplomatic offer by August 22 is puzzling, and may have more to do with the desire of some member states for confrontation than compromise on the issue of Iran&#39;s nuclear program...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/danieljoyner.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>hile Lebanon is taken back thirty years in its economic development and political prospects by Israeli bombardment, and Iraq continues its seemingly inexorable slide into open civil war, the United Nations Security Council this week brought back to the top of its agenda the Iran nuclear issue.   <br /><br />On Monday the Council issued Resolution 1696, in which, acting under Article 40 of Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, it demanded that Iran suspend all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, and requested a report by the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) by August 31 to confirm this suspension.  It further endorsed the diplomatic package deal which had been offered to Iran by the permanent five members of the Security Council plus Germany, which promised various economic incentives and the provision of light water nuclear reactors to Iran in exchange for a long-term moratorium on enrichment activities and research on Iranian soil. <br /><br />Resolution 1696 is notable because it is the first time that the Security Council has acted on the Iran nuclear issue using its mandatory powers under Chapter VII of the Charter.  Until then, declarations from the Council to Iran had been issued as Presidential statements, or as hortatory, non-binding entreaties for Iran to abide by the decisions of the IAEA Board of Governors, which have called on Iran to cease enrichment activities, and provide a fuller account of its nuclear programs as confidence building measures to convince the world that its nuclear ambitions are in fact aimed at civilian energy production and not weapons development.  <br /><br />In using its Chapter VII powers to back up these statements, the Council has substantively changed the legal issues presented in the Iranian nuclear case. Iran has always claimed that it has a right to conduct enrichment activities and research on its own soil, pursuant to Article IV of the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), of which it is a member. It claimed, quite persuasively, that this right could not be abridged or restricted, even by the demands of the IAEA, whose role is limited to monitoring state compliance with its safeguards agreements. <br /><br />Until Monday, Iran had been quite correct in its legal interpretation. However, the U.N. Charter in Article 103 specifies that "In the event of a conflict between the obligations of the Members of the United Nations under the present Charter and their obligations under any other international agreement, their obligations under the present Charter shall prevail." The charter is thus a super-treaty, its obligations superior to all other treaty obligations by its own terms.  One of the substantive obligations United Nations members undertake in the Charter is spelled out in Article 25, which states that "The Members of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the present Charter."<br /><br />Thus, with the passage of Resolution 1696, the Council has invoked Iran's obligation as a U.N. member to abide by its decisions under Article 25, which is an obligation superior to all other treaty obligations pursuant to Article 103, inclusive of the rights and duties contained in the NPT.  Iran is now legally obligated to comply with Resolution 1696, which includes a suspension of all enrichment activities, including research and development.  And the Council has, in Operative Paragraph 8 of the resolution, expressed its intention to consider the imposition of economic and diplomatic sanctions under Article 41 of Chapter VII if Iran does not comply.<br /><br />All this being said, the timing of the passage of Resolution 1696 is quite inexplicable. Iran had already committed to formally respond to the diplomatic package offered to it by August 22, and, at least in its public statements, seemed to be seriously considering the deal.  It is thus extremely difficult to understand why the Security Council, particularly at this moment when the Middle East is already in turmoil and so many other issues demand its attention, would consider the passage of this resolution both necessary and timely.  <br /><br />The day before the resolution was passed, Hamid Reza Asefi, a spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, warned that "If any resolution is issued against Iran tomorrow, the package would be left off the agenda by Iran," and that any such resolution "will confront the region with more tension."   Why would the Council thus risk escalating tensions in a region already tearing at the seams, and push Iran further into a defensive posture by raising the diplomatic stakes on such a sensitive issue, when Iran had already committed to respond to the offer made through political channels only three weeks later? <br /><br />Perhaps the sense of Western negotiators was that Iran would never fully accept the package deal, and that it was simply vying for time in its commitment to respond in late August.  Perhaps Resolution 1696 was intended as something of a legal "preemptive strike" to show Iran that the Council isn't willing to be led along indefinitely by such carrots of hope for a diplomatic resolution.<br /><br />Or perhaps, as Iran's Ambassador to the U.N. has stated, Resolution 1696 is another example of the "persistence of some to draw arbitrary red lines and deadlines that [have] closed the door to any compromise."  As the current author has commented on a previous posting on this issue on JURIST, the entire movement by Western states particularly to increase pressure on Iran through legal and diplomatic means to renounce its nuclear programs has been premature and ill-conceived, as no evidence has been produced by the IAEA or by any other body of any continuing breach of Iran's safeguard's agreement or of any breach of its substantive NPT obligations.  Thus, the idea that Resolution 1696 is simply the next installment in a series of impetuous and unconsidered procedural actions pushed through international bodies by Western states which have brought the situation to this crisis point, is not an unreasonable conclusion. <br /><br />Despite the change in the legal status of the dispute which Resolution 1696 brings about, the prudential character of the West's efforts to confront Iran over its nuclear programs, and the particular tactics of those efforts, remain strikingly dubious and unlikely to produce the effect of a peaceful abandonment by Iran of its nuclear ambitions.  The government of President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad is highly unlikely to accede to what it sees as hubristic and hypocritical demands emanating from nuclear weapons possessing Western states for it to give up what it sees as its inalienable right to produce civilian nuclear energy on its own soil, regardless of the changed legal character of these demands.  <br /><br />Once Iran fails to meet the August 31 deadline for suspension of its enrichment activities, which it undoubtedly will, it is still not at all clear that the political will exists among the members of the Security Council to impose meaningful sanctions on Iran through a further Chapter VII resolution.  Russia and China remain much less commit
ted to this path in the Council than do the other three permanent members, and it was due to their concerns that Resolution 1696 was watered down to require further consideration and another resolution before any such sanctions were imposed. <br /><br />One cannot escape the impression that, in the passage of Resolution 1696 the Security Council is still fiddling away in a course of action destined to fail in its aims, while the Middle East burns.  If it does indeed fail, and Iran continues its nuclear programs unimpeded by the now formal demands of the Security Council, the consequences for the perceived legitimacy and effectiveness of the Security Council will likely be severe.  Therein also looms the specter of unilateral action, through economic or even military means, by a coalition of willing states <em>a la</em> Iraq.  In the final analysis, perhaps this has been the intention of some of the states orchestrating this otherwise largely inexplicable course of action against Iran all along.<br /><br /><br /><em>Daniel Joyner is an Assistant Professor at the University of Warwick School of Law in the United Kingdom, where he writes and researches in the area of proliferation studies.

No previous natural disaster in the nation's history inflicted a grimmer toll.  The legendary city of New Orleans all but sank when its levees failed and the resulting storm surge drowned much of the city and many of its feeblest, most vulnerable residents.  Although Katrina exposed flaws in virtually every aspect of disaster management at every level of government in the United States, the magnitude and senselessness of the loss serve to indict American society for its callous disregard of social vulnerability.<br /><br /> "The moral test of government," said Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, "is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped."  <em>Arnold v. Arizona Dep't of Health Servs</em>., 160 Ariz. 593, 775 P.2d 521, 537 (1989) (quoting Humphrey).  The cloud of natural disaster puts government to an extreme test of its ability to protect those citizens who dwell in the dawn, the twilight, and the shadows of life.  As Katrina demonstrated, social vulnerability profoundly affects the ability of governments to prepare for, respond to, mitigate, and recover from natural disasters.<br /><br /> Natural disaster supposedly does not discriminate; it putatively strikes everyone in its path, without regard to race, class, age, sex, or disability.  In other words, "poverty is hierarchic, smog is democratic." Scott Frickel, <a href="http://understandingkatrina.ssrc.org/frickel"><em>Our Toxic Gumbo: Recipe for a Politics of Environmental Knowledge</em></a>, (Oct. 6, 2005) (quoting Ulrich Beck, <em>Risk Society: Toward a New Modernity</em> 36 (1986)). Closer examination of the interplay between natural and social factors at work in any disaster, however, belies this assumption.  Disaster does not so much erase as expose social vulnerabilities within the society it strikes.  Although "'[n]atural disasters' such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods are sometimes viewed as 'great social equalizers" in the sense that "they strike unpredictably and at random, affecting black and white, rich and poor, sick and well alike," Katrina bluntly demonstrated that "the harms are not visited randomly or equally in our society." Center for Progressive Reform, <em>An Unnatural Disaster: The Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina</em> 34 (2005).<br /><br /> Disasters are never strictly "natural."  Catastrophic losses invariably stem from social as well as environmental factors.  Around the world, social injustice contributes so heavily to the incidence and intensity of natural disasters that the quest for domestic and global equality may be rightfully regarded as a valuable tool for refining the law's approach to disaster preparedness, response, mitigation, compensation, and rebuilding.<br /><br /> The first step in overcoming natural disaster lies in defining social vulnerability.  According to one definition, social vulnerability means "the characteristics of a person or group in terms of their capacity to anticipate, cope with, resist, and recover from the impact of a natural hazard." Piers Blaikie, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis &amp; Ben Wisner, <em>At Risk: Natural Hazards, People's Vulnerability and Disasters</em> 9 (1994).  In <a href="http://understandingkatrina.ssrc.org/Cutter"><em>The Geography of Social Vulnerability: Race, Class, and Catastrophe</em></a>, Susan Cutter elaborates this definition in a very useful way: "Social vulnerability is partially a product of social inequalities &#8212; those social factors and forces that create the susceptibility of various groups to harm, and in turn affect their ability to respond, and bounce back (resilience) after the disaster."<br /><br /> In other words, social vulnerability consists of two distinct components: the susceptibility of certain groups to harm and the resilience of these groups.  Susceptibility is an ex ante quality; it is already in place when disaster strikes.  Inequality in New Orleans and elsewhere throughout America has taken hundreds of years to build.  Differences in living conditions, wealth, political power, and so forth rendered the poorest, often black victims of Katrina susceptible to disproportionate loss during the storm.<br /><br /> Resilience, by contrast, assumes importance after the fact.  Rebuilding communities destroyed by natural disaster demands extraordinary human and material resources.  Material resources available for recovery &#8212; and often taken for granted &#8212; in more affluent communities may simply not exist in poorer communities.  Crucial physical and social infrastructure, often strained or undermined by disaster and its aftermath, is not as readily reestablished.<br /><br /> Katrina played itself in media reports as a grand tragedy of race and class, of official incompetence and social injustice.  If anything, the condemnation of a society that found itself unprepared for Katrina has not been severe enough.  To prevent or at least to mitigate future disasters, we must confront social vulnerability in all its manifestations, from its racial and class-based dimensions to other vectors of discrimination laid bare by the storm, such as sex, age, and immigrant status.  All of these factors contribute to the susceptibility of specific individuals and groups to disaster.  In addition to recognizing and making best efforts to ameliorate these sources of susceptibility to harm during disasters, government owes its weakest citizens a corresponding responsibility to maximize their resilience in disaster's wake.<br /><br /> If anything redeems the tragedy that was Hurricane Katrina, it is America's collective appreciation of the survival, suffering, and heroism that accompanied the storm.  A society better attuned to questions of social vulnerability might yet glimpse some future time when that storm's winds and rains have fully subsided and "the needles thick on the ground" of the Gulf shore "will deaden the footfall so that we shall move among trees as soundlessly as smoke."  Robert Penn Warren, <em>All the King&#39;s Men</em> 438 (Harvest 1996; 1st ed. 1946).  "But that will be a long time from now, and soon now we shall go &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; into the convulsion of the world, out of history into history and the awful responsibility of Time."  <em>Id.</em><br /><br /><br /><em>Jim Chen is Associate Dean and James L. Krusemark Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota Law School. He is the co-editor (with Daniel Farber) of </em>Disasters and the Law: Katrina and Beyond<em> (Aspen, 2006). </em><br />

I limit my comments only to those paragraphs where I take a perspective that differs from Prof. D'Amato's views.<br /><br /><em>The Security Council, <br /><br />PP1. Recalling all its previous resolutions on Lebanon, in particular resolutions 425 (1978), 426 (1978), 520 (1982), 1559 (2004), 1655 (2006) 1680 (2006) and 1697 (2006), as well as the statements of its President on the situation in Lebanon, in particular the statements of 18 June 2000 (S/PRST/2000/21), of 19 October 2004 (S/PRST/2004/36), of 4 May 2005 (S/PRST/2005/17) of 23 January 2006 (S/PRST/2006/3) and of 30 July 2006 (S/PRST/2006/35),</em><br /> <br />Referring to previous resolutions does not usually mean that they are superseded. The normal usage is to quote previous resolutions as building blocks on the way to the resolution that follows.<br /><em><br />PP2. Expressing its utmost concern at the continuing escalation of hostilities in Lebanon and in Israel since Hezbollah&#39;s attack on Israel on 12 July 2006, which has already caused hundreds of deaths and injuries on both sides, extensive damage to civilian infrastructure and hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons,</em><br /><br />The Hezbollah launched an unprovoked attacked against Israeli patrols in Israel territory, they killed a number of soldiers and kidnapped two of them. This attack was accompanied by a Hizbollah barrage of rockets against both military and civilian targets in Israel. By any reasonable standard this is an armed attack against Israel. The UN Security Council recognizes it as such.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/mideastconflict.php">Middle East Conflict</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2006/08/middle-east-resolution-vote-un.php">Middle East resolution vote</a> [UN Security Council]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><em>PP3. Emphasizing the need for an end of violence, but at the same time emphasizing the need to address urgently the causes that have given rise to the current crisis, including by the unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers,</em><br /> <br />The call for release of Israeli soldiers is unconditional. It is not an operative paragraph of the resolution but the preamble to a resolution is used to express the background and motives behind a resolution. It is relevant to add that, in gross violation of humanitarian law and human rights law, no information has been provided about the health of the kidnapped soldiers nor has the Red Cross been allowed to visit them or communicate with them.<br />  <br /><em>PP7. Taking due note of the proposals made in the seven-point plan regarding the Shebaa farms area,</em><br /> <br />Israel does not claim that the Chebaa farms area is Israel territory it is therefore unnecessary to write "territory can no longer be obtained by military conquest, and hence it does not legally belong to Israel." The UN determination to date has been that it is Syrian territory.<br /> <br /><em>PP10. Determining that the situation in Lebanon constitutes a threat to international peace and security, </em><br /><br />This wording is taken from Chapter VII of the Charter but in "binding" resolutions the phrase is usually combined with language referring explicitly to Chapter VII of the Charter or to specific Articles in that chapter of the Charter. The absence of such a reference and the stress on the agreement of the Lebanese and Israeli Governments would tend to point that the resolution is regarded as taken in accordance with Chapter VI hence requiring the agreement of Israel and Lebanon.<br /><br /><em>OP1. Calls for a full cessation of hostilities based upon, in particular, the immediate cessation by Hizbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by Israel of all offensive military operations;</em><br /><br />By its language this paragraph implicitly allows Israel to take defensive measures. No such allowance is made for Hezbollah since it was the aggressor. <br /><br /><em>OP2. Upon full cessation of hostilities, calls upon the government of Lebanon and UNIFIL as authorized by paragraph 11 to deploy their forces together throughout the South and calls upon the government of Israel, as that deployment begins, to withdraw all of its forces from Southern Lebanon in parallel;</em><br /> <br />The stipulation that the cease-fire did not come immediately into effect is to sanction Israel's continuous military action until the cease fire is in force. An aggressor should take into account that it cannot always determine at will when the defending state must cease its military activities.<br /><br /><em>OP3. Emphasizes the importance of the extension of the control of the government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory in accordance with the provisions of resolution 1559 (2004) and resolution 1680 (2006), and of the relevant provisions of the Taif Accords, for it to exercise its full sovereignty, so that there will be no weapons without the consent of the government of Lebanon and no authority other than that of the government of Lebanon;</em><br /> <br />This paragraph is important for the future as it emphasizes that it is the territorial state, Lebanon, that is responsible for attacks from its territory.<br /><br /><em>OP8. Calls for Israel and Lebanon to support a permanent ceasefire and a long-term solution based on the following principles and elements:<br /><br />- security arrangements to prevent the resumption of hostilities, including the establishment between the Blue Line and the Litani river of an area free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those of the government of Lebanon and of UNIFIL as authorized in paragraph 11, deployed in this area,<br />- no foreign forces in Lebanon without the consent of its government,<br />- no sales or supply of arms and related materiel to Lebanon except as authorized by its government,</em><br /><br />Perhaps the heart of the matter. The Security Council has outlawed the continued presence of armed Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. The resolution makes no reference to the continued existence of Hizbollah as a political-religious movement. It has further forbidden Iran and Syria, though not mentioned by name, from arming and training Hezbollah.<br /><br /><em>P18. Str
esses the importance of, and the need to achieve, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, based on all its relevant resolutions including its resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973; </em><br /><br />This paragraph, inserted, apparently, at Israel's request, would point to the fact that future negotiations with Syria, including the question of the Shebaa farms, should be dealt with in the context of peace negotiations.<br /><br /><strong>General comment</strong><br /><br />It is too early to know whether the UNSC resolution will be implemented on the ground. If Lebanon will implement the resolution it will not be because of any inherent awe of the UN. It will be because the State of Israel, which Hezbollah attacked from Lebanese territory, responded in force. Hezbollah dragged Lebanon into a military conflict with no possible military or political gain for Lebanon. Both Israeli and Lebanese civilians have been killed, Lebanese infrastructures have been badly hit and Israel has suffered some four thousand, Iranian and Syrian made rocket attacks.<br /> <br />A prominent Israeli "dove" commented recently that he remains a dove but is aware that if a dove doesn't protect itself it can end up on somebody's dinner plate.<br /> <br /><br /><em>Dr. Robbie Sabel teaches international law at the Hebrew University Faculty of Law in Jerusalem, Israel and has served for many years as a Legal Advisor to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/shane.html">Peter Shane</a> of Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, says that even in the wake of a federal court injunction, meaningful restrictions on the executive&#39;s domestic surveillance program require that both the judiciary and the legislative branches of government assert themselves against presidential overreaching...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petershane2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>f the United States is still celebrating its constitutional freedoms at age 250, we will owe a profound debt to federal judges who faced down the Bush Administration&#39;s exaggerated claims of national security power.  Judge Anna Diggs Taylor, who yesterday ordered a halt to the NSA&#39;s Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP), will be one of them.<br /><br /> What Judge Taylor&#39;s opinion shows most convincingly, however, is that Congress and the judiciary must act together if there are to be meaningful curbs on presidential overreaching.<br /><br /> Congress, for its part, enacted meaningful constraints on electronic surveillance for national security purposes when it adopted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.  &quot;In enacting FISA,&quot; as Judge Taylor wrote, &quot;Congress made numerous concessions to stated executive needs.&quot;  Overall, Congress succeeded in creating &quot;a secure framework by which the Executive branch may conduct legitimate electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence while meeting our national commitment to the Fourth Amendment.&quot;  It is a system that combines substantial flexibility for the executive with a genuine role for judicial oversight.<br /><br /> A problem for the nation, however, is that, if the President defies FISA, there is nothing Congress can do to protect its handiwork short of impeachment.  Unless courts become involved to enforce FISA&#39;s constraints, a rogue executive can ignore the law.<br /><br /> This is precisely why the executive has tried so hard to dodge judicial review through procedural hurdles.  The government hoped it could escape judicial review because potential plaintiffs could not get the information they need to mount a lawsuit.  For example, because of federal standing rules, plaintiffs can only bring federal cases when they can plausibly allege that the conduct they are challenging is causing them (or will imminently cause them) some concrete, individualized injury.  If no one knows whom the TSP is targeting for surveillance, it should be hard to identify particular individuals who can make that claim of injury.<br /><br /> The plaintiffs in <em>ACLU v. NSA</em>, however, include scholars and journalists who communicate regularly with individuals whom the government has identified as terror suspects or associated with terrorist organizations.  The government has already stated publicly that the TSP targets precisely such persons, so Judge Taylor found that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a specific connection between the TSP and themselves.  As to concrete injury, the plaintiffs&#39; argument was simple: Because of the TSP, their clients and contacts were refusing to speak to them by phone, thus making their professional lives impossible.  This sort of injury is at least as specific and concrete as others that the Supreme Court has recognized as the basis for standing.<br /><br /> In addition, the government sought to invoke the so-called state secrets privilege, which protects the government from having to divulge military or national security secrets to the detriment of the United States.  Judge Taylor observed, however, that the government, through the personal statements of President Bush, had already offered public affirmation of the facts that gave rise to the plaintiffs&#39; case.  That is, the government has already announced that the TSP exists, that it operates without judicial warrants, and that it targets communications where one party is outside the United States, even if the other party is within the U.S.<br /><br /> Here, however, Judge Taylor still confronted a potentially knotty problem.  The government might also be able to fend off judicial review on the ground that its defense of the lawsuit would require the divulgence of state secrets.  Judge Taylor agreed, in fact, that the state secrets privilege did prevent a challenge to the data-mining aspects of the TSP because, without access to state secrets, the plaintiffs (and the court) could not actually determine the nature of the data-mining at issue.<br /><br /> Judge Taylor nonetheless carefully determined that the state secrets privilege did not preclude the government&#39;s robust defense of the plaintiff&#39;s challenge to TSP wiretapping.  The government had already indicated the nature of its defense to that challenge, which is purely a matter of law.  The government argues that the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) in Afghanistan provides authority for the TSP and that, in any event, the President has inherent national security powers that entitle him to create such a program, irrespective of what any statute might say.  Because these defenses do not depend on secret facts, the court can proceed to decide the plaintiffs&#39; case.<br /><br /> But, of course, judicial involvement is not meaningful unless the law actually prescribes substantial constraints on presidential authority.  Congress did this with FISA, and Judge Taylor&#39;s opinion is strongest in insisting that the President lacks any authority under Article II of the Constitution to go beyond FISA in implementing foreign intelligence surveillance of U.S. persons.  (One does wish, however, that her treatment of this point had been less superficial and more detailed.)  Thus, Congress played a pivotal role in delimiting presidential power.<br /><br /> This implies a tricky legal question:  If Congress had not enacted FISA, would the Constitution itself &#8212; especially the First and Fourth Amendments &#8212; impose substantial constraints on the President?  Do we really need Congress to promulgate standards, as long as we have the Bill of Rights?<br /><br /> The answer, in reality, is that Congress is crucial.  To apply the First and Fourth Amendments directly to the President&#39;s actions, without any reference to a legislative standard, a court probably would need to explore facts that are protected from disclosure by the state secrets privilege.  Thus, even if the President were conducting unconstitutional wiretaps, a court might well be precluded from intervening just because the broader standards of the Constitution might be unenforceable without more detailed factual inquiry.<br /><br /> This is just what makes legislative proposals to weaken FISA so frightening.  If Congress explicitly gives presidents the option of conducting electronic surveillance without judicial oversight, the executive branch might  implement its program in an unconstitutional way.   Yet, without the specific details of how the program is run, the general constitutional limits &#8212; as opposed to the more specific and concrete FISA standards &#8212; might be impossible to police because of executive privilege.<br /><br /> Things now stand just where they should.  A lower court has stood up to the executive, relying on Congress&#39;s appropriate determination of the right balance between surveillance and oversight in the foreign intelligence context.  Now, it&#39;s up to Congress to keep its backbone intact, while higher courts review &#8212; and, one hopes, affirm &#8212; Judge Taylor&#39;s order.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Peter M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.ijdh.org/">Brian Concannon Jr.</a>, Director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, says that although the political prisoners lingering in Haiti&#39;s squalid jails are not the byproduct of the policies of incoming President Ren&amp;#233; Pr&amp;#233;val, they are certainly his problem, drawing criticism with each passing day not only from international human rights groups, but also from Haiti&#39;s urban poor...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/concannon.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>H</strong></font>aiti's new government issued a democracy dividend on August 14 with the acquittal and release of four political prisoners. Three months into constitutional President Ren&Atilde;&copy; Pr&Atilde;&copy;val's term, most of the high-profile members of Haiti's Lavalas movement jailed by the brutal Interim Government of Haiti over two years have been released. But if the cases demonstrate the democratic transition's promise, they also illustrate its pitfalls.<br /> <br />The high-profile cases were all easy calls from a legal standpoint. They were in some ways easy from a political standpoint as well, because President Pr&Atilde;&copy;val comes from the same Lavalas movement. Nevertheless, the new government took three months to release the prisoners, because of strong resistance within both the justice system and Haitian civil society. That resistance spells delays, and trouble, as Pr&Atilde;&copy;val's government tackles the much harder and more numerous cases of low-profile political prisoners.<br /><br /><em>The "Easy Cases"</em><br /><br />Activist and folksinger Annette Auguste (known as So Ann) was released on August 14 after more than 27 months in jail. Ms. Auguste was arrested illegally in May 2004, without a warrant and in the middle of the night, by U.S. Marines who had entered the country in the wake of Haiti's February 2004 coup d'etat. The Marines claimed she was threatening U.S. troops, but never presented any proof. The IGH claimed she was involved in sorcery and in violence during demonstrations at the State University (Universit&Atilde;&copy; de l'Etat Ha&Atilde;&macr;tien, or "UEH") in December 2003. But after investigating for two years, all the while refusing motions for pre-trial release, the IGH was not able to present a single witness or item of proof that Ms. Auguste had anything to do with the UEH violence. In the meantime, justice advocates in Haiti regularly protested the unjust detention, and human rights groups like Amnesty International campaigned abroad for her release or trial.<br /><br />Last March, the Leny Fredd'Herck, the chief prosecutor in Port-au-Prince's trial court, conceded that there was "no evidence, no indication and no presumption of any involvement" by Ms. Auguste in the UEH incidents, and recommended dropping the charges. But a judge allied with the IGH sent the case to trial anyway, claiming that Ms. Auguste's admission that she regularly organized demonstrations for Lavalas was sufficient grounds to find her responsible for the UEH violence, which allegedly involved some Lavalas partisans. The defendants appealed, and at the appeals court another prosecutor advocated sending the case to trial, without citing any evidence. The Appeals Court agreed with the latter recommendation, without explaining why, and on August 14, the case went to trial. At trial, no evidence was presented against Ms. Auguste or any of her five co-defendants, not a single witness appeared against them. A third prosecutor, noting the obvious, asked the judge to acquit all, which he did.<br /><br />Former Prime Minister Yvon Neptune was provisionally released on July 27 after twenty-five months in prison, most of it on a limited hunger strike. He turned himself in to police twice: the first time in June 2004, after hearing about a warrant for his arrest on the radio, the second time in February 2005, after he was forced from the prison at gunpoint during a prison break. Mr. Neptune was so determined to clear his name through the justice system that in late 2004 he refused a government offer to fly him out of the country for medical treatment, fearing he would not be allowed back into the country (and prison) following the treatment.<br /><br />Haiti's Constitution guarantees all prisoners an initial hearing within 48 hours of arrest, but Mr. Neptune did not get his for a year. He was formally charged 15 months after the arrest, in September 2005. The UN human rights mission in Haiti quickly called the charging document unconstitutional on its face. His codefendants appealed, and although they were entitled to a hearing and decision within a few weeks, the appeals court declined to hear the case for seven months.  The court finally held a hearing in May, where the prosecutor recommended dropping all charges against Mr. Neptune, citing procedural irregularities and an absence of proof. But the court has still not yet issued a decision, 11 months after the appeal.<br /><br />In the meantime, calls for Mr. Neptune's release came from UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, human rights groups throughout the world, and even from the United States, the IGH's principal international patron. The IGH managed to deflect the protests, claiming deference to the judicial system. Haiti's elected government, installed last June 6, found these calls, and the even louder calls coming from its own grassroots supporters, harder to resist. In late July, the Minister of Justice asked the prosecutor to request the appeals court to provisionally release Mr. Neptune on humanitarian grounds, to seek medical treatment. The court granted this request, and Mr. Neptune was transferred to a hospital run by UN peacekeepers.<br /><br /><em>Unfinished Transition</em><br /><br />In most contexts, the pre-trial release of a prisoner who had twice turned himself in and once refused to leave the country, or the acquittal of a defendant against whom no evidence was presented, would be routine. But the Neptune and Auguste cases count as hard-won victories in today's Haiti. Although the legal merits of the decisions were uncontestable, a powerful constituency installed within the justice system and without by the IGH and its allies survived Haiti's democratic transition, and continues to resist the liberation of political prisoners.<br /><br />The most obvious resistance to freeing prisoners lies within the judiciary itself. The IGH won no power in this year's Presidential and Legislative elections, but it maintained power in the judicial branch by packing the courts with sympathetic judges throughout its two-year reign. In 2004 and 2005, the Minister of Justice illegally pushed out trial judges appointed by Haiti's democratic governments and replaced them with people willing to do the IGH's bidding. In December, 2005, in what has been dubbed "the Friday Night Massacre", the Prime Minister replaced half of the Supreme Court in one fell swoop, after the Court ruled against the IGH in a controversial case. Both the firings and the executive's unilateral naming of replacements were as unconstitutional in Haiti as they would have been in the United States. But the judges remain on the bench<br /><br />President Pr&Atilde;&copy;val has been reluctant to respond to complaints about the IGH's judges, declaring that he will not answer the IGH's interference with judicial independence with his own interference. But respect for the separation of powers does not require acceptance of the illegal status quo. To the contrary, the Constitution requires action, to ensure that current judges have been approved through its procedures. Supreme Court judges, for example, must be chosen by the President from a list of three candidates per seat proposed by the Senate. The judges named to the seats vacated by the Friday Night Massacre were simply appointed by the Prime
Minister, with no parliamentary consultation. Now that Haiti has a constitutional Senate and a constitutional President, it should have constitutionally-appointed judges.<br /><br />There is also a constituency within Haitian civil society for keeping the political prisoners in jail. Some student groups, including the Haitian Federation of University Students (FEUH) had been active in the campaign that led to the February 2004 coup d'etat, and had filed complaints in the case against Annette Auguste and her co-defendants. But when the judge investigating the accusations summoned the students to testify, they refused. They also failed to appear at trial on August 14.  But three days after the acquittal, FEUH members organized a well-attended press conference to protest the decision. <br /><br />Another organization, the R&Atilde;&copy;seau National de Defense des Droits Humains, (RNDDH) is playing a similar role in Mr. Neptune's prosecution. RNDDH used to be known as NCHR-Haiti, and developed a good reputation for human rights work during Haiti's 1991-1994 de facto dictatorship. But the organization became increasingly politicized, and in the wake of the 2004 coup d'etat it cooperated with the IGH in persecuting Lavalas activists. The persecution became so flagrant that NCHR-Haiti's former parent organization, New York-based NCHR, publicly repudiated the Haitian group and asked it to change its name. RNDDH changed its name, but maintained its dogged pursuit of Mr. Neptune and other Lavalas members. The organization filed a suit on behalf of a group of people claiming to be victims of a massacre a few days before the coup, with the help of a substantial grant from the Canadian government. RNDDH's legal team tenaciously opposed, in court and in the press, the prosecutor's recommendation to drop the case, and even the request for humanitarian release.<br /><br /><em>Political Obstacles</em><br /><br />Beyond this political polarization, Haiti is now afflicted with an increase in violent common crime. The crime wave has many causes, including demographics, poverty, urbanization and the IGH's diversion of police energy to persecution of political dissidents. But its effect is public outrage, especially among middle-class Haitians, and urgent calls for the government to re-establish security.<br /><br />Pressure to get tough on crime, combined with the resistance to freeing the political prisoners, will make tackling the remaining political prisoner cases extremely difficult for Haiti's government. Hundreds of people, mostly young men from the poor neighborhoods that support Lavalas, sit in Haiti's jails with no justification for their detention. Under the IGH, police routinely swept though neighborhoods, arresting young men by the dozens. The police, and even UN Peacekeepers, routinely made warrantless arrests based on uncorroborated tips from informers. <br /><br /><em>The Hard Cases</em><br /><br />Some of these prisoners were arrested because they were suspected Lavalas activists, others because they were suspected criminals. The problem for the low-profile political prisoners is that it is not easy to tell the illegally-held suspected dissidents from the illegally-held suspected common criminals. Most of the low-profile political prisoners were involved in politics at the neighborhood level, where organizing is informal. They may not have an official position or title that clearly establishes their political role, so it is harder to establish a political motive for their arrest. <br /><br />Haiti's Constitution and international law do not distinguish among types of illegally-held prisoners. Instead, they require that all prisoners who are not detained for a legally adequate reason be released immediately. But a general, large-scale release would be politically difficult for the government. It would inevitably put some criminals on the street, adding to the reality of the crime problem, but more important, providing government critics an opportunity to blame any crime committed over the next few months on the releases.<br /><br />The government could sharply reduce the number of political prisoners by installing a fast-track procedure for prosecutors to review cases of alleged political persecution and recommend dismissals where appropriate. In Haiti's notoriously slow and corrupt justice system, expedited procedures would require the Ministry of Justice to lean hard on its prosecutors, but the Ministry would be leaning with popular support. Grassroots human rights organizations recently delivered a tool to help identify and prioritize political prisoner cases: on August 24, a coalition of groups presented officials with a list of political prisoners. The human rights organizations' conclusions will need to be confirmed through an independent judicial process, but the list is certainly a good place to start, and will provide a yardstick for measuring the progress of releases. <br /><br /><em>Conclusion</em><br /><br />Political prisoners are not President Pr&Atilde;&copy;val's fault, but they are very much his problem. Every day they spend in Haiti's squalid prisons exposes his government to more criticism, from international human rights groups, but also from Haiti's urban poor, who are the strongest constituency for the both the political prisoners, and numerically, for the new government. They understand the difficulties of the justice system, and will be patient, but only as long as they believe that the system is moving in the right direction.  <br /><br />The release of the prominent political prisoners in July and August provided some proof that the new government was moving in the right direction. But the goodwill they generated will not last forever. President Pr&Atilde;&copy;val and his government must show more proof, by moving quickly to submit illegally-appointed judges to a constitutional approval process and by instructing prosecutors to prioritize the files where there is a credible claim that the defendant was arrested for his political activities. <br /><br /><br /><em>Ronald St. Jean of the Groupe de Defense Des Droits des Prisonniers Politiques in front of the National Penitentiary, with a list of political prisoners.</em><br /><br /><img src="/forumy/haitilist.jpg" /><br /><p><br /><br /><em>Members of the Kolektif Fanmi Prizonye Politik  demonstrate outside the Penitentiary</em><br /><br /><img src="/forumy/haitidemonstrate.jpg" /><br /><p><br /><br /><em>Political Prisoners Annette Auguste and Paul Raymond In Court</em><br /><br /><img src="/forumy/haitiprisoners.jpg" /><br /> <br /><br /><em>Human rights lawyer Brian Concannon Jr. directs the Institute for Justice &amp; Democracy in Haiti, <a href="http://www.ijdh.org">www.ijdh.org</a></em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/concannon.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='90' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Mark Brown, holder of the Newton D. Baker/Baker and Hostetler Chair at Capital University School of Law, says that the Fifth Circuit ruling blocking Texas Republicans - at the instance of Texas Democrats - from declaring Tom DeLay ineligible to run again for his Texas congressional seat sets a bad precedent for the American electoral system by moving disputes between the major political parties from the hustings to the courts...<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/mbrown.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Fifth Circuit last week (<em>Texas Democratic Party v. Benkiser</em>, -- F.3d &#8212; (5th Cir., Aug. 3, 2006)) sustained a federal District Court ruling that prevented Texas Republicans from declaring Tom DeLay ineligible to run again for his seat in the United States House of Representatives.  DeLay resigned his post as House Majority Leader following his indictment by a Texas grand jury last fall.  Faced with sagging poll numbers and mounting legal fees, DeLay decided to resign from the House in April. Because he won the Republican primary in March, however, Texas law prevented Republicans from replacing DeLay on the ballot.  So long as DeLay remained alive and eligible, he could not be replaced.  <br /><br />Although he is a good Republican soldier, DeLay was not prepared to die for his party.  But he was willing to do the next best thing; he moved to Virginia.  Because the United States Constitution (Article I, &Acirc;&#167; 2) requires that House members be "Inhabitants" of the states from which they are elected, a Virginian can not represent Texas.  <br /><br />Following DeLay's "move," the Republican Party Chair, Tina Benkiser, duly announced that DeLay was no longer eligible and could be replaced.  (Benkiser was delegated this authority by Texas law, as was the Democratic Party Chair, and thus was clearly a "state actor" for constitutional purposes.)  The Texas Democratic Party then sued Benkiser in state court claiming that Benkiser violated Texas law and the Article I, &Acirc;&#167; 2.  Arguing that one need only be a Texas resident when elected, Democrats claimed that Benkiser's "anticipatory" finding was unconstitutional.  The end result, they argued, was that DeLay could not be replaced. <br /><br />Benkiser removed the case to federal court, where Judge Sparks (a Bush I appointment) found both a properly pleaded federal question and standing on behalf of the Democratic Party to contest DeLay's eligibility.  Turning to the merits, Judge Sparks concluded that Article I prevented the Republican Party Chair from declaring DeLay to be ineligible before the election.  After all, DeLay might move back to Texas on election day, which is all that Article I demands.  <br /><br />A bi-partisan panel of the Fifth Circuit unanimously affirmed.  The Democratic Party had standing, it reasoned, because Democrats would be forced to expend more money on a new campaign if DeLay were replaced.  Further, the Democratic Party's "election prospects" might suffer if substitution were allowed.  Both injuries could be directly traced to DeLay's eligibility.  <br /><br /> <em>Benkiser</em> is wrong for four reasons, the first three of which are peculiar to DeLay's case, and the last of which has broader ramifications.  First, Article I clearly does not prohibit the Texas Republican Party from removing and replacing DeLay.  If, for example, Texas law authorized the replacement of any candidate who willingly chose to withdraw, there would be no constitutional problem.  Benkiser's decision to remove DeLay had a federal flavor only because of its justification&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;ineligibility.  Defensive justifications, however, are rarely sufficient to support federal jurisdiction.  Although the Republicans did not contest it&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;indeed, they had removed the case&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the federal District Court had no business getting involved in the controversy.<br /><br /> Second, even assuming federal jurisdiction, the Texas Democratic Party's economic and political injuries were not directly caused by DeLay's eligibility; rather, they flowed from his likely replacement.  The Democratic Party certainly had standing to complain about the injustice of allowing a replacement, but this was a state-law concern.   Any link between Democratic injuries and a federal constitutional violation was highly attenuated.  Even assuming its injuries could be fairly traced to a violation of Article I, moreover, third-party standing precedents counsel caution in a case where a third-party's interest in a constitutional wrong contradicts that of the immediate victim.  As explained below, the Qualifications Clause was designed to protect candidates, not their competitors.  It would seem that if anyone is allowed to press a federal complaint based on the Qualifications Clause, it should be the candidate who is deemed ineligible&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;not an adversary who seeks only to shoot an easier pigeon.<br /> <br /> Third, the federal Constitution does not prohibit a state from removing a congressional candidate who admits he does not meet Article I's age, residence and citizenship requirements.  Article I was designed to prevent Congress from adding qualifications to defeat the election of rabble-rousers like John Wilkes, who in 1763 had been expelled from Parliament for criticizing England's peace treaty with France.  Madison wisely thought it "improper &amp; dangerous" to allow Congress such a broad power.  The better course, Madison concluded, was to fix congressional qualifications to insure that dissidents have a voice in the political arena&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;at least if they choose to run.  Willingness, as far as Article I is concerned, is implicit.  <br /><br /> Last, but most important, the DeLay holding is a poor precedent for America's electoral system.  Its moral is that if you don't like your opponent, sue to have him removed.  Of course, the nation's major parties rarely battle ballot access between themselves.  (DeLay's case is truly strange in this regard.)   But they do regularly fight minor parties and independent candidates over access.  Common is the case where a major-party bullies an independent off the ballot to harvest his votes.  Ralph Nader's experience during the 2004 presidential election is perhaps the best-known example.<br /> <br />If America is truly interested in open, competitive ballots, the major parties cannot be allowed to wage this kind vigilante political justice.  They should not be allowed to wage it against each other, and they cannot be trusted to wage it against minor parties and independent candidates.  Matters of constitutional eligibility and local qualifications cannot be trusted to the forces of judicial combat.  One's adversary should not be allowed to administratively and/or judicially challenge what amount to a licensing decision.<br /><br />Do not get me wrong.  I am not arguing that courts should never get involved.  I do not trust the partisan bureaucrats who license our candidates either.  But the impetus to turn to court must fall to the unlicensed candidate, not the competitor. <br /> <br />Why deny competitors standing in the context of ballot access?  In short, affording judicial access to competitors breeds abuse.  In any technical setting requiring the satisfaction of minute standards, a well-funded and highly motivated challenger will almost always be able to uncover errors and discrepancies.  Imagine if General Motors and Ford were allowed to contest (on an expedited basis) each and every automotive licensing decision.  How many Subaru owners would there be on America's highways?   <br /><br />Because there is no federal constitutional right to keep another candidate or party off the ballot, and no constitutional right to intervene in administrative licensing proceedings, there is no federal obstacle to abolishing m
ajor-party participation in the ballot preparation process.  One party simply has no constitutional stake in whether another party gains access to the ballot.  Their challenges need not and should not be heard. <br /> <br /> In the end, <em>Benkiser</em> proves that strange cases make strained law.  Tom DeLay is an unsavory political player who manipulated Texas law to his party's advantage.  But that does not mean that constitutional principles should be abandoned.  If it does, then the game of partisan politics has no rules.  And if that is true, Democrats cannot complain about Richard Nixon and George W. Bush.<br /><br /><br /><em>Mark R.

		<title>Politics in Pennsylvania: Stifling Ralph Nader and Open Ballots</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Mark Brown, holder of the Newton D. Baker/Baker and Hostetler Chair at Capital University School of Law, says that forcing unsuccessful 2004 presidential candidate Ralph Nader to pay after-the-fact for a ballot contest instigated against him in Pennsylvania when his campaign was found to have committed no wrongdoing is constitutionally dubious...<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/mbrown.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Pennsylvania Supreme Court yesterday affirmed a Commonwealth Court order directing Ralph Nader to pay more than $80,000 to Democratic challengers who successfully removed his name from the ballot during the 2004 presidential election.  The court's rationale was that "massive" fraud infected Nader's submission of 52,000 voters' signatures&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;more than twice the number needed to access the ballot.  Nader could thus equitably be required to pay for the transcripts and writing experts needed to prove the Democrats' case.<br /><br />This was not the first Commonwealth Court order rebuking Nader's run for the White House, nor was fraud the only justification for keeping him off the ballot.  The Commonwealth Court's initial rationale for removing Nader from the ballot was his endorsement by the Reform Party of Florida.  Given this endorsement, the court reasoned, Nader could not credibly claim to be an independent in Pennsylvania.  The court next ruled that Nader's running mate, Peter Miguel Camejo, who was registered with the Green Party of California, knowingly filed a false affidavit claiming to be an independent in Pennsylvania.<br />  <br />The three-judge Commonwealth Court's reasons were rejected by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.  Only after its first failed attempt at removing Nader did the Commonwealth Court find "massive fraud."  And in drawing this conclusion, the Commonwealth Court engaged in a breakneck review of Nader's 52,000 signatures.  Eleven judges were employed simultaneously across the state, forcing Nader's team to foreclose participation in some locations.  The ultimate finding by President Judge Colins was that "there were thousands of names that were created at random and then randomly assigned either existent or non-existent addresses by the circulators."  <br /><br />President Judge Colin's claim that "thousands" of signatures were forged appears to be a gross exaggeration.  Justice Saylor, the only member of Pennsylvania's high court to address the merits, found that the Nader campaign, contrary to the harsh language employed by President Judge Colins, had not engaged in "massive" fraud:  "[a] review of the tables and exhibits attached to the order &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; suggest[s] that the problem was of a more limited scale (for example, 687 signatures out of 51,273 reviewed--or approximately 1.3% of the signatures--were rejected on the basis of having been forged)."<br /><br />Moreover, 588 of these forged signatures (85% of the total) were uncovered by President Judge Colins.  The other ten judges found fewer than 100 forged signatures.  Granted, there were an additional 1,087 "duplicate" signatures reported, but even including these as "forged" or "fraudulent" raises the total to fewer than 2,000, about 4% of Nader's total submission.<br /> <br />President Judge Colin's conclusion notwithstanding, a thorough review of the record reveals that simple technicalities were responsible for the rejection of most signatures.  Including information (like dates and addresses) "written in [the] hand of another," was a common reason for striking signatures.  Almost 8,000 signatures were cancelled for this reason.   Almost 9,000 signatures were thrown out because otherwise qualified electors&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;who could vote&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;were not registered on the day they signed Nader's petition.  More than 6,000 signatures were invalidated because the addresses provided did not precisely match those on the voting roles.  Nearly 2,000 signatures were ruled invalid because information was missing.  This is hardly the stuff of massive fraud, as alleged by President Judge Colins.<br /><br />The eleven Commonwealth Court judges responsible for removing Nader, moreover, invalidated signatures at significantly different rates.  Judge Mirarchi invalidated almost 93% of the 3,708 signatures he reviewed.  President Judge Colins invalidated close to 70% of the 10,794 signatures he reviewed.  Judge Smith-Ribner struck 73% of the 12,818 signatures she reviewed.  Outside these three judges&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;who were all on the original panel that removed Nader&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the highest invalidation rate of any judge was just over 50%.  One of these eight judges even found that 79% of the signatures Nader submitted were valid.  In the end, Judges  Colins, Mirarchi and Smith-Ribner found more "forgery" than the other eight judges combined.  Even though they reviewed only half the signatures, they invalidated significantly more (over 20,000) signatures than the other eight judges put together (just over 12,000).<br />  <br /> Even assuming fraud among some supporters, it must be remembered that the Nader campaign itself was found guilty of no wrongdoing.  Political sabotage likely played a large part in Nader's unfolding drama.  (Who do you think signed names like "Fred Flintstone" and "Mickey Mouse"?)  But even if it did not, I am aware of no precedent or practice holding major-party candidates strictly responsible for the wrongs of voters.  In Ohio, for example, Sherrod Brown unconstitutionally signed on to John Kerry's slate of electors.  Kerry was not removed from the ballot or forced to pay a fine.   Do you really think George Bush could hold office if he was held strictly accountable for the wrongs of Republican voters in Florida?  Let's face it, election fraud is a constant.  Some people vote outside their districts, some vote more than once, some cast votes for other voters.  But no major-party candidate to my knowledge has been forced off the ballot or out of office for this reason.  <br /><br />Should states be allowed to use incentives and deterrents to manage their ballots?  Sure.  But within the bounds of constitutional reason.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several occasions that states cannot assess non-trivial ballot fees.  Forcing a candidate to pay for signature validation clearly runs afoul of this precedent.  Forcing an unsuccessful candidate to pay after-the-fact is no-more constitutional.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Mark R. Brown is the Newton D.

The pinpoint accuracy of the Israeli missiles is not disputed.<br /><br /> As in the missile attack five days earlier on the United Nations Interim Peacekeeping Force in southern Lebanon, the government of Israel again stated that the attack was not deliberate and that it would be investigated.  Unfortunately Israel's disclaimers, no matter how sincere, have no truth-value.  They are like a judge entering a plea of "not guilty" on behalf of a silent criminal defendant.  Lawyers for Israel's government undoubtedly advised the officials that unless they said affirmatively that the attacks were not deliberate, they could severely impair their defense to a later war-crimes prosecution.<br /><br /> It is worth pausing a moment to falsify the oft-stated claim that Israel's leaders need not worry about war crimes because there is no international court that has the jurisdiction to prosecute them.  First, a strong argument can be made that the International Criminal Court itself has jurisdiction over the attack on the U.N. peacekeepers even though neither Israel nor Lebanon are parties to the Court.  For although the Statute of the Court says nothing about crimes committed against the United Nations or its personnel, the International Court of Justice (an organ of the United Nations) issued an advisory opinion on April 11, 1949 known as the "Reparation for Injuries" case.  The ICJ recognized an "international personality" in the United Nations.  If one were to make a constructivist interpretation of the ICC's statute (an endeavor perhaps less familiar to Continental than common-law attorneys), the ICC might well find that it has jurisdiction over states that attack UN personnel.  Second, European nations are beginning to assert jurisdiction over war crimes committed abroad even if their own citizens are not involved.  Last year a former Israeli military chief cancelled his trip to London upon being warned that he could be prosecuted for war crimes that he had allegedly committed in Gaza.  The concept of "universal jurisdiction" for war crimes and crimes against humanity is catching on in country after country.  Third, although the Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister are immune from war-crimes prosecution anywhere while they are in office (under a recent ruling by the ICJ), they lose their immunity when their term of office expires.  Fourth, they would have no immunity at all from prosecution in Israel.  This is extremely unlikely, of course, but the country could later turn against them the way that Chile has decided to prosecute its former ruler Augusto Pinochet for crimes against humanity committed during his dictatorship. <br /><br /> In my view, the Israeli government did not receive creative legal advice following the strike upon the UN peacekeepers.  It should have immediately arrested the crew of the F-16 that fired the missile and released their detention photographs to the public.  It should have said that the crew members were being interrogated, and that court-martial charges against them were possible.  Instead, Israel suffered major public-relations damage throughout the world by simply saying that the incident would be investigated.  If Israel had acted forthrightly and arrested the crew members, the second missile attack in Qana might have been deterred.<br /><br /> Of course, it is possible that Israel did get such advice from its lawyers but felt itself politically hamstrung by the military.  The Israeli Air Force (IAF) is technically an arm of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) but, as is true of most countries, feels that it is in competition with the ground troops.  One can infer from recent events that the pilots of the IAF believe they can win the war all by themselves.  After taking out the obvious infrastructure targets, they apparently are beginning to drop bombs and missiles indiscriminately.  Their constant excuse is that the Hezbollah has insinuated itself among the civilians and hence it is impossible to bomb Hezbollah targets while avoiding collateral damage.  Yet it may also be true that the IAF believes that if they reduce the entire country to rubble, all the Hezbollah terrorists will be buried along with the rest of the Lebanese population: thus guaranteeing security for Israel.<br /><br /> It's possible that if the civilian government of Olmert-Peretz does not have enough parliamentary clout to constrain the conduct of the IAF pilots, at least it does have the power to curtail or stop their sorties over Lebanon.  It will be interesting to see if post-Qana Israel shifts its emphasis to ground forces and away from air strikes.  In my <a href="/forumy/2006/07/war-crimes-and-mideast-conflict.php">JURIST editorial last week</a>, I argued that the ineffectiveness of air strikes against the Hezbollah bunkers coupled with the increasing likelihood of war crimes should push Israel toward replacing its aerial bombardment with a massive ground campaign.<br /><br /> In any event, the Security Council will meet in the next few days to consider a resolution calling for a cease-fire and establishing a United Nations army to patrol the Lebanon-Israel borders.  In the first week of the war (July 13-20) a UN peacekeeping force was envisaged along the model of the usual consensual force: that is, both Lebanon and Israel would have to approve of the force.  My guess is that the world has rapidly become exasperated with Israeli attacks on the UN mission and on the civilian target in Qana.  There's a good chance that the UN will act if necessary in the teeth of complaints or protests from Lebanon or Israel.  This means that Article 39 of the Charter will be invoked on the basis that there has been a breach of the peace in the Middle East conflict.  Such a finding would then allow the Security Council to invoke its power to send in a United Nations army (made up from national military contributions).  Inasmuch as Israel and Lebanon would have no choice in the matter, they might want to save face by consenting to the U.N. resolution.  However, Israel continues to insist that no ceasefire is possible until Hezbollah is disarmed. <br /> <br /> A peacekeeping force set up by the Security Council under its Chapter 7 powers would only be the second such force in UN history.  The first, during the Gulf War, was correctly referred to as a "Chapter 6&Acirc;&frac12;" force, inasmuch as it was run by the contributing military powers (mainly the United States) and not by the Secretary-General (as would be the case with a pure Chapter 7 force).  It will be interesting to see whether the Chapter 6&Acirc;&frac12; model is used this time.  If the bulk of the UN army is contributed by Turkey (as is currently rumored), the major powers might be unwilling to let Turkey call the shots.  Chapter 6&Acirc;&frac34;, anyone?<br /><br />The big question is what Hezbollah will do.  The representatives of Hezbollah who are part of the Lebanese government have
 expressed their approval of a cease-fire and a U.N. peacekeeping force so long as there are a few minor concessions.  But those governmental representatives might not be speaking for Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader.<br /><br />While it is possible that Nasrallah might "quit while we're even," thus enhancing Hezbollah's burgeoning reputation as the first Arab entity ever to stand up to Israel's vaunted IDF, I think there is a more important consideration that is rarely mentioned.  Lebanon has a dozen good ports on the Mediterranean that could receive shipments of rockets, missiles, and launchers from countries such as Iran, Russia, and Syria, as well as from private "merchants of death" who operate on a global scale.  Even submarines could be used to transport these weapons into Lebanon.  If the Security Council resolution provides for a peacekeeping blockade of these ports, or if it leaves open to Israel the policing by air and navy of Lebanon's ports, then I doubt that Nasrallah would agree to a cease-fire.  On the other hand, if access to Lebanon by sea is not realistically interdicted by the UN resolution, then Israel may break with the UN.  The Middle East crisis is more dire than is generally appreciated.<br /> <br /><br /><em>Anthony D.Amato is Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University, where he teaches international law and human rights.

		<title>Legal challenges facing Cambodia&#039;s garment industry</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong>Andrew Wood</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh School of Law 2L, in Cambodia]: &quot;Cambodia&#39;s role in the Textile and Garment (T&amp;G) industry has only recently developed into the nation&#39;s largest export industry.  With Cambodia&#39;s first garment factories opened in 1994, the industry is relatively young, especially when compared to its neighbors such as China.  Over 70% of Cambodia&#39;s textiles are exported to the United States, thereby reflecting the importance of the relationship between the USA and Cambodia.  The T&amp;G industry in Cambodia grew rapidly under the US-Cambodia Trade Agreement on Textile and Apparel (TATA) from 1999-2005, and, for the first time, this experimental agreement linked the improvement of trade to labor rights.  Its relative success has seen Cambodia rise to an international spotlight; the nation can, in some ways, be perceived as a showcase to reflect the unique relationship between export-oriented manufacturing and poverty reduction (though it is arguable that with the minimum wage set at $45 USD per month, poverty reduction is not significantly impacted).<br /><br />Cambodia has one of the highest percentages worldwide of trade union members in the T&amp;G industry (approx. 60%).  The number of workers employed in the Garment sector in Cambodia has grown from next to nothing in the mid-1990s to around 293,600 in April, 2006.  In some regards, the Cambodian situation appears ideal in theory, attracting &quot;reputation conscious&quot; brands; the current trend toward pursuing and advertising &quot;fair trade&quot; products is pervasive in many American businesses, and Cambodia&#39;s relatively good reputation is certainly one of its main advantages.<br /><br />However, the Cambodian T&amp;G industry is in a vulnerable state of existence and many problems inevitably persist.  While Cambodia has fared surprisingly well since the Multi-Fibre Agreement and Quota Era ended on 31 December 2004, additional major challenges loom large around the corner.  It remains to be seen how the end of quota restrictions on China in 2008 and Vietnam&#39;s upcoming ascension into the WTO will affect the industry in Cambodia.  The added competition of nations like China and Vietnam, combined with Cambodia&#39;s internal problems, increases the likelihood of the garment industry shifting from Cambodia to more economically poised nations.  Further, the increase of violent incidents and criminal punishments against union activists may potentially tarnish Cambodia&#39;s relatively good reputation as an ethical producer.  Cambodia cannot directly control the rise of international competitors; however, the realities of the situation make it crucial for Cambodia to adapt and address problems within the industry. <br /><br />Many underlying problems put the T&amp;G industry in Cambodia at risk, including corruption, the arrests, threats, abuse, and murder of union activists, and Cambodia&#39;s relatively high electric and petroleum costs &#8212; to name a few.  Lawyers at the Community Legal Education Center of Cambodia (CLEC) are working to address some of these issues in a number of ways: they conduct training sessions to educate union workers and village leaders about aspects of labor law, such as the benefits of achieving collective bargaining agreements; they work with other local organizations to further the development of the garment industry; and they conduct studies for International organizations such as the ILO.  They also try to advocate workers&#39; rights granted in Cambodia&#39;s labor law.  Part of my position was to conduct a study highlighting instances in which union leaders have been arrested in the course of fighting for workers&#39; rights.  I recently accompanied two CLEC lawyers to an Oxfam-led workshop held in Phnom Penh that shed light on the activity regarding this issue.  About 30 representatives from various International NGOs, local NGOs, labor unions, and private law firms were in attendance, the majority of whom identified corruption as the number one problem threatening to frustrate relationships with foreign investors.  It was encouraging to see these groups working together to discuss how best to approach their nation&#39;s challenges, and interesting to see the many facets of their work.  In addition to the work that local NGOs like CLEC are doing, Cambodian union leaders are currently negotiating with employers&#39; associations to decide on a new minimum wage, local lawyers are defending union leaders facing charges resulting from labor disputes, and international organizations are attempting to raise international awareness to the industry&#39;s situation. <br /><br />When I went to Cambodia to work for the summer, I had the Khmer Rouge and the upcoming tribunal in mind; fresh was the brutal history of the country about which I had personally studied, visited, and come to love.  However, by working in the nation&#39;s capital, and existing within a community working to develop the country, I witnessed many effects of the Khmer Rouge legacy.  In some ways, the Khmer Rouge did, in fact, achieve its goal of creating their &quot;year zero&quot;; today, Cambodia is struggling to catch up to the rest of the world &#8212; to turn its calendar forward to 2006.  In many ways, the country has had to start over, and currently remains in a rebuilding phase on a variety of social and economic levels.  The garment industry has the potential to assist in Cambodia&#39;s development, yet it remains to be seen what the future will bring.  It is daunting to consider all the factors that will determine the industry&#39;s fate, but it is encouraging to witness some of the Cambodian leaders&#39; dedication to their country&#39;s improvement.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm"><strong>Ben Davis</strong></a> [University of Toledo College of Law]: &quot;The rejection today by the Senate Armed Services Committee of the President&#39;s draft bill on detainees and the voting out of a draft supported by Senators Warner, McCain and Graham and Democrats, together with the opposition expressed by former Secretary of State Colin Powell, appear to be progress towards a bill that complies with international law.  However, as has been noted by Marty Lederman and others at Balkinization, even the new version eliminates habeas and defines detainee treatment based on a standard that can be (and thus would) undermine Common Article 3 standards.<br /><br />Rather than therefore be relieved at the rejection of the President&#39;s draft, I would suggest that what we are seeing is a classic gambit of &quot;good cop&quot; and &quot;bad cop.&quot;  President Bush&#39;s draft is the draft of the &quot;bad cop&quot; causing great ire by those concerned about preserving the Geneva Conventions.  The Warner-McCain-Graham third draft is considered &quot;good cop&quot; hoping to mollify those concerned about not weakening the Geneva Conventions out of concern for American troops.  I think that notwithstanding his public face &#8212; given the negotiations this past weekend &#8212; the President can live with both or (agreeing with Marty Lederman) would intend to put in place a Commander-in-Chief override through a signing statement in any event.  One must keep in mind that the House version more closely resembles the President&#39;s version so the result of a conference on this (and who represents each side of Congress in such conference) are many issue that are uncertain.<br /><br />So I am worried that the concerns that the top Military JAG Officers expressed in July will be passed aside in either version.  The recent pressure placed on them to recant their July 2006 testimony is proof of the problematic nature of what is being put forward by the Executive and raises my fears of what even the Warner-McCain-Graham proposal may lead to.<br /><br />May we borrow from Nancy Reagan of an earlier generation and ask Congress to &quot;just say no&quot; to the President and the Warner-McCain-Graham bills?  Congress should leave this until after the election for the next Congress that will have to live with these laws for the next two years and beyond.  Protecting our forward deployed persons is the most important consideration and I fear neither of these bills created in this pre-election hothouse atmosphere does that well enough.  The good is the enemy of the best in this case.&quot;<br />

Kelly</strong></a> [Creighton University School of Law]: &quot;President Bush recently acknowledged the existence of the long-suspected C.I.A. detention facilities that the U.S. has used to interrogate and possibly torture high-value foreign members of al Qaeda captured abroad.  This acknowledgement, even as the facilities are being shut down in the wake of the Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>, has renewed efforts by the European Parliament to find out exactly which European countries were involved in the system in direct violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.  So far, they&#39;ve drawn up a list of 14 states, three of whom are candidates to join the European Union:  Romania, Macedonia, and Turkey.  These countries, especially Romania and Turkey, have undertaken massive economic, political and legal reforms to get their respective societies in shape to be considered E.U. states (like eradicating banking corruption, abstaining from the death penalty, ensuring religious freedoms, and increasing protection for the rights of women).  Participation in President Bush&#39;s secret C.I.A. detention and interrogation program will significantly mar those laudable records.  While other E.U. countries, like Germany and Poland, are suspected to have been participants as well, they are safely in the club.  Unanimous consent from the 25 E.U. states is required for a country to join.  It only takes an upset Denmark or Sweden to kill the candidacy of any applicant.  So Romania, Macedonia and Turkey must rethink how far they are willing to follow George W. Bush on his misguided quest.  Is it worth endangering their E.U. candidacies?  To be sure, the War on Terror must be fought; but it needn&#39;t be fought at the expense of perpetrating human rights violations - that makes us in the West just as bad as the jihadists.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm"><strong>Ben Davis</strong></a> [University of Toledo College of Law]: &quot;The President in his televised press conference today framed the discussion of the draft bill on Military Commissions in terms of whether Congress was going to permit &quot;the Program&quot; to go forward.  He made it clear that Americans working in the intelligence community would not violate the law.  He did not want international courts defining how America should protect himself.  He explained how American law defines the United States international obligations.<br /><br />The problem with this line of reasoning is that war crimes have already been committed by us in the Program. As the four top Military JAG officers testified in July 2006, those who authorized and used the various techniques of interrogation violated Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.  The specific period was in the post 9/11 up until Hamdan period &#8212; the period of the Program.  So Americans in the intelligence community (David Passarro being the only one convicted so far on this) have violated the law.  What the legislation is about is changing the law in a manner that the &quot;clarifications&quot; eliminate the war crimes.   Changing the law does not change the behavior and does not change the background treaty.  So the Program that was a war crime becomes a Program that is not a war crime &#8212; as a matter of United States domestic law.  The background behavior (the acts in the interrogation) would still be war crimes as a matter of international law but the President and those supporting the good cop and bad cop versions of the law (see Good Cop, Bad Cop and detainee treatment) are willing to run that risk as part of the Program.<br /><br />The President&#39;s concern about some international court judging how Americans protect themselves misses the point that it is far more likely that the United States Supreme Court would be making such a determination.  As part of that process, the Supreme Court would examine what other countries have done in applying the treaty language.  However, by changing the law the implicit hope is that Justice Kennedy will lean the other way and the behavior that is war crimes in the Program will pass muster.<br /><br />So it all comes down to whether each of us as Americans are willing to get with the program by getting with the Program.  Please understand that the war crimes have already been committed and this bill is basically blessing future war crimes.  We must think &#8212; will we be like the French during the Algerian War?  Will we be like the English in the suppression of the Mau Mau rebellion in Kenya?  Some of us will bet that it is not possible to protect ourselves without the Program.  Others will say that the only way to protect ourselves is without the Program.  What we should not do is try to be in denial about the fact that we have committed war crimes and thus are capable of committing war crimes.  It may be troubling, however, that that reality suggests we are not so exceptional.  Maybe it is time to show we are exceptional.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm"><strong>Ben Davis</strong></a> [University of Toledo College of Law]: &quot;Alberto Gonzales has said that one of the reasons the Administration departed from the Geneva Conventions in early 2002 was to provide more &quot;flexibility&quot; to the President.  This week, some of the ironies of the Military Commission Bills of the President and Senators McCain-Warner-Graham are (1) the rejection of the flexibility of the Geneva Conventions, (2) the proposal of definitions of specific offenses as war crimes to the presumed exclusion of others, and (3) the requirement of interpretation of this law to not take into account any foreign sources of law.<br /><br />Section 8 of the McCain-Warner-Graham bill, entitled Revision to War Crimes Offense Under Federal Criminal Code, proceeds to specify definitions of torture, cruel unusual or inhumane treatment or punishment, performing biological experiments, murder, mutilation or maiming, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, rape, sexual assault or abuse, and taking hostages.  It also makes foreign sources of law inapplicable to interpretation of these provisions.<br /><br />In contrast, the language of  Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions prohibits:<br /><br />&quot;(c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment;&quot;<br /><br />Section 8 is specific in an effort to give flexibility.  Common Article 3 is flexible but with another goal.  As is noted in the International Committee of the Red Cross Commentary to Common Article 3:<BLOCKQUOTE>At one stage of the discussions, additions were considered -- with particular reference to the biological &quot;experiments&quot; carried out on detained persons. The idea was rightly abandoned, since biological experiments are among the acts covered by (a). <strong>Besides, it is always dangerous to try to go into too much detail -- especially in this domain. However great the care taken in drawing up a list of all the various forms of infliction, it would never be possible to catch up with the imagination of future torturers who wished to satisfy their bestial instincts; and the more specific and complete a list tries to be, the more restrictive it becomes. The form of wording adopted is flexible, and at the same time precise. The same is true of item (c).</B> (my bolding).</BLOCKQUOTE>The effort of the drafters of the Military Commissions Bills is to create a rule under which state actors are permitted to imagine, authorize and use with impunity a pallet of techniques that are not prohibited.  There is no limit to what bestial instincts can imagine that might fall between the interstices of the specific offenses noted.  One should not assume they have a conscience to be shocked.  The effort of the drafters of Common Article 3 was to operate in the opposite manner, to create a rule of flexible protection of detained persons that has a chilling effect on overzealous coercive interrogators.  <br /><br />We should not allow Military Commission Bills to pass that reduce that flexible protection of persons who are detained because we are then left to trust the conscience of the interrogators - something history has shown and the drafters of the Geneva Conventions well understood was a poor bulwark against human depravity.  Let us not be forced to relearn again this painful history.  Whether it is the <a href="/hotline/2006/09/good-cop-bad-cop-on-detainee-treatment.php">McCain-Warner-Graham &quot;Good Cop&quot;(!) or the Administration &quot;Bad Cop&quot; version</a>, these versions shock the conscience and should be removed.&quot;<br />

		<title>Justice for 14,000? Apply international standards and change the Program...</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm"><strong>Ben Davis</strong></a> [University of Toledo College of Law]: &quot;Back in 1994 when the US ratified the Convention Against Torture and Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment (&quot;CAT&quot;) it included reservations, understanding, and declarations (&quot;RUD&#39;s) as regards the prohibitions against cruel, inhuman and degrading (&quot;CID&quot;) treatment.  Those RUD&#39;s interpreted CID to mean the US constitutional standard - the so called &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; standard.  <br /> <br />Introduction of the US domestic law standard for a Convention was questionable at the time as a violation of the object and purpose of the Convention and remains questionable.<br /> <br />Early in the war on terror the analysis of Executive lawyers was that since the Constitution did not apply outside the United States, this CID constitutional standard did not apply outside the United States - put another way, over the sea, free to do CID.  This proposition was refuted by those that participated in the negotiation and signature of the CAT, but this was the pitch.<br /> <br />Be that as it may, the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 closed the inexistent geographic loophole by stating the constitutional &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; standard applies worldwide - no freebee CID over the sea.<br /> <br />Now the President (&quot;bad cop&quot;) and McCain-Warner-Graham (&quot;good cop&quot;) Military Commission Bills to address <em>Hamdan</em> take the constitutional &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; standard and have that be the United States domestic law interpretation of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.  They also lay out specific offenses rather than leave the flexibility of Common Article 3&#39;s language.  <br /> <br />(The drafts actually do much more in terms of making definitions of lawful combatants that are inconsistent with other sections of the Geneva Conventions such as the definition of Prisoner of War for Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention.)<br /> <br />Like a legal daisy chain of laws, clearly very bright lawyers are working over the Geneva Conventions to pass a United States law to provide maximum &quot;flexibility&quot;  (there is that word again) for application of the shocks the conscience standard introduced in the CAT RUD in 1994.<br /> <br />Some say - &quot;If the standard is OK for the Detainee Treatment Act it is OK for the Geneva Conventions, right?&quot;  Wrong - shocks the conscience only works if you are capable of shock AND have a conscience.  Especially in armed conflict, if one has little or no conscience or if little shocks one can do many current Common Article 3 violative acts.  And since these acts are or would be done to people held abroad who are not Americans and in the absence of habeas jurisdiction, United States federal courts are not available (quid state courts of general jurisdiction) to hear what happened or do something about it.<br /> <br />But, can we trust ourselves to apply such a domestic standard in a manner that is consistent with the prior international standard?<br /> <br />As I ponder the 14,000 persons being held around the world in a series of prisons under United States control I think of Union soldiers who were held at Andersonville during the Civil War,  the southern cotton mill unionizers held in stockades in the 30&#39;s, slavery, the treatment of Native Americans, the treatment of Asians in the late 19th and early 20th century and Japanese-Americans during World War II, the treatment of the Irish in Boston (NINA - No Irish Need Apply), the treatment of hispanics in the Southwest, the anti-semitism against Jews, and the years and years of segregation of blacks including the thousands of lynchings.  I also ponder secret prisons and other aspects of our Program that are revealed every day.  I ponder what the Military JAG officers said on July 13 this summer that interrogation techniques that were authorized and used in this war violate Common Article 3.<br /> <br />And I conclude that we are fooling ourselves if we think the &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; standard is anything more than a carefully carved way to get around an international standard and do uncivilized things in the dark, far away, to people who seem to be different and who hate us - all in the name of protecting us and self-defense. Sounds like overseas lynching to me.<br /> <br />Protection and self-defense can lead to awful things.  I had a godfather who was held in a secret prison in the dark, incomunicado, in Liberia by then Sargeant Sam Doe after the coup there in the late 70&#39;s.  No one could be in contact with him.  My father, desperate, contacted persons close to President Carter who was able to get in contact with the American Ambassador in Liberia.  The consul was able to go to the prison and ask for my godfather.  A door was opened, light came into the dark, and my uncle came out of the dark.  The door closed on the others in there with him.<br /> <br />The power and prestige of the United States helped my godfather to come out of a cell where he had been held in such an uncivilized manner.  <br /> <br />That United States power and prestige is now being used to create &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; conditions for the 14,000 and counting being held in this global war on terror.  I am convinced our approach is a terrible mistake which will come back to haunt us just as the Senate&#39;s failure to pass an anti-lynching law in the early 20th century came back to haunt the Senate.<br /> <br />I ask each American to contact their Congresspersons www.house.gov and Senators www.senate.gov to block both the President and the McCain-Warner-Graham Military Commission Bills and ask them to change the Program. <br /> <br />I also ask our friends abroad to not see this as an internal American discussion but to take a stand in support of the Common Article 3 standard as-is and other definitions of the Geneva Conventions that are under assault and ask that we change the Program.  <br /> <br />While Americans can be very hostile to foreigners, world opinion does affect us - it was one of the reasons that <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> was decided by the Supreme Court in the 50&#39;s.  <br /> <br />We can do better than these good cop/bad cop laws.  Those intelligence officers who have crossed the line SHOULD take out war crime insurance if they have committed them as part of their work over these years.  We can act consistent with the best of our history and not the worst.  If that means changing the Program, then change the Program and then make the Executive execute under that clear standard.  Lauterpacht told us in the early 1940&#39;s that citizens cause compliance with the reality of international law.  Let us cause compliance.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: &quot;Five years later, the 9/11 tragedy is writ large. Unnecessary deaths litter the day, every day. Gratuitous barbarism shocks the conscience. The rhetoric of destruction intensifies. Individuals and nations committed to violence threaten international peace and security. The United Nations fails. The Security Council lingers, limps, and acts with half-hearted authority as it arbitrarily selects problems and solutions. The United States, the sole superpower, drifts away from the path of human rights and the rule of law. Muslim militants in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere show no signs of abandoning suicide bombings. The carnage defines the day. <br /> <br />The fifth anniversary of 9/11 comes amidst unprecedented destruction in Iraq and Lebanon. Twisted metal, smoke, screams, awe, and ruins of the World Trade Center no longer stand alone in the haunted memories of men and women who see butchery not through the distorting mirrors of nationalism or religion but with innocent eyes. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights challenges our sense of owning some deaths but not others. It shakes our muddled conscience with the clarity of its first Article: &quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.&quot; Poets of the world sob in unison without raising their heads to ask who has been killed by whom.  The death of princes mourns the death of beggars. Partisan philosophers, however, harp on the mantra that there is no moral equivalency between &quot;those&quot; and &quot;these&quot; killers.  <br /> <br />Tough leaders are hatching new plots to perpetuate the idea of senseless destruction. Al-Qaeda has released new videos to reaffirm their resolve to continue to kill until Muslim lands are liberated. Israeli and Palestinian leaders vow to meet again for fruitless talks. The US Vice-President reminds Americans that the deadly invasion of Iraq was justified. The UK Prime Minister makes a useless trip to the Middle East to assert his non-existent moral authority. State-sponsored assassinations and secret prisons find legal excuses in the rhetoric of &quot;terrorism.&quot;  Incompetent neo-cons are urging for a war against Iran, which refuses to give up its rights to undefined nuclear energy.  The Sudanese government denies the massacres of Darfur.  Madness rules the world. Pessimism darkens the hour. Law has become lawless. This is a sad day. But even today, I must muster hope and courage to teach law to a new generation of lawyers.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong>Abigail Salisbury</strong></a> [University of Pittsburgh 3L, just returned from Kosovo]: &quot;I went to spend my summer working in Prishtina, the capital city of Kosovo, because I thought that there I would gain some valuable experience which would be relevant to my work toward the International and Comparative Law Certificate.  While many internationals (the generic term given to the foreigners working in Prishtina) enter that country only to work with other people from their own countries, I wanted to work somewhere where I would be able to experience the actual atmosphere of a working Kosovar Albanian office. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that atmosphere turned out to be nightmarishly disorganized.  In order to organize my internship before my departure from the United States, a faculty member from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, a translator and a staff member from the Council of Europe met with the staff at the Chamber of Advocates, the Kosovar equivalent of a bar association.  It was agreed that I would work on an ethics project which could potentially grow into something I could continue studying in the United States upon my return.  When I showed up for work at the Chamber, however, I was left with people who spoke no English at a time when I spoke virtually no Albanian, and was shown into a room and left there for four hours while everyone left the office.  The same thing happened the next day, and when the person in charge of my internship--an English speaker--showed up, I asked her if there would ever be anything for me to do.  She said I should probably go back to the United States, as there was no project.<br /><br /> Fortunately, with the help of the Council of Europe employees, I was able to secure a replacement position as a &quot;Praktikante&quot; or a sort of summer associate at a law firm of an attorney who deals primarily with war criminals and high-profile defense cases.  Although some attorneys speak at least rudimentary English, I had no choice but to intensively study and practice Albanian in order to follow most meetings, as almost none of the clients were remotely fluent in English.  People found it shocking and admirable that an American would try to learn Albanian, but at the same time they would laugh at me as if I were on a fool&#39;s errand and always say, &quot;Don&#39;t waste your time!&quot;  Indeed, the question of language is always a touchy one.  Almost everyone of a certain age speaks Serbian because they were forced to learn it in school under the old regime.  Sometimes businessmen will deal in Serbian, and all court documents must be produced not only in English and Albanian, but also in Serbian.  However, a friend of mine who had been born in Belgrade and then emigrated to Canada as a child was working in Prishtina for the summer and she was always wary, because we were occasionally threatened by people who heard her speaking Serbian.  Thus, despite the fact that she could freely communicate with most of the local business-owners, we usually used a combination of my Albanian and another friend&#39;s German to negotiate, as many people also speak German.  Prishtina is unique in the fact that many more people speak English than one would imagine, but most internationals do not meet the &quot;locals&quot;, and so they often have an overly-inflated notion of how many people actually do speak English.<br /><br /> As an international, my time in Prishtina ended up naturally splitting up into three parts: first, my time spent with other law students like myself who had come from North America; second, my interactions with the local Kosovar Albanians who became my friends; and third, my workdays and networking evenings with local professionals who were friends with my boss.  Each of these divisions was strikingly different, made obvious by the fact that many professionals consider it above them to speak to other locals, for example, and by differing social mores based on interpretation of risks under the traditional Leke Dukagjini, or laws of behavior. <br />  <br /> While I spent my time at the law office meeting with clients, going to the courts and jails, and writing persuasive correspondence and appeals, everything came to a halt when the courts began to shut down at the end of July.  Heaven help you if you were arrested and put into a detention center in June or July!  The courts would not open for another month and a half.  Even when they are open, they work so slowly that people often sit in prison for over a year without really being properly charged, while the judge and prosecutor go through what is called the &quot;investigatory phase&quot;, as they have roles rather different from their American counterparts.  The legal system in Kosovo parallels some European procedures, and the judge is required to look into matters personally and to make his or her own investigation.  Thus, they set off for the day to visit the crime scene, accompanied by guards with Kalashnikovs.  <br /><br /> Thus, I had time to work on my own research and to travel around Kosovo.  It is only by traveling to the other areas of Kosovo and accepting the shocking level of local hospitality offered throughout the region that one can truly see the massive effect the international presence has had on Prishtina.  In Pej&euml; or Prizren, horse-drawn carts still roll through the streets, there are no restaurants because there are no &quot;rich&quot; foreigners to dine in them, I did not see anyone who spoke English, and many people still wear the traditional Albanian folk costumes.  Coming back into Prishtina and watching the city-dwellers drive through the streets blasting American rap and Western European techno, I could better see why the locals thought that the people from the villages were so different from them.  In Prishtina especially, there is a tremendous contempt for the country people, who are called &quot;katunar&quot; after the Albanian word for &quot;villager&quot;, resulting in a derogatory slang term akin to &quot;redneck&quot;.  Thousands of these villagers came into the city because their houses were destroyed in the war.  Now there is no work for them in an economy of 70% unemployment and many of the old men roam the streets aimlessly all day while there are miles and miles of fallow fields left behind in the countryside.  <br /><br /> UNMIK has seemingly done little to help the economy, but much of the problem is likely due to the fact that Kosovo has yet to attain the &quot;final status&quot; which is seen as the determining factor in showing foreign businesses that Kosovo is ready for development and worth the risk of investment.  For the time being, it is trendy to put up the signs encouraging the boycotting of Serbian goods in order to foster the market for Albanian and Kosovar products.  However, these local products seem to consist merely of building materials and food, and an economy is not built on selling your own cheap goods to your own poor people.<br /><br /> Overall, I leave Kosovo with hope for but not a lot of confidence in its future: UNMIK has not created a system which will self-sustain after the internationals leave.  The economy in Prishtina, for instance, is largely a service industry based on catering to the dining, travel, and entertainment desires of the international community, and will necessarily collapse when there is no more customer base.  The international judicial system was put into place as a temporary measure to keep cases from being tainted by prejudiced or otherwise influenced local judges.  However, the local judicial system has not been cleansed of these problems in the meantime.  Instead, there is little confidence in that system by the average Kosovar, who still believes--often rightly so--that paying the right person will ensure a verdict.  The attorney with whom I worked makes his clients write out by hand a statement that they are not buying a decision, but merely legal services, and they often still misunderstand and become irate when things do not go their way.  Inadequate continuing legal education means that the majority of judges do not understand which laws to apply, do not think it is their job to interpret the law or to utilize case law, and cannot write an adequately-reasoned opinion in any language.  The organizations created to improve these problems are floundering helplessly.  The Chamber of Advocates has no control over its members and offers little help to them anyway, much like the similar body for judges.  The Kosovo Law Center has lost its OSCE funding, meaning that it has had to move into a tiny facility where it has no access to its own archives and that it can no longer offer productive training in any medium.  Without some serious practical changes and step-by-step action plans which I do not see forthcoming from UNMIK, I am not optimistic, and perhaps untold millions will have been spent only to see a return to the same old problems.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ndlaw/faculty/facultypages/oconnell.html">Mary Ellen O&#39;Connell</a> of Notre Dame Law School says that five years after 9/11 - five years that have witnessed Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, Abu Ghraib and CIA &quot;black sites&quot; - there are hopeful signs that America is returning to the rule of law that a handful of powerbrokers urged be cast aside in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks...<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/oconnellnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s we reach the fifth anniversary of the tragic events of September 11, 2001, our nation seems poised for recovery.  In addition to recovering from the shock of that fateful day, we are also poised to pull back from a number of lawless policies instituted in response.  Apparently, in an effort to ensure our safety against threats both real and imagined, our leadership largely abandoned this country&#39;s commitment to the rule of law, certainly our commitment to international law.  But now, finally, we as a nation are pushing back from those policies.  We are on the road to recovering our legal and moral commitments and, therewith, the nation's standing in the world. <br /><br />The Supreme Court started us on this road to recovery with its 2004 decision in <em>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</em>.  Justice O'Connor reminded the President he has no blank check to violate the law even in wartime.  The recovery was helped immensely when the Court stated in <i>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> this past summer that the Geneva Conventions do in fact apply to battlefield captives facing trial.   Following Hamdan, Secretary of State Rice apparently succeeded in persuading the President to close - at least for now - "black sites" where terrorism suspects were being held secretly for years on end.[<a href="#1">1</a>]  The U.S. military has stood firmly against adopting unlawful interrogation techniques, and the new Army Field Manual 2-22.3, &quot;Human Intelligence Collector Operations&quot; (the replacement for the 1992 FM 34-52 &quot;Intelligence Interrogation&quot;) does ensure that Army interrogators will use only lawful techniques, at least with respect to some detainees.<br /><br />Congress now has the opportunity to ensure that trials of detainees will meet our legal obligations under international law and to ensure that the CIA uses only lawful interrogation methods.  Congress can also keep us in compliance with the Geneva Conventions by rejecting proposed changes to the War Crimes Act.  If the Administration would then renounce the practice of extra-judicial killing and the policy of pre-emptive force, the country will have rejected the worst of the lawless policies developed in the wake of 9/11.  <br /><br />Five years after that day, we might have expected to be in a very different place.  We might have thought our leadership would have put every effort into developing a comprehensive treaty against terrorism, that we would have created new, powerful international institutions to coordinate counter-terrorism efforts by police around the world, and that we would have put our best legal talent to work in strengthening the legal norm against terrorism, internalizing it, making it more effective.  We had the full support and sympathy of the world community following 9/11 - all of these possibilities were open to us.<br /><br />Instead, we abandoned international law and today we fear an attack on America as much as we did five years ago.  And worse, we are disrespected, even hated around the world, as perhaps never before.  Secretary Rice finally chose to support the closing of the black sites because our allies were refusing to cooperate with a state that would operate such places.  Today, many people in the world associate 9/11 not with the horrible wrong done to us, but the wrongs we have done to others in the name of 9/11.  When 9/11 is mentioned, many people think of it as a pre-text for Iraq, Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib and waterboarding.  But thanks to the courts, Secretary Rice, our friends and allies abroad, human rights lawyers, members of Congress, reporters, and numbers of courageous private citizens, we appear to finally be moving in the right direction.  Congress now has its chance to do the right thing and keep us moving again toward the rule of law.<br /><br />Perhaps it will help if our elected representatives consider how we arrived at this dark place in our history.  How could it be that we threw away sixty years of legal development&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;law that reflects the moral consensus of nations?  Yes, 9/11 was disorienting.  We were in shock.  But it seems to me that our leaders allowed a handful of men to take advantage of that disorientation to push through policies of their own, policies that did not reflect U.S. or international law.  Vice President Cheney and his inner staff wished to strengthen the presidency.  In the ideology of neo-conservatism, a nation needs a very powerful leader who will ruthlessly press for supremacy.  The Vice President had a useful ally in this goal, John Yoo, in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.  In Yoo's personal theory, courts cannot restrain presidential conduct in wartime.[<a href="#2">2</a>]  <br /><br />In the confusion of 9/11, the decision was made to declare a "global war on terrorism."  The president would then have unlimited power.  The first public indication of the deadly seriousness of these policies came November 13, 2001, with the executive order on detention and trial of al Qaeda members, something that even the conservative columnist William Safire called a dictatorial grab for power.<br /><br />John Yoo was also writing memos together with a few colleagues (Bybee, Delahunty, Goldsmith) arguing that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to al Qaeda in the President's worldwide war, that the President could authorize torture and abuse in interrogation, that he could declare anyone &#8212; even an American citizen &#8212; an enemy combatant and put him beyond the protection of the courts.  One memo opines that even where the Geneva Conventions do apply, they do not stop the president from shipping people to black sites. [<a href="#3">3</a>]  <br /><br />Real experts on international law, military law and interrogation put other views before the president, but these were rejected. (Just as the advice of military experts was rejected prior to the Iraq invasion.)  It may not even be that the White House actually believed the fallacious legal analysis of Yoo and company - think how much more powerful the president can be if he is actually above the law.  And that seemed to be the real argument going on post-9/11.  How could anyone really believe that the Geneva Conventions did not cover everyone on a battlefield in a signatory state or permitted detainees to be hidden from the International Committee of the Red Cross?  What these memo writers really seemed to be saying is that the president need not respect the law in this "new kind of war".  <br /><br />Principally the Supreme Court and our allies have rejected these dangerous assertions.  Secretary Rice sees the price we have paid for acting lawlessly.  Much of the nation is shocked that we, a rule of law people, a moral people, have treated human beings like dogs.  <br /><br />Now it is Congress's turn.  Congress tried to stop the use of cruelty and abuse in interrogation in the McCain Amendment last December but was outsmarted by Vice President Cheney.  It has another chance to do the right thing with respect to trials of detainees and CIA interrogation.  One step that should help is if Congress listens to real experts on international law and interrogation instead of ideologues and amateurs.  The Vice President is not an expert on interrogation.  Neither is John Yoo.  These men appear not to care a fig about the Geneva Conventions, let
 alone international law.  But they have never served in combat on a foreign battlefield.  Congress should ask military lawyers whether we should undermine the Geneva Conventions.<br /><br />Military lawyers have told Congress, when we undermine law-of-war protections, we undermine them for our own troops as well as the enemy.  We have an obligation to afford our troops on the battlefield every protection we can - physical and legal.  If our enemies do not respect the law, we need to demand that they do, not cease respecting it ourselves.  <br /><br />Troop protection is a vital reason to honor the Geneva Conventions.  Still, there is a more important reason than self-protection and that is self-respect.  Anyone who has tried to fight honorably in combat knows the value of the Geneva Conventions.  In trying to gain advantages or power for the president by dismissing the Geneva Conventions, we do not retain their value for our troops.<br /><br />In many respects, we have lost five years in the struggle against terrorism.  For the foreseeable future, much of our diplomacy and legal talent will be devoted to dealing with the fallout from lawless post-9/11 policies.  Still, it looks as though we are through losing time, that we are on the road to recovery.  As Justice Stevens said in the final line of his historic opinion in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>:  "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; [T]he Executive is bound to comply with the Rule of Law that prevails in this jurisdiction."  That is good news five years after 9/11.[<a href="#4">4</a>]<br /><br /> <br />------------------<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes<br /><br /><a name=1>1</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that the &quot;compromise&quot; between senior Republican lawmakers and the White House on the terms of military commission legislation governing detainee interrogation and trial provides US interrogators with inadequate guidance and leaves them - and their would-be protectors - legally unsafe...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/paustbig.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>C</strong></font>ongressional adoption of the recent "compromise" between three Republican Senators (McCain, Warner, and Graham) and President Bush does not provide proper legal guidance to U.S. interrogators and adherence merely to its standards would place the United States in violation of common Article 3 and other provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions (such as Articles 1, 146-147 of the Geneva Civilian Convention), not to mention similar provisions in several other international treaties and instruments and customary international law.  Those who would authorize, abet, or implement the "compromise" language in violation of common Article 3 (for example, CIA or U.S. military personnel) would be subject to criminal and civil sanctions outside the United States in any foreign forum and in certain international courts.  No Act of Congress would change this result.  As those involved in the "dirty war" interrogation tactics in Argentina and Chile have learned, even comforting legislative limits and domestic immunity can change.<br /><br />It was pointed out in a <a href="/forumy/2006/09/plea-to-congress-on-military.php">previous JURIST <em>Forum</em> essay</a> that Justice Stevens, writing the opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> (2006), warned that "at least one provision of the Geneva Conventions ... applies" to the Administration's detainees: common Article 3.  In his concurring opinion in <em>Hamdan</em>, Justice Kennedy emphasized that "[t]he Court is correct to concentrate on one provision of the law of war that is applicable ... Common Article 3."  He then noted that common Article 3 "is part of a treaty the United States has ratified and thus accepted as binding law."  As noted also, every violation of the law of war is a war crime, punishable here or abroad in any country and in international fora presently operative or created in the future under the principle of universal jurisdiction.  A denial of the rights and protections under the Geneva Conventions (such as those expressly set forth or incorporated by reference in common Article 3) is a violation of the Conventions and a violation of the Conventions is a war crime.  Certain violations of Geneva law are not merely war crimes but are also "grave breaches."  These include "torture," "inhuman treatment," and "wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health."  Another provision of treaty-based laws of war that also reflects customary international law is quite relevant in this regard.  It is set forth in Article 23(h) of the Annex to the 1907 Hague Convention No. IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which reads: "it is especially forbidden ... [t]o declare abolished, suspended, or inadmissible in a court of law the rights ... of the nationals of the hostile party."  Similarly, as part of the law of war, a violation of the Hague Convention is a war crime and acceptance of the Republican compromisers&#39; draft would do just that.<br /><br />What specific forms of treatment does common Article 3 guarantee and prohibit?  First, the article requires that all detainees "shall in all circumstances be treated humanely," not merely whenever the U.S. Executive prefers to do so and not merely whenever domestic U.S. constitutional amendments or criminal laws against "torture" happen to coincide with some common Article 3 standards.  Second, the article prohibits, "at any time and in any place whatsoever," "torture," "mutilation," "cruel treatment," "outrages upon personal dignity," "humiliating" treatment, and "degrading" treatment.  A core of generally agreed meaning and definitional factors operate in various judicial fora for imposition of criminal and civil responsibility with respect to each term or phrase despite the possibility of a lack of generally agreed meaning at the extreme outer edges of theoretically possible meanings &#8212; a circumstance well-known to lawyers and judges who interpret words such as "due process," "free speech," and the like in constitutions, statutes, private contracts, and other instruments.<br /><br />Addressing Article 4 of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), which incorporates all violations of common Article 3 and lists several of its proscriptions (including torture, mutilation, outrages upon personal dignity, humiliating treatment, degrading treatment, rape, and any form of indecent assault), the Trial Chamber in <em>The Prosecutor v. Musema</em> (2000) ruled that the list "is taken from Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol II" and "comprises <em>serious</em> violations of the fundamental humanitarian guarantees which ... are recognised as customary international law" (emphasis added).  Thus, if Congress wishes to focus on "serious" violations, all of those listed in common Article 3 are among them.<br /><br />More particularly, the Trial Chamber ruled that humiliating and degrading treatment includes "[s]ubjecting victims to treatment designed to subvert their self-regard," adding: "motives required for torture would not be required."  "Indecent assault," the court affirmed, involved "the infliction of pain or injury by an act which was of a sexual nature and inflicted by means of coercion, force, threat or intimidation and was non-consensual."  As documented in my article <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/jtl/Vol_43_3_files/Paust.pdf ">Executive Plans and Authorizations</a>, other international courts and tribunals have provided guidance concerning the meaning and definitional factors with respect to cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment (id. at 845-46), and so have several U.S. courts (id. at 821-22 n.40).  For example, while addressing five British interrogation tactics used in the 1970s (wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink), the European Court of Human Rights affirmed that inhuman treatment occurred with respect to a combination of some of the tactics that "caused, if not bodily injury, at least intense physical and mental suffering."  The five "techniques were also degrading, since they were such as to arouse in their victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them and possibly breaking their physical or moral resistance."  Another European decision in 1999 expressly reaffirmed the recognition that treatment is degrading if it is "such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them."  <br /><br />A U.S. court has also recognized that "cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment includes acts which inflict mental or physical suffering, anguish, humiliation, fear and debasement" and that being "forced to observe the suffering of friends and neighbors ... [is] another form of inhumane and degrading treatment."  As documented in my article, the Committee Against Torture (which recognized that the putative U.S. reservation to the Convention Against Torture (CAT) attempting to limit U.S. obligations under the CAT to merely those operative under three U.S. constitutional amendments is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the treaty and void as a matter of law) affirmed that seven interrogation tactics are either torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment criminally proscribed by the Conven
tion: (1) restraining in very painful conditions, (2) hooding under special conditions, (3) sounding of loud music for prolonged periods, (4) sleep deprivation for prolonged periods, (5) threats, including death threats, (6) violent shaking, and (7) using cold air to chill.    <br /><br />Language in the Republican compromise fails to reflect the international legal standards recognized in international and U.S. domestic courts and tribunals.  First, several definitions in the draft are limited to others that are found in prior legislation, even though the Committee on Torture noted that prior U.S. legislation is inadequate and, thus, this scheme will not protect U.S. interrogators.  Second, contrary to some of the standards noted above, some of the definitions in the draft are far too limiting and, thus, do not adequately warn U.S. interrogators regarding what the actual international legal standards are.  Third, the draft attempts to abet this problem by requiring that "[n]o foreign or international sources of law shall supply a basis for a rule of decision ... in interpreting the prohibitions enumerated" in the draft.  Thus, U.S. interrogators are needlessly placed in harms way if they merely follow the standards in the draft.  <br /><br />In particular, contrary to international precedent, the draft attempts to add limiting words such as "intended to inflict," "severe," and "serious" to a definition of cruel or inhuman treatment.  Instead of a prohibition of "mutilation," the draft seeks to limit one form of mutilation to "permanently disabling." The draft also attempts to limit "serious physical pain or suffering" by excluding "cuts, abrasions, or bruises" not amounting to "a burn or physical disfigurement" and excluding serious pain or suffering not involving "significant loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty," or "extreme" physical pain, or "a substantial risk of death."  Thus, the draft does not cover all forms of serious injury to body or health, mutilation, and cruel treatment.  There is no attention in the draft to Geneva prohibitions of "humiliating" treatment and there is only one portion of the draft that addresses "degrading" treatment &#8212; and it does so in a manner that also fails to provide adequate legal guidance to U.S. interrogators, since it attempts to limit its coverage of "cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment" to merely that prohibited by three domestic U.S. constitutional amendments.  As noted, the Committee on Torture has rejected such an attempt.  Moreover, there is no such attempted reservation to the Geneva Conventions and, if there had been, such a putative reservation would also be void ab initio as a matter of law.  Constitutional amendments simply do not cover all cruel, inhuman, degrading, and humiliating treatment proscribed under the laws of war and human rights law.  Moreover, constitutional amendments do not even reach all private perpetrators, whereas the laws of war and human rights law can reach private perpetrators (as affirmed in several U.S. cases).  Using a void putative amendment to one treaty in an attempt to limit the reach of several others would be outrageous and would not provide adequate guidance to those involved in interrogation.<br /><br />For several reasons, Senator McCain is correct that this is not about al Qaeda, this is about America.<br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.brooklaw.edu/faculty/profile/?page=66">Susan Herman</a> of Brooklyn Law School says that the lingering fog of the 9/11 attacks has clouded our perceptions, blurred our legal categories, and perhaps also compromised our judgment...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/susanherman.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>F</strong></font>or a month after September 11, 2001, I walked out of my house in Brooklyn and smelled the smoke.  Even while the air was still acrid, people agreed that 9/11 had "changed everything."  In those early days, we all felt that to be true but we didn't really know what it meant.<br />   <br />            I have two thoughts to add to the chorus of fifth anniversary reflections about how "everything" has changed, focusing on law, my own field.<br /><br /><strong>Categories and the law</strong><br /><br />Among the structures shaken by the ripples of 9/11 are the categories on which much of our law depends.   For example, before 9/11, the law dichotomized rules for war and rules for peace.  A threat to the safety of Americans was treated under one set of procedures if the threat was posed by a soldier of a foreign state and under quite another set of procedures if the threat came from an individual or group considered criminals. 9/11 left us struggling with the question of which paradigm is a better fit for treating suspected terrorists.   That dichotomy poses a thorny choice post 9/11.  Are we at war and should we therefore invoke the law of war with respect to matters like detention and interrogation of suspects, or procedures for deciding who actually is a terrorist?  Or should we treat suspected terrorists as criminals in the civil courts or under the rules we would apply to our own military personnel in courts-martial?  <br /><br />Underlying our struggles with these difficult questions is the more profound question of whether our categories have failed, rendering this dichotomy and the choice it poses useless.  How should we respond if the "war on terror" does not fit neatly into either of our preexisting categories, war or criminality?  What deeper questions should we be asking if not the formal question of whether this is war or peace?  What civil process is worth preserving and importing if we want to create a new, third category instead of trying to operate under our earlier dichotomy?<br />   <br />A second victim of this challenge to our previous axioms about the categories on which law is based has been the separation of powers/checks and balances among the branches of the federal government.   The law (the Constitution in particular) set out roles for each branch of government in order to provide checks and balances with respect to important decisions about matters like detention, treatment of non-citizens, and rules governing surveillance.  But the President argues that 9/11 has necessarily unsettled our expectations about the role of the other two branches, both as a matter of prerogative and as a consequence of our need for secrecy.  The President acted unilaterally to change the rules governing surveillance, for example, on the theory that Congress could not, as a practical matter, be formally involved in deciding on the scope of permissible surveillance.  Because the factual background of our actual surveillance activities, the administration argues, needs to remain secret, Congress cannot fulfill its legislative function because the process of legislation is inherently public, therefore threatening to our security, and therefore impossible.  The administration also frequently argues that the courts should not be involved in checking executive decisions about matters like conduct of surveillance or extraordinary rendition, for similar reasons.  Litigation, the administration says, is not feasible where "state secrets" would have to be revealed to the court and perhaps the parties during the course of the litigation.  So the administration claims the right to act unilaterally, not just because of our underlying maxims about the prerogatives of the executive branch or our conclusions about whether we are at war, but because it is ostensibly not possible, as a practical matter, to include the other branches in decision-making without increasing the risk of harm.  <br /><br />The Supreme Court has fought to preserve the essential role of the courts in a remarkable series of cases &#8212; <em>Rasul v. Bush</em>, <em>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</em>, and <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>.  But the scope of those decisions, including the question of their relevance in cases where the administration argues that a need for secrecy precludes litigation, is far from clear.  And Congress has barely begun to scrape the tip of the iceberg in considering what its own role should be with respect to setting rules for surveillance, or procedures for military commissions.  Decisions about checks and balances, always difficult, have been made geometrically more difficult by questions about the extent to which earlier rules still apply.<br />      <br />A third example:  It has become a commonplace that post 9/11 the law of search and seizure should be subject to reevaluation so we can make wise decisions about how we balance our concern for privacy with our desire to uncover terrorist activity.  But the changes in our very approach to questions about the permissible scope of surveillance go beyond any possible recalibration of that balance.   Before the fall of 2001, the law of surveillance created two distinct paths for search and seizure procedures, depending on whether or not the purpose of the surveillance was to gather foreign intelligence or to conduct a criminal investigation.  The Patriot Act collapsed those categories to allow the administration easier access to surveillance aimed at doing both.  The law of surveillance also distinguished searches and seizures within the United States from searches and seizures abroad.  Although we do not know the details of the National Security Agency surveillance (secrecy again), it seems that, maybe due to advances in technology, that line may be considerably more fluid than we previously thought.  Fourth Amendment law, furthermore, required the courts to distinguish reasonable expectations of privacy from unreasonable searches and seizures.  The administration now argues that the courts are not competent to decide whether an expectation of privacy is reasonable under circumstances where, again, the courts cannot know what information is being acquired in the "war on terror" or how it is being used and so cannot evaluate costs and benefits.<br />  <br />The law of federalism provided that the federal and state/local governments operated within certain spheres, and under established hierarchies.  But in Joint Terrorism Task Forces, federal officers may be interfering with state/local law in indeterminate ways.  And in New York City, Chief of Police Ray Kelly has created his own international networks with which federal agents dare not interfere.<br />  <br />Perhaps most importantly, the distinction between legal responses based on fear and those based on reason seems blurred.  Although there have certainly been other times in American history when fear has triumphed over reason, the immediacy of the threat of harm has never seemed greater.  Some argue that politicians are fanning our fears for their own partisan purposes.  Some acknowledge that they prefer laws that make them feel safe, regardless of whether the laws can actually be expected to have that effect.  One person interviewed about airport security measures was told about a new x-ray technology &#8212; perhaps it was facial recognition software &#8212; that according to experts was not actually effective.  He replied that he would prefer for such technology to be used for airport screening even if it was not effective because it made him f
eel safer.  How can, or should, law operate in the fog of fear?<br /><br /><strong>Processing 9/11</strong><br /><br />In light of the events of the last five years I also wonder how lawmakers can make decisions about law before culture has had an opportunity to work through how we actually feel about the issues law entails.  At first, 9/11 was news 24/7 as we focused on immediate personal tragedies, Herculean clean up efforts, and early attempts to consider what we might do to prevent similar catastrophes.  Very quickly, 9/11 began to become history.   And within a few weeks or months, 9/11 became a fount of law.  On September 18, Congress authorized the President to use force to counter terrorism, and on October 26, with remarkable unanimity and little debate, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act, which confidently described itself as "Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism." By then, 9/11 had also become politics.<br /><br />It is only five years later that 9/11 has become national art.  The first few wide distribution movies about the events of that day, about United Flight 93 and the fates of individual firefighters, appeared to a chorus of discussion about whether it was too soon to tell stories about  9/11.  These films and the network TV series ABC planned on the road to 9/11 seem to have provoked more bitter and widespread controversy about their timing and content than the legislation of fall 2001 provoked in the fall of 2001.  <br /><br />It is remarkable that dramatic legislation about terrorism could be so speedy and so unanimous while artistic representations have been so slow to emerge and so hard fought.  It is only quite recently that Congress has shown any inclination or ability to reexamine the legal responses of the fall of 2001, perhaps because enough time has passed that it is becoming possible to ask somewhat more dispassionate questions.  The report of the 9/11 Commission and other histories are still quite recent.   Can our legal responses be stable or reasoned when we are still so unsure about how to tell the story of 9/11 through history or art? <br />     <br />Maybe five years from now the fog will have lifted enough that we will be able to understand more about our immediate and long term responses to the challenges 9/11 poses to lawmakers.   Maybe five years from now, we will have found our way to more reasoned and stable laws. <br />   <br /><br /><em>Susan Herman is Centennial Professor of Law at Brooklyn Law School and General Counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union</em><br />

Foremost among them have been the discomforting refusal of the administration to rule out the introduction of substantive evidence outside of the presence of the accused.  This proposal, rejected even by the senior military leaders of the armed forces, may well not survive Congress.  Even those endeavoring to execute the commissions argue that the procedures must be improved in several other ways to bring them into compliance with U.S. and international law.  Yet it is possible that all of the discussion over what procedures should be used misses a far more vital issue.  It may be that how any procedures are used&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;who is to be tried, and when&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;reflects a strategic choice more vital to the United States than narrower questions of what sort of review system is appropriate, or whether hearsay should be admissible.<br /><br />As the nation has grappled with our new enemy, it has been painfully clear that al Qaeda is not interested in adhering to the limits of the Law of Armed Conflict.   The nations of the world, which developed those rules to mitigate the most terrible effects of war for its most helpless victims, have witnessed the results. We struggle not against a nation with whom we can ultimately seek peace, but against a criminal organization.   <br /><br />There are two distinct models for attacking a criminal enterprise of this kind.  In what might be called "the Untouchables" strategy, government forces seek a weak link in the organizational chain, a small fish.  They hope to find someone who possesses limited power and limited liability, but knows about the internal workings of the organization.  Pressure is put on that person, generally in the form of the stick of severe prosecution paired with the carrot of immunity or a favorable plea agreement.<br /><br />The expectation is that the small fish will offer the prosecutors better information and even testimony.  The government can then pursue ever larger fish, ever more important targets, until the leader of the organization is brought into a courtroom, and perhaps a prison.  Along the way the trials will be stealthy: jurors will be secluded, witnesses will be protected, gag orders will be issued.  The government will conduct a secretive campaign, as darkness offers many advantages while pursuing the big fish.<br /><br />The other model is that conducted at the International Military Tribunal (IMT) at Nuremberg after World War II.  There the prosecutions began with the most culpable defendants in the hands of the Allies.  The first trial was an elaborate and high profile affair of almost two dozen men and a handful of organizations.  Prominent lawyers of four nations served as judges and lead prosecutors (the United States sent the Attorney General for the former role and a Supreme Court Justice for the latter).  Imprinted on the consciousness of the world since the IMT are the pictures of Robert Jackson at the podium, Herman Goering in the dock.  The world watched on newsreels as the courtroom, crowded with judges, advocates, interpreters, and spectators, heard witness after witness and read document after document.  Even in the grainy films that exist the impression a viewer gets is of proceedings conducted under bright light.  <br /><br />Only after the original trial did other tribunals take up the problems of the lower level leaders, the rank-and-file who participated in the evils.  By then, much of the glamour was gone, taking the press with it.  There were thousands of trials conducted in what were accurately, if unpoetically, called the "Subsequent Proceedings."  <br /><br />Any doubts about which approach the U.S. would use against al Qaeda evaporated upon the announcement that the first defendant to face trial by military commission was to be Salim Hamdan.  Hamdan, a driver and bodyguard for Osama bin Laden, has never been alleged by any government agency to be a leader, a planner, or even a major operative.  On the contrary, he is a neat parallel with the usual run of drivers and lookouts so often targeted in an incrementalist campaign to bring down a mob.  His identity as a small fish was placed into stark relief by the pronouncements of the White House that three legitimate big fish had been seized by U.S. forces: Ramzi Binalshibh, Abu Zubaydah, and the man who is alleged to have hatched the 9/11 plan, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM).  The Untouchables strategy took charge of the proceedings, while potential Nuremberg defendants sat in U.S. or allied custody somewhere, seemingly beyond the reach of both the rights they should have been accorded and the justice owed the nation and the world.  Little argument was heard about the strategic choice, and the renewed discussion following the president's announcement has not changed that. This was unfortunate: the competing strategies are based on sets of assumptions that are perfectly opposite, and the possibility that the assumptions did not fit the actual world went sadly unexamined.  <br /><br />The Untouchables strategy assumes a furtive, finite group.  Its target has no real ideology beyond material reward.  Although prosecutors may have extraordinary degrees of personal loyalty to overcome, they need not wean participants from any higher calling.  In order to turn them, the economics of their position must be altered: the costs to the fish of remaining loyal must be made to be (or to seem) less than those of turning to the aid of the government.<br /><br />The Nuremberg model makes an opposite assessment of its foe.  It targets a group which may be bound by loyalty or personal gain, but at least in part functions the way that it does because it believes that it is in the right.  Because it has a triumphalist ideology, coupled with an odious lack of regard for the value of the humans it victimizes, it is futile to fight it in secret.  The group will make claims of its own righteousness in the sunny town square; it will hide its misdeeds in the darkness.  If it can keep them hidden, it will continue to grow and attract new followers.  In order to fight such a group, the Nuremberg strategy needs light.  The press was not allowed into the workings of the IMT out of the generosity of the Allies.  The press was the critical player. <br /><br />Justice Jackson's report to president made clear his belief that "the importance of this case is not measurable in terms of the personal fate of any of the defendants who were already broken and discredited men."  Rather, he thought, the lasting importance of the trial was that the demonstration of their crimes would "leave no ground for future admiration of their characters."<br /><br />The peril to the United States, and the world, in clinging to the Untouchables strategy is that it allows the al Qaeda ideology to continue to grow.  Operatives and true believers can maintain innocence, even victimization by the United States.  A Nuremberg model, a trial of senior personnel, and perhaps the organization itself, would expose to world view the cruelties of al Qaeda, their attacks upon innocents traveling, at work, and even in embassies.  Such a trial, with evidence subjected to rigorous cross-examination, conducted before the international press and carried
 on global television, would expose the deeds of men which might well leave no ground for current, or future, admiration of their characters.<br /><br />In his speech on September 6, 2006, the loudest applause President Bush received was when he announced that KSM and the other high profile detainees had been turned over to the military and should stand trial by military commission.  It may have been caused by a hope for justice for these particular individuals.  On the other hand, it may signal hope that there is to be a transformation of trial strategy, a change from the pursuit of individual gangsters to an attempt to discredit before a world audience this sinister ideology.  Perhaps it reflected the growing awareness that the importance of exposing al Qaeda to the light exceeds even the need for settling the cases of these broken men.<br />    <br /><br /><em>John M.

One picture caption described a solitary black man wading through waist-high water with a bag of groceries as "looting" whereas the other picture showed a white couple in similar circumstances and the caption described them as "finding" groceries. The media meanwhile described the Superdome where mostly-black hurricane survivors huddled as unsafe, and as a place where murders, rapes, and robberies were rampant. Later, the New Orleans <em>Times Picayune</em> investigated the public safety issues and found the crime that took place in the Superdome was exaggerated. This biased coverage was directly responsible for the National Guard being ordered to "shoot to kill" those whom they perceived as breaking the law during the hurricane.<br /><br />A recent study by two Pennsylvania researchers, Oscar Gandy, Jr. and Chul-Joo Lee analyzed photographs appearing in the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Washington Post</em> after the onslaught of Katrina; they found that the photographs showed a distorted picture of New Orleans with almost all black victims and virtually no black rescuers. Given that the City of New Orleans is disproportionately black, it is surprising to see so few black heroes. The choice of photographs may reinforce stereotypes of black helplessness.<br /><br />Katrina crystallized and highlighted the current stereotypical media coverage of people of color. However, the news media have historically misrepresented or failed to cover minorities. In 1968 the Kerner Commission and the U.S. Civil Rights Commission blamed the media's lack of diversity for the social unrest of the 1960s. Today, the broadcast news notoriously overreport black-on-white violent crime stories. Given racially segregated housing patterns, most crime is racially segregated. Even though crime decreased in the 1990s, coverage of crime increased 721%. In 2000, broadcast crime reporting dropped 39 percent, but still remains the third most covered topic in network news. Broadcasters often sensationalize stories with white victims or occurring in rich neighborhoods. <br /><br />The FCC can remedy this stereotypical reporting by increasing diversity in the ranks of broadcast owners, managers, and employees. However, since 2002, the FCC has failed its public interest mandate and ignored issues of racial diversity. When the FCC rendered its media ownership decision in 2003, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported that diversity was only a last minute consideration. The FCC failed to acknowledge eleven minority ownership proposals, leading the Appellate Court to partly reverse the FCC's 2003 ownership decision. <br /><br />In 2003, then-FCC Chairman Powell appointed a Diversity Committee that ultimately devised several innovative race-neutral proposals that would increase media diversity. Noting that these proposals would help remedy the underrepresentation of minorities, FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein, at a recent conference at St. John's Law School, admonished the FCC for its failure to take action.  In its most recent media ownership order, the FCC again has failed to sufficiently address these issues, even on a subject as urgent as requiring multilingual communications in emergencies like Hurricane Katrina.<br /><br />The FCC must implement policies to increase the number of minorities who own and are employed by broadcast stations. Only 3.9 percent of all broadcast stations are owned by minorities, and only 5.2 percent of the general managers of local broadcast stations are minorities. Between 1995 and 2005, minority employees virtually disappeared from radio news; and those remaining, according to the Minority Media Communications Council work solely in minority radio.  Even though minorities are better represented among television news reporters, they often are powerless to influence media coverage. In its current media ownership proceedings, the FCC should initiate bold remedies to make broadcast media and coverage more reflective of society.<br /><br />Minority absences and racial misrepresentations in the media are serious concerns because they imperil our democracy. First, minorities have few avenues for robust discussion of issues important to their communities. Second, negative representations of minorities are broadcast without critical analysis and often without the presentation of the opposing viewpoints.  As a consequence negative perceptions are continually reinforced and become more tightly woven into the fabric of U.S. society. More diversity in the newsroom and in media ownership can counter these negative representations by creating more opportunities for diverse voices to emerge. Only the FCC has the power to address this woeful imbalance in media ownership and employment and the concomitant effect on balanced coverage. So far, the FCC has failed to act. <br />    <br /><br /><em>Leonard M. Baynes is Professor of Law and Director of the Ronald H.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/Friedman.cfm">Lawrence Friedman</a> and <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a> of New England School of Law say that Congress needs to step in to counter the Bush administration&#39;s apparent efforts to limit the ability of uniformed military lawyers to advise on future military commissions while it favors the input of its own political appointees...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/friedmannew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/forumy/hansennew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (2006), has rightly been regarded as a rebuke to the Bush administration's claims of authority to establish military commissions at Guantanamo.  But the decision should be viewed as no less a rebuke to Congress for its failure to fulfill its constitutional responsibility in providing legislation to create a legitimate structure for military commissions and thus providing an important and necessary check on Executive power.  <br /><br />As we have argued (<a href="/forumy/2006/03/army-and-constitution-time-for.php">The Army and the Constitution: Time for Congress to Step In</a>, JURIST, March 21, 2006) and the <em>Hamdan</em> decision confirms, the constitutional scheme contemplates that Congress will play an active part in the conduct of foreign and military affairs.  Prior to the Court's opinion in <em>Hamdan</em>, Congress was very reluctant to provide the President any substantive guidance or legislation on the structure of the military commissions.  As a result of <em>Hamdan</em>, Congress now has another chance to assert itself on commission structure.  <br /><br />In doing so, Congress should ensure that the voices of the military lawyers are heard and that these uniformed lawyers contribute to the development of the structure of the military commissions.  This is particularly important in light of recent reports that the administration is once again attempting to marginalize input from the uniformed lawyers in favor of advice from political appointees.  See Charlie Savage, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/08/27/military_lawyers_see_limits_on_trial_input/">Military Lawyers See Limits on Trial Input</a>, <em>Boston Globe</em>, Aug. 27, 2006.  It seems that the administration never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to seek and consider independent legal advice from those who ultimately have the responsibility to implement whatever structure the military commissions take.  <br /><br />In the past, Congress has been remarkably forceful in curbing at least one of the administration's proposals to consolidate its power over military decision-making:  the politicization of the selection process for the top military lawyers of each service, a transparent effort to stem the flow of independent legal advice that the uniformed lawyers provide.  <br /><br />In the face of administration proposals to have political appointees choose the top military lawyers, and the Pentagon's attempt to give the Air Force's general counsel supervisory authority over the Air Force's uniformed lawyers, Congress has remained unimpressed and affirmatively and effectively resisted those efforts.  Indeed, Congress is currently considering legislation that would promote Judge Advocate General independence by elevating the ranks of top military lawyers by giving them a third star and putting them on a more equal footing with the military and civilian officials with whom they work and advise.  <br /><br />The administration's proposals raise at least two questions in respect to Congress.  First, does Congress have the constitutional authority to prevent the President, as commander-in-chief, from controlling the selection process and marginalizing the role that the military's top lawyers play in important legal matters?  Second, if Congress does have this power, how should it assert it in the current context?<br /><br />That Congress has the power to deny the President's proposals should not seriously be in question.  The President does not possess the exclusive authority to regulate the armed forces or to make decisions regarding their composition.  The Constitution expressly permits Congress to "provide for the common defense," U.S. Const., Art. I, &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 1; to raise and support armies, see id. &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 12; and to "make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces," see id. &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 14.  Particularly in respect to the composition of the armed forces&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;which necessarily includes the military's lawyer corps&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;Congressional authority is clear.  See, e.g., <em>Loving v. United States</em>, 517 U.S. 748 (1996) (Congress has primary authority to regulate military conduct).    <br /><br />In light of this Constitutional authority, Congress should continue to resist efforts by the administration to politicize the selection process for the top military lawyers.  It can do this by continuing to block the administration's efforts to let political appointees select each service's top lawyer.  The current mechanism whereby each service nominates its respective Judge Advocate General has proved to be an effective means of identifying those military lawyers best qualified to serve in these important positions.   <br /><br />In addition, Congress should seek to elevate the position of each service Judge Advocate General from a two-star position to a three-star position.  In an organization that is based on rank and where rank brings with it influence and authority, this promotion would be much more than a symbolic change.  It would help to ensure that the service Judge Advocate Generals stand on equal footing with the people they advise and it would be much harder for their advice to be marginalized and ignored.  <br /><br />Finally, in the specific context of the military commissions, Congress should continue to ensure that the independent advice of the uniformed lawyers is heard.  Congress can do this in several ways.  In holding hearings on the commissions, Congress must routinely press the administration to provide specific information on what advice it sought from the military lawyers.  If it is apparent that the administration is continuing to ignore or marginalize the uniformed lawyers, Congress has a strong basis upon which to reject the administration's proposals outright, sending a message that it will withhold its authorization of the commissions unless the administration changes its view of the advice of military lawyers.  It follows that Congress should continue to call upon the nation's top military lawyers and other military legal experts to comment on how the military commissions should be formulated.  <br /><br />The Constitution's framers recognized that a federalist system, with its multiple and redundant checks and balances, serves as the most substantive obstacle to the aggregation of power in any one branch of government.  Though the President has the undeniable authority to lead our armed forces in the nation's defense, Congressional insistence that he consider the independent counsel of those who will be doing the defending is not only unlikely to hinder his ability to do so, it is consonant with the commitment to the rule of law in our constitutional system.<br /><br /><br /><em>Lawrence Friedman teaches courses in constitutional law at New England School of Law; Victor Hansen, a former lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps, teaches courses in criminal law there.</em><br />

		<title>Legislating Law of War Compliance: A High Price to Pay</title>

US Army (Ret.) and former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters, now a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that the recently published Army Field Manual outlining permissible interrogation techniques reflects the extraordinary measures Congress has been forced to rely on to ensure compliance with the most basic principles of the law of war; it responds to the loss of confidence in the President's interpretations of this law, but it also distorts the longstanding relationship between military doctrine and tactical initiative....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/cornforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he current impasse between President Bush and Senate Republicans over the meaning of Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions is the latest example of the administration&#39;s loss of credibility over the issue of detainee treatment.  President Bush is now reaping the bitter harvest from seeds sown when he adopted the decisions advocated by administration legal and policy advisers apparently determined to maximize executive discretion, even at the expense of compliance with the most basic obligations relating to the treatment of captured and detained enemy personnel.<br /><br />Ironically, the same loss of credibility was also manifested recently in the adoption by the Army of the new Field Manual on Human Intelligence &#8212; a move that received widespread praise among administration critics.  This Manual includes Army doctrine on interrogation techniques &#8212; called "approach" techniques.  Many observers praised the Army for rejecting many of the "aggressive" interrogation tactics that became lightening rods for the treatment of Guantanamo detainees, and for forgoing the originally conceived secret annex to the Manual.  Pursuant to the Detainee Treatment Act, these techniques are now, as a matter of law, the controlling standard for all Services within the Department of Defense.  How then, does this "positive" development in the treatment of detainees reflect a loss of credibility for the administration?<br /><br />The answer to this question lies in the unprecedented transformation of military doctrine into legal obligation.  The introduction to this Field Manual includes a statement that in accordance with the Detainee Treatment Act, the only permissible interrogation techniques for the U.S. armed forces are those provided by the Manual.  To understand why this is so unusual, and why it is also a manifestation of the profound loss of confidence in the approach adopted by the President to deal with detainees, it is important to understand what doctrine is and what it is not.<br /><br />Doctrine is best understood as a statement of "what right normally looks like."  The development of doctrine is normally not a "top down" driven process.  Instead, doctrine evolves from the innovation and creativity that occurs at the tactical level of operations.  Soldiers develop ideas of "what works", and these ideas are captured in lessons learned and after-action reports.  Doctrine development is the process of analyzing and refining these ideas and adopting them as the Army statement of "how to do it."  <br /><br />But doctrine is not intended to "freeze" the process of innovation.  Because it is best understood as a statement of Army-endorsed tactics, techniques, and procedures, doctrine is best understood as a starting point for tactical planning and execution.  Tactical innovation is then relied upon to adjust doctrine to the situation of the battlefield to find the most effective situational approach to accomplish a given mission.  In fact, one of the principal weaknesses of the Soviet military monolith NATO forces always anticipated being able to exploit was their stoic adherence to doctrine.<br /><br />Of course, innovation on the battlefield is not without limit, and I am not suggesting that no such limits exist in the realm of interrogation techniques.  Numerous factors limit tactical innovation, the law being one such factor.  This has always been acknowledged in U.S. doctrine by the clear and simple requirement that all activities must comply with the law of war.  Indeed, for decades this statement of obligation was sufficient to ensure the methods of interrogation developed by U.S. forces were consistent with the basic obligation of humane treatment.  Doctrine provided the start point, but interrogators were not prohibited in developing alternate or modified "approach" techniques, so long as those techniques complied with the law of war. Unfortunately, legal opinions that provided the foundation for Bush administration policies related to the treatment of "enemy combatants" eviscerated the effectiveness of this traditional balance between tactical innovation and legality.<br /><br />When the President adopted the conclusions of Department of Justice lawyers that excluded post 9/11 detainees from the protections of the law of war, he set in motion a chain of events that created increasing concern among lawmakers that the President's policies failed to comply with the most fundamental right of all detainees &#8212; the right to be treated humanely.   This in turn ultimately led to the Detainee Treatment Act, which justifiably sought to impose limits on the ability of the President to deviate from this obligation.  However, because the longstanding practice of compliance with the principles of the Geneva Conventions had obviously proved insufficient to limit interrogation techniques, Congress instead applied its own form of "tactical innovation" by mandating that only those interrogation techniques listed in the Army Field Manual would be permitted in the future.<br /><br />While this method undoubtedly provides the benefit of ensuring compliance with the principle of humane treatment, from a military perspective it is unfortunate that Congress was forced to adopt such an extraordinary approach to achieve this goal.  This response to the loss of confidence in the Bush administrations willingness to comply with this long understood limit on "tactical innovation" has radically altered the function of doctrine.  The Field Manual no longer represents "what right normally looks like"; it now represents "the only methods you are permitted to use."  These techniques have thus been "frozen" by law, a result inconsistent with the very concept of "doctrine." <br /><br />While the proponents of the Manual have put the proverbial "brave face" on the end result of their efforts, eliminating tactical innovation from interrogators "toolkit" is an unfortunate byproduct of the loss of confidence created by the President's policies.  Even assuming the methods adopted by the Manual are considered both effective and consistent with the principle of humane treatment, as they no doubt are, they are also now restrictive in nature, a result that was not inevitable and could have been avoided.  While the Manual does indicate that the techniques may be periodically revised, those revisions will not be developed in accordance with the tried and true method of doctrine development, but instead will have to rely on analysis detached from operational reality. <br /><br />This is a high price to pay for the President's decision to exclude detainees from the protection of Common Article 3.  To the knowledge of this author, Congress has never before felt compelled to transform doctrine into a binding legal mandate.  But the persistent efforts of the President's advisers to circumvent this most basic obligation set the conditions for this unprecedented method of ensuring such compliance.  The end result is that interrogators are now deprived of the opportunity to use their initiative and creativity, within the limits of the
law of war, to accomplish their important mission; a result that could have easily been avoided if the legal analysis relied on by the President had not created such a loss of confidence in his decisions &#8212; a loss of confidence that is again forcing prominent Senators to make an even more determined effort to preserve the integrity of the law of war.<br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S.

The events of that day shocked most of the world.  They have acquired iconic status and are referred to in the United States and elsewhere as 9/11.<br /><br />In the wake of 9/11 the Security Council of the United Nations passed various resolutions requiring all states to take measures to combat terrorism. In response countries around the world have adopted new or amended existing anti-terrorist legislation.  In some countries this has led to an erosion of cherished rights; in others it has provided a welcome opportunity to governments to reinforce and strengthen repressive practices.<br /><br />Looking back over the five years few could claim that the world is a safer place than it was before 9/11.  There have been disastrous wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in the aftermath of which great numbers of lives are still being lost, injuries and widespread suffering is being caused and normal conditions of life are being disrupted.   More recently the conflict between Israel, Hezbollah and Hamas has escalated and led to widespread loss of life in the region, greater proportionately than happened on 9/11, to damage on a much greater scale and to a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon. There have also been a significant number of bomb attacks on civilian targets in different regions, some said to have been committed or inspired by Al Qaeda.  These attacks have been in countries with different social, economic, political and cultural norms.  To mention but some, those targeted include Indonesia, Spain, Egypt, the United Kingdom, Kenya and Russia. Elsewhere there have been internal armed conflicts in various parts of the world including Colombia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Chechnya, and Sudan, characterized by some as terrorism and by others as legitimate struggles.  <br /><br />On the fifth anniversary of 9/11 it is appropriate to reflect on what has happened during the past five years and on the impact of the counter-terrorism measures that have been taken.<br /><br />In a statement issued on 30 June 2003, experts associated with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights expressed<blockquote>their profound concern at the multiplication of policies, legislations, and practices increasingly being adopted by many countries in the name of the fight against terrorism, which affect negatively the enjoyment of virtually all human rights - civil, cultural, economic, political and social.</blockquote>The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and other respected international human rights organizations have expressed similar concerns.  The ICJ has a network of 60 Commissioners, 37 National Sections and 45 Affiliated Organizations. At a well attended meeting of this network held in Berlin to mark its 50th anniversary the ICJ adopted the Berlin Declaration on Upholding Human Rights and the Rule of Law in Combating Terrorism, affirming the importance of complying with human rights and humanitarian law, and stressing that<blockquote>Contemporary human rights and humanitarian law allow states a reasonably wide margin of flexibility to combat terrorism without contravening human rights and humanitarian obligations.</blockquote>Allegations have been made concerning excessive counter-terrorism measures adopted by some countries.  They include torture of detainees to extract information; where torture is not practiced suspects may be transferred to countries where torture is likely; suspects are held in indefinite, sometimes secret, detention without charge or trial; detainees are held without access to habeas corpus and the protective reach of the courts is cut down in other ways. Fair trial guarantees and rights of appeal are curtailed; action is taken against suspects on the basis of evidence or intelligence that is withheld from them; freedom of expression is threatened; minority communities are targeted and discriminated against on ethnic or religious grounds; and because of vague definitions of terrorism political and social dissent is criminalized.   <br /><br />Hearing these allegations I was reminded of what happened in South Africa which is my home. For almost forty years from 1950 to 1990 a network of security legislation was enacted, and amended bit by bit over time to deal with perceived gaps in the laws, and the demands of the security establishment to strengthen its armory to enable it to deal with what was characterized as the fight against terrorism.  This led to the development of a structure of draconian security laws including arbitrary powers of arrest vested in senior police officers to order the detention of suspects and to hold them incommunicado, without access to lawyers or persons other than the security establishment. Initially detention could be for up to 90 days; that was amended to 180 days and ultimately indefinite detention was sanctioned. Not surprisingly the isolation placed the detainees in a vulnerable position in which they could be and were, with impunity, subjected to methods of interrogation that caused mental and physical stress, degrading treatment and torture. In a number of cases the excesses led to deaths in detention. The armory of security laws made provision for the banning of organizations and the banning of publications, and for administrative measures involving the curtailment of freedom of speech, freedom of movement, freedom of association, and for house arrest under which suspects could be confined to their homes for all or part of a day during which they would be prohibited from receiving visitors or communicating directly or indirectly with persons listed as "communists" or supporters of an unlawful organisation. <br /><br />These measures had a profound impact on our legal system and on life in our country.  Terrorism was defined broadly and caught within its net activities which could be said to be no more than legitimate social or political protest. Well established principles of the common law such as habeas corpus, the presumption of innocence, the right to a fair trial, the right to be heard before being deprived of liberty, and much more were swept aside on the grounds that this was necessary to combat terrorism. This had a chilling effect on freedom of speech and freedom of association; what you said and who you associated with could be noted and recorded and there was always the risk that if you were seen in the "wrong" company you could be placed under surveillance yourself.<br /><br />I do not suggest that conditions in apartheid South Africa are comparable to those in established democracies; nor do I suggest that the struggle against apartheid characterized by the apartheid state as terrorism can be compared to atrocities such as those committed on 9/11.  There are, however, lessons to be learnt from the South African experience, and from the experience of other countries in which excessive security measures have been adopted in the interest of the security of the state. First, early encroachments into fundamental rights are dangerous because they open the way for subsequent encroachments and to a process that saps the will of the public to object. Secondly
 they seep into the law, the temporary becomes permanent, new norms are established and become acceptable for dealing with other problems that confront the state.  Thirdly, the laws seldom achieve their purpose if the underlying causes of the threat remain unresolved and are often counter-productive, alienating communities whose support the state may need to counter the threat effectively. <br /><br />This is not to say that legislation to combat terrorism is not necessary.  The threat of terrorism is real and calls for response, including where terrorism has an international dimension, response at an international level.  But to repeat what I said at the Berlin meeting of the ICJ "the response should be proportional to the danger involved and carefully tailored to address it, bearing in mind that the danger includes not only the harm done by terrorism, but also harm done to the fabric of society by disproportionate responses that undermine democracy itself".<br /><br />The United States has a tradition of respect for human rights.  It is important that it should be, and should be seen to be, meticulous in crafting anti-terrorism measures to ensure that they comply with human rights and humanitarian law.  Five years after 9/11 it is appropriate to ask: has this been done? <br /><br /><br /><em>Justice Arthur Chaskalson is the President of the International Commission of Jurists.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that President Bush&#39;s acknowledgement that high-level terror detainees have been held in secret CIA prisons should be the beginning of a cleansing process in which leaders of the American executive, legislature, and judicial branches of government and the American people as a whole own up to and apologize for their abject failure to adhere to the international rule of law...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavis.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s President Bush has now made his long awaited admission that there have been secret CIA prisons around the world in which individuals have been held in prolonged, secret incommunicado detention in clear violation of international law (see the <a href="http://www.asil.org/insights/2006/05/insights060519.html">ASIL Centennial Resolution</a>), one has a sense of relief that the coverup is lifting and at least part of the truth is finally starting to come out.  In due course I am certain we will learn that the "tough" interrogation techniques admittedly used in these secret detention facilities violated Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.  Even if one had been in denial, one must at this point come to terms with the dawning realization that violations of international humanitarian law and war crimes have been committed by the United States that were authorized by the highest levels of civilian authority of the United States.<br /><br />It is important that we do not think of this failure of our leadership to respect the most elemental aspects of international law as purely a failure of the Executive.  In time, I hope that the ranking members of the Senate and House committees (Armed Services and Intelligence Committees and possibly others) and others (dare I say the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and/or FISA Court?) who were briefed in some manner about these practices will also come forward and tell the American people and the world  (1) what did they know?  (2) when did they know it?  This failure is a failure of the United States and falls on each of our shoulders as a collective shame.<br /><br />I hope there will come a day when on the floor of the Senate, the Senators will reveal what they knew and on the floor of the House the House members will reveal what they knew and apologize.  I hope there will be a day when the United States will make an apology to the world for its weakening of the rule of law through these types of actions.<br /><br />We can recognize the good intentions behind these illegal orders &#8212; to protect the American people.  But the departure from civilized standards that they demonstrate in the face of substantial credible internal opposition suggests a terrible failure of character that has besmirched American honor.  We ask them also to keep our honor clean and faithfully execute our laws.<br /><br />How do we get back to being ourselves?  Might I suggest that Congress start by rejecting the Bush Administration's Military Commission legislation, a thinly veiled effort to amnesty actions that were done in the 2001-2006 period.  Second, Congress should take its lead from the Military JAG Officers testimony this summer in fashioning a set of military commissions that start from the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  We should not go off half-cocked but rather draw on the history and experience under that Code to fashion an adequate procedure that meets the strictures of our statutory and international law obligations as <em>Hamdan</em> has reminded all again.  Third, Congress should simply refrain from any measures which would have the effect of amnestying or reducing the criminal and/or civil liability of those who authorized or engaged over the past years in the departures from civilized standards that are coming to light.  The full extent of those departures (extraordinary renditions, torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment etc) from civilized standards are still far too unknown and merit serious examination and, as warranted, prosecution.  The operative rule should be that the only salvation for those seeking to escape criminal and/or civil liability for their actions should be the Presidential pardon &#8212; not Congressional cravenness.<br />   <br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/about_us/aboutus_bios.html#jonathan">Jonathan Hafetz</a>, Associate Counsel with the <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a> at New York University School of Law, says that the Bush administration's post-9/11 detainee policies - most recently evidenced in the proposed military commissions bill that would severely limit the habeas corpus power of the federal courts - are a recipe for unbridled executive power and lawlessness that makes America less secure...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/jonathanhafetz.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>C</strong></font>onfronted with a revolt by his own party, the President sunk to new levels of fear-mongering last week.  He warned that America's safety would be imperiled if defiant Republican senators did not approve the administration's continued use of "enhanced" interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists at secret CIA prisons.  The message was clear: America needs to torture others to defend itself. <br /><br />But rhetoric can no longer mask the reality of immorality and mismanagement.  Five years after September 11, the President's global "war on terrorism" has come unraveled.  Lawmakers and the public are increasingly recognizing that the administration's post-9/11 detainee policies are a recipe for unbridled executive power and lawlessness that makes America less secure.   <br /><br />Since 9/11, the President has maintained that America is fighting a new kind of war, one without traditional battlefields or enemies and which could last generations.  In this "new paradigm," as the President calls it, none of the established rules apply.  The <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4999148/site/newsweek/">Geneva Conventions were cast aside as "quaint"</a> and the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4989422/">"gloves came off"</a> in the detention and interrogation of prisoners swept up across the globe.<br /><br />The results are all too familiar &#8212; a network of torture chambers stretching from Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo to Abu Ghraib to secret CIA "black sites"; indefinite detention based on secret and coerced evidence; a sham system of military trials; and a domestic spying program that thumbs its nose at surveillance laws on the books for decades.<br /><br />But the rule of law and human rights are not the only casualties.  The President's "war on terrorism" has tarnished the United States' image, undermining the support among Arabs and Muslims at home and abroad that is crucial to forestalling future terrorist plots.  Similarly, it has diminished America's standing among even its closest allies, on whose cooperation we depend.  Summarizing the state of affairs, a top British official recently blasted Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo as a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5340104.stm">"shocking . . . affront to the principles of democracy."</a><br /><br /> The courts have thankfully pushed back, demonstrating the vital role the Judiciary plays in preserving democracy and justice.  In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/03pdf/03-334.pdf#search=%22rasul%20v.%20bush%22">Rasul v. Bush</a>, the Supreme Court rejected the administration's claim that it could operate Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo as a lawless enclave, where individuals were imprisoned indefinitely without any basis to test the lawfulness of their detention.  In <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=000&invol=03-6696">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a>, the Supreme Court made clear that the President's invocation of his commander-in-chief powers does not trump the core elements of due process.  And, this past June in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=3&q=http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf&e=14905&ei=EIISRbqzN46KgQLQnpztCQ&sig=__4ri4NGREC6rmVFHZ9ikk1zVOWHk=">Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</a>, the Court struck down the administration's jerry-rigged military commissions established to try suspected terrorists of war crimes.<br /><br />These and other decisions expose the evidence problem that lies at the heart of the administration's failings.  In the realm of detentions, the evidence problem has two closely related components: first, disregarding the rules regulating how the United States obtains information; and second, eliminating a meaningful forum to test the accuracy of that information.  The result is not only torture and other abuse but also the imprisonment of innocent people.<br /><br />At Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, for example, more than 700 individuals have been detained based on secret and coerced evidence without a fair hearing.  Why?  Because the administration has disregarded established limits on interrogations and avoided any judicial inquiry into the factual basis for those detentions through continued stonewalling.<br /><br />Take the case of Mohammed al Qahtani, the alleged "twentieth hijacker." Al Qahtani has reportedly implicated 30 other prisoners.  Yet, these statements were the product of brutal interrogations in which, according to the government's own interrogation log, al Qahtani was shot up with intravenous fluid to force self-urination, denied sleep, and leashed and made to do dog tricks.  What prisoners are being wrongfully detained based on false statements coerced from al Qahtani?  Unless a federal court can examine the facts through habeas corpus proceedings, we will never know.  Instead, prisoners will be condemned without a day in court based on techniques abhorrent to any civilized society.<br /><br />The evidence problem transcends morality, with consequences that would make even the most ardent practitioner of Realpolitik shudder.   The case of Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi is but one example.  Al Libi, a captured al Qaeda commander, was rendered by the United States to Egypt for interrogation.  The administration relied on al Libi's statements that Saddam Hussein's government had provided chemical and biological training to terrorists in making the case to the American public for war in Iraq.  But, it turned out, al-Libi's statements had been gained through torture, and were later recanted by al-Libi and disavowed by the CIA.<br /><br />Undeterred, the President is now demanding that Congress grant him even greater powers going forward.  The effect would be to institutionalize future lawlessness.<br /><br />The good news is that key Republican senators are refusing to hand the President a blank check.  Senators John McCain, John Warner, Lindsey Graham, and others are fighting to preserve the protections of Geneva Conventions and to ensure that military trials are fair.<br /><br />The bad news is that these same lawmakers are ignoring the most important lesson of the last five years &#8212; the need for judicial review.  Legislation sponsored by Senators Warner and Graham would eliminate habeas corpus over pending cases challenging detentions at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo and over any other cases brought by non-citizens held abroad.   If enacted, this measure would perpetuate the evidence problem by sanctioning executive detention without due process or meaningful review.  It would effectively  return Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo to its pre-Rasul state as a prison beyond the law, where the truth is whatever the President says it is.<br /><br /> In sum, the last five years show we need greater, not less, scrutiny of presidential action by the other branches of government, especially the Judiciary.  As Congress continues to debate proposed detainee legislation, it would be wise to remember the teaching of the country's Founders: that a system of checks and balances makes America safe as well as free.<br /> <br /><br /><em>Jonathan Hafetz is an attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.</em><br />

Rumsfeld</em> (2006), warned that the military commission created by President Bush "lacks power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate the UCMJ and the Geneva Conventions," adding: "at least one provision of the Geneva Conventions ... applies," common Article 3.  Common Article 3, Justice Stevens emphasized, "prohibits 'the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.'"  He added: "[i]nextricably intertwined with the question of regular constitution is the evaluation of the procedures governing the tribunal ... the phrase 'regularly constituted court' ... must be understood to incorporate at least the barest of those trial procedures that have been recognized by customary international law."  Moreover, the phrase "all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable" necessarily incorporates by reference customary rights to due process that constitute a minimum set of due process guarantees under customary international law.  See, e.g., 23 <em>Mich. J. Int'l L.</em> 677, 678 n.9 (2002), cited elsewise in <em>Hamdan</em>; 23 <em>Mich. J. Int'l L.</em> 1, 7 n.15, 12 n.26 (2001).  <br /><br />Justice Stevens rightly recognized that "[m]any of these are described in Article 75 of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions," citing also Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (a treaty of the United States that happens to reflect what the international community now recognizes as a set of minimum due process guarantees under customary human rights law that must be complied with and that is necessarily incorporated by reference in common Article 3).  The minimum guarantees include the right to be tried before a regularly constituted, competent, independent, and impartial court; to be presumed innocent; to counsel of one's choice and to effective representation; to regular and fair procedure, including regular and fair rules of evidence, the right to examine or have examined witnesses against the accused, to be tried without undue delay, and to not be compelled to testify against oneself or to confess guilt; and to review by a competent, independent, and impartial court of law.<br />  <br /> In his concurring opinion in <em>Hamdan</em>, Justice Kennedy emphasized that "[t]he Court is correct to concentrate on one provision of the law of war that is applicable ... Common Article 3."  He then noted that common Article 3 "is part of a treaty the United States has ratified and thus accepted as binding law."  He added: "[b]y Act of Congress, moreover, violations of Common Article 3 are considered 'war crimes,' punishable as federal offenses."  Indeed, every violation of the law of war is a war crime, punishable here or abroad in any country under the principle of universal jurisdiction.  War crimes are also prosecutable in international criminal tribunals that have jurisdiction over particular perpetrators.  A denial of the rights and protections under the Geneva Conventions (such as those expressly set forth or incorporated by reference in common Article 3) is a violation of the Conventions and a violation of the Conventions is a war crime.  <br /><br />Another provision of treaty-based laws of war that also reflects customary international law is quite relevant in this regard.  It is set forth in Article 23(h) of the Annex to the 1907 Hague Convention No. IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which reads: "it is especially forbidden ... [t]o declare abolished, suspended, or inadmissible in a court of law the rights ... of the nationals of the hostile party."  Similarly, as part of the law of war, a violation of the Hague Convention is a war crime. <br /> <br />Members of Congress are thus on notice that minimum due process guarantees under customary international law must not be denied when Congress attempts to articulate what forms of procedure a military commission should adopt.  If members participate in a plan to do so or are complicit in the deprivation of minimum due process guarantees under customary international law incorporated by reference in common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions or any other rights or protections under common Article 3 (e.g., concerning the right to humane treatment even at the hands of CIA interrogators), they would be participating in the denial of rights, protections, and duties under Geneva law.  Such denials are war crimes.  <br /><br />Moreover, "wilfully depriving a protected person of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed in the ... Convention" constitutes a more egregious "grave breach" of Geneva law.  Denial of what the world knows are minimum due process requirements would also resonate against us like the crimes at Abu Ghraib and the Administration's criminal torture memos and authorizations.  <br /><br />War crimes policies and authorizations are not merely a threat to constitutional government and our democracy.  They threaten law and order more generally, violate our common dignity, degrade our military, place our soldiers and CIA personnel in harms way, thwart our mission, and deflate our authority and influence abroad.  They can embolden an enemy, serve as a terrorist recruitment tool, lengthen social violence, and fulfill other terrorist ambitions.  <br /><br />Additionally, Congress should not attempt to provide domestic immunity for criminal violations of rights and protections contained in the Geneva Conventions.  Tin-horn dictatorships attempt such forms of impunity, but the attempt would itself violate several treaties of the United States and (as Marcos, Milosevic, Noriega, Pinochet, various Argentinian generals, and others learned) have no legal effect abroad in foreign or international fora.  Instead, Congress should protect the honor of the United States and maintain the rule of law.<br /><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/paust.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/bransond.php">Douglas Branson</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that recent problems at Hewlett-Packard related to board leaks and their investigation could have been avoided with a little thought and the application of basic corporate governance principles...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/douglasbranson.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n Jim Collins's award winning book about rock solid companies, <em>Built to Last,</em> Hewlett-Packard (H-P) is the paradigm.  In the late 1990s, H-P's board of directors reached out to Lucent Technologies Corp., choosing Carleton Fiorina as H-P's chief executive officer.  For several years, Fiorina was the most powerful and famous business woman in the world.  She criss-crossed the globe in the H-P Gulfstream jet, creating a buzz wherever she went.  It was "all Carly, all of the time."<br /><br /> In January-February, 2005, the H-P board of directors held several meetings and retreats.  The subject was the high profile Carly Fiorina, her refusal to delegate, her reluctance to hire a Chief Operating Officer (CEO), her continued consolidation of power, and H-P's stock price, flat over the 4 years of Fiorina's tenure.  Under pressure, Carlton Fiorina resigned.<br /><br /> During and following all of this, several surprisingly accurate accounts appeared in the press.  The H-P board chair, Patricia Dunn, some say encouraged by advice from H-P's outside counsel, super lawyer Larry Sonsini  (Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich &amp; Rosati, Silicon Valley's leading law firm) set out to find the leaks to the press of the board's deliberations.  Dunn caused the corporation to hire a security firm, which in turn hired a Boston based private detective agency.   They did find the leaks, or most of them, which had come about when a long time director, George Keyworth, had had lunch with a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter.<br /><br /> As with any other board of directors witch-hunt, this one came to no good. A preeminent H-P director, Tom Perkins, founder of Kleiner Perkins, the leading venture capital firm, resigned from the H-P board in May, 2006, as had director George Keyworth, who admitted to the lunch and probable leaks.  Perkins protested the fact of a witch-hunt, and the tactics used, which had included "pretexting."  In pretexting, which is a felony, an investigator assumes another's identity in order to obtain the person's telephone records, in this case Pui-Wing Tam of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and Dawn Kawamoto of CNET News.  Eventually, H-P board chair Patricia Dunn, who had initiated all of this, had to step down as board chair.  The California Attorney General, William Lockyer, went on television to say that felonies had been committed, both within and without the company.  He expressed his intention to prosecute them.<br /><br /> On a more modest level perhaps then criminal prosecutions, this whole mess teaches us several things about corporate governance.<ol><li><strong>Neither Board of Director Deliberations Nor Board Minutes Are Confidential.</strong><br />  <br />Even material, non public investment information (inside information) is not per se confidential.  The law prohibits trading on such information or tipping others to do so.  Communication of such information to persons who will neither trade nor tip is perfectly permissible.<br /><br /> Yet in insider trading prosecutions, SEC and Department of Justice attorneys try to convince juries that what goes on in a corporate board meeting, and is recorded in the minutes, is confidential.  It is only confidential if the presiding officer first extracts a promise of confidentiality from those in attendance, before he or another person imparts the information or the discussion takes place.  For serious matters, a corporation could require each director to sign an NDA (Nondisclosure Agreement), although that may be overkill.<br /><br /> In many corporations, the corporate secretary takes notes at the meeting but turns them over to the firm's lawyer to put in final form as minutes.  Corporate minute books which contain those minutes are stacked atop the filing cabinets in many law firms.  They are not in the safe or otherwise under lock and key.  An enterprising reporter could probably read minutes for an hour before any associate, secretary, or file clerk noticed.  They are not confidential and, rightly or wrongly, they are treated as a ho-hum sort of thing.<br /><br /> <li><strong>Individual Directors Have No Power To Do Anything, Let Alone Initiate Corporate Action.</strong>  <br /><br />Directors are not agents of the corporation.  They cannot bind it to anything (although one older case holds a corporation responsible for an American Express card a director procured in the corporate name).  All corporate power ultimately resides in the board qua board, either seated around a table or all signing a unanimous consents to action proposed.  Directors have their power as members of a collegial group, not as individuals.  So the next time some one poses as a director, saying "I've got a deal for you," walk away, or at least be skeptical.<br /><br /> <li><strong>Chairman of the Board is an Empty Vessel into Which Various Corporations Pour Various Things.</strong>  <br /><br />But pour they must, either by a bylaw provision or by a delegation from the full board of directors.  If the corporation has not outlined duties and responsibilities for the board chair, the holder of that position has no significant powers or status independent of other directors.  At most, they are a bit shy of a first among equals or just another director in many other companies.  No statutes describe the position of board chair.  At many companies, the chair occupies a purely ceremonial or honorary position.   The non executive chair may not even preside at board meetings in companies in which the CEO is wishes to retain that function (presiding).  Many CEOs try to control both the board agenda and the meetings. <br /><br /> At the other end of the spectrum, some sets of bylaws or governance blueprints outline a number of powers and responsibilities for the board chair.  The chair may function as a senior statesperson, or have an avuncular relationship with the CEO.  <br /><br /> Unless there had been a board delegation, Patricia Dunn had no power to do what she did as board chair, let alone as a rank-and-file director.<br /><br /><li><strong>Directors Should Never Spy on or Conduct Any Form of Witch-hunt Regarding Fellow Directors.</strong><br /><br />A board is a group of equals.  At most, the Chair-CEO is a first among those equals.  Ordering commencement of a process that may delve into telephone or other personal records is unseemly and out of place.  If that action may be necessary, then the target should not be on the board of directors in the first place.  I have been in several cases in which directors have tried to sanction fellow directors, mostly for statements to the press, as here.  I suppose that technically they have power to do so but the end result is never any good.<br /><br /> <li><strong>Directors Have No Power To Remove Other Directors So Sanctions and Witch-hunts Tend to Be Idle Gestures, or End Up in Nasty Fights.</strong>  <br /><br />Shareholders elect directors.  Usually, they alone also have power to remove directors, by majority vote and with or without cause.  Most courts hold director attempts to remove fellow directors to be nullities.<br /><br />What then is to be done when a director allegedly has misbehaved?  No witch-hunt, for certain.  No private detective or security firm.  No sanctions.<br />  <br /> Instead, if a critical mass of directors has reason to suspect the honesty or integrity of a fellow board member, they should bite their tongues.  Management should simply
not re-nominate that person for re-election.  Short of re-election, management could seek removal of that director at a special shareholders' meeting called for that purpose but that alternative would cost several hundreds of thousands (a million?) of dollars in a modern publicly held company.  Besides, the offending individual may be around for only up to 11 months.  More likely, they will know when they are not wanted, resigning beforehand.<br /><br /> It is only with a classified, or staggered, board, that more serious problems arise.  State corporation laws permit corporations and their shareholders to divide directors into up to three classes (Nevada allows four), members of each class to serve 2 or 3 year terms, as the case may be, resulting in a classified board.  It is conceivable that, on a classified board, a director the other board members suspect of misconduct may have 35 months left in her term.  In that case, if the target director is a recalcitrant one, a proceeding to remove her from office may be an alternative.</ol>While Hewlett-Packard may be built to last in terms of designing and building high tech products, in corporate governance, H-P, its board chair, counsel and board of directors seem to have a self destructive death wish, one that could have been avoided with a little thought and the application of basic principles.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Douglas M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jamie McKenzie</strong> [<a href="http://nochildleft.com/about.html">Nochildleft.com</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/federal-judge-dismisses-most-counts-of.php">rulings</a> by Judge Kravitz on the case against Secretary Spellings touched not on the substance of the complaints, but largely on matters of jurisdiction, judicial ripeness and timing, as he argued in the first three counts that the dispute between Connecticut and the Secretary needed to move further through administrative  procedures before a district court could intervene.<br /><br />Given the heavy handed and wrong-minded insistence of the Secretary on damaging and underfunded policies like annual multiple choice testing it would be sad to wait until this dispute &#39;ripens&#39; further.  Few states have the courage to face this &quot;ripening&quot; process and its possibly dire consequences. They elect instead to surrender their schools and children to simple-minded policies that violate most good thinking about real educational reform.  Four years into these NCLB change strategies we have seen no real progress in NAEP test results (The National Assessment of Educational Progress).<br /><br />Fortunately, Judge Kravitz in Count IV A&#8212; Denials of Plan Amendments - held open one door wide to his judicial review of the Secretary&#39;s denials of Connecticut&#39;s plan amendments without hearings, finding sufficient ripeness to proceed. The case is far from over.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.throwawaythekey.org"><strong>Michael Paranzino</strong></a> [President, <a href="http://www.throwawaythekey.org">Throw Away The Key</a>]: &quot;North Dakota should bring back the death penalty, and it&#39;s sad that it took the brutal murder of a young woman, Dru Sjodin, by a convicted sex offender, to wake up the state&#39;s lawmakers.  A federal jury in North Dakota has <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/north-dakota-faces-first-execution-in.php">sentenced her killer to death under federal law</a>, despite the state&#39;s not having a death penalty.  This is an emerging trend in death penalty cases:  even in states where lawmakers do not trust their citizens to make this decision in state cases, federal juries in capital cases who hear all the facts are willing to impose death sentences on brutal killers.<br /><br />We already gave her killer, Alfonso Rodriguez Jr., too many chances.  Less than six months after his release from prison, he raped and murdered Sjodin.  Every day he sits in prison watching cable TV and eating ice cream is a further insult to Dru&#39;s memory.  The system egregiously failed to protect Dru Sjodin.  Executing this rapist-murderer will send a healthy signal to the next violent predator in North Dakota that the state is finally going to take murder seriously.&quot;<br />

		<title>&#039;Different spanks for different ranks&#039;: reject the compromise or pardon the Abu Ghraib offenders</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm"><strong>Ben Davis</strong></a> [University of Toledo College of Law]: &quot;There&#39;s an old adage in the military that goes &quot;different spanks for different ranks&quot; (see James W. Smith III, &quot;A Few Good Scapegoats:  The Abu Ghraib Courts-Martial and the Failure of the Military Justice System&quot;, 27 <em>Whittier Law Review</em> 671, 677, 693 (2006)): persons at lower levels in the military receive more severe punishment then those at higher levels.<br /><br />The classic case of this is the Abu Ghraib scandal in which no general or high level civilian authority was court-martialed and Brigadier General Karpinski was given nonjudicial punishment that was specifically said to not relate to the prisoner abuse.  <br /><br />Army Reserve Specialist Charles Graner, Staff Sgt. Ivan Frederick II, Spc. Jeremy Sivits, Spc. Megan Ambuhl, and Army Reserve Pfc Lynndie England were all court-martialed.  They should all be seeking review and a Presidential pardon if the compromise detainee bill is made law.<br /><br />Under the compromise detainee bill, nothing in any of those infamous Abu Ghraib pictures that shocked the world would be prohibited.  The basic rule of the compromise detainee bill is &quot;don&#39;t kill or rape them&quot;.  With the assistance of creative Office of Legal Counsel lawyers that brought us this bill we can expect definitions of &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;cruel, inhuman and degrading&quot; to allow the dogs and everything else.<br /><br />As part of the Program, we can expect the President (in the role of the sole arbiter of Geneva Conventions compliance as foreseen in the bill) to feel comfortable that no technique short of death or rape &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; (the implicit residual standard).  <br /><br />The offenders at Abu Ghraib were held to a different standard - the Uniform Code of Military Justice which embodies the Geneva Conventions.<br /><br />If they did what they were asked to do and Congress now says that we can continue the Program (which appears much worse then what the Abu Ghraib offenders did) then it seems extremely unfair for the Abu Ghraib offenders to be languishing in prison if this is the legislation.<br /><br />At a minimum, the President should pardon all of them so that we do not appear to be hypocritical.  After all, it has been made clear that the torture that has been going on will be allowed to continue as part of &quot;the Program.&quot;  It is patently clear that our domestic law as proposed by this compromise and as expected to be practiced will be in breach of the United States obligations under Common Article 3.<br /><br />Now, if, as we all felt, there remains some revulsion about the Abu Ghraib pictures then it seems to me that whether those acts are done by soldiers or intelligence persons we should object - they are torture no matter what the euphemisms proposed and are &quot;outrages against human dignity&quot;.  And to make that objection clear we should reject this detainee bill compromise.  That is, if we still have consciences that can be shocked.<br /><br />This does not mean we have any sympathy for the detainees like Khalid Sheik Muhammad.  But, what disturbs me is that the manner in which this bill is going forward reminds me of how lynch mobs work - they would torture the person before they burned him.  A structure is being put in place that embraces the kind of unlawful command influence that caused dysfunctional proceedings in World War II.  We had a Vanderbilt Commission which examined those proceedings and that work led to the kinds of adjustments to military law and military commission law embodied in the Uniform Code of Military Justice.<br /><br />A further concern is that the lesson of this is to (1) select lawyers to make fanciful interpretations of the law, (2) as President sign off on orders that are made pursuant to those fanciful interpretations, (3) have members of the military and intelligence community compromise themselves by working under those fanciful interpretations, (4) when it all explodes, prosecute  a few of the low level military under tough UCMJ standards and one civilian contractor (Passarro), (5) for the core employees press Congress to amend the law for &quot;clarity&quot; to protect them (6) and then push Congress to &quot;not look weak&quot; by enshrining in law the procedures based on the original fanciful interpretations.<br /><br />Please note, in the context of international law, this type of process is precisely why the rule has developed that a state can not avail itself of its internal law to extract itself from its international obligations.  Thus, those amateurs of U.S. foreign relations law who may succeed through this compromise in immunizing themselves from domestic court proceedings (and the language as presented does not prevent federal conspiracy or state charges) will not have absolved themselves of individual responsibility as a matter of international criminal law.<br /><br />Clearly, these actors in the Executive and Legislative are willing to take that risk.<br /><br />One possible glimmer is whether Congress delegation of authority to the President here will be considered too broad.  But that would require a challenge in the courts, and that will take some time.  In the meantime, the Program would continue.<br /><br />So reject this compromise or be consistent with the compromise language and pardon the Abu Ghraib offenders.  In other words, demonstrate what we think America stands for.  After all, now we have the pictures.  I hope we would reject the compromise - that&#39;s what America is to me.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/jamescarafano.cfm"a><strong>Dr. James Jay Carafano</strong></a> [Senior Research Fellow, <a href="http://www.heritage.org/">Heritage Foundation</a>]: &quot;When Congress <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/congress-sends-military-commissions.php">passed the law</a> that will govern how terrorist suspects can be tried in military tribunals, they acted just like the Founding Fathers would have wished. They stuck fast to principles, the bedrock of values and beliefs that this nation stands for -- and they compromised on particulars.<br /><br />Three principles were at stake in the debate -- ones that should be used to grade the compromise. Any suitable legislation would have to 1) respect the rule of law, 2) guarantee the basic human rights to the defendants and 3) respect the legitimate national security interests of the United States. By any fair measure of the legislation, Congress did all three.<br /><br />In stipulating the procedures that will be used to interrogate defendants, Congress fulfilled the Supreme Court&#39;s mandate of specifically authorizing the rules for trials. It was Congress&#39;s job to ensure that all the equitable elements of due process, such as the right counsel, were included. Congress did this.<br /><br />Congress also stipulated that these procedures were compliant with Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. This measure was designed to reassure the rest of the world that the United States takes seriously its responsibility to respect the basic human rights of all persons, on and off the battlefield.<br /><br />Finally, Congress ensured that adequate measures were taken to protect legitimate secrets and the &quot;sources and methods&quot; used to obtain them. Some complain that other war crimes trials, such the Nazi Nuremberg trials and the prosecutions of Bosnian war criminals at the Hague, did not allow for &quot;secret&quot; evidence. But there is a significant difference. Those trials didn&#39;t take place during a war when enemies on the battlefield might use the information to their advantage. Under the congressional rules for military commissions, defendants will still be able to know about and challenge evidence -- they just won&#39;t be able to give away America&#39;s secrets. <br /><br />This is a rare example of democracy at its best.&quot;<br />

On the other hand, the legislation contains provisions that make the enforcement of Common Article 3&#39;s humane treatment standards much more difficult and that violate fundamental rights to fair trial and due process. The most serious flaws in the Act include:<ul><li>grant of unprecedented and unchecked authority to the Executive Branch to label as &quot;unlawful enemy combatants&quot; and detain an overly broad range of people, including U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents inside the United States<br /><li>denial of independent judicial review of these detentions<br /><li>provisions that seek to eliminate accountability for past violations of the law<br /><li>admission of evidence obtained through coercion<br /><li>grant to the Secretary of Defense the authority to deviate from time-tested military justice standards for fair trials<br /><li>grants the executive broad discretion to determine the scope of U.S. obligations under the Geneva Conventions, except as to the category of violations known as &quot;grave breaches.&quot;&quot;</ul><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.aclu.org/about/staff/20118prs20050707.html"><strong>Caroline Fredrickson</strong></a> [Director, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/natsec/gen/26861leg20060925.html">ACLU Washington Legislative Office</a>]: &quot;Last week, the House and Senate <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/senate-passes-military-commissions.php">adopted S.3930</a>, the Military Commissions Act of 2006.  In doing so, lawmakers removed important checks on the president, failed to protect due process, eliminated habeas corpus for many detainees, undermined enforcement of the Geneva Conventions and gave a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot; to senior officials who authorized or ordered illegal torture and abuse.  President Bush is expected to sign the legislation soon &#8212; in time for a nice photo opportunity that can be used by Republicans as they try to hold on to their majority in Congress.<br /><br />In their effort to get something passed before the busy election season, lawmakers have passed a flawed bill.  Here are just some of the problems with the bill:<ul><li>It gives the president license to weaken enforcement of the basic protections in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, that prohibit torture and abuse. <br /><li>The president has new power to decide much of the scope of authorized conduct  and the severity of punishment, giving him unparalleled power to unilaterally determine whether the government can carry out cruelty and abuse.<br /><li>It undermines the American value of due process by permitting convictions based on evidence literally beaten out of a witness or obtained through other abuse by either our government or other countries. <br /><li>Government officials who authorized or ordered illegal acts of torture and abuse would receive retroactive immunity for many of these acts, providing a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card that is backdated nine years. <br /><li>The &quot;Great Writ&quot; of habeas corpus is severely undermined, leaving those detained indefinitely without charge with no meaningful opportunity to assert their innocence.</ul>This bill will be signed into law by the president.  We can only hope that, as Senator Arlen Specter noted, the courts will &quot;sort out&quot; the unconstitutional provisions of the law, and that a future Congress, without the pressure of a pending election, will reconsider the issue to create a system consistent with American values.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.pillsburylaw.com/bv/bvisapi.dll/portal/ep/profDetail.do?bio=50348"><strong>David Cynamon</strong></a> [partner, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman; <a href="http://www.kuwaitifreedom.org/index.php">Project Kuwaiti Freedom</a>]: &quot;I represent the four remaining Kuwaiti detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, captured in Pakistan by bounty hunters and sold to the US government.  Before being sold, these captives, who were charity workers, were not given any hearing or the benefit of any investigation.  They simply were turned over for the cash payment. Then, without any hearing, the US government transported them to Guantanamo, where they  remain today after over 1,700 days of captivity -- again without any due process.<br /><br />Our system of justice was founded on the belief that no one should be imprisoned without a fair hearing to determine whether there is a basis to imprison them - and that they are innocent till proven guilty. These are fundamental legal rights granted to us in our Constitution, first recognized in English law as a result of the Magna Carta in England over 500 years ago.  These rights apply to all human beings, not just American citizens, particularly where in this case the captives were kidnapped and transported to the US in bondage. In spite of these elementary rights, my clients&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and hundreds of other captives&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;have been denied the right to a fair hearing with basic due process to challenge their imprisonment.<br /><br />Therefore, Congress&#39; recent <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/congress-sends-military-commissions.php">passage of a bill</a> that strips detainees of their right to Habeas Corpus is a shameful contradiction of some of our country&#39;s founding basic principles. If the United States is going to win the war on terror, it is crucial that we, as a country, maintain our moral authority over our enemies and practice what we preach.  Congress&#39; actions last week falls so far short in respecting these basic rights that I fear it will be a day of lasting dishonor for America.<br /><br />While we are confident that the Supreme Court, if necessary, will again confirm and preserve these fundamental due process rights, that is a distant consolation to my clients, who have been isolated from their families for over five years in this endless legal limbo never, never land.<br /><br />After all this time, why is it that the Bush administration still does not trust America&#39;s judicial system to distinguish the innocent from the guilty?&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bill Goodman</strong> [Legal Director, <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>]: &quot;The Center for Constitutional Rights is aggressively challenging the appalling Military Commissions Act (MCA) <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/congress-sends-military-commissions.php">passed by Congress last week</a>. Our allies have already contributed cogent analyses of some of the dangers posed by the MCA: its unprecedented and expansive suspension of habeas corpus, its retroactive amnesty for U.S. military and intelligence officials who have tortured detainees, its distortion of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, not to mention the willful surrender of the authority of Congress to check the worst excesses of the President. <br /><br />To develop this critique further, we think it&#39;s important to draw attention to three elements of the bill in greater detail.<UL><LI>Under the MCA &#39;unlawful enemy combatant&#39; (UEC) is broadly defined as a person who has:<ol><br /><li>&quot;engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States&quot; or its allies, or <br /><li>been deemed an enemy combatant by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal or &quot;another competent tribunal&quot; established by the President or the Secretary of Defense.</ol><br />The first definition is so sweeping that it could be read to include anyone who has donated money to a charity for orphans in Afghanistan that turns out to have some connection to the Taliban or a person organizing an anti-war protest in Washington, D.C. The second definition could supersede the first  entirely, granting the President shockingly wide latitude to declare anyone a UEC.<br /><br /><li>Habeas corpus is suspended for any non-citizen who is &quot;detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.&quot; Habeas corpus, or the Great Writ, grants the accused the right to challenge their detention in a court of law. The jurisdiction-stripping provision in the MCA threatens to institutionalize racial profiling (such as the immigrant detention sweeps that followed the terrorist attacks of September 11) even as it denies our clients at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, most of whom have long since lost hope of a &quot;speedy trial,&quot; any hope of challenging their detention in court.<br /><br /><li>Rape would no longer qualify as torture unless the intent of the rapist to torture his victim could be proven. This regressive definition has been repeatedly rejected internationally. The MCA also narrowly defines coercion and sexual abuse, effectively making many of the crimes perpetrated at Abu Ghraib legal.</ul>Just prior to the enactment of the MCA, CCR filed a petition for habeas relief on behalf of 25 detainees held at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan, as well as another petition on behalf of Majid Khan, one of the men recently transferred by President Bush from a secret CIA prison to Guant&aacute;namo Bay. These cases will present the first new challenges to the constitutionality of the suspension of habeas corpus under the MCA, the most ominous and far reaching threat to our civil liberties by this Administration yet.&quot;<br />

Our national psyche is a desire to help those in need. That need to serve our fellow citizens and mankind is strong in most Americans.<br /><br />The double blow of the hurricanes Katrina and Rita highlighted several things last year.  First is that our federal, state, and local responders were not ready.  Secondly, the responders had no clear chain of command with major communication problems; and third, Americans wanted to respond in any way they could to help&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;they wanted to serve their country and help their fellow citizens.<br /><br />There is a close and hard look ongoing at all levels at this failure so we can fix the response system.  This ongoing evaluation and review should also look at how best we can provide needed relief efficiently, effectively, as well as fast. I'm not sure it is being given the attention it is due.  <br /><br />Related to this is how do we tap into the vast positive energy of Americans, from all over this country, wanting to assist in a way that is responsive and helpful? In my mind, it is establishing a Public Assistance Service of America (PAS) under an independent and revamped/renamed Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).<br /><br />Fashioned along the lines of our militia, our national guard, the PAS would be a corps of trained citizens who would mobilize to deal with man-made or natural disasters under a centralized chain of command with appropriate contingency plans and pre-positioned logistic points.<br /><br />Placed under FEMA, the PAS would be grouped by regions and districts answerable to a career cadre of experienced leaders, managers, and specialists.  They would go through an initial basic training at centralized training centers, then be assigned back to their districts to train one weekend per month and two weeks in the summer to prepare for whatever disaster befalls the district or region.  <br /><br />The members of the PAS would be paid appropriately for their drills and be eligible to retire at the age of 65, drawing a pension. When called-up, a member of the PAS would be paid an appropriate wage under government personnel rules.  The National Guard has a similar system, as does our Reserves.  <br /><br />The PAS would be the domestic responders, trained, equipped, and ready.  As the situation and circumstances dictate, further assets could be drawn upon under the PAS to assist with manpower, equipment, security, and logistics.  The chain of command would be the director of the PAS under the FEMA director.  The regional directors would have onsite command over all assets, federal, state, and local once the PAS was called-up, along with private charitable organizations.  The various States would remain the primary responders until they requested the federal government to step in and take over the scene.  It must be noted; under our constitutional system the States have the primary responsibility to provide disaster relief. The PAS would be the federal responders to assist State and local authorities and would free up federal troops and our reserves for their primary mission of defending the United States.  <br /><br />We should, also, consider pulling FEMA out from under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  Let DHS protect the homeland and its borders.  FEMA and its PAS can take care of the interior challenges of various disasters.  The FEMA director should be appointed by the President, with the consent of the Senate, and serve for a period of 9 years. My suggestion is to get the emergency management system out of politics.  The disaster of Katrina showed how politics and emergency management do not mix.  Lives were lost because of politics and inefficiency.<br /><br />The time to fix the system is now.  An independent FEMA, with its Public Assistance Service, made up of trained and motivated Americans from all walks of life and backgrounds is a possible solution.  I'm ready to sign up.<br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

		<title>Don&#039;t Outsource Your Conscience: Lessons in Corporate Truth</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=35">Nancy Rapoport</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that the recent spate of guilty verdicts and stiff sentences handed out for corporate fraud committed by the erstwhile leaders of Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia and other companies suggests that executives need to take personal responsibility for the propriety of their deals, and shouldn&#39;t &quot;outsource&quot; their ethical judgment to others...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/nancyrapoport.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>G</strong></font>uilty, guilty, guilty.  Enron's Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling were both found guilty of conspiracy, securities fraud, and various false statements earlier this year.  Since Enron's fraud was uncovered, various high-profile employees of companies from WorldCom to Dynegy to Tyco (and so on) have likewise received guilty verdicts and are either serving time or awaiting sentencing.<br /><br />In the last few days, three significant sentences have made the news.  Dynegy's Jamie Olis was re-sentenced to six years (down from the original 24) for his role in inflating Dynegy's cash flows.  Bernie Ebbers pulled into prison yesterday in his Mercedes to begin serving his 25-year sentence.  And also yesterday Andy Fastow received six years (down from the agreed-upon 10-year term that was part of his plea-bargain) for his role in the chutzpah-laden Enron frauds.  <br /><br />Not too long ago, Tyco International's Dennis Kozlowski received an Ebbers-like 25 year sentence, and John Rigas of Adelphia Communications received a 15-year sentence.  On the other side of the government's win-loss record are Richard Scrushy and the dearly(?) departed Arthur Andersen accounting firm.  <br /><br />Different stories, different types of frauds, different sentences.  What can we learn from the sentencing thus far?<br /><br /><strong>Lesson one:  timing is everything.</strong>  Olis had originally received a mind-boggling 24 years in prison for participating in Project Alpha, a scheme that had overstated Dynegy's cash flows.  Then the U.S. Supreme Court, in <em>U.S. v. Booker</em>, ruled that the sentencing guidelines were just that &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; guidelines &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; rather than mandatory rules.  As a consequence of the Supreme Court's ruling, the Fifth Circuit reversed Olis's sentence, and on resentencing, the district court gave Olis a sentence of 6 years.  Mind you, Olis is not serving "easy time," if such a thing even exists.  Before his resentencing, Olis was moved from a minimum-security prison to a medium-security one.  I'm sure that the fact that Fastow&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;who masterminded much of Enron's dirty deals&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;received the same sentence that Olis did.  And Olis wasn't the mastermind of Dynegy's Project Alpha.<br /><br /><strong>Lesson two:  remorse matters.</strong>  David Delainey of Enron was sentenced last week to 2&Acirc;&frac12; years in prison for his insider trading.  That sentence reflected his cooperation with the prosecution and, perhaps, a genuine remorse for his role in Enron's schemes.  Andy Fastow cooperated with the Enron prosecution team, and he is cooperating with the plaintiffs in the shareholder suits.  Fastow apparently demonstrated, to the district court's satisfaction, that he was truly a changed man by the time his sentencing date came around.  (One of the tragedies of Ken Lay's death was that he was never able to live long enough to answer the question of whether he, too, would have reformed himself over time.)<br /><br /><strong>Lesson three: symbols speak volumes.</strong>  Many months before Ebbers drove himself to prison in his luxury car, Martha Stewart carried a Herm&Atilde;&copy;s bag into her jury trial.  Although Stewart went to prison for a relatively minor transaction, she might have avoided some jail time by remembering that few jurors own a  handmade handbag that takes years to acquire (from a multi-year waiting list).  <br /><br /><strong>Lesson four:  outsource your conscience to other professionals at your own risk.</strong>  Skilling has every right to be nervous about his own upcoming sentencing on October 23.  Although Lay and Skilling both pointed fingers all over the place in their defense, the judge and the jury found that both of them knew darn well what they were doing when they approved the Enron frauds.  And that's one of the most important lessons to come out of all of these corporate fraud cases:  no matter how many people say that something's ok, you still have to think for yourself.<br /><br />Olis's testimony at the resentencing illustrates the theme of the sentences:<blockquote>Olis said as he worked on the 2001 transaction at the heart of his fraud conviction, Project Alpha, he believed his bosses at Dynegy determined it was proper and legal. "I trusted their judgment," Olis said. "Now I look back and I should have questioned everything, but I didn't. And here I am." [Tom Fowler, <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/biz/4185728.html">Ex-accountant says he regrets some 'got hurt': Olis insists he's 'not a bad person' despite conviction</a>, <em>Houston Chronicle</em>, Sept. 14, 2006]</blockquote>Irony of ironies, Enron's advertising campaign, pre-scandal, was "ask why?"  But few people did.  <br /><br /> There has to be a middle ground between asking "why" about every possible order from above and not asking "why" when something is clearly fishy.  But where should we draw the line?  The jurors in Enron drew the line very close to, if not on top of, the "clearly fishy" part of the continuum.  I didn't review any of the evidence in the Olis case, so I don't know where on that continuum Olis's case falls, but my guess is that the intentional manipulation of cash flows to present a healthier financial picture is closer to the "fishy" line than to the "clearly ok" line.  <br /><br />The lesson from these sentences in the various corporate scandals is not, therefore, to ask why on every deal, even the most clearly legitimate one.  The lesson is to ask why something feels fishy when those first tiny quivers of "uh-oh" start vibrating in the pits of our stomachs.  No matter how many people assured Lay and Skilling (and Olis and Fastow and Ebbers and Koslowski) that the deals were on the "light grey" side of a black-and-white ethical line, they should have thought for themselves as well.  These executives allowed others to bless the fishy (or outright illegal) deals.  And that's why they're serving time.  Maybe their consciences bothered them in proposing the deals; maybe not.  Had they asked themselves why &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; why they needed to hide losses, why they needed to manage cash flows&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;they might have looked more closely at why their businesses were failing.  Asking why is important.<br /><br /><strong>Lesson five: you may never know when to ask why.</strong>  Knowing when to ask why is easier said than done.  Stanley Milgram's famous experiment, in which the experimental subject shocked to the death a complete stranger because the "scientist" took all responsibility, shows that humans are very, very good about fooling themselves.  Milgram's theories about cognitive dissonance &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the inability of anyone to maintain competing moral views about himself&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;form part of the explanation of what went wrong with all of these corporations.  So are Solomon Asch's social-pressure experiments, in which the subject was willing to agree that an identical line was, in fact, not identical, as long as everyone else in the room said that the line was not identical as well.  Social pressure, cognitive dissonance, the diffusion of responsibility ("someone else will fix the problem") &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; all of these theories help to explain how such large-scale, clearly fishy cor
porate frauds occurred.  All of us are, at some level, superb at creating rationalizations for our clearly immoral behavior.  I'm not immune.  Neither is anyone else.  The smartest people in the room are often so smart that they can fool themselves with clever rationalizations.  And they can fool others, at least for a time.  But outsourcing one's conscience is, in the end, a very foolish thing to do.<br /><br /><br /><em>Nancy Rapoport is professor of law at the University of Houston Law Center</em><br />

My focus, however, is not on the sections that have so far been the subject of great discussion (classified information, common article 3, habeas corpus, offenses, etc.) but rather on what the compromise drafters are trying to do overall.<br /><br />It appears that what is going on here is broader than what I have seen described.  The compromise drafters appear to be decoupling these military commissions from international law, from domestic courts-martial, from other types of traditional military commissions, from any other law.  These alien unlawful enemy combatants, these human beings, are in fact being decoupled from &quot;all the laws but one,&quot; in the words of President Lincoln.  The power of this effort should not be underestimated because as the lone superpower, the act does no less than push out to the world a state practice that would bring us back to pre-Geneva Convention standards for these people, worthy of only &quot;special process&quot;.<br /><br />From this view, these individuals have committed such heinous crimes that their process and punishment should be in a carefully controlled hermetically sealed environment that should not contaminate any other procedures that might impact more &quot;deserving&quot; characters.  In the 18 sections below I examine the provisions that struck me that - taken as a whole - give us the outline (if we wish to look) of this &quot;special process&quot;.  We must remember that this special process is being created using all the ordinary words we have seen before.  That is in one sense the genius of this effort.  By carefully pulling together points strewn in many places including <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>, words that are familiar are able to create a unfamiliar &quot;special process&quot;. <br /><br />For this special process, this group of human beings is segregated from the rest of mankind.  They are segregated and by that segregation they are declared a different type of human being.  Based on the responses of Republicans and Democrats, the American Congress, the President and by extension all the American people are willing to have these people declared as different.  Moreover, the United States Government is willing to have these rules applied to aliens and in that sense is making a statement to all countries who might seek to invoke diplomatic protection for these non-Americans.  Those countries must now consider (&quot;are you with us or against us?&quot;) whether their countrymen are truly a different type of human being such that they will acquiesce in the American determination of segregation.<br /><br />This, I would suggest, is the essence of the decision that is going to be made this week by this Congress on this legislation.  Is America going to declare certain human beings beyond &quot;all the laws but one&quot; depriving them of common levels of human dignity?  This type of separation resonates in American history at many points - in the Constitution in its treatment of slaves, in the reservations for Native Americans, in the exclusion of Asians, in the status of women.  It resonates in other countries&#39; histories also, such as in the Black Codes in France, the treatment of Algerians by the French and the laws for the overseas territories, the time of apartheid in South Africa, and the Nuremberg Laws in Nazi Germany.  These are only some examples and others can think of more ancient historical references (such as who was a citizen of Athens in the days of its empire).<br /><br />It points a question mark at the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rest of the International Bill of Rights. We are asked to think that this might only be for the current &quot;difficulties&quot;  but the legislation does not have any sunset provision.  A permanent track is created and any Congressperson or Senator who might seek to amend it in the future is likely to be immediately excoriated for being &quot;soft on terror&quot;.  Much power is centered in the President and the unitary executive in the implementation of the process with extremely limited judicial review.<br /><br />This is what bothers me greatly.  For on every occasion I can remember where this kind of special process occurs there is a person who stands up in front of the all powerful in that process and asserts his human dignity. A person like David Wainapel, the late husband of a late friend who challenged a Nazi camp commander in the center of his concentration camp.  David Wainapel was considered by that special process as a non-human, but David asserted his humanity.  I suspect that these alien unlawful enemy combatants and their lawyers will assert their humanity in front of this special process and the question will be whether we are capable of seeing that humanity (which is to see the evil of which we are each capable for those of them who are guilty) and whether we deny what we are capable of by denying their humanity.  And by that denial, I fear we produce an abomination in our lust to end the presence of these persons.  In a sense, their victory will have been complete in having us put such effort in creating such a special process for them.  We give them their status by our treatment of them - the strangest aspect of all this.<br /><br />Something deep in the American soul was stirred by the 9/11 events.  Something that reminds me personally of what one sees in the eyes of lynch mobs in the old pictures.  Except, now those standing are not exclusively white but are a rainbow coalition to ban certain aliens from the benefits of human dignity.  There is a coldness to the hate.  There is a precision to the process of destroying these persons.  There is a determination and an exquisite intelligence with which this is done - through processes that are oh so democratic.<br /><br />Those pushing this special process have so much power to sway us.  All politicians are afraid if they stand against this that millions of dollars will come raining down on them from &quot;the other side&quot; (Republican or Democrat) for being &quot;soft on terror&quot;.  Persons of great stature have bought into this compromise (McCain et al) giving psychic cover for those to vote for this language.  The rest of the world could make an outcry but one feels that the efforts so far are perfunctory - half-hearted - maybe because the rest of the world wants this special process to develop that they can apply to their special group.<br /><br />It might be possible for some lone Senator or some lone Congressperson to stand up and say &quot;This is too much for mankind.  We have fought too long to not create these kinds of special processes.&quot;  We await that champion of human dignity in all its frailness.  My fear is that there is no one.<br /><br />Below is my analysis by section of the 94 pages of the <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/military_commissions_bill_1.pdf">latest draft</a> of the Military Commissions Act of 2006. Initial page references are to the pages in that draft. The titles offered in association with the Roman numerals are my own. <br /><br /><br /><strong>I. Humans covered</strong><br /><br />(pages 5-6) Sec 948(a), US Code Title 10, Subti
tle A, Chapter 47A<br /> <br />Definitions<br /><br />A. Compromise proposed language<br /><br />&quot;(3)  Lawful Enemy Combatant:  The term &#39;lawful enemy combatant&#39; means an individual who is -<br /><br />&quot;(A) a member of the regular forces of a State party engaged in hostilities against the United States;<br /><br />(B) a member of a militia, volunteer corps, or organized resistance movement belonging to a State party engaged in such hostilities, which are under responsible command, wear a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance, carry their arms openly, and abide by the law of war, or<br /><br />(C) a member of a regular armed force who professes allegiance to a government engaged in such hostilities, but not recognized by the United States.<br /><br />(4) Unlawful Enemy Combatant.-The term &quot;unlawful enemy combatant&quot; means an individual engaged in hostilities against the  United States who is not a lawful enemy combatant.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong> The definition of Lawful Enemy Combatant diverges substantially from the Geneva Convention III Article 4 (for example, &quot;regular forces&quot; vs &quot;armed forces&quot;) definitions for a Prisoner of War, thus restricting the domestic law position as to the applicability of the Geneva Convention to covered groups. The effect is to return to a pre-Geneva Conventions standard of the kind described by Justice Thomas in his dissent in <em>Hamdan</em>, and implicitly the harsh treatment accorded such persons pre-1949.<br /><br /><br /><strong>II. Relation to the Uniform Code of Military Justice</strong><br /><br />(pages 6-7) Section 948(b) generally<br /><br />(b) Construction of Provisions.- The procedures for military commissions set forth in this chapter are based upon the procedures for trial by general courts-martial under chapter 47 of this title (the Uniform Code of Military Justice).  Chapter 47 of this titles does not by its terms, apply to trial by military commission except as specifically provided therein or in this chapter, and many of the provisions of chapter 47 of the title are by their terms inapplicable to military commissions.  The judicial construction and application of chapter 47 of this title is therefore not binding on military commissions established under this chapter.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong> The language appears to try to be limiting the effect of the Section 836(a) and (b) language as interpreted in <em>Hamdan</em> on subjective practicability and objective uniformity by reducing reference to the rest of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (See Section XIV below).  Some specific exclusions  810 (speedy trial), 831(a)(b) and (d) (compulsory self-incrimination), and 832 (pretrial investigation) are made.<br /><br /><br /><strong>III.  Decoupling alien unlawful enemy combatant military commissions from courts-martial</strong> <br /><br />(page 8) Section 948(c)<br /><br />&quot;TREATMENT OF RULINGS AND PRECEDENTS.- The findings, holdings, interpretations, and other precedents of military commissions under this chapter may not be introduced or considered in any hearing, trial, or other proceeding of a court-martial convened under chapter 47 of this title.  The findings, holdings, interpretations, and other precedents of military commissions under this chapter may not form the basis of any holding, decision, or other determination of a court-martial convened under this chapter.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong> This next section makes all the acts in these military commissions inadmissible in court-martials.  Thus, if there is proof of extremely harsh treatment in the military commission and findings are made, those are excluded from court-martial proceeding.  Similarly every procedural determination would be disconnected from courts-martial.  The goal appears to be to avoid &quot;contamination&quot; of the court-martial process by the actions in these military commissions and to create this hermetically sealed separate track for alien unlawful enemy combatants.  Without that link, these military commissions can evolve in a manner that will likely work against the defendant.  If there was no disconnection like this, then those making decisions might be concerned about the effect of decisions on American military in courts-martial.  That structural constraint is removed by this language.  This leaves a great risk of procedures evolving away from the experience of the past 50 years under the UCMJ toward what might be called &quot;kangaroo courts&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><strong>IV. Common Article 3 compliance</strong><br /><br />(pages 7-8) Section 948(b)<br /><br />(d)  Status of Military Commission Under Common Article 3.- A military commission established under this chapter is a regularly constituted court, affording all the necessary &#39;judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples&#39; for purposes of common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong> This section asserts that military commissions meet the international standard of Common Article 3.  Whether in fact these military commissions do meet that international standard will be a question for possible subsequent review by the Supreme Court and/or international tribunals.  While not redefining Common Article 3 per se, this language is a domestic law push at Common Article 3 saying the U.S. foreign relations law understanding of what is needed under Common Article 3 in this area will control.  One difficulty is the extent that what is permitted in this law violates Common Article 3 in terms of detainee treatment, would effect significantly the actual &quot;regularly constituted&quot; nature of these tribunals.  If &quot;regular&quot; means only &quot;properly&quot;  (Alito dissent in <em>Hamdan</em>) as opposed to meaning also &quot;fairness&quot;   (implicit in the Kennedy concurrence in Hamdan and seems what Common Article 3 is expressing) these provisions may not meet the international standard of Common Article 3 (especially as they are decoupled from the Uniform Code of Military Justice procedure which seeks to meet that and possibly more).<br /><br /><br /><strong>V. Stripping of Geneva Convention rights in military commissions</strong><br /><br />(page 8) Section 948 (b)<br /><br />(f) GENEVA CONVENTIONS NOT ESTABLISHING SOURCE OF RIGHTS.- No alien enemy unlawful combatant subject to trial by military commission under this chapter may invoke the Geneva Conventions as a souce of rights at his trial by military commission.<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong> Coupled with the language asserting this military commission meets the Common Article 3 standard (see IV), this language purports to deny the alien unlawful enemy combatant the ability to assert in the military commission Geneva Convention rights including the Common Article 3.  So the disconnection from the court-martial track is further enhanced by trying to decouple the ability to argue of the alien unlawful enemy combatant from the Geneva Conventions.  Without grounding in the Uniform Code of Military Justice or in the Geneva Conventions, the alien unlawful enemy combatant appears only able to assert grounds within this self-contained military commission structure here created - at least that seems to be the intent.  It is a kind of isolation of the military commission from the rest of the statutory and international law structure which underpins <em>Hamdan</em>.<br /><br />Moreover, given the difference between the definition of lawful enemy combatant and the Prisoner of War in the Geneva Conventions III earlier in the document (see Section I above), some of the persons in this hermetically sealed military commission structure are persons who would form some of the Prisoners of War under the Geneva Convention III Article 4 definitions which do not track with the definitions in this legislation.  This suggests two types of treatment for Geneva Convention III Article 4-compliant individuals who one would expect would be in the same procedures.<br /><br /><br /><strong>VI.  Two track issue again - person
s</strong><br /><br />(page 8)  Section 948c  <br /><br />Any alien unlawful enemy combatant engaged in hostilities or having supported hostilities against the United States is subject to trial by military commission as set forth in this chapter.<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong> The two track issue for Geneva Convention III Article 4 POW compliant persons arises again with Section 948c.<br /><br /><br /><strong>VII.  Two track issue again - jurisdiction and how far back</strong><br /><br />(page 9) Section 948d. Jurisdiction of military commissions<br /><br />(a) jurisdiction is over &quot;alien unlawful enemy combatant before, on, or after September 11, 2001&quot;. <br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong> This means that military commissions might be applied for anytime in the past and anytime in the future.  In the wrong hands, this could mean a very expansive use of military commission structures on aliens.<br /><br /><br /><strong>VIII.  Two track issue again - lawful enemy combatants subject to court martial proceedings for offenses punishable under the military commission chapter</strong><br /><br />(page 9)&quot;(b) Lawful Enemy Combatants - Military commissions under this chapter shall not have jurisdiction over lawful enemy combatants.  Lawful enemy combatants who violate the law of war are subject to chapter 47 of this title.  Courts-martial established under that chapter shall have jurisdiction to try a lawful enemy combatant for any offense made punishable under this chapter.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong> Together with the problem of the Geneva Convention III Article 4 POW split between &quot;alien unlawful enemy combatant&quot; and &quot;lawful enemy combatant&quot; this language seems to say the offenses in the current chapter as opposed to the UCMJ will apply to lawful enemy combatants.  To the extent - given the disconnection above - the offenses in this section also end up being disconnected from the Uniform Code of Military Justice there is an interpretation here that even lawful enemy combatants might be subject to courts-martial operating on punishments completely different from those of American soldiers (and others so defined) subject to the punishments in the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  It is the use of the word &quot;this&quot; as opposed to &quot;that&quot; in the next to last sentence above that could create such a situation which would appear to be an anomaly.<br /><br />The solution or further problem may be in the next section, to wit:<br /><br />(page 9) &quot;(c) Punishments.-A military commission under this chapter may, under such limitations as the President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by this chapter, including the penalty of death when authorized under this chapter, chapter 47 of this title, or the law of war.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong> One could imagine the President limiting to the military commissions certain types of punishments which would not be punishments that American soldiers would be subject to under the courts-martial jurisdiction but for which - based on the above language, the alien unlawful enemy combatants (in military commissions) AND lawful enemy combatants (in courts-martial) would be subject.  This seems to be a carve out for &quot;lawful enemy combatants&quot; too.  So really there are three tiers - alien unlawful enemy combatants in military commissions, American soldiers in the courts-martial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and &quot;lawful enemy combatants&quot; who can be switched in courts-martial to punishments triable in military commission OR courts-martial at the President&#39;s discretion.  This seems to come back to that two-track issue and compliance with the standards of Geneva Convention III Common Article 3 and consistency in treatment of Geneva Convention III Article 4 defined POW status in any event.<br /><br /><br /><strong>IX.  Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 - &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; two track integration</strong><br /><br />Section 948r. Compulsory self-incrimination prohibited; statements obtained by torture or other methods of coercion<br /><br />(page 18)&quot;(a) IN GENERAL.- No person shall be required to testify against himself at a proceeding of a military commission under this chapter.<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  This first language appears to be non-controversial.  One must keep in mind that the silence of Moussaoui in questioning was used against him, notwithstanding his right against self-incrimination.  So one does not know whether that tactic will be used in these military commissions to the same effect.<br /><br />(page 18) (b) STATEMENTS OBTAINED BY TORTURE.-A statement obtained by use of torture shall not be admissible in a military commission under this chapter, except against a person accused of torture as evidence the statement was made.<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  &quot;statement obtained by use of torture&quot; troubles me in the context of extraordinary renditions and torture by third parties.  The persons in the military commission may assert that no torture was used and one can carefully make sure that there are sufficient filters so that the prosecutor in the military commission can state that in good faith.  I am not sure if the &quot;obtained by use&quot; term will be interpreted to mean US persons or will include situations with foreign countries.  One wonders also to what extent the state secrets type doctrine will be brought into play in this type of setting.  It seems it would it be better to just say &quot;obtained by torture&quot; which has the nice effect of forcing us back to the statement receiving event rather than who used it (if - a big if here - one were trying to prevent statements obtained by torture from being introduced).  It is curious that the &quot;use of&quot; language is not in the title.  I suspect some wiggle room is being placed here due to the practices that have been used over the past several years.  A reference to a definition of torture is not made here.  There is a definition later in the punishments but this also seems to be a source of wiggle-room (See discussion at Section XIII).<br /><br />(pages 18-19) (c) STATEMENTS OBTAINED BEFORE ENACTMENT OF DETAINEE TREATMENT ACT OF 2005.-A statement obtained before December 30, 2005 (the date of the enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005), in which the degree of coercion is disputed may be admitted only if the military judge finds that-<br />&quot;(1) the totality of circumstances render is reliable and possessing sufficient probative value; and<br />(2) the interest of justice would best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  Pre-December 30, 2005 statements are subject to a very low standard for admissibility.  The totality of circumstances standard leaves enormous discretion to the judge and the interest of justice standard also does that.  Given the way politicians use the term &quot;justice&quot; in a manner that sounds like &quot;death penalty&quot; and that kind of indirect command influence being very likely as these military commissions go forward it seems probable that statements retrieved even under the most egregious types of pre-December 30, 2005 standards can be allowed in under this language.  The separation of the military commissions from the courts-martial and the alien unlawful enemy combatant and lawful enemy combatant distinctions discussed above also make it very possible that divergent determinations on practices will be made in inconsistent manners across the cases.  I question also whether this procedure meets the international standard of Common Article 3 given the wide discretion being admitted here.  Clearly, a statement from &quot;torture lite&quot; that is accepted as a matter of domestic law under the &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; standard of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005  but reprehensible as a matter of international law is very likely to be admitted.  In this sense, as I proceed through this text I begin to feel that this is really becoming a kangar
oo court.  It also appears that this language is there to solve the problem created by the fanciful interpretation of early 2002 on detainee treatment, the presidential order of February 7, 2002 enshrining that approach, the acts of military and intelligence persons in contravention of international standards pre- December 30, 2005 (and pre-<em>Hamdan</em>) - including the actions in the secret prisons and extraordinary renditions.  Arguably, the law that was applicable during the pre-Hamdan period 2001-2006 was <em>Hamdan</em> but that standard was intentionally subverted.  The approach to detainee treatment taken (&quot;new paradigm thinking&quot;) deviated from the 50 year approach of the United States.  In particular the idea of the United States reservation to the Convention Against Torture and Cruel Inhuman and Degrading Treatment on &quot;cruel inhuman and degrading treatment&quot; resolving to a United States constitutional standard (&quot;shocks the conscience&quot;), BUT that being considered as geographically limiting the United States obligation to the United States  (notwithstanding the testimony of persons who actually negotiated the treaty) is the kind of fanciful permissive interpretations that permitted low standards for seeking statements.  And those low or no standards statements are being allowed in through this section of the act.  This section is shameful and a disgrace to America.  The next section makes the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 standard apply also but it has its issues.  See below.<br /><br />(page 19) (d) STATEMENTS OBTAINED AFTER ENACTMENT OF DETAINEE TREATMENT OF 2005.- A statement obtained on or after December 30, 2005 (the date of the enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005), in which the degree of coercion is disputed may be admitted only if the military judge finds that_<br />&quot;(1) the totality of circumstances renders it reliable and possessing sufficient probative value;<br />(2) the interests of justice would best be served by admission of the statement into evidence; and<br />(3) the interrogation methods used to obtain the statement do not violate the cruel, unusual or inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth, and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  In contrast to the previous section, where no floor other than the discretion of the military judge was set, this section includes the &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; domestic law standard as the floor for evidence. Several difficulties are (1) whether the &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; standard meets international standards, (2) the different tracks for alien unlawful enemy combatants and lawful enemy combatants in the contexts of this act (the Geneva Convention definitional problem discussed above again), (3) the decoupling from other types of procedures, and (4) the hermetically sealed nature of these procedures suggests.  Taken together, the standard used here may be evolved away from that used in other types of tribunals in a suspect manner.<br /><br /><br /><strong>X. Structuring of the procedure before the military judge</strong><br /><br />(pages 20-45) see the text<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  The military judge&#39;s role described appears to have a structural preference to protect classified information and sources, methods and activities even if that might cause unfairness.  I believe many have commented on this and reference can be made to those writings (Marty Lederman at <em>Balkinization</em> in particular).<br /><br /><br /><strong>XI.  Execution of confinement</strong><br /><br />A. Where one can be held<br /><br />(Page 48) Section 949u. Execution of confinement<br />(a) IN GENERAL.-Under such regulations as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe, a sentence of confinement adjudged by a military commission under this chapter may be carried into execution by confinement -<br />&quot;(1) in an place of confinement under the control of any of the armed forces; or<br />(2) in any penal or correctional institution under the control of the United States or its allies, or which the United States may be allowed to use.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  This language allows for the return of an individual to overseas settings not under the control of the United States.  Thus secret prisons and sites of extraordinary rendition may be used as places of confinement.<br /><br />B. What are the standards for being held?<br /><br />(page 48)<br />(b) TREATMENT DURING CONFINEMENT BY OTHER THAN THE ARMED FORCES.-Persons confined under subsection (a)(2) in a penal or correctional institution not under the control of an armed force are subject to the same discipline and treatment as persons confined or committed by the courts of the United States or of the State, District of Columbia, or place in which the institution is situated.<br /><br /><strong>Comments:</strong>  Given the prevalence of prison rape and racially segregated gangs in American prisons one wonders what the American standards noted are.  On the other hand, the reference to &quot;or place in which the institution is situated&quot; seems to indicate that persons can be confined in places under standards that are local standards as opposed to American or international standards.  This gives some leeway to choose &quot;high standard&quot; or &quot;low standard&quot; locations outside the United States as part of the confinement.  This appears troubling in the context of the &quot;extraordinary renditions&quot; already practiced by the United States.<br /><br /><br /><strong>XII. Interlocutory Appeal by the United States</strong><br /><br />(page 52) Section 950d Appeal by the United States<br /><br />(a) INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL.-(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), in a trial by military commission under this chapter, the United States may take an interlocutory appeal to the Court of Military Commission Review under section 950f of this title of any order or ruling of the military judge that-<br />(A) terminates proceedings of the military commission with respect to a charge or specification;<br />(B) excludes evidence that is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding, or<br />(C) relates to a matter under subsection (c) (closure of proceedings), (d) (exclusion of accused from certain proceedings) or (e) (protection of classified information) of Section 949(d) of this title.<br />(2) The United States may not appeal under paragraph (1) an order or ruling that is, or amounts to, a finding of not guilty by the military commission with respect to a charge of specification.<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  Under (page 41) Section 949l. Voting and rulings on rulings it states  in relevant part &quot;...(2) Any ruling made by the military judge upon a question of law or an interlocutory question (other than the factual issue of mental responsibility of the accused) is conclusive and constitutes the ruling of the military commission.  However, a military judge may change his ruling at any time during the trial.&quot;  Thus, from the accused&#39;s point of view there is no review until the end of the proceeding.  From the point of the United States, if there is an unfavorable decision on excluding evidence, closure of proceedings, exclusion of accused, or protection of classified information, the military judge knows his/her decision may be appealed immediately.  It seems obvious, this state of affairs creates a disequilibrium and structural pressure on the military judge to not make decisions unfavorable to the United States.  The appeal of the United States is to the Court of Military Commission Review (Section 950(f)(c)) a court made up of military judges with the same qualifications as the military judge in the military commission and whose members are also appointed by the Secretary of Defense.  The Court of Military Commission Review is only permitted to hear appeals from the defendant of a final decision.  The Court of Military Commission Review&#39;s reviews are only with respect to matters of law.  Given the types of matters that are in the law co
ncerning protections of classified information, one senses that the United States has a substantial advantage in that the law requires the military judge to make sure significant protections are provided in these matter, and the interlocutory appeal processes to review those decisions is immediate, and the military judge is free to change a decision at any time. Under the pressure of a possible interlocutory appeal by the United States, one could see a military judge reversing a decision pursuant to the discretion given.  This structure could be termed structural lawful (but questionable) command influence at least through indirect appointment control of the Secretary of Defense.<br /><br />Further, cases in which review is of right by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia are those in which the detainee is sentenced to 10 years or more.  So for cases where the sentence is less than ten years the matter is heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia under its discretion.  To the extent that discretion is denied the final decision will be in the Court of Military Commission Review - Court subject to the control of the Secretary of the Defense.  Appeal to the Supreme Court is only by cert. The references are back to Section 1005(e)(4)(f) of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 which also states as a matter of construction  &quot;(f) Construction- Nothing in this section shall be construed to confer any constitutional right on an alien detained as an enemy combatant outside the United States.&quot; Thus, the sense is that cert will be hard to get as one would have to prove a detainee constitutional right and assert it, Geneva Convention grounds can not be asserted, and the focus of this review is on validity of the decision of the military commission rather than more broad attacks on the process.<br /><br /><br /><strong>XIII.  Punishment clauses</strong><br /><br />Section 950 rr - Torture<br /><br />(Page 69) &quot;(a) OFFENSE.-Any person subject to this chapter who commits an act specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control for the purpose of obtaining information or a confession, punishment, intimidation, coercion, or any reason based on discrimination of any kind, shall be punished, if death results to one or more of the victims, by death or such other punishment as a military commission under this chapter may direct, and, if death does not result to any of the victims, by such punishment, other than death, as a military commission under this chapter may direct.<br />(b)  SEVERE MENTAL PAIN OR SUFFERING DEFINED.-In this section, the term &#39;severe mental pain or suffering&#39; has the meaning given that term in section 2340(2) of title 18.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</b>  The specific intent and definitional difficulties (Yoo/Bybee memo enshrined) have noted by others such as Jamie Mayerfield and Marty Lederman over at <em>Balkinization</em>.  The key for me is how this relates back to the exclusion of evidence sections noted above.  Much coercive pre-December 30, 2005 statements would be included if this is the test for what is torture.  And as this definition appears later in the same legislation it is likely that this is the definition of torture that will be used.  So a big hole for pre-Detainee Treatment Act of December 30, 2005 statements to come in at the discretion of the judge is provided by this definition read in conjunction with the prior section.  Post-December 30, 2005 statements are only kept out by the minimal &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; domestic standard as opposed to an international standard.  This appears troubling.  It is also curious that conspiring to commit torture is not included in the definition while the conspiracy is foreseen in the &quot;cruel or inhuman treatment&quot; section.<br /><br /><strong>General comment:</strong>  Several persons have discussed the difficulties with these sections.  One recent point noted in the <em>New York Times</em> (&quot;Turning back the clock&quot;, <em>New York Times</em>, September 23, 2006, Editorials) the weakening of the international standard for rape.  The offenses appear to be a further decoupling effort from any other law.<br /><br /><br /><strong>XIV. Amendments to other laws</strong><br /><br />(page 79) <strong>Comment:</strong> UCMJ Section 802 definitions of who are subject to courts-martial now include the lawful enemy combatants designated pursuant to the sections of this act.  Because of the difference between that definition and that of POWs under the Geneva Convention III Article 4 one sees that two classes of Geneva Convention POWs are created by this act for reasons that I have found troubling in the sections above.<br /><br />(page 79)  <strong>Comment:</strong>  The deletion of the words &quot;by statute of laws of war&quot; from UCMJ Section 821 removes the basis through which the Supreme Court brought in Common Article 3 and the Geneva Conventions in <em>Hamdan</em>.  This deletion is a further example of the decoupling of these military commissions from international law and any other domestic law (courts-martial, other military commissions etc) for these persons described as &quot;alien unlawful enemy combatants&quot;.<br /><br />(Page 79) <strong>Comment:</strong> The addition of the words &quot;(other than military commissions under chapter 47A of this title)&quot; in UCMJ Section 836(a) removes the duty on the procedures in these military commissions that &quot;may be prescribed by the President by regulations which shall, so far as he considers practicable, (to) apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.&quot;  These alien unlawful enemy combatant military commissions are decoupled from any concern about showing why deviations from other procedures were considered practicable.  In addition the exception has the effect of eliminating the requirement for uniformity with other procedures under Section 836(b) (&quot;(b) All rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable and shall be reported to Congress.&quot;).  The elimination of the President&#39;s practicability requirement and the uniformity standard removes two further sections that were crucial for the Supreme Court decision in Hamdan for their determinations about the adequacy of the procedures of the military commissions then before them.  Truly, the decoupling from other law for this group is as complete as one could imagine. <br /><br /><br /><strong>XV. Stripping of habeas corpus</strong> <br /><br /><strong>Comment:</b> (page 81) Section 6 Habeas corpus under this bill has been discussed by many so I will not add anything here except to emphasize the decoupling of these procedures from all other procedures.<br /><br /><br /><strong>XVI.  Treaty obligations exclusions</strong><br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  (page 83) Section 7 - TREATY OBLIGATIONS NOT ESTABLISHING GROUNDS FOR CERTAIN CLAIMS has been discussed by many but it should be emphasized that the Geneva Conventions are excluded from federal, state, and territory habeas or civil action or proceeding.  The question is whether &quot;proceeding&quot; includes criminal proceedings in those courts.  The act is not clear and a question of interpretation will arise.  The lack of precision on that point might be understood as not precluding criminal proceedings.<br /><br /><br /><strong>XVII.  Treaty obligations implemented</strong><br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong> (page 83) Section 8 Implementation of Treaty Obligations creates the structure of (1) United States domestic law defined grave breaches that others have noted are restrictive as compared to the Geneva Conventions, (2) remaining breaches that are undefined and left to the interpretation of the President as sole arbiter, (3) a residual domestic s
tandard of &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; that differs from Common Article 3 and (4) limitation of sources of law in interpretation to US sources (or rejection of foreign sources of law in interpretation of this statute to slip around the approaches of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties).  Many have talked about these sections already and I would refer you to them.<br /><br /><br /><strong>XVIII. Section 9 detention covered by review of decisions of Combatant Status Review Tribunals</strong> <br /><br /><b>Comment:</strong> (page 94) Section 1005(e)(2)(B)(i) of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (which states: &quot;(B) LIMITATION ON CLAIMS- The jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit under this paragraph shall be limited to claims brought by or on behalf of an alien--<br />(i) who is, at the time a request for review by such court is filed, detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and&quot;)  is amended by striking &quot;the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba&quot; and inserting &quot;the United States&quot;.<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  This appears to be a means to avoid court review of the holding of aliens prior to a Combat Status Review Tribunals by others than the United States and thus the holding of persons by foreign countries, in secret prisons, etc.  This change suggest possibly why the 14 top Al-Qaeda members are being hustled into Combat Status Review Tribunals: to create a filter for the alien unlawful enemy combatant military commissions and the courts as to what can be reviewed of what happened and according to what standard in the period these persons (and 14,000 others according to reports) were held outside of Guantanamo prior to a Combat Status Review Tribunal.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------<br /><br /><em>Postscript</em> [September 26, 2006]<br /><br /><strong>Revisions Expand, Broaden, and Harden the walls of the &quot;special process&quot;</strong><br /><br />New <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/Military.commissions.bill.925.pdf">changes</a> [PDF revised draft] to the bill have gone farther in hermetically sealing this procedure, expanding the potential persons subject to be alien unlawful enemy combatants, decoupling of all this from armed conflict, giving the United States more rights of interlocutory appeal unavailable to the accused and generally reinforcing the isolation of this special process from any other U.S. process.<br /><br />The details noted are below.<br /><br /><br /><strong>I. Who - Enemies of the State</strong><br /><br />(Page 3 9/25 Version)''&Acirc;&#167; 948a. Definitions<br /><br />3 ''In this chapter:<br /><br />4 ''(1) UNLAWFUL ENEMY COMBATANT.&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;(A) The<br /><br />5 term 'unlawful enemy combatant' means&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;<br /><br />6 ''(i) a person who has engaged in hos7<br /><br />tilities or who has purposefully and materially<br /><br />8 supported hostilities against the United States<br /><br />9 or its co-belligerents who is not a lawful enemy<br /><br />10 combatant (including a person who is part of<br /><br />11 the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces); or<br /><br />12 ''(ii) a person who, before, on, or after the<br /><br />13 date of the enactment of the Military Commis14<br /><br />sions Act of 2006, has been determined to be<br /><br />15 an unlawful enemy combatant by a Combatant<br /><br />16 Status Review Tribunal or another competent<br /><br />17 tribunal established under the authority of the<br /><br />18 President or the Secretary of Defense.<br /><br />19 ''(B) CO-BELLIGERENT.&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;In this paragraph,<br /><br />20 the term 'co-belligerent', with respect to the United<br /><br />21 States, means any State or armed force joining and<br /><br />1 directly engaged with the United States in hostilities<br /><br />2 or directly supporting hostilities against a common<br /><br />3 enemy.<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  The significant expansion of who can be an unlawful enemy combatant is the most significant development.  Under the broad two-part definition above, if so designated by the government, anyone is an unlawful enemy combatant.  Thus, the careful distinctions between POWs and non-POWs and Civilians etc in the four Geneva Conventions are obliterated.  Taken with the definition of who is a lawful enemy combatant which I describe aboved as being different from the Geneva Convention III Article 4 definitions for POW&#39;s, we have a fundamental revision of Geneva law that seems even broader than the pre-Geneva 1949 environment.  Thus, if the state says you are an unlawful enemy combatant you are one - we move from POW&#39;s to unlawful enemy combatants to enemies of the state.<br /><br /><br /><strong>II. Presidential authority broadened</strong><br /><br />(page 5 9/25 version) 948b. Military commissions generally<br /><br />''(b) AUTHORITY FOR MILITARY COMMISSIONS<br /><br />18 UNDER THIS CHAPTER.&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;The President is authorized to<br /><br />19 establish military commissions under this chapter for of20<br /><br />fenses triable by military commission as provided in this<br /><br />21 chapter.<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  The authority of the President to establish military commission is now stated in very broad terms deleting references to &quot;the trial of unlawful enemy combatants engaged in hostilities against the United States for violations of the law of war and other offenses&quot; in the prior version.  Coupled with the broad definition or unlawful enemy combatant, one senses that the bills drafters wanted to give the President the broadest <em>Youngstown</em> authority for these commissions.<br /><br />At pages 5 and 6 of the new version (sections 948b. (c) and (d)), language is deleted to eliminate reference to any language in the UCMJ.in the (c) Constuction of Provisions section.   In (d), other provisions of Chapter 47 are made to apply under this chapter only to the extent provided by this chapter. This deletion and language further decouples the unlawful enemy combatant military commissions from the UCMJ as described above.<br /><br /><br /><strong>III. Geneva Convention exclusion broadened</strong><br /><br />(page 7 9/25 version) Section 948b.(g)<br /><br />''(g) GENEVA CONVENTIONS NOT ESTABLISHING<br /><br />14 SOURCE OF RIGHTS.&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;No alien unlawful enemy combat15<br /><br />ant subject to trial by military commission under this<br /><br />16 chapter may invoke the Geneva Conventions as a source<br /><br />17 of rights.<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  In the prior version it was explicit that the alien unlawful enemy combatant could could not invoke the Geneva Conventions in the military commission trial but there could have been an ambiguity about whether the Geneva Convention could be invoked other places.  This slight change of this section appears to make this exclusion as broad as possible.<br /><br /><br />IV. <strong>Jurisdiction - two tracks for alien unlawful enemy combatants and lawful enemy combatants</strong> (pages 7- 8) Section 948d.  <br /><br />Jurisdiction of these military commissions is kept only to offenses made punishable by this chapter or the law of war - removing reference to the UCMJ. Lawful enemy combatants can be prosecuted in courts-martial for offenses here but the punishments may be different there - thus keeping the two tracks described above.<br /><br /><br /><strong>V. New provision on the dispositive nature of the status determination</strong><br /><br />(Page 8) Section 948c.(c)<br /><br />''(c) DETERMINATION OF UNLAWFUL ENEMY COM11<br /><br />BATANT STATUS DISPOSITIVE.&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;A finding, whether be12<br /><br />fore, on, or after the date of the enactment of the Military<br /><br />13 Commissions Act of 2006, by a Combatant Status Review<br /><br />14 Tribunal or another competent tribunal established under<br /><br />15 the authority of the President or the Secretary of Defense<br /><br />16 that a person is an unlawful enemy combatant is disposi17<br /><br />tive for purposes of jurisdic
tion for trial by military com18<br /><br />mission under this chapter.<br /><br /><strong>Comments:</strong>  This provision anchors the jurisdiction of the military commissions in determinations for which there is little or no review.  Once considered an unlawful enemy combatant, one is truly alone and made to have limited recourse before the end of the proceeding.  And the powers of the Secretary of Defense are enhanced as the punishments are no longer to be determined by the President in Section (d) on that same page 8.<br /><br /><br /><strong>VI.  Who can serve on military commissions</strong><br /><br />At page 9, Section 948i.(a) states that only active duty armed forces (as opposed to reserves in the earlier version) may serve on the military commissions.  I am not sure of the import of this except that the control is obviously much more significant on active duty personnel as opposed to reserve personnel.<br /><br /><br /><strong>VII. Rules of evidence</strong><br /><br />Pages 19 and 20 Section 949a. Rules (a)<br /><br />''&Acirc;&#167; 949a. Rules<br /><br />17 ''(a) PROCEDURES AND RULES OF EVIDENCE.&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;Pre18<br /><br />trial, trial, and post-trial procedures, including elements<br /><br />1 and modes of proof, for cases triable by military commis2<br /><br />sion under this chapter may be prescribed by the Secretary<br /><br />3 of Defense, in consultation with the Attorney General.<br /><br />4 Such procedures shall, so far as the Secretary considers<br /><br />5 practicable or consistent with military or intelligence ac6<br /><br />tivities, apply the principles of law and the rules of evi7<br /><br />dence in trial by general courts-martial. Such procedures<br /><br />8 and rules of evidence may not be contrary to or incon9<br /><br />sistent with this chapter.<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  The Attorney General is inserted in the process of determination of the procedures.  Moreover, the priority of military and intelligence activities is greatly emphasized in the language.<br /><br /><br /><strong>VIII.  Number of members of military commissions in non-capital cases</strong><br /><br />Page 43 (Section 949m (b)(2)), the number of members of the military commission in non-capital cases is increased from 5 to 9.<br /><br /><br /><strong>IX.  Enhanced role of the Court of Military Commission Review</strong><br /><br />Page 51 (section 950c.(a)), in what appears to be a new section an automatic review of any finding of guilty is provided by the Court of Military Commission Review.<br /><br /><br /><strong>X. Further enhancement of one way appeal by the United States</strong><br /><br />Page 52 (Section 950d. Appeal by the United States) - the United States alone has certain rights to make a few appeals on certain military commission order or rulings to the Court of Military Review. If the Court of Military Review enters an adverse ruling, a new section grants the right to petition for review of that decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (whose review will be at the Court of Appeals&#39; discretion).<br /><br /><br /><strong>XI.  Scope of Review of the United States Court of Appeals</strong><br /><br />Page 57 Section 950g.(e)<br /><br />''(c) SCOPE OF REVIEW.&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;The jurisdiction of the<br /><br />10 Court of Appeals on an appeal under subsection (a) shall<br /><br />11 be limited to the consideration of&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;<br /><br />12 ''(1) whether the final decision was consistent<br /><br />13 with the standards and procedures specified in this<br /><br />14 chapter; and<br /><br />15 ''(2) to the extent applicable, the Constitution<br /><br />16 and the laws of the United States.<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  The scope of review is limited and the chapter attempts to be very self-contained.<br /><br /><br /><strong>XII.  (Page 64) Section 950v. Crimes triable by commission.</strong><br /><br />The deletion of the  section &quot;(c) Common Circumstances.-An offense specified in this subchapter is triable by military commission under this chapter only if the offense is committed in the context of and associated with armed conflict&quot; (page 62 Section 950aa.of the 9/22 version) is significant.  The offenses are decoupled from armed conflicts.  Given the broad definition of who is an unlawful enemy combatant in the new version - aliens everywhere can find themselves caught in this system whether or not they are near armed conflict.<br /><br />At page 70 (Section (12)), reference to conspiracy or attempts is deleted in the cruel or inhuman treatment offense.  At page 76 (Section (22)), Sexual Assault or Abuse is included in this section as it is in the War Crimes Act section later in the new version.<br /><br />At pages 80 and 81 (Section 4 (a)(2) and (3), the exclusion of the applicability of Section 821 and 836(a) and (b) of the UCMJ is made even more explicit for the avoidance of any risk that a Hamdan kind of analysis might be done again through these provisions to bring in the Geneva Conventions.<br /><br /><br /><strong>XIII. New habeas language</strong><br /><br />Page 93 Section 7 Habeas Corpus Matters<br /><br />''(e)(1) No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdic<br /><br />13 tion to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas<br /><br />14 corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the<br /><br />15 United States <u>who has been determined by the United<br /><br />16 States to have been properly detained as an enemy com<br /><br />17 batant or is awaiting such determination</u>. (my underlining)<br /><br /><strong>Comment:</strong>  This language is present in both the 2241 U.S.C. amendments and the Detainee Treatment Act amendments.  This new language really seems to leave the unlawful enemy combatant at the absolute mercy of the determinations of these military commission and related processes.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<title>The Arar Report: The US Should Follow Canada&#039;s Lead</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.richmond.edu/faculty/tobias.htm">Jules Lobel</a>, a lawyer for Maher Arar and a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, says that the US government and federal courts should follow the lead of a recently-completed Canadian inquiry by acknowledging the injustice done to Arar in deporting him from the US for torture in Syria...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/juleslobel.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>hy would the United States government send a detained Canadian citizen who it believes may be a terrorist to Syria, a country which the State Department claims practices torture and is a State sponsor of terrorism, and not to Canada, our friend and ally? That&#39;s the question raised by the case of Maher Arar, a case that has become an international symbol of all that is wrong with the Bush Administration's policy of extraordinary rendition. The recent exhaustive 1200-page report of a Canadian <a href="http://www.ararcommission.ca/">Commission of Inquiry</a> appointed to investigate Mr. Arar's case offers some insights into what happened to Arar and why.<br /><br />     The Commission chaired by appellate judge Dennis R. O'Connor made a number of findings that are important for Arar's ongoing quest for justice in the United States. First, the Commission concluded that Arar was never a member of Al Qaeda or associated with any terrorist group. Nonetheless, based on false information supplied by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the United States government detained Arar at Kennedy Airport in New York on his way home to Canada from a family vacation in Tunisia. He was jailed and harshly interrogated in New York for two weeks and then secretly flown by U.S. government plane to Jordan and taken from there to Syria.  He was held by the Syrians in a tiny cell for 10 months and tortured. On October 5, 2003, the Syrian government released Arar after concluding that he had no connection to terrorism<br /><br />       The Commission found that based on his mere acquaintances with other men under suspicion, the RCMP sent a report to the U.S. which listed Arar and his wife as "Islamic extremists suspected of being linked to the al Qaeda movement". Both the Commission and the RCMP now agree that the description was totally false. Judge O'Connor stated "categorically that there is no evidence to indicate that Mr. Arar has committed any offense or that his activities constituted a threat to Canada.&quot; The Commission suggested that the Canadian government pay compensation to Arar.<br /><br />      The Canadian Commission report also sheds light on the actions of American officials.  In deciding to deport Arar, INS Regional Director J. Scott Blackman determined that the evidence "clearly and unequivocally reflects that Mr. Arar is a member of a foreign terrorist organization, to wit Al Qaeda." Yet only 3 days earlier, Canadian counterterrorism officials sent a fax to the FBI which stated that while Mr Arar "had contact with" suspicious individuals, they "were unable to indicate links to Al Qaeda", and had "yet to complete a detailed investigation of Mr. Arar".  The next day, the Commission reports that a Canadian and FBI official spoke by phone and both concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge Arar either in Canada or the United States with a crime, which would not be true if they had clear and unequivocal information that Arar was an Al Qaeda member. <br /><br />    Not only is it now clear that US officials inflated the evidence they received from Canada, but they also kept Canadian officials in the dark about their plans for Arar. The Canadian foreign ministry was not initially informed of Arar's detention, and American officials denied Mr. Arar's requests to talk to the Canadian Consulate in New York, a violation of American treaty obligations with Canada. The Commission report concluded that "American authorities appear to have intentionally kept Canadian officials in the dark about their plans to remove Mr. Arar to Syria". They did so, according to the report, because they "believed - quite correctly- that if informed, the Canadians would have serious concerns about the plan to remove Mr. Arar to Syria". Even after Arar's deportation to Syria, the United States government did not inform Canada of Arar's whereabouts, and the Canadians only learned two weeks later from the Syrians that he was there. Once the Canadians learned that Arar was in Syria, his torture and interrogation stopped.<br /><br />    The Commission report suggests that the reason Arar was not sent to Canada was because, unlike Syria, Canada would not have detained or tortured him. Canadian officials told their American counterparts that they would place Arar under surveillance. But that would not have sufficed for the United States - hence the Syria option.<br /><br />    The Canadian Commission report thus underscores the problems with the "preventive paradigm" that has become the key tool of the United States government's war on terror, of which extraordinary rendition is but one tactic. First, the preventive paradigm allows the government to use force and coercion against individuals and other states based on suspicions and not hard evidence. Thousands of innocent people like Arar thus get caught in the government's dragnet. Second, the paradigm relies on methods such as torture or inhumane treatment to obtain information which the government believes can not be obtained by normal police methods such as surveillance. Since Canada could not openly torture Arar, we sent him to Syria, which would. Finally, these coercive preventive measures rely on secrecy and lack of accountability.  <br /><br />        While the Canadian government has now publicly aired the facts of its involvement in this outrageous incident, the United States government and courts continue to refuse to provide answers to why the U.S. government sent Arar to Syria. The  U.S. government refuses to publicly discuss the Arar matter, has refused to make public any information about his deportation to Syria and refused to co-operate with the Canadian Commission. Mr. Arar's quest to discover how this could happen has fared no better in the judiciary -  a US District Court recently dismissed Arar's lawsuit seeking damages because it raises "crucial national security and foreign policy considerations" that are the prerogative of co-ordinate branches of government.<br /><br />Now that the Canadian government has openly aired its dirty laundry, we in the United States should demand of our government that it openly account for its actions. If it won't, the judiciary must ensure that Arar's claims get a fair and open hearing.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Jules Lobel is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law and one of the lawyers representing Maher Arar in his US court action.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/political_science/faculty/albritt.html">Robert Albritton</a> of the University of Mississippi says the recent overthrow of Thailand&#39;s elected government by unconstitutional means reflects a disconcerting failure of mass democracy in the country in the face of opposition from critical elites...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/robertalbritton.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><em>For forms of government let fools contest; that which is best administered is best.</em><br /><br /><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>hese words from the British playwright Sheridan, quoted favorably by Hamilton in <em>The Federalist</em>, sum up the attitudes of many elite Thais toward democratic government. As in 1991, a military coup overturned a democratically-elected government on September 19, 2006 on the pretext of corruption. Whether corruption truly existed has yet to be proven, but what is clear is that Thai elites are still willing to sacrifice democracy when they find control of government slipping from their grasp. For the time being, they are willing to tolerate a ban on all political activities, including meetings of political parties, assemblies of more than five people, and restrictions on the news media &#8212; specifically a ban on criticism of the regime and other possible censorship, all restrictions that far exceed criticisms of the regime led by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.<br /> <br /> Before censorship of the media took effect, the coup was challenged by some academics formerly opposed to Thaksin and even the opposition political party, Prajadhipat (Democrat), but few were willing to oppose the coup directly, especially after it received blessings from the palace. Clearly, they had underestimated the mood of the military and the palace that combined to end the 15-year trajectory of democracy.<br /><br /> Most Thais were in denial concerning clear signs of an impending coup. Within a year after the landslide election victory of Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party in the 2005 elections [<a href="#1">1</a>], significant fissures opened in the Thai political landscape. Thousands of Bangkokians gathered in Lumpini Park to listen to attacks on the government by Sondhi Limtongkul, a wealthy businessman who, after supporting Prime Minister Thaksin in previous elections, fell out with him over as-yet-unidentified business issues. Many Thais were enraged, however, when the Prime Minister sold the huge Shin Corporation shares to a Singaporean firm. The company included the major satellite linkage in SE Asia and a huge proportion of cell phone business. Some Thais argued that these were national assets that could not legitimately be transferred to non-Thais. In addition, Thaksin paid no tax on the sale estimated at around $2 billion, because of a law exempting capital gains from taxation when acquired by sales through the Securities Exchange of Thailand. On a routine basis, as many as 100,000 protestors marched to demand Thaksin's resignation or replacement.<br /> <br /> Thaksin nonetheless had his own supporters located mostly in rural areas of the country and mobilized even larger crowds (as many as 200,000 in Bangkok) in his support. Eventually, in order to quell the continuous unrest, he dissolved Parliament and ordered a "snap" election, knowing that his popularity in the countryside would give him a new mandate to govern. The opposition parties, however, refused to participate in the poll and supported a move to encourage voters to mark ballots against any candidates. Because the election law requires that any candidate must receive at least 20 percent of the eligible electorate when only one candidate runs unopposed, this move was successful and, despite repeated by-elections, 14 seats remained unfilled. <br /><br /><strong>The &quot;Two Democracies&quot;</strong><br /><br /> This political conflict represents a resurrection of the "two democracies" identified by Thai political scientist Anek Laothamatas [<a href="#2">2</a>] that essentially pitted the politics of Bangkok against the rural North, Northeast, and Central regions from which the majority party, Thai Rak Thai, drew its strength. Underlying this cleavage is a division rooted in the history of Thai politics, but only now becoming critical to social stability as a result of advancing democracy in the Thai nation. Until the development of democracy, Thai politics was dominated by Bangkok, even though Bangkok comprises only about 10 percent of the population of Thailand. As democracy began to take hold (with each voter in the rural areas counting as much as each voter in Bangkok), it was only a matter of time before political power would shift to the politics and priorities of rural Thailand. The conflict between Bangkok and the hinterland was long in building, but, once the structures of democracy were in place, it was not long before the rural 80 percent asserted their political strength to the alarm of Bangkok elites.<br /><br />At least two Thai scholars have argued that these cleavages have long existed between political orientations of Bangkok elites and Thai villagers. [<a href="#3">3</a>]  According to this view, Thailand is, thus, a tale of two democracies - that of sophisticated urban elites (with origins or current status in Bangkok) and that of a rural, often isolated, parochial interest that views political activity, especially elections, as opportunities for personal or community benefit. This perspective is important because, historically, it has been the position taken by Bangkok elites that has determined the fate of democratic government in Thailand.<br /><br /> The difference between urban and rural constituencies (according to the elite "urban view") is that:<blockquote>Voting in farming areas is not guided by political principles, policy issues, or what is perceived to be in the national interest, all of which is (regarded as) the only legitimate rationale for citizens casting their ballots in a democratic election. The ideal candidates for rural voters are those who visit them often, address their immediate grievances effectively, and bring numerous public works to their communities. [<a href="#4">4</a>]</blockquote>The ability of rural constituencies to acquire substantial power in parliaments under these conditions often led to doubts among the middle class, the mass media, and even academics as to the efficacy of democratic processes. For these groups, "democracy turns out to be the rule of the corrupt and incompetent." This creates a dilemma, for although the middle class opposes authoritarian rule, in principle, they hold rural constituencies in contempt, regarding them as "parochial in outlook, boorish in manner, and too uneducated to be competent lawmakers or cabinet members." [<a href="#5">5</a>] <br /><br /> The problem is that urban, educated, cosmopolitan candidates, who are skilled policy experts, are often held in equal contempt by villagers, regarded as being alien to rural electorates in terms of taste, culture, and outlook, who "fail to stay close to the voters in both a physical and cultural sense." [<a href="#6">6</a>] This veiled contempt for rural-dwellers by sophisticated Bangkok elites poses no problem under authoritarian regimes. Once democratic elections tipped the balance in favor of rural areas, however, significant gaps in perceptions and meanings of democracy developed.<br /><br /><strong>Socioeconomic Status and Support for Democracy</strong><br /><br />Other cleavages not limited to the urban-rural divide emerged after 2001. Data from a 2005 poll foretold a growing political cleavage based upon class. [<a href="#7">7</a>]  Cleavages based upon education, income, and social status have, over the past decade, produced considerable political tension that, until recently, seemed to be abating. The threat posed by these cleavages lies in d
eclining enthusiasm for democracy and ambivalence among the middle class in supporting democratic consolidation. There is growing evidence that, while the middle class opposes authoritarian forms of government that restrict individual freedoms and exercise a heavy hand over commerce, the uncertainty of changes in government, even by democratic processes, can be viewed as destabilizing the economic and cultural environment traditionally led by elites of the middle class. The possibility that government may be seized by politicians with "populist" agendas poses an even more direct threat to the interests of a class that stands significantly above the average voter in Thai elections. What may be even more significant is the prospect that, because of the democratic ballot, traditional status (that is, non-economic) elites are pitted against rural masses that heretofore have had little or no political power.<br /><br /><strong>Opposition to Popular Democracy from Traditional Sources of Status and Power</strong><br /><br />It is too facile to view these cleavages either as a product only of class or even of the urban-rural divide. There is another, more subtle, dimension to the emerging political conflict. The conflict over the Thaksin regime exposed significant differences between "traditional elites" and the masses in their understandings of popular democracy. Publicly expressed views of academics and supporters of traditional society indicate that the "reformers" expected voters to support traditional elites, that is, those who were "supposed" to lead the nation. The capture of the government by mass (as opposed to elite-led) democracy brought about a corresponding disillusionment with democratic elections among intellectual and urban elites. This sentiment was represented by academic and social activist Thirayuth Boonmi, who was quoted by the <em>Bangkok Post</em> as saying that it was worrisome that Prime Minister Thaksin had mobilized the poor --- <em>and gotten them involved in politics</em> (italics mine). What was even more worrisome, he went on to say, was that <em>the poor voted differently from the middle class</em> (italics also mine). The conflict between an emerging, mass-based democracy and traditions embedded in a hierarchical society pose a major obstacle to further consolidation of Thai democracy.<br /><br /><strong>The Role of the Royalists in the Coup of 2006</strong><br /><br />Among the "traditional elites" who have become increasingly uncomfortable with democracy are the "royalists." Unable to unseat Thaksin by legitimate means, royalist elites made alliances with anti-Thaksin protest movements to the extent that representatives of the anti-Thaksin alliances appeared often "at the door of the palace" asking for help in turning Thaksin out of office. Thaksin did not help his cause by appearing to compete with the king, especially in insinuating himself into ceremonies honoring the 60th year of the king's accession to the throne. In addition, the hard line taken by the government in denying full control in the South to the military and interference in the annual reshuffle of military officers, alienated key elements of powerful elites that had been quiescent for over a decade.<br /><br /> A series of events foretold the coup for those who are sensitive to the intricacies of Thai politics. A series of speeches by Prem Tinsulanonda, spokesman for the Privy Council, and, thus, the voice of the king, indirectly chastised developments within the government, but, more importantly, in speeches to various military groups, reminded the military officers that the military belonged to the king, not the government. A visit by General Songthi to the palace preceded the mobilization of the military to take over the government, to replace the Prime Minister, and to abrogate the Constitution of 1997. This was followed by immediate approval of the coup by the monarch. As one Thai scholar put it, "If the king didn't give a nod, this never would have been possible." [<a href="#8">8</a>]<br /> <br /><strong>Constitutional "Reform"</strong><br /><br />Some Thai intellectuals have little regard for constitutions; therefore, the abrogation of the Constitution of 1997, has evoked only scant elite opposition. This constitution, however, has been suggested as the basic document for any new reform efforts and has received support from Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the opposition Prajadhipat (Democrat) Party. The Constitution of 1997 outlines explicit political and human rights unmatched in most constitutions of democratic states. Whether a new constitution will infringe upon or maintain these rights remains an open question.<br /><br /> Agitators for constitutional reform are united in attempting to write a constitution that will prevent concentrations of power such as those of the Thai Rak Thai party during the past five years. The Constitution of 1997, of course, was designed to overcome the anarchy of coalition governments that proved unstable and were associated with the economic collapse of the late 1990s. The solution appears to lie in what Thais refer to as "checks and balances." These are a series of institutions designed to countermand the government in a variety of sensitive areas, including the Election Commission, the Constitutional Court, the Administrative Court, a Human Rights Commission, and a National Counter-Corruption Commission.<br /><br /> The Constitution of 1997, however, never solved the problem of how these bodies were to be constituted. The solution was to have members of these agencies appointed by a theoretically nonpartisan Senate. Because these bodies often found in favor of the government, criticism of the Thaksin administration began to spill over onto these independent bodies. At this point, it is not clear how the issue of appointments to what are, in principle, watchdog bodies will be resolved. Furthermore, it is probably na&Atilde;Atilde;&macr;ve to think that all aspects of corruption can be forestalled by any constitutional document. In fact, many of the complaints about elections, for example, are fruits of implementing legislation, not provisions of the Constitution.<br /> <br /><strong>Analysis and Conclusions</strong><br /><br />The history of democracy in Thailand has been one of elite-guided democracy. Whether the Bangkok intellectual and social elites will cede political authority to the hinterland remains the major issue for democratic governance, that is, progress toward mass-based democracy. Dominance by Bangkok elites of the press and academic discourse make this course an uphill struggle, and foreign media interpretations almost invariably rely on the very elites whose interest is at stake. In the long run, however, only mass-based democracy can be called true democracy.<br /> <br />The overthrow of a democratically elected government by unconstitutional means, especially with the collaboration of the palace, is shattering for analysts who believed that Thailand was making progress away from an elite-dominated society. In this case, elites have responded to a populist government with a resounding "No, we will not tolerate mass rule!" Earlier optimism about Thailand as a "democratic" state should have all but evaporated. Clearly, elites will not tolerate radical changes in society implied by mass democracy. The hopes of those who began the path to democracy, in 1932, have suffered seriously from recent events, even more than from the 1991 coup, because Thailand had come so far. <br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes<br /><br /><a name="1">1</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.fordham.edu/ihtml/dir-2bioPP.ihtml?id=658&bid=1187">Alison Nathan</a> of Fordham University School of Law says that the provision in the military commissions bill stripping the federal courts of habeas jurisdiction over detainees threatens a fundamental element of our constitutional heritage ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alisonnathan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>F</strong></font>ollowing a claim that former deputy-director of State Richard Armitage told Pakistani officials that if Pakistan did not help the U.S. topple the Taliban in Afghanistan, the U.S. would bomb Pakistan "back to the Stoneage," Armitage denied that he ever used that language.  Explaining in a CNN interview that he may have been misinterpreted, Armitage admitted that he had told the Pakistani defense minister that Pakistan had a decision to make as to whether it was "with us fully or not and that it was not a matter of being able to negotiate."  Armitage claimed that the Pakistani defense minister responded with a story about the history of Pakistan and Afghan relations; Armitage cut the defense minister off, interjecting that "history starts today."  That dramatic statement encapsulates so much of what is dangerously wrong with the Bush administration's response to September 11th.<br /><br />That the terrorists succeeded in causing wide-scale and horrific civilian death and destruction on September 11th, the likes of which was never before seen on U.S. soil, cannot be overstated.  But that by no means suggests, as the administration would have it, that history is irrelevant to our response.  To the contrary, history, particularly 200 years of this nation's constitutional history, should be our guide.<br /><br /> Consider the significant alteration to our structure of government that is embodied in the current legislative proposal regarding the treatment of detainees&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the so-called habeas-stripping provision.  In the midst of the debate between the White House and Republican Senators McCain, Graham, and Warner concerning Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, the significance of the proposed habeas-stripping language (which remains in the "compromise" legislation agreed upon by the Senate Republicans and the White House) has arguably been underplayed.  This is a serious mistake because the change that this provision would bring about to our constitutional heritage is of enormous significance.<br /><br />Pursuant to the habeas-stripping provision, any non-U.S. citizen who has been or will be swept up by the military, the CIA, or our allies and transferred to a secret black-site or Guantanamo Bay, or rendered to another country where they are held and interrogated at the behest of the U.S. government, may no longer have any recourse to a U.S. court.  As a result, the administration will have no obligation to put forward to an independent branch of government even a minimal explanation of the basis for a potentially indefinite detention.  Nor will there exist any mechanism to check military or CIA abuses, including torture, of detainees.  Whatever rights to humane treatment under the Geneva Conventions that remain following the "compromise" between the White House and the Republican Senators (and there is serious question as to whether this was indeed a compromise or a capitulation to the White House) will be meaningless since the habeas-stripping provision unquestionably ensures that those rights will find no day in court and no remedy.<br /><br />This change works a significant destruction of our constitutional heritage for at least two reasons.  First, the U.S. Constitution establishes as a fundamental structural premise that there will be three independent branches of government that serve as checks and balances upon each other.  Removing entirely the independent judiciary from any role in checking the conduct of the Executive and Congress is a substantial alteration to that structural premise.  Second, the writ of habeas corpus has, since this country's founding, served as a particularly important guardian of liberty.  Throughout our history, when the government has captured and detained individuals, the "Great Writ" has served the basic function of guarding against arbitrary government in the form of unjustified and secret detention.  Here is how Alexander Hamilton in <em>Federalist No. 84</em> (quoting Blackstone) powerfully described the critical importance of the writ of habeas corpus:<blockquote>To bereave a man of life &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government.</blockquote>Moreover, these objections to the removal of habeas corpus are not merely academic debating points.  We now know with certainty that the U.S. has detained for years innocent men at Guantanamo Bay, such as the five ethnic Uighurs who arrived there after being sold by Pakistani tribesmen for a bounty and the U.S. labeled them enemy combatants with no evidence supporting that designation.  It was in part because of the existence of habeas corpus jurisdiction and the pressure of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the <em>Rasul v. Bush</em> case, which held that non-citizens detained at Guantanamo had a right to file habeas petitions, that these men gained their freedom.  The habeas-stripping legislation will overrule <em>Rasul v. Bush</em>, making future challenges to wrongful and indefinite detention impossible.  We also know that innocent men such as Maher Arar and Khaled El-Masri have been tortured in the process of secret detention and extraordinary rendition either by or at the behest of the U.S. government.  The habeas-stripping provision will eliminate any opportunity for the judiciary to ensure that existing and future detentions are not grounded on torture or other abuse.<br /><br /> September 11th will be seen for all time to come as a horrific day that marks substantial and painful loss to America.  Let it not also be the day, as the Bush administration would have it, that heralded the loss of the fundamental principles and structure of our Constitutional heritage.  Any member of Congress who is considering whether to sign onto the habeas-stripping legislation proposed by the Bush administration must ask themselves whether history, indeed, starts today.  The answer must be no.<br /><br /><br /><em>Alison J. Nathan is a Visiting Assistant Professor at Fordham Law School.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.richmond.edu/faculty/tobias.htm">Carl Tobias</a> of the University of Richmond School of Law says although leading Republican senators are to be praised for advancing legislation to protect detainees and give them a fair trial before military commissions, there are still so many open questions about the fundamental issues involved and so little time to resolve them that Congress should avoid passing a bill before its 109th session adjourns...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/carltobias.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>R</strong></font>epublican Senators John Warner of Virginia, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina deserve credit for drafting, and encouraging the Armed Services Committee to adopt, high-profile legislation, which treats the complex questions posed by military tribunals that would try suspected terrorists. Warner, who is the Committee Chair, as well as Senators McCain and Graham, who are members, cooperated in drafting that bill. Warner, who served in World War II and as Navy Secretary; McCain, who fought in Vietnam and whom the North Vietnamese held as a POW for over five years; and Graham, who was an Air Force Judge Advocate General pushed for their legislation's approval and resisted pressure from the White House and Senate leaders to support legislation favored by President George W. Bush. The three GOP senators said the administration bill would not adequately protect Americans whom other countries detain, although the three senators reached a "deal" with the White House on Thursday. However, that deal leaves so many crucial particulars unclear that lawmakers should not pass legislation before the 109th Congress adjourns.<br /> <br /> The dispute over military tribunals arose from President Bush's November 2001 Executive Order, which unilaterally established military tribunals to try terrorist suspects. No trial has proceeded to verdict under this system. Mr. Bush recently announced that fourteen al-Qaeda operatives would receive tribunal trials. Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a defendant in one early trial, challenged that proceeding. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled for Hamdan and invalidated the tribunals, although the Court did suggest that Congress had the power to authorize tribunals.<br /><br /> Throughout the summer, the Bush Administration and Congress drafted legislation to authorize tribunals. In the week of September 11, lawmakers introduced the administration bill. On September 14, the Senate Armed Services Committee approved legislation primarily written by Senators Warner, McCain and Graham on a 15-8 vote. The Committee bill differs in several important respects from the administration legislation.<br /><br /> One critical specific involves treatment of the Geneva Conventions and Common Article 3. The Committee bill would leave intact these treaty obligations as they have existed for fifty-seven years. In contrast, the administration bill requires greater particularity in terms of the Conventions' general language and could provoke other countries' "reinterpretation" of their treaty obligations to the detriment of Americans whom they detain and try. <br /><br /> A second principal area of disagreement is evidentiary. The Committee legislation respects a fundamental principle of American constitutional law - that defendants are entitled to know the evidence against them. The Committee bill would permit considerable access even to classified national security information in a manner analogous to what happens in federal court trials and trials conducted under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In contrast, the administration legislation would narrowly confine and even prohibit that access. <br /><br />Last Thursday, the White House and the three GOP senators struck a "deal," the specifics of which still remain somewhat unclear. For example, the legislation seemingly will not reinterpret the Geneva Conventions but leaves to presidential discretion the definition of practices which U.S. interrogators might employ. The deal also leaves unclear exactly what evidence secured through questionable procedures may be admitted at trial and the precise evidence against defendants to which they would have access.<br /><br />Despite the valuable parameters, and additional helpful aspects, of the legislation adopted by the Armed Services Committee, that bill and last Thursday's deal include some disadvantages and unclear features. One crucial issue is the attempt essentially to strip the federal courts of habeas corpus jurisdiction, the centuries-old writ that is meant to prevent arbitrary executive detentions. The Senate Judiciary Committee conducted a Monday hearing on habeas corpus, which emphasized the questions regarding habeas and the bill's lack of clarity. Indeed, Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), the Chair, observed that the lack of a written bill embodying the deal hindered the Committee's efforts.<br /><br />Senators John Warner, John McCain and Lindsey Graham deserve credit for drafting legislation that honors the Geneva Conventions and that provides defendants who are tried in military tribunals considerable access to evidence against them. These procedures would better protect Americans whom other nations detain and try. However, Thursday's deal leaves so many questions unclear and Congress has so little time to elucidate critical, unresolved issues that lawmakers should adjourn without passing legislation.<br /><br /><em>Carl Tobias is the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/clinic/Scheffer/Scheffer.html">David Scheffer</a>, former US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues (1997-2001), now at Northwestern University School of Law, says that the new &quot;compromise&quot; <a href="http://natseclaw.typepad.com/natseclaw/files/Admin.SASC.Agreement.pdf">language on detainee treatment</a> included in the <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/military_commissions_bill_1.pdf">latest version of the military commissions bill</a> strips whole categories of common Article 3 Geneva Convention violations from the federal War Crimes Act, sidesteps judicial review, and invites US adversaries to treat potential US captives more severely...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidscheffer.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he so-called "compromise" legislation between the Bush Administration and key Republican members of Congress concerning the enforcement of common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions significantly weakens existing law, censors the federal judiciary in its deliberative and drafting responsibilities, and invites dangerous reciprocal and retaliatory measures by foreign governments to the detriment of U.S. personnel engaged in or responsible for interrogations of foreign detainees and any U.S. personnel who may be captured.  <br /><br /> The War Crimes Act of 1996, as amended in 1997 to incorporate violations of common Article 3 (18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167;2441), implements the 1949 Geneva Conventions into federal criminal law and, among other war crimes, makes any violation of common Article 3 a war crime punishable by fine or imprisonment for life or any term of years, or both.  If death results to the victim, the perpetrator also is subject to the penalty of death.  The War Crimes Act does not, and does not need to, define violations of common Article 3 as "grave breaches" of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, but simply converts such violations into punishable crimes under U.S. law.  A similar method was employed in Article 8(2)(c) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which criminalized serious violations of common Article 3 without linking them to the distinctive set of grave breaches under the Geneva Conventions identified elsewhere in Article 8 of the Rome Statute (and separately addressed in 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167;2441(c)(1)).  <br /><br /> There is no codified requirement to criminalize common Article 3 violations per se, but the United States did so in 1997, as have a large number of other countries in their penal codes (particularly those nations that have ratified the Rome Statute and joined the International Criminal Court).  The illegality of common Article 3 violations under the Geneva Conventions has joined with their growing acceptance among governments as criminal acts under international customary law, thus leading to penal sanctions in national criminal codes.  <br /><br />With considerable stealth, the Bush Administration has invoked Article 129 of the Third Geneva Convention, which requires states parties to legislate penal sanctions for the grave breaches listed in Article 130, in an apparent attempt to emasculate common Article 3.  The proposed amendment to the War Crimes Act first strikes out "violation" and replaces it with "grave breach" as the punishable criminal act under common Article 3 as implemented in U.S. law.  This would have the effect of eliminating a number of common Article 3 violations entirely from criminal sanctions under U.S. law and needlessly throws into a radically altered common Article 3 category certain crimes already covered as punishable grave breaches in 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167;2441(c)(1).   One is left wondering whether "grave breaches" committed under 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167;2441(c)(1) are henceforth to be defined as the Bush Administration proposes they be understood for common Article 3 violations (18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167;2441(c)(3)).  <br /><br />We are left with the bizarre result that all common Article 3 violations as such are eliminated entirely from the War Crimes Act, only to be replaced with a list of "grave breaches," some of which overlap the violations and others of which appear out of nowhere to be henceforth defined as part of common Article 3 by the U.S. Government.  Nothing in the Geneva Conventions requires any common Article 3 violations to be transformed into "grave breaches."   In this case, the new "grave breaches" are defined in narrow terms that defy the overall intent of the Geneva Conventions, while the authentic "grave breaches" of the Geneva Conventions committed outside common Article 3 situations remain standing and enforceable under the War Crimes Act even though they are not defined at all in the compromise bill.   If the latter can be enforced without such narrow definitions, why must the former be so defined?<br /><br /> Five common Article 3 violations, which since 1997 have been chargeable as war crimes under the War Crimes Act, have been dropped, with retroactive effect, in the compromise bill.   The excluded violations are as follows:<ol><li>violence to life and person other than murder, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture as each of those crimes is restrictively defined in the bill;<br /><li>murder not associated with one of the other offenses included in the bill;<br /><li>mutilation not associated with one of the other offenses included in the bill;<br /><li>outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating treatment; and<br /><li>the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.</ol>Consider the possible actions that, while subject to prosecution under the present War Crimes Act, no longer would be criminal acts under the compromise legislation:  There could easily be a violent assault on a prisoner falling just short of cruel treatment as it is defined in the bill ("severe or serious physical or mental pain or suffering&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;including serious physical abuse&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;").  A detainee could be summarily executed with one pistol shot to the head in a circumstance where no other abusive treatment associated with any other "grave breach" as defined in the bill is present.   Common Article 3 prohibits "murder of all kinds," while the compromise bill criminalizes only killing "in the course of committing any other offense under this section [of newly defined 'grave breaches']."  <br /><br />Similarly, unless it is done "in the course of committing any other offense under this section [of  newly defined 'grave breaches']," the mutilation of a detainee could not be prosecuted under the compromise bill.  Thus, the simple act of walking into an interrogation room where a detainee is being questioned in the most civilized possible manner and suddenly chopping off one of his fingers would not be a criminal act under the proposed amendment.  Common Article 3 does not require any linkage with another violation in order to criminalize mutilation.  Interestingly, only in these two cases, of murder and mutilation (as well as maiming, which is not explicitly listed in common Article 3), is the linkage required in the compromise bill.  <br /><br />One of the most significant common Article 3 violations associated with the so-called war on terror and the detainment practices at Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib and elsewhere at U.S.-controlled facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan and the secret prisons acknowledged recently by President Bush, is "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment." Yet the compromise bill excludes both the "outrages upon personal dignity" and "humiliating&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;treatment" prongs of that offense, although i
t does include far too narrowly defined "grave breaches" of rape and sexual assault or abuse.  There is also a reiteration of the prohibition on "cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment" found in the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, but the definition invoked is not a precise overlay with the totality of violations found in common Article 3(1)(c) of the Geneva Conventions.  These exclusions rip the gut out of the War Crimes Act.<br /> <br />Finally, the common Article 3 violation of necessary judicial procedures (listed as (5) above) also is excluded from the compromise bill.  The proposed amendment would insulate officials responsible for the old and newly proposed military commissions, regardless of their deficiencies as due process courts, and protect from prosecution anyone who creates a kangaroo court or no tribunal at all in the future and then passes a sentence or carries out an execution without a prior credible judicial judgment.  <br /><br />Even under the most docile interpretation of Article 129 of the Third Geneva Convention, which requires the United States to take "measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the provisions of the present Convention other than the grave breaches&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;," the compromise bill's audacious stripping of whole categories of common Article 3 violations from the War Crimes Act would be viewed as an act of implicitly promoting, rather than suppressing, those violations in light of their criminal content during the last decade.<br /><br />The compromise legislation further states, "No foreign or international sources of law shall supply a basis for a rule of decision in the courts of the United States in interpreting the prohibitions enumerated in subsection 2441(d) [which would be the new list of defined 'grave breaches' of common Article 3]."  This blatant act of censorship of federal judges in their scholarship and judgments not only reveals how intimidated the Bush Administration and its Republican allies on Capitol Hill are by foreign and international law, but its constitutionality will be, and should be, challenged.  This is not a new initiative, as there has long been legislation in the House of Representatives to achieve the same result for all federal court opinions.  Some federal judges and Supreme Court justices have angered conservative pundits, legislators, and legal scholars by occasionally daring to refer to foreign or international law developments in their written opinions.  <br /><br />Since common Article 3 has been extensively examined and its meaning discussed in many decisions by the international criminal tribunals and foreign courts and in the commentaries of the Geneva Conventions by the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as by foreign legal scholars, it would be the height of arrogance and folly to completely ignore that body of work and presume that all wisdom regarding common Article 3 resides in the relatively shallow vessel of pertinent U.S. law and sources, including American legal scholars.  (What if a prior federal judgment cites a foreign or international source?  Is the court prohibited from citing the federal case which has embodied within it foreign or international sources, either in the text or in a footnote?  What if an American law professor's article about common Article 3 in an American law school's law review similarly cites a foreign or international law source?  The absurdities abound.) After all, Common Article 3 is international law and the codified law of many foreign nations and international criminal tribunals, so any attempt to interpret it without any opportunity to refer to the sources of international and foreign law would be nonsensical and silly (see David Scheffer, <a href="/forumy/2006/06/hamdan-v-rumsfeld-supreme-court.php">Hamdan v. Rumsfeld: The Supreme Court Affirms International Law</a>).<br /><br />If the compromise bill becomes law with these and other deficient provisions (see Jordan Paust, <a href="/forumy/2006/09/unsafe-harbor-gop-compromise-on.php">Unsafe Harbor: The GOP Compromise on Detainee Treatment</a>), the United States should fully expect some governments (particularly our adversaries) to take the cue and amend their own laws or adjust their conduct towards American captives so as to grant their own interrogators and personnel the carve-outs we have so generously afforded ourselves.  Some governments may interpret a broader coverage of common Article 3 or seize the first opportunity to enforce the provision against U.S. personnel so as to uphold a higher notion of the rule of law.   Even non-governmental actors, such as militia and terrorist groups, will be emboldened in their illegal conduct.  Our pleas for justice and fairness will land on a growing number of deaf ears.  All this only will heighten the considerable risks U.S. military and other government personnel already assume when deployed overseas.  The Bush Administration has never answered to these simple realities.  <br /><br /> <br /><em>David Scheffer is the Mayer, Brown, Rowe &amp; Maw/Robert A.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/krooseve/">Kermit Roosevelt</a> of the University of Pennsylvania Law School says that the question of whether the US government can seize aliens and put them beyond the reach of law goes to the heart of who we are and what we want to become...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kermitroosevelt.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>oday, October 5, law schools, colleges and seminaries around the country are hosting a <a href="http://law.shu.edu/guantanamoteachin/guantanamo.htm">Guantanamo teach-in</a>, a national effort to shed light on the questions raised by the detention of alleged "enemy combatants" in the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay.  There are certainly many questions to which the public deserves answers.  Who are the detainees?   What are we doing to them?  And are we giving them any real chance to prove their innocence? <br /><br /> But there is a more fundamental question that is worth considering first and that may illuminate some of the others, or at least affect the way we think about them. The first question we should be asking is why we are talking about Guantanamo at all. Why are these matters being debated in the context of a U.S. naval base located in, of all places, Cuba?<br /><br /> The answer is quite simple, and it was stated cleanly by Justice Antonin Scalia, dissenting in <em>Rasul v. Bush</em>.  By holding that aliens detained in Guantanamo could seek review of their detention by filing habeas petitions in federal court, Scalia wrote, the Supreme Court had "subject[ed] Guantanamo Bay to the oversight of the federal courts even though it has never before been thought to be within their jurisdiction&#8212;and thus ma[de] it a foolish place to have housed alien wartime detainees."  Had <em>Rasul</em> gone the other way, that is, Guantanamo would have been a wise place to house detainees.  It would have been wise because there would have been no possibility of judicial oversight.<br /><br /> Why would that be?  Scalia's argument relied on what is known as the presumption against extraterritoriality&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the principle that in the absence of express indication, federal law does not apply to conduct abroad.  Historically, the principle applied not only to federal statutes but also to the Constitution, so that, as the Supreme Court put it in the 1891 case <em>In re Ross</em>, "[t]he Constitution can have no operation in another country."  Guantanamo seemed like an ideal place for detentions because its inmates would have neither constitutional rights regulating their treatment by the government, nor the ability to use federal courts to enforce any other rights (such as those available under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions) that they might have.<br /><br /> The conclusion is troubling, of course.  There have been many complaints about the "law-free zone" or "legal black hole" that the executive branch sought to create, and I will get to that point soon.  But the spectacle of the government choosing to detain people in a particular location primarily, if not solely, in order to evade legal restrictions deserves attention in its own right.  In a nation committed to the rule of law, this is alarming behavior.  Law is supposed to be a good thing, and obedience to it is desirable on the part not just of individuals but also of the government.  The fact that the government is bound by law is one of the distinguishing features of the American system.  A strategic choice to take advantage of a territorial limitation on constitutional rights is not the sort of behavior that should be applauded.<br /><br /> But does that territorial limitation even exist?  In 1891 the Supreme Court certainly thought so, but in 1957 it changed its mind.  In the case of <em>Reid v. Covert</em>, the Court held that Americans abroad still enjoyed the protections of the Constitution in their interactions with the U.S. government.  Territoriality no longer controls with respect to Americans.  The Court has suggested that it still does with respect to non-citizens, but having renounced territoriality as a general theory, it no longer has much of an explanation why it should apply only to aliens.  Citizens and non-citizens alike are protected by the Constitution within the U.S., unless the language of a particular provision restricts its application, so why should geography make a difference?<br /><br /> This question may not have much relevance for the Guantanamo detainees.  Guantanamo is subject to complete United States jurisdiction and control, and the Supreme Court in <em>Rasul</em> seemed ready to treat it as part of the United States for constitutional purposes. But it does have relevance for aliens detained in locations that are less controversially abroad, and also, perhaps, for how we think about the entire venture of extraterritorial detention. (Perhaps not as much relevance as it used to, given the recent Military Commissions Act limiting judicial review for aliens.)<br /><br /> The presumption against extraterritoriality comes from the somewhat esoteric field of conflict of laws.  In that field, however, it has been largely abandoned in favor of a more flexible analysis that determines the scope of rights by inquiring into their purposes.  Rights are created for reasons, and modern conflicts thinking suggests that the way to determine who should be able to assert them is to ask whether their assertion would promote the reasons behind them.<br /><br /> The most relevant constitutional provision is probably the Due Process Clause, which the Supreme Court used in the domestic context to stamp out abusive police interrogation practices.  So one useful way to think about extraterritorial detentions is to ask what the purpose of the Due Process Clause is.<br /><br /> That purpose is not just to protect citizens; if it were, the clause would presumably contain an explicit restriction, as some clauses do.  Indeed, the Supreme Court has made clear that it protects non-citizens within the United States.  It might well be that the extension of due process rights to such people can be explained in terms of benefits for citizens&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;aliens are more likely to immigrate or travel here if they have some protection against official brutality.  But I like to think that another concern stems from the nature of the United States government as the creation and servant of the people.  Everything the government does, it does in our name; every power it wields, we have given it.  The Due Process Clause, on this view, reflects a judgment that we do not want the government to behave arbitrarily or despotically, that we want governmental power to remain subordinate to the rule of law.  <br /><br /> Whether this view of the Due Process Clause is correct is of course an open question.  It is one that we struggle with every time some emergency seems to present a threat best dealt with by unfettered executive discretion.  The American identity changes over the years, as generation succeeds generation, and the choice we are making now will do much to define it for the near future.   Whether our government can seize the citizens of allied countries and place them beyond the reach of any law is from one perspective a technical legal question.  From another, it is the uniquely persistent question for a self-governing people, that of who we are, and who we want to be.<br /><br /><br /><em>Kermit Roosevelt is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he teaches constitutional law. His most recent book is </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300114680/ref=pd_rvi_gw_1/104-5679570-6915147?ie=UTF8">The Myth of Judicial Activism</a>.<em></em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/bransond.php">Douglas Branson</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that a comparison of the Andrew Fastow and Bernard Ebbers corporate fraud cases suggests that the sentences handed down for the two former high-flying executives - 6 and 25 years respectively - are unduly disparate and even perhaps backwards...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/douglasbranson.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>F</strong></font>or Andrew Fastow, the wrongdoing CFO of Enron, Tuesday, September 26 was the best of times and the worst of times.  It was the latter because he had his last embrace with wife Leah until 6 years pass, during which time he will be incarcerated.  Those 6 years follow a year's separation that occurred when Leah was in jail for her Enron-related crimes.  Fastow will also be apart from his two sons, who are middle school age but will be college-age when the prison releases their father.<br /><br /> But also it was the best of times.  Fastow earned $46 million, over and above Enron salary and other compensation, acting as general partner of LJM1 and LJM2.  He created the LJM partnerships Fastow to provide seed capital to special purpose entities (SPEs).  Fastow then moved assets, and related debts, to the SPEs, off Enron's books.  Enron thus preserved a decent credit rating, enabling it to borrow money at reasonable rates, postponing its comeuppance.  Fastow will keep some of that money, even though most of the gain was secret, and illicit.<br /><br /> Federal Judge Hoyt sentenced Fastow to 6 years.  The plea bargain agreement with federal prosecutors had called for 10.  Department of Justice sentencing guidelines, which federal judges are scrupulously to follow, called for Fastow to do 40 years, which would have sent him to prison for life. <br /><br /> By contrast, Tuesday was the worst of times for Bernie Ebbers, the ex-CEO of WorldCom, Inc.  Ebbers, 65 years old, reported to a federal prison to begin serving a 25 years sentence, which federal judge Barbara Jones decreed last Spring.  The odds are that Ebbers will spend his life in jail.  Ebbers will be in jail not only when Fastow is playing golf at his country club but when Fastow is playing shuffleboard as well.  As a corporate governance expert, I ask myself the question: shouldn't it be the other way around?  Is a band somewhere playing "The World Turned Upside Down."<br /><br /> Let's compare the two cases:<br /><br /> 1.  <strong>End Result.</strong>  Fastow helped build a house of cards, very little of which exists today, save for a small trading operation and ex-subsidiary Portland General Electric.  By moving 54 % of Enron's debts off books, and by leading the way to accounting recognition of hundreds of millions in false profits, Fastow was absolutely instrumental in creation of the house of cards part.  Investors lost $60 billion.<br /><br /> Ebbers built a substantial company, which started as a long distance discount reseller.  Sixteen years and 60 acquisitions later WorldCom operated in 50 countries, supplied 60% of the Internet backbone, and was the number two long distance provider in the United States.  It merged from bankruptcy court as MCI, Inc., a viable, substantial company that later became part of Verizon.  The only reason for a bankruptcy is that banks pulled a $9 billion line of credit from WorldCom after the accounting irregularities came to light in June, 2002.  WorldCom's directors than had no choice but to enter bankruptcy.  Investors lost $30 billion, arguably due to what the banks did, but, in the securities law class action, some WorldCom investors recovered approximately $8.5 of $17 million.  And WorldCom, with a different name, is still there.<br /><br />2.  <strong>Motivation.</strong>  Fastow kept his compensation secret because it was obscene in amount.  Only when a director asked him point blank, in October, 2003, did Fastow reveal the $46 million number.  Greed motivated Andrew Fastow.<br /><br /> Ebbers had his back to the wall.  He had borrowed $250 million from Bank of America to purchase WorldCom stock.  Ebbers's holding reached $900 million in early 2000.  Ebbers not only encouraged but enforced a laudatory policy that WorldCom executives did not sell WorldCom stock except in the direst of circumstances.  Then, in April 2000, the stock market began a 28 month slide that would see the market overall lose 40% of its value and the NASDAQ lose 70%.   In September, 2000, as WorldCom's stock price fell, Bank of America called on Ebbers to increase the collateral or pay down the loan.  Rather than sell stock, Ebbers convinced compensation committee chair Stiles Kellett to lend him $125 million of corporate funds.  By April, 2002, Ebbers owed the company $300 million.  How it got to $405 million is another, often mistold, story.<br /><br /> Ebbers became a victim of his own policies, policies that many governance and management gurus praise, that is, that corporate executives should own large segments of the corporation they manage.  Greed was in the background certainly, but Ebbers became trapped by a policy he had created and that motivated him.<br /><br /> 3.  <strong>Knowledge. </strong> Andrew Fastow has a Masters in Business Administration from the Kellogg School at Northwestern University, rated the country's best MBA program in many polls.  He served in successive more important posts at Continental Illinois Bank before he moved to Enron.  He is an extremely sophisticated financial engineer whose cleverness knows few bounds.<br /><br /> At 6 feet, 8 inches, Bernie Ebbers came from Canada to tiny Mississippi College to play basketball.  After college he coached basketball and got into the motel business.  Later he formed a company to sell discount cards for long distance calling.  Aside from building WorldCom, his only other activity was driving the tractor on his Arkansas rice farm.  Ebbers may be a smart man but he is light years behind Andrew Fastow in education, background, knowledge, and perhaps sophistication.<br /><br /> 4.  <strong>Secrecy.</strong>  Fastow piled up the money because he knew no one, including the directors on the finance committee, whose job it was to monitor him, was watching.  Ebbers's financial difficulties were disclosed to the WorldCom board every step of the way, or nearly so.  The compensation committee did not disclose the initial September $125 million loans until November, 2000, but board members all stated that they would have approved the loans anyway because they thought that Ebbers was so valuable to the company, at least at the time.<br /><br /> 5.  <strong>The Evidence.</strong>  I read the transcripts of the Ebbers criminal trial, as it occurred.  I thought the prosecution had not laid a glove on him.  It was CFO Scott Sullivan's word  against CEO Ebbers's version of events and of the management arrangements at WorldCom.  Flip a coin as to whom you would believe.  Sullivan testified that Ebbers knew that Sullivan first poached line cost reserves and then capitalized line costs to lower expenses, making WorldCom appear profitable when it was not.  Ebbers testified that he looked after sales and revenues and ways in which to grow the company; CFO Sullivan had exclusive control over and knowledge of the cost side of things.  Ebbers knew nothing.  Post trial the jurors reasoned, or speculated, "Ebbers was the CEO, he must have known."<br /><br /> Had Fastow gone to trial dozens of persons would have testified against him.  They were willing and unwilling participants in Fastow's schemes.  All of them would have testified further as to Fastow's greed, his stealth, and his knowledge of what he was about every minute.<br /><br /> What do we learn from this?  One, corporate CEOs are much like ship captains: they may be blamed for everything that happens on their wat
ch, whether they are complicit or not.  Two, the much ballyhooed Department of Justice guidelines mean nothing in high profile white collar crime cases.  They don't prevent lynching the less blameworthy; they also permit a mere slap on the wrist to the greedy, the sophisticated, and the stealthy if they turn state's evidence.  Three, Ebbers should serve roughly the same as, or only a little more, or even a little less, time than should Andrew Fastow, at least if we are concerned about doing justice.<br /><br /><br /><em>Douglas M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/samaha/">Adam Samaha</a> of the University of Chicago Law School says that this Term&#39;s US Supreme Court cases will likely reveal whether we have a new boss on the Court who can push its decisions in new directions, or whether we have an old boss in the form of precedent slowing drives for change...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/adamsamaha.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>N</strong></font>ow that the spectacle of the latest judicial confirmations is well and truly behind us, we are down to the business of identifying meaningful change at the Supreme Court as it opens its new Term.  The two should not be confused.<br /><br />True, Court personnel changes might make for good television.  (Think Robert Bork, not Ruth Ginsburg.)  Plus changes in the cast of characters open possibilities for unanticipated season finales.   But new faces do not always foreshadow new outcomes.  And old faces may develop new complexions.  If we want to predict how the new ensemble will decide its cases, we have to forecast locations of power within the Court.<br /><br />These locations are not marked with a title.  Nobody should automatically stamp a Court lineup with the Chief Justice's surname.  Sometimes the name fits, but often it is even less helpful than using the decade as a unit of analysis.  The 1960s seem to have ended in <a href="http://loki.stockton.edu/~greggr/thrill.htm">1972</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960s">later</a>.  And for every John Marshall there is a Fred Vinson, for every Sherman Minton a William Brennan.<br /><br />A justice's ability to persuade colleagues is one component of power, but this is difficult for outsiders to measure.  Identifying the "swing justice" is an alternative.  Academics might use sophisticated <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=276370">models</a> to isolate the swing justice(s).  The basic idea, however, is simple.  It is the most likely fifth vote out of nine, and sometimes this is transparent.  In closely divided cases, rock-solid votes lose importance.  The Hamlets of the Court matter most.  In fact, this seems more true for cases than elections.  Turnout tends to be 100% at the Court so nobody gets an edge for better get-out-the-vote efforts.<br /><br />Who will play Hamlet most often, or in cases deemed important?  Data from last Term suggest at least two candidates for the role.<br /><br />John Roberts was in just about as many five-vote coalitions as was Anthony Kennedy &#8212; and certainly not because Roberts has the better title.  Furthermore, Roberts has <a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/webcast/eventDetail.cfm?eventID=144">stated</a> a preference for narrow rulings.  Only he joined in full Justice Breyer's campaign finance <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-1528.ZO.html">opinion</a>, for example.  It condemned Vermont's limits on contributions and expenditures, yet appeared to maintain the general approach of past decisions.  On this issue Kennedy is the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-1528.ZC1.html">aggressor</a>.  Indeed he has staked out other strident-sounding positions for <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-1682.ZO.html">speech regulation</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-241.ZD1.html">affirmative action</a>, and sometimes the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0492_0573_ZX2.html">establishment clause</a>.<br /><br />Yet there is a developing reluctance to use such information to predict Kennedy's behavior.  Some believe Kennedy enjoys attention and power &#8212; that he will reserve enough ideological flexibility to be the swing voter in marquee cases while he cultivates a good reputation among the elite.  On this theory Kennedy will be the new Sandra Day O'Connor, because he is closest philosophically to that slot already and because he will be willing to move there anyway.  As a practical matter, then, Samuel Alito's confirmation hearings were about replacing the old Kennedy, not O'Connor.<br /><br />This understanding of Kennedy could be correct.  Roberts might be playing nice while shifting Right.  And Kennedy was apparently the fifth vote in several high-profile cases last Term, like <em><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-184.ZC1.html">Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</a></em>.  As for the Justice's aspirations and psychological needs, there can be only competing speculation.<br /><br />This helps swing-voter enthusiasts select a few pending cases to watch carefully.  Focusing on constitutional law:<br /><br />1.  The Court will address the ability of school districts to consider <a href="http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003697.php">student race</a> when populating oversubscribed schools.  The districts' goal is to provide some parental choice while avoiding racially homogenous schools.  Kennedy could soften his opposition to race-based government action in this setting, or possibly forfeit the swing vote.  Advocates might then see a chance to sway Roberts or Alito, in light of partly favorable <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-241.ZO.html">precedent</a> on graduate school affirmative action.<br /><br />2.  The Court will revisit <a href="http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003376.php">partial-birth abortions</a>, this time reviewing a federal ban.  The prior lineup struck down an almost identical state legislative effort, 5-4, with Kennedy in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-830.ZD2.html">dissent</a>.  This is another situation in which the new justices might be bigger swingers, at least if precedent matters and they would otherwise let the statute stand.  In fact, Clarence Thomas might have been the swing voter if the case had been framed differently.  It is not clear he could honestly find a grant to Congress of regulatory <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1454.ZD1.html">authority</a> over most abortions.<br /><br />3.  The Court also has a <a href="http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003687.php">punitive damages</a> case involving the death of a cigarette smoker.  Kennedy has used constitutional law to trim back punitive damages <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/01-1289.ZO.html">before</a>.  But it could be that Roberts and Alito have no such inclination &#8212; just like Scalia, Thomas, and Ginsburg.  Two of those three see intervention here as little different from Court protection of abortion, and none of them seem ready to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/search/display.html?terms=state%20farm&url=/supct/html/01-1289.ZS.html">cave</a>.  The issue therefore tests the strength of still more pre-Roberts precedent.  And it comes with the fun of media-unfriendly coalitions of justices.<br /><br />There is bound to be drama as we learn whether we have a new boss who can push Court decisions in new directions.  Or whether we have an old boss in the form of precedent slowing drives for change.  Or whether we have an old boss in the form of Sandra Day O'Connor body-snatching one or more sitting justices.<br /><br />It is worth noting, however, that the titillating search for today's swing justice can be a crippling distraction if you are interested in meaningful change.  Visible drama is just not the same as revolution.  Talk to Mr. Hamdan about his Court victory in light of the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a>.<br /><br />We should be asking not only who is swinging, but within what confines.  We should be looking for not only particular decisions, but what counts as a conceivable outcome.  The new justices will undoubtedly have an effect on the Court's direction.  But so far and compared to recent years,
neither the questions nor the likely answers seem radically new.<br /><br />About 35 years ago, the justices saw a quite different set of options.  There was a choice between prohibiting capital punishment and mending-but-not-ending it.  There was a choice between defending welfare beneficiaries with procedure alone and holding that the benefits themselves were required.  There was a choice about deregulating abortion but protecting consensual gay sex was not yet in view.<br /><br />We live in a distinct constitutional world, and the feasible options will have shifted again 35 years from now.  There is no perfect algorithm for predicting that new option set, much less an assurance the justices will have much control over the matter.  But it is a fact that the personnel dramas of the Court can be a meaningless sideshow.  And on that point, I would not want anyone to be fooled (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Won%27t_Get_Fooled_Again">again</a>).<br /><br /><br /><em>Adam M. Samaha is an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School, and a former law clerk to Justice John Paul Stevens.  His latest article is </em><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=930716">Undue Process</a><em></em><br />

The question is <strong>who</strong> has been committing these crimes for the last three years?  It is this very government which has orchestrated and committed these crimes, continuing them even today. Dare we wait for the perpetrator to protect its victims?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/"><strong>Thomas Nash</strong></a> [Cluster Munition Coalition Coordinator]: &quot;The increasing evidence of humanitarian harm from cluster munitions used during the recent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is the latest example of a consistent pattern of civilian suffering documented over the last 40 years. Whether it has been the goverment of Sudan against armed factions in south Sudan, Ethiopian use against Eritrean refugee camps, Russian use against Chechen forces, US use in Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, UK use in Kosovo or Iraq, <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/un-humanitarian-chief-accuses-israel.php">Israeli use in Lebanon</a> or now, reportedly, <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/rights-group-says-hezbollah-used.php">Hezbollah use in northern Israel</a>, the impact is the same: unnecessary deaths and injuries during attacks and a deadly threat to lives and livelihoods for decades afterwards.<br /><br />The legality of the use of cluster munitions is contested. Legal opinions range from their use being inherently illegal, conditionally illegal, conditionally legal, or requiring no specific provisions. Belgium has banned the weapon and Norway has declared a moratorium. The ICRC has called for a legally binding instrument on cluster munitions, prohibiting their use in populated areas and ending the use altogether of &#39;inaccurate and unreliable&#39; types. Key user states have argued that the use of cluster munitions is legal and that the right balance has been struck between military necessity and humanitarian concern. Yet they have made no effort to understand the humanitarian impact and have dismissed evidence gathered by humanitarian organisations. The only reason these indiscriminate weapons are still considered legal is that the international community has failed to take the necessary action and render them illegal. If the international community has a genuine commitment to the protection of civilians from the effects of armed conflict such action must be undertaken.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>His Excellency <a href="http://www.turkishembassy.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=74"><strong>Nabi Sensoy</strong></a>, Ambassador of the Republic of Turkey [<a href="http://www.turkishembassy.org/index.php">Turkish Embassy, Washington DC</a>]: &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2006/10/turkey-urges-eu-to-oppose-french-bill.php">During the First World War</a> the Ottoman government was fighting  for survival against the Entente powers. A situation of extreme danger existed as a result of  serious military setbacks. Many Armenians sided with the enemy and for the defeat of the Ottoman Empire. They were actively engaged in subversive activities and in armed fight against the Ottoman army. Thus the Armenian people had thrown in their lot with the Entente cause and were arrayed against the Ottoman forces in a fateful struggle. Used by Russians in their armed hostilities with the Ottoman Empire in eastern Anatolia and by the British and the French in Cilicia, the Armenians were without doubt a threat to security. The Ottoman government had to secure its position by removing the Armenians from strategic points where they were  assisting the enemy and were attacking the civilian population. The Sublime Porte did not instruct or plan the annihilation of the Armenian population in 1915, as some argue. What it did was to order the relocation of the Armenians from areas made sensitive by the progress of war. <br /><br />Since genocide is now a technical term in international law, the definition established by the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948 has assumed prima-facie authority, and it is with this definition that one should assess the applicability of the concept of genocide to the Armenian events of 1915. The initial phrase of Article 2 of the convention addresses the fundamental element of the crime of genocide, that is, the &#39;intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.&#39; Practically all legal scholars accept the centrality of this clause. Genocide thus covers a precisely-defined range of prohibited conduct only when that conduct is intentionally undertaken. Up to now no direct and objective evidence of malicious intention in the Armenian case is manifest. Ottoman archives in Istanbul are replete with government decrees and regulations proving the contrary. As the classification process is completed, more documents are becoming available to researchers. Access to the Ottoman archives through the Internet is possible. On 10 April 2005 Turkey extended an invitation to Armenia to establish a joint commission consisting of historians and other experts from the two countries to study the events of 1915 not only in the archives of Turkey and Armenia but also in the archives of all relevant the third countries and to share their findings with the international public. The Armenian government has so far failed to accept the call.&quot;<br />

The motion recites, from the point of view of Jose Padilla, his detention at the US Navy Brig in Charleston, South Carolina.  If the facts are as alleged, it describes a harrowing experience:<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Padilla was threatened with being forcibly removed from the United States to another country, including U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he was threatened his fate would be even worse than in the Naval Brig.  He was threatened with being cut with a knife and having alcohol poured on the wounds.  He was also threatened with imminent execution.  He was hooded and forced to stand in stress positions for long durations of time.  He was forced to endure exceedingly long interrogation sessions, without adequate sleep, wherein he would be confronted with false information, scenarios, and documents to further disorient him.  Often he had to endure multiple interrogators who would scream, shake, and otherwise assault Mr. Padilla.  Additionally, Mr. Padilla was given drugs against his will, believed to be some form of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or phencyclidine (PCP), to act as a sort of truth serum during his interrogations.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>An American citizen, treated like this in America, by the American government!<br />

Mr. Munaf maintains his innocence.  According to Mr. Munaf&#39;s Iraqi counsel, two American military officials appeared during the proceeding, met privately with the judge outside the presence of Mr. Munaf, his co-defendants and their counsel, and demanded Mr. Munaf receive the death penalty.  After the ex parte meeting, the judge rendered the verdict and death sentence.<br /><br />Mr. Munaf has been in American custody for the past 16 months and has been subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment by U.S. and other officials.  The U.S. government has maintained that Mr. Munaf cannot invoke the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the federal courts to challenge his prolonged detention by the United States and threatened transfer by the United States to Iraq because the U.S. is operating as part of a multinational force in Iraq.   On October 13, 2006, Mr. Munaf&#39;s counsel sought emergency relief in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, to temporarily enjoin his transfer until the court could properly adjudicate his habeas petition and his claim that his detention and threatened transfer violate the Constitution and laws of the United States. <br /><br />Mr. Munaf&#39;s detention and transfer by the United States for certain death without judicial review and an opportunity by heard would not only deny him fundamental due process but would also jeopardize the fundamental guarantees secured to American citizens by habeas corpus and the Constitution.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong>David Becker</strong></a> [Senior Attorney, <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/">People for the American Way Foundation</a>]: &quot;Last week Missouri&#39;s Supreme Court, with only one justice dissenting, upheld long-standing constitutional and legal principles in <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/missouri-high-court-rejects-voter-id.php">striking down Missouri&#39;s restrictive voter ID law</a>.  Though the state claimed that the law was necessary to combat alleged voter impersonation fraud, the facts were undisputed that voter impersonation fraud is not a problem in Missouri.  In fact, Gov. Matt Blunt (R), a supporter of the voter ID law, himself declared that the 2002 and 2004 elections in Missouri were &quot;fraud-free.&quot;<br /><br />Furthermore, the ID requirement expressly excludes those voting by absentee ballot, where even voter ID advocates agree voter impersonation fraud is most likely to occur, if it exists at all.  Thus, rather than preventing such fraud, the exclusion of absentee ballots from the requirement actually provides a road map for the commission of such fraud.<br /><br />Finally, voter ID laws like Missouri&#39;s place severe burdens on voters, and those burdens are most heavily placed on those least likely to be able to bear such a burden -- minorities, poor, and the elderly.  Both Democratic and Republican state officials agreed that at least 135,000 eligible Missouri voters did not have the requisite ID to cast a ballot necessary to obtain such an ID -- birth certificates, passports, etc. -- costs money, which is a tremendous burden on a low-income voter, and effectively creates a poll tax, in violation of constitutional principles.<br /><br />Missouri&#39;s Supreme Court has served the citizens of Missouri admirably, in protecting and reaffirming their fundamental right to vote free of burdensome bureaucratic barriers.&quot;<br />

In the first case, a 60-year old woman from Berlin claimed that VIOXX caused her cardiac arrhythmia. The second case involved the claim of a 61-year-old man from Berlin who sued the company over a heart attack.  <br /><br />We believe this is the correct ruling. Each case presents a different set of facts and a different medical history.  This is why we intend to address them one by one over the coming years. The company acted responsibly every step of the way &#8212; from researching the drug prior to approval &#8212; to monitoring the medicine while it was on the market &#8212; to voluntarily withdrawing the drug in September 2004.<br /><br />To date, there have been 10 cases that have proceeded to trial in the United States.  In six of those cases, juries returned verdicts in Merck&#39;s favor.  A state judge set aside one of those six verdicts.  In the four cases resulting in a plaintiffs verdict, Merck already has filed an appeal or sought judicial review.  In one of those four cases, a federal judge overturned the damage award.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lawyerscomm.org/2005website/aboutus/staff/staffgreenbaum.html"><strong>Jon Greenbaum</strong></a> [Voting Rights Project Director, <a href="http://www.lawyerscomm.org/2005website/home/home.html">Lawyers&#39; Committee for Civil Rights Under Law</a>]: &quot;Since the 2004 election, one disturbing trend in election law has been the enactment of laws requiring voters to provide government-issued <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/missouri-high-court-rejects-voter-id.php">voter identification</a> in order to cast ballot or documentation of citizenship in order to register.  These laws, which have been enacted in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, and Missouri, have the impact of disfranchising millions of voters who do not have the required identification and are not able take the time and pay the money to get the identification.  In passing these laws, legislators have claimed that they are necessary to prevent voter fraud without any facts to support their claims.  Information obtained through court cases has revealed that voter impersonation, the specific type of voter fraud prevented by requiring government-issued identification to vote, is not a problem in any of these states.  Instead, politicians are using these laws as a device to maintain their own incumbencies by keeping certain types of voters &#8212; the elderly, minorities, the poor, and students &#8212; out of the political process.<br /><br />Thankfully, several courts have struck down these laws.  Most recently, on October 16, the Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed the trial court&#39;s ruling that Missouri&#39;s government-issued photo identification voting requirement violated the equal protection clause of the Missouri constitution in Weinschenk v. State of Missouri.  The Supreme Court found that the identification provisions constitute &quot;a heavy and substantial burden on Missourians&#39; free exercise of their right to vote&quot; because of the money and effort required to procure the necessary identification and the number of people who did not have the required identification (between 169,000 and 240,000).  In assessing the government&#39;s justification, the Court noted that the preexisting identification requirements, which required voters to provide identification but not necessarily photo identification, had been sufficient to prevent voter impersonation, and so the law was not necessary to justify such a burden it exacts on Missouri voters.  By carefully weighing through the evidence and faithfully applying the law, the Missouri Supreme Court saw the government-issued photo identification requirement for what it is: an unneeded modern day poll tax.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong>David Miner</strong></a> [attorney for US Army Sgt. <a href="http://www.sdmcc.org/rickyclousing/">Ricky Clousing</a>, an Iraq war objector who recently pleaded guilty to going AWOL]: &quot;A growing number of soldiers question whether they can honorably serve in support of the war in Iraq.  My client Ricky Clousing confronted this question after a five month deployment to Iraq ending in April 2005.  In June of 2005, Ricky left his Fort Bragg unit after experiencing a &#39;crisis of conscience&#39; stirred by his time in Iraq with the 82nd Airborne Division.  Last week, under a plea agreement, Ricky Clousing <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/us-soldier-disputing-iraq-war-legality.php">pleaded guilty to absence without leave</a>.  During sentencing proceedings, Ricky offered his personal observations of deliberate and systemic abuse perpetrated by U.S. troops as the reason for his unauthorized absence.  The military judge, operating within a unique feature of military justice, returned a sentence of 11 months of confinement, before referencing the plea agreement term that restricted the general from approving any confinement in excess of 3 months.   <br /><br />As illustrated by these divergent numbers, the Army faced a dilemma in this case.  It seeks to instill the &quot;Army values&quot; of integrity, honesty and personal moral courage.  Ricky exemplified these values during his time in Iraq by reporting the abuses he witnessed.  In his conclusion that the war and occupation conflicted with his moral beliefs and required separation from the military, Ricky applied &quot;Army values&quot; to the disapproval of the Army.  Ricky faced the stark choice to violate his conscience or violate the law.  He could not apply for conscientious objector status because he could not honestly state he was opposed to participation in all wars.  <br /><br />The solution to the dilemma Ricky and the Army faced is a law that permits conscientious objection to a particular war.  A democratic society should allow its soldiers freedom of conscience.  Soldiers who volunteer to defend our freedom of conscience should not be required to forfeit their own consciences upon enlistment.  This proposal would not likely have significant adverse effects upon the military&#39;s mission.  But if such a law would limit our government&#39;s ability to engage in wars of choice, it would be valuable not just for Ricky, but for our nation as a whole.&quot;<br />

		<title>Lawyers to blame for HP pretexting</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thecorporatelibrary.com/marketing/management.asp"><strong>Nell Minow</strong></a> [Editor and Co-founder, <a href="http://www.thecorporatelibrary.com/default.asp">The Corporate Library</a>]: &quot;The board of Hewlett-Packard, a serial offender with a record of colossal poor judgment in the selection, overpayment, and departure package of CEO Carly Fiorina and in its massive mishandling of the fight over the Compaq merger, <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/ousted-hp-execs-surrender-on-felony.php">leapt from the frying pan into the fire</a> when it tried to clean up its act.  The most fundamental requirement for board effectiveness is trust, the ability to communicate in an atmosphere of candor and confidentiality.  When a director chooses to leak proprietary information about <a href="http://news.com.com/HP+outlines+long-term+strategy/2100-1014_3-6029519.html?tag=nl">strategic deliberations</a>, including possible acquisitions, it damages the company&#39;s ability to plan and compete and destroys the ability of the board to function in any capacity.<br /><br />What is a chairman to do under those circumstances?  Any list of best practices would advise the chairman to first speak to each director and see if the leaking director wanted to confess, explain the rationale, and re-commit to the company&#39;s confidentiality standards.  If that was unsuccessful, the next step would be to retain an independent outside firm to investigate.  A chairman would have to obtain assurances that the investigation would comply with the law, but the chairman would also not be permitted to delve too deeply into the specifics of the investigative techniques to ensure that there was no special treatment; the credibility of the investigation would depend on treating all of the directors as potential suspects.  Prudence might require an outside certification of the legality of the procedures from counsel.<br /><br />This is pretty much what happened.  Pattie Dunn should not have tried to avoid responsibility.  Her argument that a &quot;Clever&quot; email response to a proposal to trick a reporter by creating a fake leaker was not approval, just a comment, because she had no line authority as Chairman of the board, was disingenuous.  But it was not a felony, and I predict a settlement of the pending charges.  CEO Mark Hurd has handled the situation as well as possible, accepting responsibility, providing clear, candid assessments of what went wrong, but subtly providing perspective to remind investors, employees, legislators, and regulators that this was a small, contained problem with no connection to financial disclosures or product safety that was quickly identified and corrected.<br /><br />The people who deserve the blame here are the lawyers.  Now-departed (with a generous severance package) General Counsel Ann Baskins and senior counsel and ethics(!) officer Kevin Hunsaker permitted the &quot;pretexting&quot; and fake leak initiatives.  Outside counsel Larry Sonsini&#39;s email exchange with a departed director neglected the single most important threshold question for any lawyer: &quot;Who is my client?&quot; His &quot;investigation&quot; into the legitimacy of the inquiry consisted of asking the very person he should have been double-checking.  The real disgrace in the Hewlett-Packard mess is the failure of the people the executives and board members relied on to provide the kind of counsel that is the core responsibility of members of the legal profession.  &quot;Pretexting&quot; is fraud and should be illegal.  But worse than any &quot;pretexting&quot; to obtain phone records was the pretense that the clients here were getting adequate and appropriate and honorable legal advice.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University]: &quot;The world will mourn today&#39;s <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/0/28.html?id_issue=11600925">brutal murder</a> of Russian journalist and human rights advocate <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero/politkovskaya.html">Anna Politkovaskay</a> in Moscow. In writing my book, <em>A Theory of International Terrorism</em> (2006), I relied on Anna Politkovaskaya&#39;s reports about the situation in Chechnya that she always delivered with passionate clarity. Below is the story of a man caught in the web of violence, a story in my words but derived from Politovaskaya&#39;s passion for truth:<BLOCKQUOTE>Anna Politkovskaya, a Russian journalist, writes in the vicinity of the Russian literary tradition, shared by Chekhov and Solzhenitsyn, which daringly exposes the horrors and atrocities unleashed in name of the motherland. In her book, <em>A Small Corner of Hell</em>, Politkovskaya describes the ordinary Chechen life in wartime. Though the book&#39;s narrative embodies fictional style and literary diction, the stories told with pitiless honesty are nonetheless real. One telling story is that of Vakha found lying on &quot;withered autumn grass&quot; along with hundreds of other fleeing Chechens while Russian helicopters &quot;fly so low that you can see the gunner&#39;s hands and faces.&quot; Women and children wail. With his mouth pressed to the ground and wearing a black suit with a white shirt and a black tie, Vakha tells his prostrating comrades, all folded up in the fetal position, how it is the folder that has saved his life. For &quot;every time the helicopters come, I take my folder, get out some paper, and pretend to write. This way the pilots believe that I am not a terrorist.&quot;<br /><br />Those who can hear him laugh, finding fault with his na&iuml;ve logic; says one, what if the pilots think &quot;you&#39;re taking down their license plate numbers.&quot; Vakha equipped with his life-saving folder is hoping to join his mother, wife, two unmarried sisters, and six children, all of whom fled a week ago. As helicopters circle above and machine guns shoot mercilessly in nearby fields, the folder jokes begin to multiply: &quot;Putin will wonder why all the Chechens are running around with folders.&quot; &quot;Vakha, what color should the folders be?&quot;  &quot;You don&#39;t know how lucky you are, man; they might think you&#39;re counting us. And that means you&#39;re on their side.&quot; Relishing the folder jokes and believing in a happy future, Vakha and his new buddies are slowly crawling toward the checkpoint. A bit tired, Vakha concedes that &quot;all is in Allah&#39;s hands&quot; but still insists that the folder has always helped him, in Russia&#39;s first war against Chechnya, and this one.  <br /><br />Perhaps exhausted from waiting in the long line, Vakha veers off into a nearby field infested with landmines. Within minutes, Vakha is dead in an explosion. He, however defined, is still lying on the ground but no more in the fetal position. His hands rest quietly several feet away from the shredded contents of his black jacket and his legs have vanished. His magic folder with its blank sheets has also turned into anonymous dust.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.freetrade.org/bios/griswold.html"><strong>Daniel T. Griswold</strong></a> [Director of the Center for Trade Policy Study, <a href="http://www.cato.org/">Cato Institute</a>]: &quot;The 700-mile, $1.2-billion <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/mexico-may-seek-un-intervention-in-us.php">wall along the U.S.-Mexican border</a> that Congress authorized before leaving town will not stem the flow of illegal immigrants to the United States. It will be an expensive, ugly band-aid. We built several miles of walls through urban areas in the 1990s, and it only succeeded in diverting the flow of migrants deeper into the desert. The new wall, whenever it is built, would still leave a good 1,000 miles of border unfenced. Like previous enforcement-only efforts, the wall will only succeed in raising smuggling fees and death rates as immigrants seek to enter through more remote regions. And it will do nothing to stop those who enter the country legally and overstay their visas.<br /><br />A truly effective response to illegal immigration must include a temporary worker program. The U.S. economy continues to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs each year for low-skilled workers, while the pool of Americans ready to fill those jobs continues to shrink. A temporary worker visa would allow peaceful, hardworking immigrants from Mexico and other countries to enter the United States through a safe, orderly, legal channel rather than sneaking across the desert. It would enable the U.S. government to focus its enforcement firepower on keeping out criminals and terrorists rather than would-be janitors and construction workers.&quot;<br />

		<title>Threats and counter-threats in violation of international law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University]: &quot;One great accomplishment of the 1945 UN Charter has been its prescription against the threats of use of armed force. Article 2(4) states: <em>&quot;All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.&quot;</em>  Note that the Charter prohibits both &quot;use&quot; and &quot;threat&quot; of force. Furthermore, it does not require that the threatened state be a UN member. Any threat of force against any state is prohibited.  <br /><br />Despite this unambiguous and comprehensive statement of law, Israel and Iran continue to violate Article 2(4). Returning from Moscow Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert warned that Iran would have &quot;a price to pay&quot; if it continues to pursue its nuclear program.  He did not specifically mention any military strike against Iran&#39;s nuclear infrastructure but warned that the Iranians &quot;have to be afraid&quot; of the consequences of their stubbornness.  It was unclear whether Olmert&#39;s threat referred to possible UN sanctions or unilateral Israeli military action. Contextually, in view of Israel&#39;s destruction of Iraq&#39;s nuclear plant 25 years ago, the threat against Iran carries the elements of military action. The threat addresses the people of Iran and not merely its government. It is framed to cause fear among the people of Iran that they could face death and destruction.  Since Israel has no basis to speak on behalf of the UN Security Council or the region, its threats are blatant violations of the UN Charter.   <br /><br />In responding to Olmert&#39;s threats, Iran has issued its own counterthreats. Speaking to a rally to mark Iran&#39;s &quot;Jerusalem Day&quot;, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad questioned the very existence of the state of Israel. Israel would soon disappear, said the President, since the people of the Middle East have reached &quot;a boiling point.&quot; One could argue that the extinction of the <em>state</em> of Israel does not necessarily imply death and destruction. After all, the Soviet Union disappeared without bloodshed. Still, the Iranian threats of &quot;wiping out Israel&quot; are not received in a benign manner since the possible use of force appears to be a strong component of the threat. These threats cause fear among the people of Israel who already know that they are not welcome in the region. <br /><br />Threats of the use of force are prohibited under the UN Charter since verbal threats often pave the way for a war. Fiery language can bare the mouths of guns.&quot;<br />

The US State Department deserves much of the credit not only for the text of the resolution but also for the skillful diplomacy, headed by Secretary Condoleezza Rice and Ambassador John Bolton, that has resulted in the fifteen-nation Security Council's unanimous vote.  <br /><br /> <strong>A.  The Global Question</strong><br /><br /> Before we get into specifics, a broad question that can be asked of this resolution is how can North Korea be legally forbidden to attain nuclear weapon capability when seven or eight states have already have arrived there?  (The members of the "have" nations are the United States, Great Britain, France, China, the Russian Federation, India, and Pakistan; Israel probably has nuclear capability but denies it.)  <br /><br /> The Resolution in its Preamble provides two answers to this question, the first of which is spurious but the second substantial.  The spurious answer is that North Korea's underground nuclear test of 9 October 2006 constitutes a "challenge" to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  However, North Korea has withdrawn from the Treaty.  What is the point of calling a withdrawal from a treaty a "challenge" to the treaty?  Under international law, a state party to a treaty has a right of withdrawal except for those few treaties that by their terms bar withdrawal: for example, treaties of peace do not permit withdrawal.  As for the Non-Proliferation Treaty itself, it specifically provides for withdrawal in Article X.  <br /><br /> The Resolution redeems itself by its second answer.  North Korea's decision to move from a have-not nuclear weapon nation to a have, poses a danger "to peace and stability in the region and beyond."  The Security Council therefore determines that "there is a clear threat to international peace and stability."  This "clear threat" phrase brings the Resolution under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, legally authorizing the Security Council to take "measures" against North Korea,  The "measures" are of two kinds, to which I will refer in a moment.<br /><br />  We have here a most interesting theoretical situation: does international law follow "precedent" the way common law does, or is it possible for international law to draw a line after 7 or 8 precedents and then say "no more."  What kind of strange "law" would it be to say that a tort case involving a Cadillac in 1990 is not a precedent for a similar tort case involving a Mercedes in 2000?  <br /><br /> I take credit or blame, as the case may be, for introducing this peculiar problem of precedents in international law in an article I wrote way back in 1967 on the <a href="http://anthonydamato.law.northwestern.edu/Pages-papers2/french-nuclear-tests.pdf">legality of French nuclear tests in the South Pacific</a>.  I argued then that even though the United States had conducted nuclear tests in the same region, the US tests were not a precedent for allowing the French tests because the radioactive damage to the environment would be cumulative.  In other words, the first test can do major but biologically recoverable damage; the second test could destroy ocean life in its entirety.  In cases of environmental damage where there may be a sustainable threshold of survival, I argued that strict legal "precedent" may be inapplicable. <br /><br /> I contend that it would be irrational for international law to say that if we are given seven or eight precedents of "have" nations, then the number must be legally extendable by operation of precedent to 190 nations.  At the moment we have stability, but would we have stability if 190 nations could each destroy the others?  Sometimes when astronomers report a supernova in the sky, I wonder if the explosion isn't the result of a planet whose inhabitants have reached roughly our own level of civilization and development, and among whom a hydrogen-bomb war broke out destroying their entire world.  I often wonder whether these celestial explosions are indeed frequent, and whether our Earth may soon join the series.  If it happens, we won't feel a thing.<br /><br /> International law should not be a recipe for planetary destruction.  It follows, I would suggest, that the Resolution on North Korea is a milestone that is connected to our own self-preservation &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; including the self-preservation of North Korea!<br /><br /> It is a milestone because its implications extend beyond the case of North Korea.  The Security Council has now committed itself to take similar aggressive action against Iran if and when Iran tests a nuclear weapon  Had the Iranian case preceded that of North Korea &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; as it looked like it might a few months ago &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; it would have been highly unlikely for the Security Council to have acted as boldly as it has now done.  The new Resolution will also impact Israel.  If Israel should decide to test its nuclear weapons, or even declare that it has them, it would be hard for its few friends on the Security Council to distinguish the Israeli case from the North Korean case.  Instead they would be under strong legal pressure to decide that Israel's nuclear weapon is, in the language of Preamble to the North Korean Resolution, "a clear threat to international peace and security."  This decision, in turn, would invoke the full powers of the Security Council against Israel, including the power to use force.<br /><br /> <strong>B.  Measures</strong><br /><br /> The full range of measures [<a href="#1">1</a>] short of armed force are available to the Security Council under Article 41 of the Charter.  (Article 42, providing for armed force, is left for further decision by Paragraph 16 of the North Korea Resolution.)  The Resolution imposes on all Member States of the UN to prevent the direct or indirect supply of weapons and spare parts to North Korea.  Included are tanks, armored combat vehicles, large calibre auxiliary systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships, missiles, and missile systems.  Additionally banned are any items or materials that could contribute to North Korea's nuclear-related or WMD-related programs.  All technical training, advice or services pertaining to the banned items are also prohibited.  <br /><br /> Not only does the Resolution ban the above-mentioned items from going in to North Korea, but it also prohibits them from coming out &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; in other words, an embargo on North Korean exports.  This may seem peculiar: why should the United Nations care if North Korea exports missiles when doing so would simply leave North Korea with fewer missiles?  My guess is that this is a very shrewd and realistic provision.  Suppose North Korea builds a factory to produce a new long-distance missile.  Once built, the factory can turn out many additional missiles at marginal cost.  If these extra missiles could be sold abroad, the factory could recoup its capital expenditures.  (North Korea has indeed been selling missiles on the world market.)  By placing an embargo on armaments exports, the United Nations has made it perhaps prohibitively expensive for North Korea to set up a factory to produce just the limited number of weapons it can use itself.  <br /><br /> Another shrewd and realis
tic provision of the Resolution is the ban on Member Nations' exporting luxury goods to North Korea.  With most of its people at the sustenance level, one may wonder whether North Korea imports any luxury goods at all.  The answer is that Kim Jong-il uses luxury goods as gifts to his close advisers and officials.  He rewards them with Mercedes and BMWs, fine cognac, and Cuban cigars&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;items that money can't buy in North Korea.  The Resolution's ban on luxury goods (even though that term is not defined) indicates a seriousness of purpose in putting the squeeze on the leaders of North Korea.<br /><br /> The Resolution does not call upon Member States to inspect all goods destined for North Korea.  Inspections are up to the Member States; the Resolution obliges them just to "prevent" exportation of the banned items to North Korea.  Similarly restrictive is the Resolution's failure to require nations to prevent banned items from being shipped to North Korea on the high seas in vessels other than their own flag vessels.  (The Security Council clearly has jurisdiction to infringe upon North Korea's right to freedom of the seas if there is a threat to the peace.)  China, one of the last holdouts on the various drafts of the Resolution, in particular seems reluctant to press North Korea.  It has announced that it will not make inspections on the high seas. <br /><br /> More critical to the international community is the 800-mile border that China shares with North Korea.  An hour after joining in the Council vote for the Resolution on Saturday, October 14th, the Chinese ambassador, Wang Guangya, said China would not participate in the inspection regime because it would create "conflict that could have serious implications for the region."  However (thanks to the instant reporting of world news these days) China has begun inspecting all trucks and other vehicles crossing the border into North Korea.  "Watch what we do and not what we say," Attorney General Mitchell once advised the American public during the Nixon Administration.  This same admonition might also apply to China today.<br /><br /> <strong>C.  What Will North Korea Do?</strong><br /><br /> The question whether the Resolution will force North Korea to quickly give up its nuclear weapon program is the issue that preoccupies the media.  To my mind it's less important than the precedents set, and the coming-together of the Members of the Security Council, that I have discussed above.  North Korea's nuclearization program has been an economic disaster; the new Resolution will make it even worse.  North Korea knows that if it ever actually uses any of its nuclear weapons on China, Japan, or Alaska, it will immediately be reduced to radioactive rubble by American nuclear missiles.  <br /><br /> Thus I submit that the new Resolution is not really about North Korea, it's about non-proliferation.  And the latter, I think, is <u>the</u> most important issue facing the human race.<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes<br /><br />1.   I'm glad the UN uses the word "measures" instead of the word "sanctions" which one sees in every other editorial in the <em>New York Times</em>.  "To sanction something" means either to approve it or prohibit it.  How could such an internally inconsistent word ever have entered into serious discourse?  Maybe the <em>Times</em>'s neutrality-striving editorial writers like it because it simultaneously allows them to approve and prohibit whatever they are talking about. <br /></font><br /><br /><br /><em>Anthony D.Amato is Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University, where he teaches international law and human rights.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/damato.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='120' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<title>The Military Commissions Act: Congress Commits to the War on Terror</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.stmarytx.edu/ctl/display.php?go=addicott">Jeffrey Addicott</a> of St. Mary&#39;s University School of Law, formerly a Lieutenant Colonel in the US Army Judge Advocate General's Corps, says the new Military Commissions Act reflects a clear and much-needed Congressional commitment to the war on terror, which to this point has been largely conducted in legal terms by the executive branch with occasional interjections from the judiciary...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/jeffaddicottnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>ith the passage of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), Congress has firmly committed itself to the view that the nation is at war and that the legislative branch of government has a significant role to play in a variety of legal issues associated with the "enemy combatants" &#8212; both legal and illegal - that seek to do great physical harm to the United States and its allies.  While the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 provided an advanced signal that Congress was at last willing to get involved in a limited manner in some of the thorny legal aspects of the War on Terror, the MCA represents a major Congressional shift in scope.   In short, the MCA is a resounding statutory broadside that impacts forcefully and with great effect across the entire legal landscape.<br />  <br />     Above all, the MCA has certainly washed away all doubt regarding Congress' willingness to characterize the War on Terror as a real global war against real enemies who desire to murder and terrorize. Accordingly, Congress has demonstrated that it is more than willing to employ the full weight of the rule of law pertaining to armed conflict against our enemies.  Prompted by the Supreme Court's holding in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>, an energized Congress understood that they could no longer remain on the sidelines in the War on Terror.  Congress established the creation of military commissions, affirming quite satisfactorily that the MCA is consistent with the requirements of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions &#8212; the military commissions so established constitute a "regularly constituted court," affording all the necessary "judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples." <br />  <br />     Not only does the MCA provide crystal clear guidance in the context of the establishment and operation of military commissions to try "any alien unlawful enemy combatant" (al-Qa'eda and al-Qa'eda-styled Islamic terrorists) it provides concrete statutory definitions concerning a wide variety of terms that have been previously hotly debated.  The MCA also clearly places a large legal "seal of approval" on many of the initiatives taken by the Bush Administration in the War on Terror.  For instance, the MCA defines "unlawful enemy combatants" in precise language while recognizing in the same breath the lawful functioning of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal for enemy combatant determination set up by the Department of Defense in response to the 2004 <em>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</em> ruling:<blockquote>(i)  a person who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents who is not a lawful enemy combatant (including a person who is part of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces); or<br /><br />(ii) a person who, before, on, or after the date of the enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, has been determined to be an unlawful enemy combatant by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the President or the Secretary of Defense.</blockquote>The MCA also lists in detail the criminal offenses that fall within the jurisdiction of the military commission.  Apart from the traditional list of war crimes the MCA appropriately includes "conspiracy" and "providing material support for terrorism," drawing definitional language from the Material Support provisions at Section 2339A for the later offense.  In addition, reaffirming the fact that the United States is in a state of hostilities, the MCA addresses the matter of streamlining the process for dealing with the large number of petitions filed by lawyers on behalf enemy combatants in the federal court system.  Again, if one recognizes the government's premise that the nation is at war and the laws of war apply, then the MCA properly deals with restricting habeas corpus and providing for other limitations on the jurisdiction of civilian courts. <br /> <br />    In the sphere of authorizing trial by military commission, the Congress wisely allows for the military commission to operate in the traditional manner of all previous military commissions (hundreds were tried by military commissions in World War II, some were even U.S. citizens) and consider, for example, hearsay evidence and information gathered without a search warrant.  The MCA holds that "[e]vidence shall be admissible if the military judge determines that the evidence would have probative value to a reasonable person" and "[e]vidence shall not be excluded from trial by military commission on the grounds that the evidence was not seized pursuant to a search warrant or other authorization."  While the MCA correctly excludes all statements obtained by use of torture, the MCA also tackles the hard question of statements taken from an illegal enemy combatant where a "degree of coercion is disputed." Such statements may be admissible under strict guidelines depending on when they were obtained. Statements obtained before the enactment of Detainee Treatment Act "in which the degree of coercion is disputed may be admitted only if the military judge finds that (1) the totality of the circumstances renders the statement reliable and possessing sufficient probative value; and (2) the interests of justice would best be served by admission of the statement into evidence."  Statements obtained after enactment of Detainee Treatment Act in which the degree of coercion is disputed may be admitted only if the military judge finds that in addition to (1) and (2) above, "(3) the interrogation methods used to obtain the statement do not amount to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment."<br /><br />    Ironically, some view the common sense evidentiary provisions in the MCA as a violation of Common Article 3's requirement that the accused be afforded all the necessary "guarantees &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples."  Such ethnocentric views are quickly dispelled when one considers the day-to-day activity of most modern European criminal courts where hearsay is regularly considered and far different legal avenues regarding the introduction of evidence are regularly employed.  Even the International Criminal Court allows hearsay.  In fact, earlier calls by some (uniformed judge advocates who should have known better) that a military commission should include the same due process standards that American soldiers enjoy at a military courts martial under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice were wisely disregarded by Congress.  Obviously, these "relaxed" provisions in the MCA are necessary due to the exigencies of war &#8212; witnesses and victims may be dead, investigators are not able to get to the crime scene, etc.<br /><br />      As various legal challenges to portions of the MCA make their way through the lower courts, e.g., the MCA revokes all U.S. court's jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions by alien enemy combatants in U.S. custody, it is highly doubtful that the Supreme Court will strike down very much of the MCA as unconstitutional. Indeed, in time of war the Court has traditionally been most reluctant to intervene in matters of national security, particularly when the executive and legislative branches have joined to
gether in such a seamless fashion.<br />  <br />In summary, Congress has sat on the sidelines in the War on Terror for far too long.  While rational people understand that the unique threat of al-Qa'eda-styled terrorism can only be addressed by employing the laws established for armed conflict, it is equally true that said laws of war need to be updated to encompass the new paradigm.  For over five years, Congress has simply watched as the executive branch, with occasional mandates from the judicial branch, crafted and implemented an emerging rule of law.  It is extremely supportive of the rule of law and vital to the issue of legitimacy that the legislative branch of our government has finally joined the process.   <br /><br /><br /><em>Jeffrey Addicott is Associate Dean for Administration, Director, Center for Terrorism Law and Professor of Law at St. Mary&#39;s University School of Law.

		<title>Suspending and Using Habeas Corpus: The View from 1689</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/history/faculty/halliday.html">Paul Halliday</a> of the University of Virginia Department of History says that before signing the Military Commissions Act suspending the writ of habeas corpus for alien &quot;enemy combatants,&quot; President Bush should reflect on the English experience with suspending and then reviving the writ in the midst of fear and political crisis over 300 years ago...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/paulhalliday.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ater this week, the President plans to sign the Military Commissions Act, suspending the writ of habeas corpus for aliens labeled "enemy combatants."  Throughout debates on the bill in the Senate and well beyond, our English legal heritage has been often invoked, if little understood. What shall we do now as popular fears drive us to undermine personal liberties and the legal means by which we have protected them for so long?  What might the history of the suspension of habeas corpus - as well as that of the writ&#39;s revival - tell us about what we should do now with those we have imprisoned as suspected enemies?<br /><br />Consider the situation of England in 1689.  One king &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the Catholic James II &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; had been expelled late the previous year in favor of James's Dutch son-in-law William and his wife Mary.  Though much of the country approved the change, political order teetered on edge.  Rumored rebellions threatened to knock it over for good.  Soon war was declared against France.  Invasion seemed imminent, possibly from three directions.  Catholics, foreigners, Englishmen too: hundreds were arrested as fear turned into panic.<br /><br />What to do with all these prisoners?  Many in Parliament argued that "the common safety" required suspending habeas corpus in order to keep them all locked up.  Supporters of suspension posed a simple question: your security or your liberty?  Their answer: liberty must give way.  A few replied that this was a false choice.  Habeas corpus, they argued, was "the best security of the nation."  They understood that habeas did not simply release dangerous people from jail.  Rather, it was the means for safely sorting the bad from the good, those imprisoned by law from those imprisoned against it.  Courtroom arguments and struggles with the crown throughout the century before 1689 had shown this well enough.<br /><br />Nonetheless, in March 1689, Parliament suspended the writ's work by statute for the first time.  To their credit, they did so in the narrowest terms: only for those jailed on treason charges by orders signed by six or more of the King's Council.  More important, Parliament limited suspension to just seven months.  So the writ lay dormant, but only briefly.  What happened then when it returned to life in October 1689?<br /><br />Everything and nothing: hundreds of writs and hundreds released, all without danger to the people.   Using habeas corpus, the court of King's Bench, Sir John Holt presiding, held the applicable law up to every prisoner and asked whether law or fear had been the reason for imprisonment.  And Holt's court considered facts as well as law in habeas hearings, going well beyond the simple matter contained in the official return to the writ.  It was a searching inquiry made possible by habeas corpus.  After all, only by considering the alleged facts in each case could they decide whether the law had been properly used.  <br /><br />Day after day, during court terms and between them, the justices continued sorting the dangerous from the hapless, until by the end of 1690, they had decided nearly three hundred such cases.  Some prisoners were remanded and sent to trial.  A few died a traitor's death with all the fury English law could show.  It was thought a sign of mercy that Godfrey Cross's dismembered quarters were "delivered to his friends" after his execution for passing secrets to the French.  King's Bench showed that the law, carefully applied by independent judges, could certainly spot the traitor in a crowd of innocents.<br /><br />And what a crowd it was.  In all, King's Bench released 82% of those jailed on charges of treason or sedition in 1689 and '90.  Apparently, the King's Councilors had played a bit loose with the law as they sent people to the Tower and other keeps in those anxious months.  As war continued throughout the 1690s, hundreds more such cases came through King's Bench, with similar results.  Despite the fear that produced the suspension of 1689, the justices showed throughout that they were quite capable of protecting the liberty and security of the people by using the habeas corpus well.  <br /><br />Why don't we know about these cases?  Because we write legal history &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and make courtroom claims about the state of English law before 1789 &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; from a fistful of case reports rather than from the astonishingly rich records of the court that decided these cases.  Yet there they are in the archive: thousands of writs, lying unread since they were written centuries ago.  These show us just how rich our heritage is on the writ of habeas corpus.  It is a heritage of confident, careful judges allowed to do their work.  It is a heritage by which we have sorted fear from reason and lawful imprisonment orders from unlawful ones, thereby protecting those liberties we take to be our inheritance from English law and which we revere as the heart of American ideals.<br /><br /> Americans, like the English, have always needed habeas corpus most when our fears were greatest.  When we use habeas corpus, we protect the safety of both our physical selves and our moral selves.  Members of Parliament saw this when they allowed their legislative suspension to lapse in October 1689.  Englishmen everywhere saw this as King's Bench considered the cases of hundreds of alleged traitors in the months following.  For all their fears, political order was maintained and public safety ensured.  So too was the safety of law and liberty.  Well might the President reflect on this history before his signature makes the Great Writ quite a bit smaller.<br /><br /><br /><em>Paul Halliday is a history professor at the University of Virginia.</em><br />

For more than 4 years, until February, 2005, H-P had a female chief executive officer, Carleton Fiorina, only the second (after Jill Barad at Mattel) at a Fortune 500 corporation and the most powerful businesswoman in the world.  More recently, H-P also had a non-executive board chair, Patricia Dunn.  H-P was one of only 16 % of large American companies to have a non-CEO (non-executive) in the board chair position, even though a non-executive chair is considered a baseline corporate practice, a standard in 90-95% of the large corporations around the world, everywhere except in America.  Moreover, the chairperson was a woman.  So Hewlett-Packard is a bellwether among U.S. corporations.  There is much for which the corporation deserves praise.<br /><br /> But recent commentary, including my own, jumps past all of that. Late observations about the company have been universally negative, especially following Wednesday&#39;s indictment of Dunn, who initiated the investigation aimed at plugging H-P boardroom leaks, house attorney Kevin Hunsaker, the corporation's chief ethics advisor and 3 outside detective operatives.<br /><br /> Things that went haywire at H-P include the assumption that what occurs at board meetings is confidential.  It is not.  Board members are extremely discrete in what they discuss with non-directors outside of the boardroom but that is far short of operating under the seal of confidentiality.<br /><br /> The board chair has no legal authority to order anything like this.  &quot;Board chair&quot; is an honorary or ceremonial position.  A few corporations delineate duties and responsibilities for the position, through bylaw provisions.  Through the process of accretion, a few other corporations may be said to have given content to the position.  Overall, not much has been written about the duties of board chairperson, certainly nothing in legal treatises or court opinions.  It is a minor post.  An over-exaggerated sense of self importance, as well as the common misunderstanding of the board chair's authority, may have been at work here.<br /><br /> Most of all, what occurred at H-P does violence to boardroom culture, not laws.  Directors do not spy on one another.  Nor do they allow others within the corporation to undertake witch hunts against directors, like this one.  Directors have the highest regard for and respect their fellow directors.<br /><br /> If directors suspect wrongdoing by a fellow director, they bite their tongues.  The corporation simply does not re-nominate the suspect for service the following year.  What occurred at H-P smacks of efforts to plug leaks in the Nixon White House or, in even an earlier era, the tactics of Senator Joe McCarthy.<br /><br /> As the saga at H-P unfolds, additional principles emerge, giving more guidance.  One very fundamental universal evident here is that, when the pendulum swings, the pendulum never stops at dead center, or anywhere near that point.  As here, the pendulum continues to swing, all the way to the stops on the other side.<br /><br /> To use another metaphor, this one from football, with indictments and threatened criminal prosecutions, there may be a bit or more of "piling on" in the Hewlett-Packard affair.<br /><br /> I have no sympathy for the professional operatives here.  They know what is permissible and what is not.  California Attorney General Lockyer should have his subordinates prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.  Pretexting is not only prohibited by statutes but it seems morally reprehensible.<br /><br /> The corporate defendants (Dunn and Hunsaker) say they thought about the legality of the tactics used but were advised by counsel that pretexting was permissible.  Moreover, counsel was none other than Larry Sonsini, maybe the most powerful person in Silicon Valley (at least after Oracle CEO Larry Ellison).<br /><br /> Is the indictment of corporate players here post-Enron, post WorldCom morality?  Yes, it is.  The invocation of principles from those cases is very reminiscent of "post Watergate morality" and the more than a bit of hypocrisy which surfaced in the 1970s.<br /><br /> Does the prospective punishment fit the crime?  No, it does not.  Enron and WorldCom investors lost tens of billions of dollars.  No one lost a dime at H-P.  Ten of thousands lost their jobs as Enron vaporized and WorldCom entered bankruptcy (although WorldCom always did remain a very large and viable company, which emerged from bankruptcy as MCI, Inc., now part of Verizon, Inc.).   Except for Hunsaker and Dunn, no one at Hewlett-Packard lost their positions.<br /><br /> Will a prosecution succeed, teaching Corporate America a valuable lesson?  Probably not.  The prosecutions will more than likely entail a requirement that the state prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants possessed an evil state of mind at the time they acted, a fairly high degree of culpability.<br /><br /> Ms. Dunn states unequivocally they she relied upon advice of counsel.  Moreover, she did not rely on a hack lawyer passing by.  She relied upon the best of the best, which brings us back to Larry Sonsini at Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich &amp; Rosati.  The advice of counsel defence should convince the jury that she lacked the needed mental state, or introduce more than a reasonable doubt that such was the case.<br /><br /> Some of the offenses Attorney General Lockyer alleges may be what attorneys call police power offenses.  They dispense with any requirement that the prosecutor prove any state of mind with regard to minor matters and regulatory offenses, such as weights and measures ordinances or record keeping statutes.  Nonetheless, the defense will introduce exculpatory state of mind evidence which the jury may well feel dictates the outcome, across the board, as to police power offenses and "ten commandment" crimes alike.<br /><br /> So where might the finger be pointed?  Well, as usual, it seems to point directly at the one key player who had not been indicted, attorney Larry Sonsini.  He gave the wrong advice.  He seemed blissfully unaware of the basic, governing corporate governance principles here.  And he rendered the advice with the aura of invincibility which emantes from his many successes and long-held reputation as a corporate and securites law adviser to major corporations.<br /><br /> Mr. Sonsini has been implicated in the backdating of stock options, an illegal practice engaged in by greedy corporate executives for whom salary and options at higher, legal stock market prices have not been enough.  He was instrumental in his law firm being among the first to buy and take in lieu of fees common shares in client companies.  Even today many law firms do not permit the practice, feeling that ownership of shares prevents an attorney from rendering the objective advice clients pay to attorneys they hire.<br /><br /> All in all, then, perhaps Larry Sonsini may at some point become involved in the H-P mess, along with Patricia Dunn and Kevin Hunsaker.  At this point, in some way holding him responsible does not seem like "piling on."<br /><br /><em>Douglas M. Branson holds the W. Edward Sell

		<title>Pluralism and the Iraqi Constitution: Critical Issues For All of Us</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Chibli Mallat, visiting professor at Princeton University and the <a href="http://www.ceue.usj.edu.lb/">EU Jean Monnet</a> Professor in Law at St. Joseph&#39;s University in Beirut, Lebanon, says that Iraq&#39;s constitutional response to pluralism may yet make it an example to the world...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/chiblimallatnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>C</strong></font>riticism of post-invasion Iraq has become a cottage industry; at latest count there are over fifty books showing why Iraq has turned into a disaster. This outpouring of opinion is healthy and natural. The question is what form such exercises should take to best help the situation, beyond the general humdrum that shapes up into consensual speech, in this case the nostrum that the situation is disastrous.<br /><br />I recently participated in an unusual <a href="http://www.law.upenn.edu/currently/events/iraqiConstitution2006/">conference on the Iraqi constitution</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, unusual even for people like myself who helped organize three full exile conferences on 'A Constitution for Iraq', in 1992 and 1996 in London, and in 1993 at Princeton. Thinking ahead about frameworks for the rule of law is not a vain exercise, if one accepts that such exercises will inevitably be transformed, possibly even totally brushed aside, by the pace of events. This should not stop the debate, however eerie it may sound, from continuing doggedly in the search for law as a social regulator - sooner or later Iraq will stabilize, and one must have faith: the accumulation of analysis will contribute to a better shape of things to come than any retreat into silence. Who could know, when, together with US Ambassador Peter Galbraith and now Iraqi Ambassador to the UN Hamid Bayati, we founded <a href="http://www.indict.org.uk/">Indict</a> to bring Mr Hussein to justice, that we would see a day when the man and his aides would be in court? Who could know that introducing federalism in 1992 to skeptical participants would have any effect? Who could predict that the Shi'i colleagues, of all participants, would find it a valuable tool of governance despite their strong majoritarian community presence in Iraq? <br /><br />In a dynamic and fluid situation, there is no closure. Goethe underlined that theory is gray, and green the tree of life. I have just written a reflection on the Iraqi High Tribunal, underlining its shortcomings and suggesting that it be moved abroad to salvage whatever can still be salvaged of due process. Some will lament the tribunal&#39;s shortcomings, and wish that Saddam, like his sons, had been killed rather than arrested. Considering the toll on lives that this trial has generated, including the deaths of some of his hapless defense lawyers, the argument will find its supporters. I am not one of them: the trial is a remarkable happening in the history of Iraq - let's keep trying to improve the conditions in which it is taking place, rather than turn our back on basic values and principles that make us believe in it, and in the rule of law in Iraq as the way forward. <br /><br />So 'take stock and move on' is the motto. Let me therefore depart from the second Iraqi post-Baath Constitution  to underline its main failures and the way to remedy them in the context of a celebration of pluralism, but also to underline how much Iraq is a laboratory for the region, and for constitutionalism the world over.<br /><br />First problem. Pluralism and federal arrangements, a.k.a. Iraq and its communities, in other words federalism. In the rush to complete the constitutional process before the referendum last year, one key institution was left out: the Federation Council (<em>majlis al-ittihad</em>, Art.62),  which is the equivalent of the US Senate, or the Bundesrat in Germany. This is one gaping hole, and it needs to be remedied. The Article states that the current parliament decides on the competence and composition of this Council, but we know that owing to an awkward electoral legislation, the current Parliament essentially operates federally, with three blocs, Kurdish, Sunni, Shi'i. So two problems: first, why duplicate federated - in US parlance, states - power? And even if the Federation Council gets established, what is its relation to the current federal parliament? This is an ongoing issue, which will not go away, and a clear framework is needed. I have argued to Iraqi friends time and again that for Iraq to work, the problem is not how Kurds exercise their powers in Kurdistan, or how Shi'is protect their holy places in the South. The problem is how to secure the involvement of federal states and peripheral communities at federal level. The role of the Federation Council will therefore be central, and cannot remain undefined as it is presently.<br /><br />Second problem. Pluralism and Islamic law. Iraqi constituents have missed the one major challenge which the world put to them: reconciling world constitutionalism and universal human rights with the Islamic legal tradition. Under the chairmanship of Hasan Chalabi, the most respected jurist of Iraq, who presides over the Islamic University in Lebanon, I suggested the need to take Islamic law seriously as the drafting process was engaged.  Taking Islamic law seriously is premised on two elements: scholarship and humanism. Humanism means that any bill of rights, whether Islamic or not, must subscribe to the basic values shared on the planet. This includes the refusal of compulsion, even in religion, and the equality between men and women. Scholarship means hard work. All kinds of Islamic congresses have failed to transcend an obscurantist interpretation of the tradition, as was shown in the important book of Ann Mayer a decade ago.  Obscurantism is a direct function of laziness, which gets manifested in circuitous and obsessive shortcomings. You dismiss the issue, either through general clauses, e.g. in endless discussion whether Islamic law is a source or the source of legislation; or, as in the Afghani and Iraqi constitution, you juxtapose Western-style bills of rights and Islamic law, and brazenly proclaim that we respect everything. Well, laziness and ignorance will not work. What we need is a paradigmatic shift: take Islamic law seriously, and, as in the Ottoman Majalla, work hard on classical sources and style, also making sure that Islamic law becomes Iraqi law, I mean law that non-Muslims can identify with. Iraqi law for all Iraqis, Middle Eastern law in the region. The Iraqi constitution was a failure, and, if only for its poor style, with the possible exception of the preamble, an exercise in laziness. So let's get back to the drawing board, and get it right this time: make Islamic law universal law, which it is no less capable of being than French or American law.<br /><br />Third problem. Women and pluralism. Here I confess there has been moderate success, as the Constitution continues the tradition of a quota of a quarter women in Parliament introduced in the first electoral law established under Paul Bremer&#39;s rule in the Coalition Provisional Authority. Success, because the arrangement ensures that Iraq joins on that score the most advanced countries. Moderate, because I tried to instill a more important locus for the quotas, that is in government, on the occasion of a seminar held with leading Iraqi women in Beirut to discuss that very topic.  More important than women MPs are women ministers and women judges. At least that is an undertaking that I have translated into the Lebanese presidential program. Together with the idea of electing directly the Lebanese president by the people, it has proved the most popular item of the program in the country. This quota system, of course, raises problems of a universal nature, whether it is called in American legal theory reverse discrimination, affirmativ
e action, or representation-reinforcement mechanisms. It is a problem that begs a response of planetary import. <br /><br />In conclusion, let me try to extrapolate from pluralism and communities, and pluralism and women, on Lebanon in particular, and on constitutional theory in general. When an American president, 42 tenures removed from George Washington, 41 tenures removed from Thomas Jefferson, says without blinking that Sunnis must be represented in government in Iraq, then surely there is a problem of constitutional values. To my knowledge, one and only one country has such an arrangement, whereby a minority sect has a <em>numerus clausus</em> in the constitution, and that is Lebanon. Now we know that such an arrangement plagues the constitution with terrible deadlocks, but what is the alternative? Majoritarianism does not work - it is brutal with minorities. A way to lessen the impact of majoritarianism is called federalism, another is called Lebanese-style sectarianism. So you see, the problem in Iraq is not only Iraqi, it is certainly Middle Eastern, with Arabs victimized in Israel, and Copts victimized in Egypt, and Berbers victimized in Algeria, and Shafi'ites victimized in the Saudi Hejaz. Iraq, as the rest of the Middle East, is offering a counter-constitutional example the world over, which majoritarianism does not have clear cut answers to.<br /><br />So you see, if you choose your priority list well, it can come with a number of surprises. We need a new post-Montesquieu constitutional theory. That it starts in Iraq may not be a total coincidence. <br /><br /><br /><em>Chibli Mallat is EU Jean Monnet Professor of Law at Saint Joseph&#39;s University in Beirut and this year is a visiting professor at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.anu.edu.au/scripts/StaffDetails.asp?StaffID=393">Don Rothwell</a> of ANU College of Law, Australian National University, says that while passage of the new Military Commissions Act in the United States presents new challenges for Australian Guantanamo detainee David Hicks, it also creates an opportunity for the Australian government to reconsider its erstwhile refusal to press for the protection of his rights...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/donrothwell.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he recent passage of the Military Commissions Act by the US Congress has attracted attention on the other side of the world. An Australian, David Hicks, has been held at Guantanamo Bay since early 2002 following his detention in Afghanistan in December 2001. Not only is Hicks one of the longest-serving Guantanamo detainees and the only Australian currently being detained, but he was charged under the original military commission process. The Australian government anticipates new charges will be laid against Hicks in the future. <br /><br />Compared to other major coalition partners, Australia has been mostly silent as to the plight of its nationals held at Guantanamo. No concerns were raised over alleged torture and mistreatment claims made by Hicks and the other Australian at Guantanamo, Mamdouh Habib (who has since been released). Likewise, few concerns were expressed over the military commission process itself. When complaints were raised within Australia over the delays in bringing Hicks to trial, the Australian government even sought to lay the blame on the Hicks legal team for joining in the appeals challenging the validity of the original military commissions.<br /><br />Notwithstanding Australia's legitimate right to call upon the US to ensure that any trial of Hicks is consistent with US and international legal standards and that his treatment whilst in detention is in conformity with international law, the Howard government has instead preferred to take a minimalist position towards exercising diplomatic protection of one of its citizens. Even considering the initial refusal of the US government to apply Geneva Conventions Common Article 3, the conditions under which Guantanamo detainees have been held and the extraordinary trial procedures of the military commissions, the Australian government insisted that what was occurring was perfectly legal and referred to its own internal legal advice in support of that position. <br /><br />Whilst the Australian government has not exactly backtracked since the recent US Supreme Court ruling in <em>Hamdan</em> it has urged the US to put in place an alternate process and bring Hicks to trial as soon as possible. Australian Attorney-General Philip Ruddock was in the US at the time of the passage of the Military Commissions Act and had discussions with Alberto Gonzales about the Hicks case. Ruddock seemed satisfied with the Act, and has controversially stated that sleep deprivation would not be contrary to the torture prevention previsions of the Act. <br /><br />What then are the possible scenarios for Hicks at this point? The prospect that he may be returned to Australia to face trial can be immediately ruled out. The Howard government has consistently maintained that it does not have the legal capacity to try Hicks for war crimes or acts of terrorism due to a deficiency in Australian law at the time of the events of 2001. The first option then would be that fresh charges are laid under the Military Commissions Act and Hicks is eventually convicted. The original 2004 charges against Hicks included being a member of an al Qaida criminal conspiracy to commit - amongst other acts - attacks upon civilians and civilian objects and terrorism, attempted murder against Coalition forces whilst not enjoying combatant immunity, and aiding the enemy. What fresh charges may be brought remains to be seen, though it is important to note the doubt the Supreme Court cast over conspiracy charges in <em>Hamdan</em>. If Hicks was to be convicted then two outcomes seem certain. The first is that he would not be subject to the death penalty. The recently arrived US Ambassador to Australia, Robert McCallum, made that clear during his first Canberra press conference. The second, is that Hicks would be eligible for return to Australia under a deal which would allow him to serve part of whatever goal term he faced in Australia. <br /><br />The second option for Hicks is that he challenges the validity of the Military Commissions Act, or that his trial is delayed as a result of challenges brought by others. Given the concerns which have already been raised over the Act by Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union and by legal scholars, there is every prospect that this will occur. By the time the various appeals have been heard and final rulings issued by the Supreme Court, this could be another few years of Hicks' life spent at Guantanamo.<br /><br /> Even if Hicks were found not guilty of any charges brought against him, this would not automatically result in his release. No matter what interpretation is placed on the circumstances of his original detention in Afghanistan, the US would seem within its rights to continue to maintain that Hicks is a prisoner of war who can continue to be detained until the end of hostilities. While that is a position consistent with the Geneva Conventions and one which has been advanced in Australia by Ambassador McCallum, presently it is difficult to foresee when a formal cessation of hostilities with terrorist forces will occur. Under this scenario, Hicks could possibly face indefinite detention as a POW. Of course some Guantanamo detainees have been released, however, almost without exception the released detainees had not been charged, were no longer considered useful for intelligence gathering, or were from countries which actively challenged the legitimacy of their detention. Hicks does not fall within one of these exceptions.<br /><br /> With Hicks' de facto POW status now effectively confirmed there is the potential for the Howard Government to request his transfer to Australia. As both a party to the Geneva Convention and also the Afghan conflict, there is nothing under international law which would bar such a transfer.<br /> <br /> For the time being, the Howard Government persists in its support of the revamped US military commission process. But can it legitimately continue its unquestioning support of the US when its previous legal advice has been shown up by the Supreme Court as wrong and when there are possible flaws with the new Act? Australia's support for the US position in its campaign against international terrorism is understandable in political terms &#8212; it must not be forgotten that Prime Minister Howard was in Washington on 11 September 2001 and that Australians have borne the brunt of terrorist attacks in Bali. The ANZUS Security Treaty has also provided a framework for Australia's close military and security cooperation with the US since 2001. However, Australia needs to maintain a balanced approach between support for one of its closest allies and protection of one of its citizens. <br /><br />One way forward would be for the Howard government and the Hicks legal team to jointly seek independent legal advice on the constitutional and international legal validity of the revised military commissions. If such advice &#8212; which should be publicly released &#8212; supports Hicks being tried, then the government can with some confidence continue its current policy of support for the US position. If not, then a more proactive position needs to be taken to ensure Hicks' rights are protected. No matter what David Hicks is alleged to have done, as an Australian citizen he remains entitled to the protection of the law and of the Australian Govern
ment. The US would be doing exactly the same for its own if they were detained in Australia.<br /><br /><br /><em>Donald R. Rothwell is Professor of International Law, at the ANU College of Law, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia</em><br />

Politicians try to stand out by taking ever tougher enforcement stands, like the Congressional authorization for a 700-mile fence across parts of the U.S.-Mexican border.  All this heated rhetoric obscures hides an important issue: what role should state and local police play?  For the past several years, the Bush Administration and many of its allies in Congress have made an effort to get state and local police involved in retail-level immigration enforcement.  But police, from chiefs to patrol officers, say they cannot imagine a worse idea, because involving local police in immigration enforcement will damage efforts to fight both garden-variety crime and terrorism.<br /><br /><strong>How We Got Here</strong><br /><br />Before September 11, 2001, debates about illegal immigration had much more to do with economics, labor supplies, cultural change, and the weak economy of Mexico than they did with law enforcement.  As for local police, they sometimes arrested people for the most serious, felony-level immigration offenses, but most illegal immigration involves either civil violations or misdemeanors.  <br /><br />Then came September 11, and immigration opponents gave the issue a different face: national security and terrorism.  If millions of illegal, uneducated, and unskilled migrants could get into the U.S., so could a terrorist.  Never mind the lack of evidence; the mere possibility, immigration opponents said, constituted a threat.<br />  <br />With the issue now positioned as part of the war on terror, allies in the administration and in Congress began to move on several fronts to involve local police in immigration enforcement.  The federal effort that caused the greatest unease among police came in the form of bills &#8212; the best known of which was the CLEAR Act, in the 108th Congress -- to force local police to get involved in immigration enforcement.  Those agencies that had policies to the contrary stood to lose all of the federal reimbursement monies they received to defray their costs when they held deportable aliens in custody for the federal government.  Many local governments could ill afford to give up these funds.  <br /><br /><strong>Police Resistance</strong><br /><br />State and local police departments (with the exception of a handful of elected sheriffs) objected strongly to the CLEAR Act.  For some departments, it amounted to a question of resources; for others, the question was the proper allocation of federal and state responsibilities.  But by far the most common, and most intense, objection to the CLEAR Act centered on crime fighting.  If police became involved in immigration enforcement, police argued, it would cripple their ability to carry out their core mission: making the streets safe from crime.   <br /><br />To account for this opposition, we must look at some important changes in policing over the past ten to twenty years.  During that time, community-oriented policing strategies have become the coin of the realm.  Most police have realized that they must have the help and support of the communities they serve in order to do a good job of assuring public safety.  This means that police must create and maintain relationships with the communities they serve &#8212; relationships based on trust.  Without this kind of relationship, police will receive little in the way of intelligence and information from the public, making it harder for officers to do their always-difficult jobs.  This change in police perspective becomes even more important when examined in conjunction with recent demographic transformations in the U.S.  During the past decade, cities and towns all over the U.S. &#8212; not just in traditional immigrant "gateway" areas like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles &#8212; have sprouted their own substantial immigrant populations.  The areas of the U.S. experiencing the fastest rates of growth in immigrants are not large urban areas, but suburban and rural areas in states like North Carolina, Georgia and Arkansas.  This means that more police departments than ever, in many more places than used to be the case, have first-hand experience doing police work in immigrant communities.  If building trust-based relationships with communities is always a central tenet of the best modern police work, police in many small and mid-size communities, as well as big cities, now understand that accomplishing this becomes doubly difficult in immigrant communities.  Language barriers, cultural differences, and the fact that many immigrants come from countries in which police behaved corruptly and brutally mean that police must work extra hard to build the important relationships that they need.  Without trust-based relationships with these communities, there will be little communication with them; with no communication, there will be precious little sharing of information and intelligence about criminal activity.  <br /><br />Forcing local police into immigration enforcement will make all of this even harder.  Police officers understand that if they are forced to become adjunct immigration agents, people in immigrant communities will begin to fear talking to them because doing so might bring with it the potential for deportation.   And this fear often arises not just for illegal immigrants, but also for many who have legal status.  In the U.S., a large number of immigrant families and households have both legal and illegal members.  For example, children in a household may have been born here to illegal immigrant parents, making the kids citizens but the parents deportable.  Thus even for those with legal status, the danger of exposure to any official with immigration enforcement duties is quite real.  The fear will cause immigrant communities to cut themselves off from police, not offering information about criminal activity and not reporting crime &#8212; even when they themselves become the victims.  Police know where this path leads.  Residents, legal and illegal, fear contact with the police and thus fail to report crimes; this leaves predators whom police might otherwise catch on the street.  It also further emboldens these criminals, because they know they can strike with a degree of impunity.   This will lead to increases in crime, especially serious crimes such as armed robberies, and the criminals perpetrating it will not victimize only illegal immigrants.  The result: diminished public safety for everyone.<br /><br /><strong>Predictions</strong><br /><br />If the federal government and opponents of illegal immigration succeed in their efforts to force state and local police into the enforcement of immigration law, six negative consequences will follow.  First, crime will increase in areas with concentrations of immigrants, and it will then spread to adjoining places.  Second, racial profiling will re-emerge as a common practice, spawning complaints against police departments and straining all-important community ties between police and residents.  Third, state and local police agencies will become targets of lawsuits over these practices, necessitating the use of millions of dollars for legal defenses and the payment of damages.  Fourth, the incarcerated population will grow, requiring more prison building and the growth of proprietary, privately-owned prisons.  Fifth, the enforcement e
fforts will drain always scarce law enforcement resources away from crime fighting.  Sixth &#8212; and perhaps most important &#8212; pushing police into immigration enforcement will prove a substantial setback to every effort now underway to obtain crucial intelligence against potential terrorists on our own soil &#8212; an ironic outcome, because those pushing for local police enforcement have dressed their efforts up in the garb of national security.  In any number of successful anti-terrorism cases in the U.S. &#8212; in Lackawanna, N. Y., and Toledo, Ohio, to take just two examples &#8212; crucial intelligence has almost always come from people in the Middle Eastern, Muslim, and Arab communities.  Since these communities contain many immigrants, both legal and illegal, the fear of the police generated by pushing local officers into the business of immigration enforcement will show up among Middle Easterners and Muslims, too &#8212; cutting off crucial communications and the sharing of information.  <br /><br /><strong>The Wrong Path</strong><br /><br />The opponents of illegal immigration say, correctly, that the stakes in the debate are high.  But the question is how we tackle the problem.  If we listen to our law enforcement professionals, we'll have the benefit of their hard-won experience.  They're the ones who know that pushing them into immigration law enforcement is the wrong path, and it can lead only to disaster.<br /><br /><br /><em>David A. Harris is the E.N.

The district court ruled in Mohammed v. Harvey that it lacked jurisdiction because the United States was acting as part of a multinational force when it arrested and imprisoned Munaf.  It also denied as moot Munaf&#39;s request for an order temporarily enjoining his transfer to Iraq to face execution in order to hear his habeas petition.<br /><br />The decision is unprecedented and unjustified, flouting more than a half-century of Supreme Court precedent establishing that U.S. citizens detained overseas have a constitutional right to challenge their detention by the United States as well as their transfer to a foreign sovereign.   In this case, Munaf was tortured while in U.S. custody and was subjected to a trial in Iraq that lacked fundamental due process and that was pervaded by significant American involvement, if not manipulation.  More is at stake than the life of an American citizen. The decision threatens to create a blank check for executive imprisonment wherever the United States claims it is holding an American citizen under the guise of a multinational operation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.reconsider.org/about/reconsider.htm"><strong>Nicolas Eyle</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.reconsider.org">RECONSIDER</a>]: &quot;Nearly three decades after California cracked down on rising crime rates with tougher sentencing laws, Californians are beginning to realize the downside of what many experts say has been one of the most poorly planned prison expansions in the country. A recent Justice Policy Institute study states that California leads the nation in drug offender imprisonment with a rate of 115 per 100,000 (the national average is 44 per 100,000). <br /><br />The basic problem is a familiar one &#8212; lawmakers and prosecutors sent far more criminals to prison than Californians, ultimately, were willing to pay for. People love the idea that people whose lifestyles they disapprove of can be sent to prison. The second part of the equation, that there is a significant cost to this form of social engineering, has been conveniently ignored. The result has been such acute <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/federal-judge-issues-restraining-order.php">overcrowding</a> that critical prison programs and services are breaking down and require enormously expensive fixes.<br /><br />This is a problem by no means peculiar to California. By the year 2000, there were 458,131 drug offenders incarcerated in America&#39;s prisons and jails &#8212; approximately the size of the entire US prison and jail population of 1980.  This means that nearly one in four (23.7%) prisoners in America is incarcerated for a non-violent drug offense. Contrary to the public perception that the incarceration of violent offenders has driven America&#39;s prison growth the major group responsible for the overcrowding of California&#39;s prisons is non-violent drug offenders.<br /><br />It is also important to understand that there is no connection between increases in incarceration and decreased crime rates. States with far smaller increases in prison sentencing rates than California have experienced even greater decreases in crime rates. <br /><br />As long as drug prohibition remains the law of the land and Americans refuse to adopt serious alternatives such as legalization and regulation there are only two choices for our country&#39;s prison dilemma; If our prisons are currently filled to double their capacity we must either significantly increase taxes to build new facilities equivalent in capacity to those currently existing, or warehouse inmates in overcrowded hellholes comparable to those in the poorest of third world nations. Neither of these is cost-effective nor realistic in the long run.&quot;<br />

The legislation sends the message abroad that we intend to defend our borders against illegal immigration. It is symbolic because little more than a start on the project can be made on the basis of the border enforcement appropriation passed earlier. This means that work on the fencing will depend on future appropriations and will be debated anew in terms of other national priorities. <br /><br />FAIR believes that the strongest deterrence to illegal immigration will come not from extending the already existing fencing on the border, but rather from turning off the job magnet that draws illegal immigrants. When jobs are effectively denied to illegal workers, employers are punished if they break the law and knowingly hire illegal workers, fencing is extended to the current major drug and people smuggling routes, and other related reforms such as federal-local enforcement cooperation are implemented, we hope to see restored an environment in which all foreigners in our country as immigrants or visitors can be welcomed as invited without suspicion that they have broken our laws.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.immigrantjustice.org/whoWeAre.asp#staff"><strong>Tara Magner</strong></a> [Policy Director, <a href="http://www.immigrantjustice.org/index.asp">National Immigrant Justice Center</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/bush-signs-border-fence-bill-despite.php">Secure Fence Act</a> has generated a good deal of controversy this election season.  First, its price tag is unknown, but is estimated to fall between $2 billion and $9 billion.  Second, it is unlikely to solve the problem of unlawful entry and visa overstays.  A decade of &quot;enforcement only&quot; policies has failed to stem the flow of immigrants responding to the demand for labor in the U.S. economy.  Third, loopholes in the bill&#39;s mandate to build a fence suggest that one may never be built at all.  <br /><br />Signed less than two weeks before the November election, the bill throws a bone to the restrictionist forces that favor &quot;enforcement only&quot; and oppose comprehensive efforts to reform the nation&#39;s border security and immigration policies.  This is unfortunate considering a broad bipartisan majority of the nation and of the U.S. Senate believes that piecemeal efforts will fail to secure the nation, grow the economy, or honor the American tradition of welcoming immigrants to our shores.  Among many prominent conservatives arguing for a comprehensive approach, Tom Ridge, the former Secretary of Homeland Security, wrote in a September 10, 2006, <em>Washington Times</em> op-ed, that gaining &quot;operational control of the borders is impossible unless our enhanced efforts are coupled with a robust temporary guest worker program and a means to entice those now working illegally out of the shadows into some type of legal status.&quot;  <br /><br />While the new law is frequently described as merely a fence on the southern border, public and congressional debate over the cost and effectiveness of the Secure Fence Act largely ignores a significant portion of the bill&#39;s text.  It contains broad language directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to take all actions &quot;necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control&quot; of the border, specifically meaning the prevention of all unlawful entries.  This language is not limited to the Southern Border but encompasses &quot;the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States.&quot;<br /><br />Many legal policy analysts who support both secure borders and immigration reform believe this text will justify searches and other intrusions of U.S. citizens&#39; homes and businesses.  If this broad grant of executive authority is cited by federal agents on the border to justify intrusions on personal property and privacy rights, then liberals, traditional conservatives, and libertarians should speak loudly and fight to repeal this portion of what is otherwise a &quot;bumper sticker&quot; law.&quot;<br />

		<title>Exposing corruption still means jail-time for Chinese journalists</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cpj.org/development/staff.html"><strong>Kristin Jones</strong></a> [Senior Asia Research Associate, <a href="http://www.cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>]: &quot;Journalist <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/china-court-orders-early-release-of.php">Yang Xiaoqing&#39;s imprisonment</a> caught the attention of ordinary people in China who recognized it as the case of a man who had taken on powerful officials in his home county and was paying the price. Without the vocal advocacy of his wife Gong Jie, supporters like Internet journalist Li Xinde and others, Yang would still be in jail today. His wife told CPJ that the journalist suffered from severe health problems during his nine months in jail, so it is hard to call him one of the lucky ones. And yet many more of his colleagues remain behind bars on much longer sentences just for doing their jobs, including Gao Qinrong, a Xinhua news agency reporter imprisoned since 1998 for exposing a corrupt irrigation scheme in Shanxi province, and Li Changqing, deputy news director of Fuzhou Daily sentenced in January to three years in prison after writing in support of a local Communist Party official who blew the whistle on corruption in his ranks. <br /><br />Chinese leaders have intermittently called on the media to perform supervisory roles in exposing and publicizing corruption. The recent purge of Party leaders in Shanghai again brought the entrenched problem into the spotlight. But administrative oversight of the press means that journalists have rarely been permitted to take the lead in exposing corruption at the highest levels, or in their own communities. Recent restrictions on reporting outside of a newspaper&#39;s own region have further limited the role that the media can be expected to take. And as Yang&#39;s case shows, the threat of jail hangs over any journalist who manages to penetrate the system of self-censorship. It is little wonder that his imprisonment angered so many Chinese citizens. When the government punishes journalists for reporting the news, it robs the public of one of the few really effective watchdogs on official actions.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/"><strong>Giovanni Di Stefano</strong></a> [lawyer for Saddam Hussein]: &quot;Although Saddam Hussein CAN be <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/saddam-sentenced-to-death-in-dujail.php">sentenced to death</a> the sentence CANNOT be carried out owing to an agreement between the UK/ITALY and the IRAQI Government witnessed by the US in 2004 which the Iraqi Government gave a written undertaking NOT to carry out the death sentence (capital punishment) on 11 detained of which Saddam Hussein is but one... I certainly made it clear on my interviews in 2004 and 2005 with CNN, ABC, CBS etc but for the media the trial of Saddam without the risk of the death penalty made boring news. So on each report (look for example on the BBC Website) it would have at the bottom that Saddam risked the death sentence. YES, he risked having such IMPOSED but never could it be carried out...<br /><br />I do not feel sorry for any of the dramatis personea in this matter. Not for Saddam Hussein although a client, not for Iraq, not for the US, the UK or any of the lawyers, judges, administrators or even the UN. I feel sorry for the loss of international law and the right and respect for international jurisprudence caused by the unlawful attack on Iraq based entirely upon a sea of mendacity. It is for the loss of natural order that all those in the legal profession should feel sorry for.&quot;<br />

Mr. Munaf has been in US custody in Iraq for more than 16 months.  An Iraqi Court sentenced Mr. Munaf to death on October 12.  A federal district judge in Washington, D.C., denied Mr. Munaf&#39;s habeas petition and the District of Columbia Circuit refused to issue an injunction prohibiting his transfer pending appeal.  If the Supreme Court does not act to prevent his transfer, Mr. Munaf may be put to death.   Mr. Munaf&#39;s case tests the right of US citizens to due process and the rule of law when held by their government.  The U.S. government&#39;s argument rests on a pure legal fiction -- that the Executive can escape constitutionally mandated habeas corpus review when it detains an American citizen if it claims to act under the guise of a multinational force.&quot;<br />

The state legislators wanted their law defended and demanded that the Attorney General defend the ID requirements for state of Ohio voters.  What we got was uniform rules for the entire state.  We got the absentee ballots to count even if the voter submitted the wrong number from their driver&#39;s license.  Everyone will have to bring ID to cast a regular ballot on November 7; however, those who do not have ID will still have their vote count.  They will not have to prove their residence or come back to show ID within 10 days.  As long as they voted in the right precinct and their signature matches, their vote will count.  <br /> <br />This is a major victory for homeless people in the state of Ohio.  They can participate in the democratic process and not worry that their vote may not count.  We are happy that the attempt to disenfranchise thousands of low income voters did not work.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.chandraforohio.com/index.htm"><strong>Subodh Chandra</strong></a> [plaintiffs attorney, Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, et al. v. Blackwell]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/ohio-voter-id-law-case-settled.php">consent order we won</a> Thursday against Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell won back the right to vote for many otherwise eligible Ohioans--including college students, the elderly, and homeless people.  Those people were not going to be able to vote because they did not have the forms of identification that the statute enumerates.  But they do have the last four digits of their social-security number, and those that do will be able to vote provisionally. <br /><br />The consent order also ensures those provisional votes, and many others that were in limbo, are counted.  For example, thousands of absentee ballots that were in question because county boards of elections were confusedly and inconsistently applying the voter-ID requirements (thus disenfranchising Ohioans subjected to the most restrictive approaches) will be counted.<br /><br />Who is the type of Ohioan whose right to vote was saved by this consent order?  Pamela Denton.  She&#39;s a graduate of Spelman College.  She grew up in Birmingham, Alabama.  Her cousin was one of the girls killed in the bombing outside the Birmingham Church.  Pamela felt the blast that killed her cousin.  Voting is important to her.  She has voted almost every year since she turned 18.  It is a critical part of carrying on the legacy of her parents and Dr. Martin Luther King. <br /><br />Ms. Denton is homeless.  She has none of the forms of identification in the statutes.  She has only her social-security number.  Last week, she would not have been able to vote on election day.  Now she will be able to.<br /><br />After it became apparent that we had an agreement in principle with the other side in Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, et al. v. Blackwell, Ms. Denton and I embraced.  She was too overcome with emotion to speak.  But her presence in the courtroom for 13 hours today--her vigil for her rights--should inspire us all.  I believe it was the decisive factor in a broader victory than seemed possible a few days earlier when the Sixth Circuit reversed the temporary restraining order we had obtained enjoining the law.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mountainstateslegal.org/staff.cfm"><strong>William Perry Pendley</strong></a> [President and Chief Legal Officer, <a href="www.mountainstateslegal.org">Mountain States Legal Foundation</a>]: &quot;Mountain States Legal Foundation (MSLF) has agreed to represent <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/federal-judge-blocks-pennsylvania-city.php">Hazleton, Pennsylvania</a> to defend its efforts to reduce the impact on the community from the presence of illegal immigrants.  MSLF was successful in its defense of the ability of the people of Arizona to take similar action when MSLF prevailed on behalf of proponents of a ballot initiative that denied illegal immigrants various tax-payer funded &quot;benefits&quot; and required positive proof of an individual&#39;s right to vote.  In the latter matter, the Supreme Court recently ruled, 9-0, that Arizona could require such proof on Election Day 2006.<br /> <br />MSLF believes Hazleton has the right to take the action that it did.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the sole immigration issues preempted by Congress, that is, barred under the Supremacy Clause, are (1) who may enter the United States; and (2) under what circumstances may they stay.  Hazleton does not address either issue.  Plus, we believe the many of the plaintiffs in the case lack standing to proceed with their claims or their claims are not ripe.<br /> <br />Hundreds of communities that have been affected adversely by the presence of those illegally in this country are watching this matter very closely.  The language by those opposed to Hazleton&#39;s actions has been harsh indeed; however, the law is clearly on the side of Hazleton.&quot;<br />

There was little fanfare publicly, yet it was an important milestone nonetheless.  Much of the importance of that event centers on the American Chief Prosecutor, Justice Robert H. Jackson, and the legacy he left mankind - the lesson that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of the gun.<br /><br />It is right and proper that we reflect on this seminal event in legal history, an event that became the cornerstone to modern day international criminal jurisprudence.  Without the international criminal trial of the key Nazi leaders then, much that has been done to date would not have been contemplated today.  <br /><br />With the beast of impunity ravenously nibbling around the periphery of civilization, the steel core of humanity to face down this beast was forged at Nuremberg, largely through the efforts of Justice Jackson and the many brave men and women who encountered numerous hardships and challenges to investigate, indict and try those men who turned the entire world upside down. Then, as now, the world was reeling with the horror of atrocity.  Stung by horrific events, the world faced the beast and impunity and took it down in 1945-1946.  The rule of law closed the book on World War II, and the United States led most of the way.  <br /><br />Today, the world is essentially again at war. Civilians are the target of choice for those who would do violence to advance their cause or intimidate their opposition. The United States is once again in the lead. However, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, passed by the US Congress just one day short of the 60th anniversary of the judgments delivered in Nuremberg, and signed into law by President Bush on October 17, shows us that the United States has chosen a different path from the one it took after World War II.  Then it was the high road of moral leadership, now it is the low road heading towards the dismal swamp of the loss of moral authority internationally.  The United States has become what it had fought so hard against in World War II: an outlaw or, as one international politician stated recently, "the world's thug", abandoning long cherished values for the sake of expediency. Whether that is true or not does not matter, the fact that it resonated somewhat is indeed troublesome.<br /><br />The Military Commissions Act itself contains questionable provisions that violate our constitutional arrangements of separation of powers and, arguably, violations of the laws and customs of armed conflict.  The stepping away of these legal principles and the loss of our moral high ground is the ultimate challenge to the legacy of Nuremberg so carefully laid down by the principled leadership of Justice Jackson.  <br /><br />With this loss of moral leadership the hard work of a decade of modern international jurisprudence is threatened by politics and a questionable unilateral withdrawal of the world's only superpower from the norms of international law.  With the echo of "the rules have changed" ringing in our ears, America enters the 21st Century under a dark and ominous cloud.  The law has been twisted to ensure a type of amnesty for past war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Americans in the "war on terror", as well as ones that might be committed in the future.  Additionally, the role of our courts, a co-equal branch of government, has been carved out of most of the process.  Regardless of its constitutionality, the appearance of unfairness is there for the whole world to see.  <br /><br />It would sadden Justice Jackson, and others who were at Nuremberg, to see their government pressing so hard for torture, loss of habeas corpus relief, secret and long term unaccounted for detention, and no judicial involvement in a very questionable legal process.  Their hard earned legacy was to try those who committed such acts above.  <br /><br />The rules have not changed.  Leadership and action under the shield and banner of the law is our ultimate weapon, one which has helped us defeat tyranny for a century. The dark and thunderous storm of the passage and entry into law of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 will drown out the clear and resonant voice of the legacy of Nuremberg.  It is a tree that has fallen in the woods, its 60th anniversary unheard and unmentioned by an administration lost in a dismal swamp of questionable moral principles. General of the Army George C. Marshall said about warfare:  &quot;It is not enough to fight.  It is the spirit which we bring to the fight that decides the issue.  It is the morale that wins the victory.&quot; [<a href="#2">2</a>] <br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes<br /><br />1.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=35">Nancy Rapoport</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that the 24-year prison sentence handed down for former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling leaves us all disappointed, not necessarily in the sentence, but in the corporate conduct that led to Enron&#39;s collapse and the huge losses that entailed...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/nancyrapoportnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n one of my favorite scenes in the movie <em>A Fish Called Wanda</em>, Kevin Kline's character opens a safe in which his ill-gotten goods had been stashed.  Finding the safe empty, Kline's character says, in a singsong, frustrated tone, "Disappointed!"  Jeffrey Skilling used the same term&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;"disappointed"&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;to describe his 24-year sentence yesterday.  And in both cases, the understatement reaction created a jarring note.<br /><br /> Disappointed?  Skilling's 24-year sentence is one shy of Bernie Ebbers's 25-year record white-collar sentence.  (Although I doubt that Skilling will drive himself to his medium-security prison in a Mercedes, the way that Ebbers did.)  Skilling's sentence ties with the first iteration of Jamie Olis's sentence, which was reduced to six years on rehearing.  Even with time off for good behavior, Skilling will be an old man when he emerges from prison, assuming that his appeals all fail.<br /><br /> And the appeals are likely to fail.  Even the willful blindness jury instruction &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; which is probably too close to comfort to the civil negligence standard that the Enron plaintiffs will emphasize &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; may not be considered reversible error.  Moreover, the "honest services" portion of the appeal, arguing that Skilling's acts weren't designed to enrich himself but were designed to help Enron, is going to fall flat.  Skilling wasn't a middle-manager, behaving the way that company-drawn incentives wanted him to behave.  He created those incentives in the first place.  Like the bad version of mark-to-market accounting, he can't be on both sides of the equation at once:  creating incentives for unreasonable company behavior and then complaining that he was only doing what the company had asked him to do.  Skilling, despite his claims of innocence, will almost certainly be spending roughly a quarter of a century in the same type of federal prison that houses much more violent offenders.<br /><br /> Before we spend too much time focusing on Skilling's reaction to yesterday's sentence, let's remind ourselves of a few things:  he is a real human, with real friends and family, each of whom know him very differently from the way that we who read about him "know" him.  We can't assume that his lack of affect in reaction to his sentence is diagnosable, in a DSM-IV kind of way, although I'm sure that there will be people who will call him a sociopath.  (He might be a sociopath, or he may just be in shock.  We just don't know enough about him to be able to make any real conclusions.)  What we do know is that he has insisted on his innocence, and his insistence didn't ring true with the judge or the jury.  <br /><br /> Skilling undoubtedly truly believes that his activities were in Enron's best interest and that his ideas &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; apart from their execution by less-brilliant people than himself &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; were visionary.  In a way, what Skilling, Lay, and Fastow did (along with their many collaborators) was very different in kind from, say, the $5 "gamble" on the Ford Pinto's tendency to explode when rear-ended.  Ford engaged in cost-benefit analysis and decided that the extra $5/car to make the Pinto safer wasn't worth the expense.  Enron, on the other hand, saw no downside to moving losses off its balance sheet: it was simply forestalling any too-early market reaction to creative, but doomed, ideas.  Viewed through a cost-benefit lens, perhaps Enron was less culpable than Ford.  (But try telling that to people whose pensions disappeared in less than a month at the end of 2001.)<br /><br /> What we're learning from Enron is that incentives dictate results, and a company that prides itself on cutthroat behavior and short-term rewards will easily go from bending the truth to lying outright.  What we're learning from other corporate scandals &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; such as the backdating of option grants and the use of pretexting to get information about leaks of board deliberations &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; is that lying is still at the heart of most bad decisions.<br /><br /> Here's a clue:  when the advice to engage in an action starts with the sentence, "Now, first you're going to have to lie a bit," you probably shouldn't listen to the rest of the advice.  Without the lies, there would have been no Nigerian barge "sales" from Enron to Merrill Lynch.  There would have been no dramatic profits from stock options that "happened" to be granted on fortuitous days.  And Patricia Dunn would probably still be the Chair of the Board of H-P.  <br /><br /><em>Disappointed?</em>  We're all disappointed:<ul><li>that the checks and balances inside and outside Enron didn't work; <br /><li>that the board of directors gave Enron and Andy Fastow free reign to engage in massive self-dealing; <br /><li>that Enron's internal incentives encouraged its workers to create deals that resulted in short-term, paper profits rather than long-term, real value; <br /><li>that the increasingly outrageous schemes that Enron created to hide its losses quarterly and annually kept Enron alive long enough to ruin the lives of thousands of investors gullible enough to invest in Enron's stock; <br /><li>that the investment banks and analysts engaged in quid-pro-quo deals to prop up Enron's paper fortunes; <br /><li>and that no amount of governmental regulation can prevent more Enrons or other corporate idiocies from happening every day.</ul><br /><em>Nancy B.

Olivas</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that the Secure Fence Act signed into law by President Bush and authorizing the construction of a 700-mile barrier along part of the US border with Mexico is a shortsighted election-time absurdity that cannot work...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/michaelolivasnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font> once had a friend who told me that she just cringed every time a professional woman on campus said or did something stupid. I remember trying to assure her that most men didn&#39;t feel that way, but I know better now what she meant. Recently, an undocumented Mexican in Houston was accused of killing a police officer after being apprehended for a traffic stop. When I saw the guy on television and heard he was not only undocumented but a once-deported felon, I just cringed, knowing the immigrant-bashing that was sure to come. And I am not identifying with the guy - I am Mexican American, but my people have been in the United States since 1695, before there was a United States. (My grandfather, born in territorial New Mexico in the 1890&#39;s, used to say that the border crossed our family, not the other way around.) Sure enough, the Houston Police Department amended its policy to ratchet up its immigrant enforcement and apprehension. I surely do not want this guy back in the country, but how will HPD enforce a policy that essentially singles out detainees who look Mexican, and how will immigrant communities respond to police initiatives and law enforcement when they become aware that HPD is taking on immigration duties? <br /><br />All this came to mind as I saw President Bush signing the "Secure Fence Act of 2006." The bill, passed by the U.S. Senate on September 29, 2006, authorizes the construction of 700 miles of new border fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. His acquiescing to this bit of political theater makes him just another victim of 9/11, when his then-scheduled bilateral talks with Mexican President Vincente Fox were made impossible. It surely is a sign of his political isolation. But about this fence, I reserve the only proper response: laughing out loud at its absurdity. At election time these days, the most dangerous place to be is between a candidate and the border, all of them on the side of increased border security in the name of reducing terrorism. Other than the American jihadist, is there anyone who is not for reducing terrorism? Can any serious person believe that fencing ourselves in will work to keep the bad guys out? My colleague at the University of Houston, sociologist Nestor Rodriguez, has demonstrated in his careful scholarship over the last decade that all that enhanced security and border-crossing militarization has achieved has been to drive the border-crossers further into the desert, where more of them die.<br /><br />I had hoped that the President's time in Texas and experience with Mexicans would lead to more meaningful and comprehensive immigration reform, not just the jingoistic resort to this bandaid. When permanent residents have more than a decade-long wait to reunite with their families, as Mexicans, Filipinos, and others do (due to the per-country limitations and the backlogs), and when federal laws have squeezed out virtually all the ways that Mexicans can legally come to the US, it is little wonder that so many enter without inspection. Reinstating the hated <em>bracero</em> "guest-worker" program will hardly scratch the surface, and such initiatives could only work if they were coupled fairly with more nuanced naturalization and legalization efforts. <br /><br />Into this gap, local and state efforts have been enacted to do the federal government's job. In Redondo Beach, CA, Farmingdale, NY, Hazelton, PA, Valley Park, MO, Norcross, GA and elsewhere this failure of federal resolve and singlemindedness about punishing immigrants is playing out, exacting a political tax upon all those who look different from the local population. The first person arrested in Georgia when a township enacted a comprehensive immigration ban in 1999 was Spanish language Christian minister Carlos Guevara, who was prosecuted under the English-only provisions for posting signs for church services in the language of his congregation. Even though this ordinance was struck down, as was the 1996 assault upon immigrants in California, in the guise of Proposition 187, these efforts have increased like mushrooms after a soaking rainfall. <br /><br />National Conference of State Legislatures data show that over 500 immigration-related bills were introduced in state legislatures in the first half of 2006 alone, and that 79 had been enacted, in 33 states. This hydraulic reaction of local townships and states undertaking the dirty work while the national government fulminates is now beginning to get politicians and policymakers to question the federal preemption powers, including the exclusive role for Congress. And some of these are just demonstrably shortsighted. As one example, by denying the undocumented any means of securing drivers licenses, we have created an entire population of unlicensed and uninsured drivers, who cannot purchase insurance in any circumstances. We are all made less-secure by resorting to the easy solutions, which have such clearly counterproductive results. While earlier cases have struck down state foreign policies and petty nuisance regulations, do we really want 500 immigration regulators, all of them outracing each other to the bottom?<br /><br />And restrictionist groups and Fox Channel-racebaiting seem to have won the rhetorical battle, if not the high ground. Who would have thought that the outrageous term "anchor-baby" would have entered the lexicon, as if these citizen children born in the United States somehow can convey immigration benefits to their mothers, when laws preclude any such derivative immigration status until the petitioner is 21 years of age? How clever of these children to have arranged to have been born here! I have waged an unsuccessful battle with the <em>New York Times</em> to purge their pages of the offensive term "illegal alien," which many other print and film media employ because it is in the <em>Times</em> style manual. Even moderates and progressive legislators have succumbed to the siren song, as Barack Obama and others voted for this chimerical lure of fencing off our borders. If the movie <em>The Graduate</em> were being re-made today, the word would not be "plastics." In this setting, it would be "Halliburton."<br /><br />As with any other such complex issue, a one-sided, enforcement-only measure cannot work, and these policymakers and elected officials know better. Shame on them.<br />  <br /><br /><em>Michael A. Olivas is William B. Bates Distinguished Chair in Law at the University of Houston Law Center</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Chibli Mallat, visiting professor at Princeton University and a prominent Middle East human rights lawyer who in 2003 turned down an invitation to join the Iraqi Special Tribunal that would judge Saddam Hussein, says that even given the chaos of the Dujail trial it is not too late to save the rule of law for Iraqis by moving the appeal of the verdict against the former Iraqi president outside of Iraq, where justice can both be done and seen to be done...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/chiblimallatnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>S</strong></font>o Saddam Hussein was sentenced to death. This does not come as a surprise. If one person were to be singled out in the world today for the ultimate sentence, Saddam would be the one. He is personally responsible for the death of about two million people through his rule between 1968 and 2003. With all the blood of innocent Iraqis, Iranians, Kuwaitis, Lebanese, Israelis, Americans upon him I would nonetheless not endorse the death sentence, as a matter of principle, and it will be important to see whether Jalal Talibani, the president of Iraq, who also stands against the death penalty as a matter of principle, will refuse to sign the order. Many Iraqis clamor for the execution of Saddam, and it will be hard to stand against that.<br /><br />But this is not the only difficult issue raised by this historic trial, which must not be allowed to fail universal standards for the rule of law. Too much is at stake for the large majority of decent, moderate Iraqis. Only the rule of law can stand against the barbarity inflicted on the country by extremist Islamists, former Baathists and neighboring leaders who do not wish for accountability to prevail in the Middle East under any shape or form. For them, Saddam&#39;s trial is just another battleground. <br /><br />From the very early days, it was clear that the trial should take place outside Iraq. For jurists like me and other more distinguished colleagues who were called upon to sit on the bench in 2003 when Saddam was apprehended, it was unsafe to go and stay in Baghdad. I turned down the offer. The situation has grown far worse since, and only moving the proceedings abroad can save the day. <br /><br />Ever since it started three years ago in the so-called Iraq Special Court, now renamed the High Criminal Court, the trial has been a failure. A low point was reached in the last few months: first, Abdullah al-Amiri, the president of the court who was appointed at the beginning of the summer, opined that the main accused was not a dictator. The remarks were uttered in open court to the face of one the victims of the Halabja massacres of 1988, when some 5000 Kurds were gassed to death in a matter of minutes in that small Iraqi Northern city. Amiri was forced to quit, but the dismissal of a sitting judge in the middle of a trial is the latest manifestation of a process gone awry. The reason is simple: the Iraqi judiciary is incapable of rising on its own to the historic task it has been assigned. Then, the brother-in-law of Mohammed Oreibi al-Khalifa, the new judge presiding over Saddam Hussein&#39;s genocide trial, was killed. This follows half a dozen trail-related assassinations, including those of two lawyers of Saddam Hussein. The last month has seen the thirteenth assassination directly associated with the trial. Rendering justice in Baghdad is an impossible task, and radical redress is needed. Only the transfer of the court abroad, and its transformation into an international or mixed tribunal, can allow justice to be seen to be done. <br /><br />Difficulties started well before the 2003 invasion, and it is unfortunate that a tribunal was not set up as early as 1991, when the German Foreign Minister at the time, Hans Dietrich Genscher, suggested that Saddam should be held judicially accountable for the invasion of Kuwait. With colleagues from the Iraqi opposition then, I helped in 1996 to establish <a href="http://www.indict.org.uk/">Indict</a>, an international NGO which sought to bring Saddam Hussein and his aides to trial in a neutral court for their unique record of crimes against humanity. Not enough support was garnered to establish an international tribunal. This is the more unfortunate since the delayed establishment of the Iraqi Court proved to be another instance of victors&#39; justice. <br /><br />Since then, the court has failed almost every single test of a fair trial under basic standards: the main accused and his acolytes were given deference which choice world criminals should have never been allowed to exercise, a plethora of lawyers postured to the world without judges questioning who was paying for all their fees and expenses. Since Saddam Hussein, his family and supporters were footing the bill, the court did not question where those funds came from, while killings by Baathists remained high, and continue to date to be supported by the main accused in open court. Lack of fairness extended in all directions. The court failed even on substantive choices: instead of focusing on the notorious anti-Kurdish genocide at Anfal, and on the massacre of Shi&#39;is by the dozens of thousands in April 1991, the first case focused on Dujail, an obscure and relatively minor killing occasion in 1983: only (!!) a hundred people had been executed by the regime in response to an assassination attempt that took place in the Middle Euphrates village, at a time when Iraq was in the throes of a war started by Saddam Hussein against Iran, a war that would eventually claim a million casualties. <br /><br />There is nothing shameful about admitting that the judicial system is incapable of coping with a challenge of the magnitude faced by Iraq&#39;s tragic modern history, and in the aftermath of the February 2005 assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri we have in Lebanon reconciled ourselves to the establishment of a mixed Lebanese and international tribunal to try suspects that will operate outside Lebanon. Like their Iraqi kin in misery, Lebanon&#39;s peaceful citizens know that victims and witnesses would not be protected enough in the present tense state of the country, that lawyers for the accused would not be safe enough to offer their clients a professional defense not tainted by ill-acquired money, and that Lebanese judges are not shielded sufficiently, nor are they competent enough in a highly complex and novel field of international law. However traumatic the Lebanese experience since the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri, the case in Iraq is far more tragic.<br /><br />The trial of Hussein and his aides is too important a test of legal accountability in the Middle East to fail. It must be moved outside Iraq, at the appellate level where it now stands, even that means that the final decision will be delayed a few weeks. I know that a number of prominent colleagues in the Iraqi cabinet share this conviction. All that is required is a request from the Iraqi government to the Security Council. <br /><br /> <br /><em>Chibli Mallat, presidential candidate for Lebanon, is a visiting professor at the Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University. He has litigated several cases on behalf of victims of internationally-defined crimes in the Middle East.</em><br />

		<title>The Hussein Verdict: Beyond Justice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.amherst.edu/~ljst/faculty.html#ldouglas">Lawrence Douglas</a>, Professor of Law, Jurisprudence and Social Thought at Amherst College, says the trial of Saddam Hussein had little didactic value in Iraq for various reasons, but it could ironically have more impact in America on the eve of mid-term elections...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/lawrencedouglas.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>P</strong></font>resident Bush hailed the verdict condemning Saddam Hussein to death by hanging "as a milestone in the Iraqi people's efforts to replace the rule of a tyrant with the rule of law."  Others have been less sanguine in their reactions.  Amnesty International promptly condemned the verdict, decrying the trial as "deeply flawed and unfair."  Clearly the trial suffered from numerous and substantial flaws.  Three members of the defense team representing Saddam and his co-defendants were assassinated.  The tribunal was subjected to withering political pressure from the Iraqi government, resulting in the resignation of the first presiding judge and in the withdrawal of a possible replacement.  The judge who finally took the reins of control, Raouf Rasheed Abdel-Rahman, frequently got into shouting matches with the defendants and openly favored the prosecution.  Had the trial been removed to an international tribunal, as many human rights observers counseled, such defects would never have been tolerated.  <br /><br />All the same, the trial was not a complete sham.  The prosecution was able to present strong evidence connecting Saddam to the killings in Dujail.  The judges apparently struggled long to weigh the evidence brought against the various defendants (though their compendious written judgment has not yet been made public).  The fact that one defendant was acquitted is a good sign.  At the very least, the judges appeared to have learned the Nuremberg lesson that nothing legitimates the death sentence of an architect of atrocity better than the acquittal of a lackey.  So if the Hussein trial failed to live up to the hopes of some that Iraqi jurists would quickly master the rules of the rule of law, it also disappointed the doomsday prognostications of others who foretold a legal catastrophe.<br /><br />But in assessing the success of the trial, it won't do simply to focus on the quality of the justice dispensed.  For the trial had other goals, and we need to ask whether these were accomplished.  Chief among these was the didactic purpose of the trial.  Like the Nuremberg, Eichmann, and Papon trials, the Hussein proceeding meant to clarify the historical record; it sought to give an accounting to an Iraqi and international audience of the crimes perpetrated by Saddam's regime.  Here, however, the trial stumbled.  In part, this was a result of the very focus of the trial.  Eager to establish a manageable case, the prosecution focused on a relatively minor act &#8212; the reprisal killings of 148 Shiites in Dujail in 1982.  While this narrow focus might have made prosecutorial sense, the crimes themselves pale in comparison to the violence that grips the Iraqi nation on a daily basis.  This fact alone creates a strong case for delaying Saddam's execution until the completion of his present trial for atrocities committed against Iraqi Kurds during the Anfal military campaign in the late 1980s.  That trial at least promises to do fuller justice to the abominable crimes of Saddam's regime.<br /><br />The didactic value of the trial was also upset by Saddam's showmanship.  At no point in the proceeding did the exposure of horrific crimes subdue the former strongman or embarrass him into a moment of contrition.  To the contrary.  Stealing a page from the playbook of Slobodan Milosevic, whose death in March deprived the Hague Tribunal from ever passing judgment, Saddam demonstrated showed himself more than adept at disrupting proceedings.  The photo that accompanied the <em>New York Times</em>' headline, "Hussein Is Sentenced to Death by Hanging," spoke volumes:  absent are the five members of the Tribunal that pronounced judgment; instead, monopolizing the page is an image of the ever-defiant former ruler, brow knitted in anger, shouting and waving an admonishing finger at the court.  (A disembodied hand, presumably belonging to a guard, grabs at Saddam's wrist in a feeble attempt at restraint).  CNN's coverage of the verdict likewise focused not on the Tribunal but on Saddam; indeed, in the cacophony of angry voices that accompanied the reading of the verdict, only the former dictator's prevailed.  From the simultaneous interpreter, the viewer heard not the court's words of condemnation but Saddam's words of denunciation.  It was as if the defendant sat in judgment on the Tribunal.<br /><br />By upstaging the trial as a didactic exercise, Saddam also undermined its function as a tool of reconciliation.  By conferring public recognition upon a suppressed history of victimization, and by providing an irrefutable accounting of wrongs, trials can establish a common history that serves the interests of reconciliation.  But by interrupting the testimony of victims and haranguing the court with challenges to its legitimacy, Saddam only succeeded in further polarizing Iraqi society.  This perhaps was unavoidable.  After all, in a nation in which governmental officials cannot even agree to convene a national reconciliation conference, can we expect a trial to contribute greatly to this end? <br /><br />Does this mean that the Hussein trial was a failure?  It's worth remembering that in the decades directly following the Nuremberg trial, the majority of Germans viewed the trial with contempt, as an exercise in victor's justice.  Now Nuremberg is generally viewed in Germany with respect &#8212; as an event that prodded Germans to a collective reckoning with their troubled past.  This is not to say that history will be equally kind to the Hussein trial.  In the short term, it is hard to imagine the verdict contributing anything to the stability of Iraq.  Ironically, its greatest affects are likely to be felt not in that worn-torn state, but in America, where it might shore up flagging support for Republican candidates.  I say "ironically," because we are assured that the timing of the verdict, on the eve of the midterm elections, was entirely fortuitous. <br />  <br /><br /><em>Lawrence Douglas is Professor of Law, Jurisprudence &amp; Social Thought at Amherst College</em><br />

To pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips<br />as well.</em><br /><br />- Justice Robert Jackson at Nuremberg</blockquote><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he verdict of guilty and the trial of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has failed the Iraqi people and failed the rule of law. It is an abuse of justice.<br /><br />Politically it sends a clear message to the Iraqi people: if they want to defend themselves they cannot look to law, they cannot look to the US government, they cannot look to the occupation government the US setup in Iraq &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; they must defend themselves using all necessary means by which national liberation movements are permitted to defend themselves.<br /><br />The trial of the Iraqi President has been declared unfair by every independent expert who has reviewed it. It constitutes the worse form of &quot;victors&#39; injustice.&quot;<br /><br />On 1 September 2006, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention <a href="http://international-lawyers.org/Documents/WGAD%20Final%20Decision.pdf">declared the trial unfair and a violation of international law</a> [opinion, PDF]. The Working Group is the UN body of five experts of fair trial, including an Iranian. The Working Group issued its opinion after scrutinizing the trial proceedings for two years, reviewing hundreds of documents, and even issuing a preliminary decision telling the United States and its occupation government what it had to improve in a preliminary judgment a year earlier. The consideration of the proceedings before the Iraqi Special Tribunal by the Working Group, were more thorough than the Iraqi Special Tribunal&#39;s own review of the evidence in the cases before it.<br /><br />The Iraqi Special Tribunal (IST) did not even review the most important evidence in the trial. This evidence is the records of the trial proceedings of the Dujail trials. First, the IST claimed that there were no records. Then the IST allowed the prosecution to introduce a few selected pages of the Dujail trial proceedings into evidence. Then the IST admitted the Dujail trial record existed, but refused to provide it.<br /><br />Similarly the IST refused to allow defense lawyers go to Dujail to even see the site of the alleged crimes or to interview witnesses. When the defense lawyers found witnesses, the court ordered their beating and arrest and sent a person from the court to coach and threaten the defense witnesses. <br /><br />But perhaps the IST thought the defense lawyers were just lucky to be alive. Four defense lawyers were killed, allegedly by Iraqi government agents, some with American soldiers nearby. No attacker has been arrested or punished; the attacks have not even been investigated. An American marshal also assaulted an American lawyer at the courthouse threatening him with further bodily harm; and the US government has refused to respond to a complaint about this treatment. Even on the day of the verdict the chief judge ordered 78-year-old former US Attorney-General Ramsey Clark accosted by bailiffs for seeking to submit arguments proving that the IST was unfair. The IST had refused to accept these submissions from the Iraqi lawyers for months despite repeated attempts to deliver them.<br /><br />Indeed, when the defense lawyers submitted preliminary arguments challenging the legality of the IST in November 2005, the clerk, Mr. Hasan Riza, in January 2006, returned the papers saying the IST &quot;did not want them&quot; and would not decide them.<br /><br />But despite their impotence in respect of their responsibility for security, the United States has trained the judges to act as they have. In addition the US has allegedly written the final decision as they wrote the closing statement for the defense after the judge forced the defense lawyers chosen by the defendants out of the courtroom.<br /><br />While the verdict was alleged being written by the occupying powers thousands of Iraqis have died because these same people can&#39;t provide basic security in the country they illegally invaded and occupied. <br /><br />This arrogant abuse of the law is part and parcel of the illegal invasion of Iraq. The trial was the direct result of multiple violations of international law, especially the illegal crime of aggression perpetrated against the Iraqi people. Actions that are the result of an illegal action must not be recognized by any state in the international community.<br /><br />The trial was undertaken by a court set up and controlled by the United States, an occupying power. This violates the express provisions of international humanitarian law in the Fourth Geneva Convention.<br /><br />The trial was plagued by insecurity that saw defense lawyers, judges, and witnesses killed or intimidated. When the defense lawyers complained they were told there was nothing more that could be done. They were told not to complain about the murder of four defense lawyers by person allegedly connected to the Iraqi government.<br /><br />The defense was given no time and no facilities to prepare a defense, even the President&#39; money was stolen from him when he was captured by the Americans. All exculpating evidence was withheld from the defense; defense witnesses were threatened by court officials; defense lawyers were assaulted by US officials; and the defendants we not given the charges against them until eight months after the prosecution had started presenting evidence and the day the defense was required to<br />start its case. The list of violations is long and undoubtedly the reason why every independent expert has found the trial unfair.<br /><br />The Dujail trial is one of the worst abuses of justice in modern history. If N&Atilde;&frac14;remberg was victors&#39; justice under difficult circumstances, the trial of the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was victors&#39; injustice founded on George W. Bush&#39;s crime of aggression.<br /> <br /><br /><em><a href="http://international-lawyers.org/">Curtis F.J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=152">David Crane</a> of Syracuse University College of Law, former Chief Prosecutor for the UN Special Court for Sierra Leone, says that the Dujail crimes against humanity trial of Saddam Hussein before the Iraqi High Tribunal was hardly perfect, but it was nonetheless a step forward for the rule of law in the face of longtime impunity for atrocities...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidcranenew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>t was rough justice, but it was justice nonetheless, and it reflects mankind's early attempts to face down the beast of impunity.  It wasn't pretty to watch, but the trial of Saddam Hussein and his henchmen shows that we are at least doing something to account for mass atrocity.  Its not always been this way, in fact in large measure, prior to the early 1990's, there was only one other international attempt to use the rule of law to hold accountable those who would use murder and terror as a national policy.  That early attempt at Nuremberg laid the cornerstone for today's tribunals and mankind's attempts to reign in the beast.<br /><br />These tribunals range from the domestic court in Iraq that found Saddam Hussein guilty of crimes against humanity, to the ad hoc tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, to the various other hybrids and internationalized domestic courts, as well as the International Criminal Court.  This modern system has been in existence for only thirteen years.  It is just the beginning, but it is a beginning and we should take heart in the fact that in most instances we are doing something to face down the beast of impunity as it nibbles around the edges of civilization.<br /><br />We should take this small moment of justice and resolve to move the concept of international justice forward in a consistent way that returns the respect of the law missing in areas where atrocity has happened.  If we can show victims that the law is fair, that no one is above the law, and that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of the gun, we will begin to develop a seedbed from which freedom and justice will grow.  The system of tribunals and courts will greatly assist in this effort.  The global community must remain focused.<br /><br />So what are we to make of the judgment that took place in Iraq this past Sunday?  In general we see that one of the most powerful leaders in the Middle East, and a mega-murderer, was humbled before the law.  We see that justice provides the victims some type of reconciliation and a factual accounting for what took place to their families, friends, villages, and towns. We see that the rule of law can be used to seek justice in a part of the world where the concept of justice has been strained indeed.  In short, a leader who controlled and influenced the lives of millions throughout the Middle East, whose policies caused the murder, rape, and torture of millions, and destabilized an entire region of the world was held accountable for those policies and criminal acts.  <br /><br />It is important to note that the domestic court that tried Hussein for the Dujail incident was born of controversy which will forever taint the result.  One must ask the question, but for the United States would the trial itself have taken place?  Depending how you view the question this could be a positive or a negative.  Accountability had to take place in Iraq.  Hussein had to be tried for what he had done along with his regime.  The effort by the United States to set up the Iraqi High Tribunal, along with its Iraqi counterparts, and its hard work behind the scenes to ensure some stability in the court room, must be acknowledged.  Yet it is that effort that has tainted the Iraqi High Tribunal.  How so?<br /><br />First, the United States has lately adopted a "go it alone policy" when it comes to international justice.  Second, it&#39;s taken a "you are either with us or against us" approach to the ideological struggle in what should be mankind's confronting of international terror.  Third, the United States has used methods of combating terror such as torture and unaccounted-for detention, and has invoked a type of amnesty for war crimes that US citizens might have committed in this fight.  Fourth, it has used a shoddy rationale to invade a sovereign state in what arguably was an aggressive act of war.  Because the United States is so closely aligned with the Iraqi High Tribunal, its loss of the moral high ground has weakened the Tribunal&#39;s efforts to seek justice in Iraq.<br /><br />In some ways the United States has used the very tactics for which we hold others accountable.  This overshadows the result last Sunday and clouds the slow, awkward, but steady movement forward by the global community to establish a system of international justice for the 21st century and beyond.  History will show that this effort in Iraq was a tragic sideshow by the world's only superpower, a power that had lost its moral compass.  Though some of the results sought in Iraq - the downfall of Hussein and his subsequent trial - are noteworthy, the debacle of the Iraq occupation will be marked as a low point in the history of the United States.  Aggressive war under the guise of the rule of law is a dangerous path that distracts from attempts to hold accountable those who chose to commit atrocity.  In many ways, the United States has moved the concept of international justice backwards to a time where the desire for some type of peace and political stability absolved those who committed crimes against humanity.  This "get along to get along" approach so prevalent in the 20th century helped set the stage for atrocities that resulted in the deaths and ruin of millions.  This cannot stand and what the United States is attempting to do with the concept of international justice only weakens this noble cause.<br /><br />There has been an accounting in Iraq for what Saddam Hussein and his regime did to his own people, as well as others.  We should take some small sense of pride that mankind now expects that those who commit atrocity will generally be held accountable, though politics will always play the determining role in whether the global community decides to act.  It may be imperfect justice, but it is justice.  Mankind needs to keep moving forward.  Wherever the beast of impunity rears its ugly head, it must be faced down.  We're developing the legal tools to do so.  Holding accountable Hussein, Milosevic, Taylor, and others shows that it is a new dawn, still a bit cloudy but the brightness of a new day under the rule of law is predicted.<br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a TARGET="_blank" href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Geoffrey_Corn.htm">Geoffrey S. Corn</a>, Lt. Col. US Army (Ret.) and former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters, now a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that Americans going to the polls with the Iraq war on their minds might reflect on how they would think about conflict and its consequences if the war were being fought by a military largely made up of draftees....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/cornforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>t's the war, stupid!  As Americans cast their ballots in mid-term elections, the news commentators keep reminding us that this election is really about the war in Iraq.  Considering the duration of this war is about to surpass the duration of U.S. participation in World War II, it can't be a bad thing that Americans consider this as a priority issue, regardless of individual views on the war.  Considering this interest has emerged among a population that remains relatively disconnected with the human cost of this war, one cannot help but wonder how the prospect of a draft might impact this debate.<br /><br /> For the first time in a long time, the United States is involved in a conflict that simply cannot be considered a sideshow by most Americans.  This is a significant contrast from so many of the military operations that have been executed by our armed forces since the end of the Vietnam conflict.  While most of these were the focus of substantial attention within the military community, they never seemed to grab much public attention, with the predictable result that none of them evolved into the political lightening rod that Iraq has become.  Of course, most of these operations were not "shooting wars", and even those involving combat operations were "fast, furious, and finished" very quickly.<br /><br /> Iraq is a very different conflict, as most Americans clearly appreciate.  The obvious difference is that it has involved deadly combat that has been anything but "fast and finished".  Indeed, the constant drone of "bad news" coming out of Iraq is offered by commentators as the explanation for the continuing loss of support for the war.  But it is the other unique aspect of this war that has perhaps been "under analyzed": the fact that Iraq is the first war of substantial duration fought by the U.S. in modern history with an all volunteer force.    <br /><br /> Of course, as political lightening rods go, the word "draft" is off the chart.  Those few politicians who have raised the prospect of national conscription have been quickly condemned as engaging in political gamesmanship of the highest magnitude.  Besides, why should any politician propose such an "antiquated" concept when there is such unified opposition to a draft by the military?  The answer may lie in the question itself: is the purpose of conscription only to fill the ranks?  Or, does it involve something more profound in the relationship between the people and the wars that are waged in the name of this nation? <br /><br /> As the news of eroding support for the war in Iraq continues unabated, it seems appropriate to contemplate how this debate might be impacted if the men and women fighting the war were not doing so because they volunteered to serve their nation, but because they were required to serve their nation.  With more and more Americans questioning the wisdom of continuing this fight, less and less of whom have likely contemplated a personal "stake in the venture", it seems reasonable to assume that the prospect of mandatory military service would profoundly impact views on the war.   Unlike the current civil/military environment, a draft would "re-connect" most Americans with the consequences of initiating, waging, and sustaining war.  Today, however, as most Americans know, the all volunteer force, and the increasing reliance on unprecedented numbers of civilian contractors to provide a wide array of support for these forces, has enabled the nation to avoid mandatory service to fill the ranks.<br /><br /> This is not to say that a draft would necessarily produce an "anti-war" impact.  It is well to recall that most of this nation's wars were fought and won by forces composed largely of conscripts.  Even support for the conflict in Vietnam remained solid for a number of years when the bulk of those Americans fighting and dying were conscripts.  What does seem certain, however, is that a draft would establish a true "stake in the venture" among all Americans.  Such a stake would ideally compel each citizen to analyze the wisdom of war with much greater focus, a goal many believe the founders of this nation had in mind when they developed checks and balances related to war-making.  Sticking a flag or yellow ribbon sticker on a car would have a very different meaning, as those with family and friends in harms way understand so well.  Rhetoric such as "cut and run" or "stay the course" would be dissected with much greater clarity because of the common connection to the cause we would all share.  And perhaps most importantly, politicians who voted for or against war would do so with full knowledge that the people who put them in office will share a common burden to execute their decisions, a knowledge that might motivate much greater debate when war is proposed, and not just when it goes badly.<br /><br /> The political impact of establishing such a "draft" connection to the current war is impossible to predict.  While many assume that it would undermine support for the war, perhaps it would actually trigger more intense political pressure to adjust the strategy in order to ensure we prevail in our national goals.  In this regard, it seems particularly revealing that the four armed service oriented newspapers (Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps Times) this week ran a joint editorial this week calling for the resignation of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.  Obviously, Americans most connected to the war are unwilling to tolerate perpetual ineffective strategic execution, even when they oppose "cutting and running". However, regardless of the direction in which a draft would push national leaders, it would be a direction much more palpably connected to "the people" as a result of an inability to displace the burden of war onto the limited number among us who choose to volunteer.<br /><br />Of course, the bitter memories of the draft lingering from the Vietnam conflict, along with the perpetual resistance of such a move by military leaders (which itself perhaps merits greater scrutiny) make its resurrection so unlikely that it is not even a part of our national debate regarding this war.  Nonetheless, as Americans contemplate the issue of war as they visit the polls (or maybe even as they contemplate whether they will visit the polls), perhaps they should consider for a moment whether their views on the war would be altered if the draft were resurrected.  If this nation continues to rely upon only those among us who choose voluntarily to fight our wars (as is almost inevitable) it seems only appropriate that when the rest of us cast our ballots we carefully consider whether the burden they are called upon to shoulder in the name of our nation is one we would &#8212; even if reluctantly &#8212; share with them. <br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~isomin/">Ilya Somin</a> of the George Mason University School of Law says that while political ignorance among voters is more the byproduct of rational calculation than laziness or stupidity, one way to address the problem is to reduce the size and complexity of government...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/ilyasomin.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>N</strong></font>ancy Pelosi may soon become the new Speaker of the House of Representatives. But 67% of Americans admitted in a recent survey that they don't know enough about her to have an opinion. Fifty-five percent say the same thing about her political rival Dennis Hastert, the current Republican Speaker of the House. These findings are not surprising to experts; indeed, they are consistent with decades of research showing uniformly low levels of political knowledge in the American electorate. Moreover, such ignorance is not primarily the result of laziness or stupidity, but is usually caused by perfectly rational behavior.  Not only does political ignorance lead to low levels of information acquisition, it also leads many voters to make poor use of the knowledge they do have. There is probably no way to eliminate political ignorance in the foreseeable future. But its harmful effects could be mitigated by reducing the size and complexity of government.<br /><br /><strong>The Extent of Ignorance</strong><br /><br />The extent of political ignorance is well-documented. Despite ongoing debate over gay rights over the last few years, a recent survey showed that only 36 percent of Americans realize that homosexuality is an inherited genetic trait rather than a result of upbringing or lifestyle choices. A 2003 poll showed that 70 percent don&#39;t know Congress passed a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens, even though the Bush Administration-supported  law  is the largest new government program in forty years and is expected to cost more than a trillion dollars over the next ten years. Voters also often misunderstand issues they are aware of. For example, high gas prices have become an important issue in this year's election despite the fact that experts overwhelmingly agree that there is little or nothing that the President or Congress can do about short-term trends in this area.<br /><br /> Public knowledge of the war on terrorism is not much better. 58 percent admit they  have heard little or nothing about the USA Patriot Act and 52 percent of Americans say they do not know enough about the highly publicized report of the 9/11 Commission to have an opinion about it. Since many people are reluctant to admit ignorance on surveys, the true proportion of citizens with little or no knowledge of  Hastert, Pelosi, Patriot Act, and  9/11 Commission report is likely to be even greater than the numbers suggest.<br /><br />However sad those results may be, they are not surprising. Decades of research show that most citizens know very little about politics and public policy. Even more alarming is that most citizens often lack basic background knowledge about political leaders, parties and the structure of government.<br /> <br />For example, the majority of Americans don&#39;t know the name of their congressman, and most do not know which branches or levels of government are responsible for which issues. Furthermore, studies show that most do not understand the basic differences between liberal and conservative ideologies.<br /><br />Voters do not have to be policy wonks to make an informed decision. Sometimes they can get by through the use of what scholars call &quot;information shortcuts,&quot; relying on small bits of information as a substitute for deeper knowledge. For example, even if a voter knows nothing about Candidate X as an individual, a lot of useful information about X&#39;s policy positions can be derived simply from knowing what party he belongs to. But lack of basic knowledge is difficult to overcome through shortcuts. Knowing that a candidate is a Democrat is only useful information to a voter if he or she has some idea of what positions the Democrats stand for, how they differ from the Republicans, and  what the likely effects of their competing policy proposals are.<br /><br /><strong>Why Political Ignorance is Rational</strong><br /><br />It is tempting to conclude that voters must be lazy or stupid. But even a smart and hardworking person can rationally decide not to pay much attention to political information. No matter how well-informed a citizen is, one vote has only a tiny chance of affecting the outcome of an election; about one chance in 100 million in the case of a presidential race. As a result, even a citizen who cares a great deal about public policy has little incentive to acquire sufficient knowledge to make an informed choice. Becoming a well-informed voter is, in most situations, simply irrational. Unfortunately, the rational decisions of individuals create a dysfunctional collective outcome in which the majority of the electorate is dangerously ill-informed. <br /><br />People who can influence politics in ways beyond casting a vote and those who simply find politics interesting might learn about it for perfectly rational reasons. Political professionals such as lobbyists and interest group leaders have strong incentives to become informed. But few of us are influential activists, or otherwise have political clout that goes beyond the power of the vote. And most Americans find politics far less interesting than other forms of entertainment.  Polls show that many more people know the names of the judges on &quot;The People&#39;s Court&quot; than those on the Supreme Court. A <a href="http://www.mccormicktribune.org/mtf/pressroom/2006/Survey_Results_Report.pdf">March 2006 survey</a> revealed that 52% of Americans can name two or more characters from the Simpsons, but only 28% can name two or more First Amendment rights.<br /><br /><strong>Biased Information Use and "Rooting for Your Team"</strong><br /><br />A low level of knowledge is just one of the harmful consequences of rational ignorance. Another is the fact that many voters will make poor use of such political knowledge as they do acquire. After all, if there is little incentive to acquire political information for the purpose of becoming a better voter, that suggests that most of the political knowledge we do learn is in fact  acquired for other reasons,  most likely its entertainment value.<br /><br /> There is an analogy to sports fans. Fans who acquire extensive knowledge of their favorite teams and players do not do so because they can thereby influence the outcome of games. They do it because it increases the enjoyment they get from rooting for their favorite teams. For this very reason, however, committed fans are unlikely to evaluate information about their favorite team and its rivals objectively. Committed New York Yankees fans are likely to seize on any information that makes their team look good or the rival Boston Red Sox look bad, and vice versa. Similarly, Democratic partisans who hate George W. Bush, and Republicans who reflexively support him, might acquire information in order to augment the experience of cheering on their preferred political "team." <br /><br />If this is indeed their goal, neither group is likely to evaluate Bush's performance in office objectively or accurately.  This intuition is confirmed by numerous studies showing that people tend to use new information to reinforce their preexisting views on political issues, while discounting evidence that runs counter to them. For example, an <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-01/euhs-esl012406.php">Emory University study</a> conducted during the 2004 election showed that Bush supporters interpreted new information in ways that reinforced their support for their preferred candidate, while Kerr
y voters interpreted exactly the same data in ways that strengthened their commitment to their own man.<br /><br />If political ignorance and biased information use are rational, there are limits to our ability to reduce it by reforming the education system or by improving media coverage of politics. Studies show that knowledge levels have remained roughly constant for over 50 years, despite massive increases in education levels and greatly increased availability of information. With the rise of the Internet and 24-hour news channels, political knowledge is readily available to those willing to take the time to find it.<br /> <br />The problem is not that the truth isn&#39;t out there, but that most don&#39;t bother to seek it out. <br /><br /><strong>Ignorance and the Size of Government</strong><br /><br />Even if the majority of voters paid more attention to politics than they do, that still might not be enough to cope with the complexities of the modern state. The federal government alone spends over 20 percent of our national gross domestic product and adopts thousands of regulations that touch on almost every aspect of our lives. Even highly attentive voters are unlikely to be aware of more than a small fraction of this activity. <br /><br />Thus, many important aspects of government power are likely to escape public scrutiny, and thereby also escape public accountability and democratic control. To take just one notorious example, every year the federal government spends tens of billions of dollars on counterproductive porkbarrel spending such as the notorious "bridge to nowhere." Yet pork projects persist because most voters are largely unaware of their existence, while the well-organized interest groups that benefit are not only aware, but prepared to punish politicians who refuse to satisfy their desires. If government had fewer functions, it might be easier for voters to keep track of them, and thereby combat interest group machinations. It would also be easier for voters to assess how well government is fulfilling its core functions, such as national defense. <br /><br />Obviously, political ignorance is far from the only problem that must be considered when we try to determine how large a role the state should play in our society. But it is essential to understand that decisions about the size of government involve not only policy questions about specific issues, but also the overall viability of democratic control of government. The government that governs least may well be the most democratic. <br /><br /><br /><em>Ilya Somin is Assistant Professor of Law at George Mason University.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law says that the trials of Saddam Hussein should continue and his death sentence in the Dujail case should be stayed at least until two other key proceedings against him are completed...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kellyupdated.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>S</strong></font>addam Hussein has been sentenced to death by hanging for his role in the massacre of 148 Shi'ites in the town of Dujail in 1982.  Much of the world's reaction has been neutral, characterized by muttering about not wanting to contribute to violence within the country, except for NGOs which predictably condemned the proceedings as unfair and/or illegal.  But Konstantin Kosachev, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Russian Duma, called it as he saw it:<blockquote>Today&#39;s ruling was quite predictable, given the attitudes to Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime that exist both in and beyond Iraqi society. The punishment was deliberately chosen to be the harshest. . . . I think that the death sentence on Saddam Hussein is unlikely to be carried out. It will be stopped one way or another, either at the level of the Iraqi president or by other means. This is more of a moral ruling, revenge that modern Iraq is taking on the Saddam Hussein regime.</blockquote>Chairman Kosachev's assessment was refreshingly candid.  Under Iraqi law, Saddam's sentence is automatically appealed to a nine member judicial panel which is expected to take a month to review the case.  If confirmed, then Saddam must be put to death within 30 days.  However, as Kosachev indicated, anything can happen.  Based on the track record of this trial, he is probably right.<br /><br />            This first in a series of planned trials of Saddam Hussein was conducted under the auspices of the Iraqi High Tribunal, successor to the Iraqi Special Tribunal, which was created by L. Paul Bremmer and the Coalition Provisional Authority.  Never regarded as legitimate, that body was clothed sequentially with approval from the CPA's hand-picked Iraqi Governing Authority, then the appointed provisional parliament, then finally the fully elected parliament &#8212; which induced the name change.  <br /><br />            Chaos ensued once Saddam was put in the dock and courtroom antics became the norm, much as in the case of Slobodan Milosevic's trial.  However, unlike Milosevic's trial, where the international tribunal marginalized him and continued assiduously following standard trial procedure, the IHT did not seem to know how to deal with Saddam and regularly breached normal procedure to essentially conduct much of this trial in absentia.  These theatrics occurred against the grim backdrop of multiple assassinations carried out against three of Saddam's defense lawyers.  A fourth fled the country in fear for his life.<br /><br />            The judges themselves were not immune from political machinations.  Chief Judge Rizgar Amin resigned under pressure from Shi'ite political leaders who claimed that he was not running the trial correctly.  Judge Amin protested against political interference in the trial.  He was replaced with Raouf Abdel Rahman. In Saddam's second trial, for the Anfal campaigns against the Kurds, Chief Judge Abdullah al-Amiri was sacked by the Prime Minister for his alleged bias in favor of Saddam and replaced with Muhammed al Ureybi.  <br /><br />            Because of attorney killings and political interference, discontinuity and a lack of judicial independence have plagued this court since its inception, underscoring Chairman Kosachev's general assessment that anything can happen.  U.S. officials have even opined that Saddam's trials may continue posthumously if he is in fact hanged.  That is probably likely for the current Anfal trial against the Kurds, which is in progress, but highly unlikely for the five other crimes with which he is charged.  <br /><br />            The IHT considered delaying the verdict against Saddam for two weeks, but abruptly reversed itself and issued the decision on the weekend before elections in the United States.  These mid-term elections are widely regarded as a referendum on the Bush Administration's policies in Iraq and Republicans are on the ropes in many races.  U.S. and Iraqi officials deny that the timing was deliberate.  <br /><br />             The question of whether this verdict will incite more violence in Iraq remains to be seen.  However, since the country is already for all intents and purposes in the throes of a civil war, it is likely to lead only to further recriminations on both sides rather than an all-out conflagration.  Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki claims that the verdict closes the chapter on the Saddam era, and will allow the country to move forward united.  While his hopes are laudatory, they are fundamentally misplaced.  <br /><br />            Saddam and his trials are not what the fighting is about.  The trials are a sideshow to the real question of who will control Iraq or its sub-parts.  When the British established the country from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire, welding together the Kurdish Mosul province with the Sunni Baghdad province and the Shi'ite Basra province, they disregarded the animosity each of the three groups harbored toward one another.  Successive hard-line strongmen provided the necessary glue to hold Iraq together, very similar to the method employed in Yugoslavia.  But when that glue is removed, the country's natural tendency is to fly apart into its constituent units, just as in the case of Yugoslavia.  Saddam's trial has no more bearing on this process than the trial of Tito would have had for the Yugoslavs or that Milosevic ultimately did &#8212; Yugoslavia is still disintegrating, with Montenegro leaving Serbia last summer and Kosovo to follow.<br /><br />            What Saddam's trial can do, however, is to contribute to the growing jurisprudence on genocide.  It is much more important for the development of this area of law that Saddam's current trial for the Anfal campaigns against the Kurds and the upcoming one on the gassing of the town of Halabja continue unabated.  President Talabani, a Kurd himself, should stay the execution of Saddam until the completion of those two trials.<br /><br />            The resounding elimination of sovereign immunity as a defense for crimes of genocide must be more firmly established within international law and domestic law, and verdicts on this point are of much greater importance than the first trial.  The main reason that the Dujail trial went first was the high quality of irrefutable evidence.  Posthumous trial in absentia would weaken the impact of those genocide cases.  Thus, I hope that Chairman Kosachev is right and Saddam&#39;s sentence will be stayed at least through the next two trials.  Not for Saddam's sake, as he deserves the death penalty many times over.  But for the sake of the law.<br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J. Kelly is Professor of Law at Creighton University School of Law in Omaha, Nebraska.

		<title>The case against Colorado Amendment 44</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David G. Evans, Esq. [Executive Director, Drug Free Schools Coalition of Colorado]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/marijuana-legalization-measures-fail.php">Colorado marijuana initiative</a> would have made it legal for anyone over 21 years of age to possess one ounce or less of marijuana. According to law enforcement, one ounce of marijuana is equal to 56-84 joints, depending upon size of joint. This large quantity, which the proponents of the measure called &quot;recreational&quot; use, is large enough to allow for transferring and dispensing to others. <br /> <br />The proponents claimed that alcohol is more dangerous and that marijuana is a safer alternative. The opponents pointed to the fact that there will be a major increase in accidents and property damage as a result of marijuana drugged driving. Between 1992 and 2002, there was a 162% increase in treatment admissions for marijuana use as the primary substance of abuse. There are over 4 million Americans suffering from marijuana dependence. Marijuana is addicting. Sixty-two percent of teens in drug treatment are there for marijuana use. Marijuana is generally the first illicit drug used by young people. <br /> <br />If the proposed initiative was enacted, persons twenty-one years of age and older would not be subject to state prosecution for possession of one ounce or less of marijuana because it will no longer be an offense. Under current law in section 18-18-406 (5), C,R. S., the transferring or dispensing of not more than one ounce of marijuana from one person to another for no consideration is deemed to be possession and not dispensing or selling. It follows, therefore, that persons twenty-one years of age or older who transfer or dispense one ounce or less of marijuana without consideration will be deemed to possess the marijuana which would not longer be illegal and thus no longer be subject to state prosecution for dispensing or selling.  This could include dispensing or selling to persons under age 18. The proponents conceded that this was a flaw in the initiative but that person who gave marijuana to persons under 18 could be prosecuted under a law on contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  However, how could it be contributing to delinquency if it was no longer an illegal act?<br /> <br />Despite an intensive campaign by the proponents, the good voters of Colorado rejected the initiative by a vote of 60% to 40%.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/fulltime/damato/damato.html"><strong>Anthony D&#39;Amato</strong></a> [Northwestern University School of Law]: &quot;Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff is US UN Ambassador John Bolton dressed up in sheep&#39;s clothing and wearing velvet gloves. He is no friend of internationalization, international law, or human rights.<br /><br />His main point in a <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/chertoff-says-international-law-being.php">speech</a> to the Federalist Society Friday is that its members - and he himself - believe in &quot;judicial modesty.&quot;  But by &quot;judicial modesty&quot; he means judges deferring to the political branches.  Thus, when you look at it closely, judicial modesty is failing to do one&#39;s job as a judge.  It is turning over jurisdiction to people other than judges.<br /><br />Now, I&#39;m in favor of judicial modesty when it comes to policy-making.  The Supreme Court, in my view, has no business making national policy.  Their business is to decide cases.  But in deciding cases, they should not whittle away someone&#39;s rights because Congress or the President wants to whittle them away.<br /><br />Judicial modesty, I believe, has no place at all in interfering with the judicial process.  Courts should strike down Congressional statutes, such as the Military Commission Act, when they violate the Constitution.  This is not a matter of policy.  It&#39;s a matter of a fair reading of the habeas corpus and due process clauses of the Constitution.  <br /><br />Any &quot;modesty&quot; along these lines means that Congress and the President should get away with disregarding Due Process and Habeas Corpus.  And this is precisely the kind of &quot;modesty&quot; that Michael Chertoff is peddling.  I would like to see him and John Bolton form a law firm and set up shop in Saudi Arabia where their first clients will be the Wahabbies.  They&#39;d find a nice home there.<br /><br />No international lawyer should accept the distorted view Chertoff gives of the ICJ&#39;s advisory opinion on the Construction of a Wall in Occupied Palestine.  He purposely does not even try to understand the title of the case.  The ICJ had no problem with Israel&#39;s construction of such a wall on Israeli territory.  It was only the attempt, by Israel, to construct the wall on someone else&#39;s territory that gave rise to the court&#39;s scrutiny of Israel&#39;s justifications.  Those justifications were all political, even though they were largely meritorious.  But political justifications, as we saw in the Teheran case, cut no weight in the ICJ against legal justifications.<br /><br />Nor should any international lawyer swallow Mr. Chertoff&#39;s reasoning, if it can be so-called, on the Nicaragua case.  Mining the Nicaraguan harbors was a direct violation of a treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation that the US has with Nicaragua.  (I pointed this out at the time in a letter to the <em>NY Times</em>.)  There were no other &quot;relevant parties&quot; to that treaty, as Mr. Chertoff quite erroneously suggests.<br /><br />Finally, in the <em>Breard</em> Case, Mr. Chertoff has the gall to applaud the Supreme Court&#39;s decision that Mr. Breard was time-barred from raising a treaty-based defense that could have saved him from the electric chair.  He fashions this as a case between a US court and the ICJ decision in the same case.  But aside from the ICJ decision, the Supreme Court -- as it had previously done in Alvarez-Machain -- distorted the ordinary meaning of a treaty in order to justify Executive actions.  Mr. Chertoff, it seems, is using the Supreme Court&#39;s penchant for ignoring the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution as a reason for ignoring international law.<br /><br />As you read his speech, listen carefully to the voice coming from under the lamb&#39;s fleece.  That voice is trying to fleece YOU.&quot;<br />

		<title>Court-martialed for refusing to take part in illegal Iraq war</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric A. Seitz, [attorney for US Army 1st Lt. Ehren Watada]: &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2006/11/us-army-lieutenant-to-be-court.php">1st Lt. Ehren Watada</a> had been an eagle scout and an exemplary Army officer when he first learned that he was likely to be deployed to Iraq and began to read and learn about the war into which he would be leading his troops.  What he read troubled him enormously.  He learned that even before the events of September 11, 2001, the Bush administration  secretly had planned to abandon the long standing strategy of containing Saddam Hussein by invading Iraq.  He confirmed that the actual reasons that were given for the invasion -- namely, the presence of weapons of mass destruction and Sadam&#39;s implication in 9/11 -- were untrue, and that the Bush administration had lied to the American people and the Congress to obtain authorization and support for the war.  He concluded that the failure of the United Nations Security Council to authorize a military action rendered the invasion of Iraq a war of aggression and a war crime under international law.  And he realized that the mounting reports of atrocities -- detentions without trial, tortures, sieges of cities and neighborhoods -- all by then well documented -- constituted separate war crimes under the Geneva Conventions and other treaties and obligations to which the United States is a signatory.  Lt. Watada determined that if he participated in the war in Iraq -- and especially if he led his troops into the conflict and occupation of Iraq -- that he, too, would be committing war crimes which he could not legally and morally defend.<br /> <br />Over a period of nearly five months Lt. Watada tried repeatedly, by himself and then through his counsel, to bring his concerns to the attention of his superiors and avoid a confrontation with the Army over his impending orders to deploy to Iraq.  The Army ignored him, refusing initially to even respond to his efforts to resign his commission or his offers to serve in some other capacity, such as Afghanistan, for the duration of his term of service.  So eventually on June 22, 2006, Lt. Watada refused to board a bus on the first leg of a deployment to Iraq, and on August 17, 2006, he appeared before an investigating officer for the Army&#39;s version of a preliminary hearing to determine whether he should be  prosecuted in a military court.  <br /> <br />In a historic hearing, Lt. Watada presented expert testimony and argued to the investigative officer that because the war in Iraq was initiated without a proper legal basis and was being prosecuted in violation of international law he not only was entitled to refuse to deploy to Iraq but was obligated to do so.  Professor Francis Boyle and former UN Undersecretary General Denis Halliday testified that under the United Nations Charter and the Army&#39;s own field manual the unilateral use of military force by one nation against another may only be utilized in self-defense or in the event of an imminent threat.  Retired Army Colonel Ann Wright also testified that in their training Army officers are instructed that they have the right and the obligation to refuse to carry out orders that are illegal or will result in the commission of war crimes.<br /> <br />Despite that testimony on November 9th the Army took formal action to convene a general court-martial in which Lt. Watada will be charged with one count of &quot;missing movement&quot; and four specifications of &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer&quot; for statements he made to the news media and a speech that he gave at the national convention of Veterans for Peace.  In so doing the Army seeks not only to punish Lt. Watada for his refusal to participate in an illegal war but even more so for his outspoken criticisms of the war in which he sought to exercise rights that are protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  By charging him under Article 133 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice the Army is inviting a legal challenge to the breadth and vagueness of its asserted limitations on free speech which barely survived scrutiny in Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, a 1974 Supreme Court decision in which an Army doctor was prosecuted successfully for encouraging troops to refuse to serve in Vietnam. <br /> <br />Pretrial motions will be heard at Ft. Lewis, Washington, in December and January with a likely trial to follow in late January or early February.  If he is convicted on all charges, Lt. Watada faces a possible dismissal from military service, which is the equivalent of a dishonorable discharge, and six years confinement in a military prison.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.saferchoice.org/index.html"><strong>Steve Fox</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.saferchoice.org/">Safer Alternative for Enjoyable Recreation</a>]: &quot;The purpose of the <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/marijuana-legalization-measures-fail.php">Amendment 44 campaign in Colorado</a> was to stimulate a debate in the state about the rationality of laws that allow adults to use alcohol while prohibiting the use of marijuana.  Specifically, the Amendment 44 campaign framed all of its arguments so that the listening public would be educated about the fact that marijuana is less harmful -- both to the user and to society -- than alcohol.  We cited statistics about domestic violence, sexual assault, and annual deaths caused by each substance to back up our argument.<br /><br />Because the use of marijuana was decriminalized in Colorado in the 1970s, the current penalty for the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana is a $100 fine and it is considered a petty offense.  Amendment 44 proposed making the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana legal for adults, thus eliminating the fine and any other penalty for individuals 21 years of age and older.  Since Amendment 44 did not pass, the possession of marijuana will remain a petty offense and individuals cited for possession will be fined $100.  Despite coming up short in the polls, the campaign undoubtedly succeeded in <a href="http://safercolorado.org/pressroom">raising the profile</a> of the issue and conveying our message.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=5972"><strong>Allen St. Pierre</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.norml.org/">National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws</a> (NORML)]: &quot;The 2006 mid-term elections offered mixed results for <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/marijuana-legalization-measures-fail.php">marijuana law reformers</a>, with voters rejecting three statewide liberalization efforts, but approving numerous local measures to &#39;deprioritize&#39; pot law enforcement.<br /><br />Regarding the three failed statewide initiative efforts: These outcomes, while disappointing, were not unexpected. Despite these results, adults in both Colorado and Nevada continue to live under state laws that authorize the medical use of marijuana and allow adults to possess and use small amounts of pot without the threat of incarceration or a criminal record. South Dakota&#39;s result, while disheartening, does nothing to change the fact that according to national polls, nearly eight out of ten Americans support the physician-approved use of medicinal cannabis.<br /><br />NORML believes that the strong showing in local races demonstrates Americans&#39; overwhelming support for more responsible pot policies. What these results tell us is that citizens strongly support reforming America&#39;s marijuana laws, but that they prefer to do so incrementally. These successes on the municipal level, once again, affirm that a majority of US citizens don&#39;t want adults who use marijuana responsibly to face arrest or jail, and they do not want their tax dollars spent on policies that prioritize targeting and prosecuting marijuana offenders.<br /><br />This year&#39;s election results also have potential federal ramifications, noting that California Democrat Nancy Pelosi, who now stands to be House Speaker, is a longtime supporter and former co-sponsor of medical marijuana legislation. It is NORML&#39;s hope that with new Democratic leadership in the US House of Representatives we will finally be able to move forward with legislation and hearings on both the physician-approved medical use of marijuana as well as the decriminalization of cannabis for responsible adults.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>George Washington [attorney, <a href="http://www.bamn.com/news/index.asp">By Any Means Necessary</a>]: &quot;On November 7, 2006, Proposal 2, which is copied from California&#39;s Proposition 209, <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/michigan-voters-approve-affirmative.php">passed in Michigan</a> by a vote of 57 to 43 percent. There are now two pending legal challenges to the Proposal, with more expected to follow soon.  The United States District Court found that the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative obtained the signatures necessary to place the proposal on the ballot by means of racially-targeted voter fraud.  But it refused to take the proposal off the ballot because the MCRI defrauded some white people as well.  The Sixth Circuit will soon hear an appeal from that decision, with the plaintiffs asking for the entire proposal to be struck down because of the fraud.<br /><br />The By Any Means Necessary Coalition filed the second <a href="/gazette/2006/11/michigan-affirmative-action-proposal.php">lawsuit</a> the day after the election asserting that the federal civil rights laws, the Equal Protection clause, and the First Amendment rights of universities preempted the substance of Proposal 2.<br /><br />There will also be further legal challenges on the basis that affirmative action is not a &quot;preference,&quot; which is all that Proposal 2 bans.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com"><strong>Giovanni Di Stefano</strong></a> [Studio Legale Internazionale, Rome]: &quot;Below are the names of those Iraq detainees who are subject to a <a href="/hotline/2006/11/saddam-lawyer-statement.php">2004 agreement</a> between the UK/Italy and the Iraqi government witnessed by the US Government that whilst capital punishment can be imposed as a sentence cannot actually have such sentence executed. All were &#39;captured&#39; or surrendered in 2003 in the early stages of the occupation and before the Iraqi Government was &#39;officially&#39; formed.<br /><br />It follows that both the United Kingdom and Italy, being signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights, could not ever place themselves &#39;at risk&#39; of being in violation of such repudiating capital punishment yet assisting in the apprehension of those that would be potentially subjected to such.<br /><br />It was for these reasons that in late 2005 the Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith repudiated the Agreement between the UK and the Iraqi Government in training lawyers and judges in England that would become prosecutors/judges/investigators. In 2005 over 90 Iraqi lawyers that were being trained in England had their courses cancelled without notice.<br /><br />Those detainees captured exclusively with the aid of the United States mostly post 2004 are subject to not only the imposition of capital punishment but the execution of such. Only those that were captured during the &#39;coalition triumvirate&#39; of US/UK and Italy are subject to the said agreement.<br /><br />It is not excluded that there are others that also cannot be executed by means of capital punishment but these on the list below are those that are certain.<br /><br />1. Saddam Hussein <br />President of Iraq, commander-in-chief of military :: Captured by coalition forces 13 December 2003 <br />War crimes &quot;claims&quot; against the Iraqi leader include genocide of the Kurds, &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; in which Kurds, Turkmen and Assyrians around the oil-rich city of Kirkuk were expelled as part of an &quot;Arabisation&quot; programme, mass civilian executions after the Kurdish and Shia uprisings in 1991, and religious persecution. Sentenced to death.<br />________________________________________<br /><br />2. Taha Yassin Ramadan<br />Vice-president :: Taken into custody 18 August 2003 <br />The 65-year-old vice-president and commander of the popular army was known as Saddam Hussein&#39;s &quot;enforcer&quot;. He is &quot;accused&quot; of complicity in the occupation of Kuwait. He is also &quot;accused&quot; of involvement in the alleged repression of Shia Muslims who rose up against the regime in 1991 and of the alleged killing of thousands of Kurds in the town of Halabja in 1988 when the town was attacked with poison gas bombs. Life imprisonment.<br />________________________________________<br /> <br />3. Tariq Aziz<br />Deputy prime minister :: Surrendered 24 April 2003 <br />The only Christian in the leadership was at Saddam Hussein&#39;s side from the 1950s. The 67-year-old deputy prime minister is one of the most well-known faces of the former regime in the West. As a member of the Revolutionary Command Council, he is accused by Indict, a British organisation which gathers evidence against former Iraqi leaders, of complicity in war crimes against Iran, Kuwait and his own people. No formal indictment has been levied against him to date. Applications to the Supreme Court of the United States and to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights pending.<br />________________________________________<br /><br />4. Abid Hamid al-Tikriti<br />Presidential secretary :: Taken into custody 18 June 2003 <br />One of Saddam Hussein&#39;s closest aides, Abed Hamoud controlled access to the president and was frequently at his side. He is said to have directed matters of state and handed down many of the regimes so called repressive orders. The US says he was also authorised to deploy weapons of mass destruction. No weapons of mass destruction were ever found. No knowledge of any formal indictment has been levied against him to date.<br />________________________________________<br /> <br />5. Ali Hasan Majid<br />Presidential adviser, southern region commander :: Captured by coalition forces 21 August 2003 <br />Saddam Hussein&#39;s cousin, Ali Hasan Majid, was known as &quot;Chemical Ali&quot; for his alleged role in the use of poison gas against Kurds in 1988. He had earlier been reported killed in a coalition air strike on his house in Basra. On trial.<br />________________________________________<br /> <br />6. Sultan Hashim Ahmad al-Tal<br />Minister of defence :: Surrendered 19 September 2003 <br />Sultan Hashim Ahmad al-Tal was rumoured to have collaborated with the US military during last year&#39;s invasion of Iraq.

		<title>Missouri stem cells amendment protects fundamental rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ben Johnson [<a href="http://www.missouricures.com/">Missouri Coalition for Lifesaving Cures</a>]: &quot;&quot;Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto&quot; - &quot;Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law.&quot; This statement, the official state motto of Missouri, stands as guidance to all those working in service to the public of Missouri.  Unfortunately, there are times when some in the state legislature seem to turn their backs on this &quot;supreme law.&quot;  In their wisdom, the framers of the Missouri State Constitution provided voters an alternative to the power of the legislature for just such times.  Through the initiative and petition process, the people can demand a public vote on issues of great importance.  This ensures that the people, not the legislators, should have the last word.  On November 7, <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/missouri-narrowly-approves-stem-cell.php">Missourians exercised this most basic right</a>.<br /><br />With the passage of Amendment 2, the Missouri Stem Cell Research and Cures Initiative, Missourians ensured that they will enjoy the constitutional right to stem cell therapies and cures allowed under federal law and available to other Americans.  Amendment 2 was necessary because some state legislators have repeatedly attempted to criminalize some forms of stem cell research and the therapies or cures that might result from that research.  This recurring threat led to the formation of the Missouri Coalition for Lifesaving Cures (a coalition of over 100 non-profit patient and medical groups and over 60,000 individual Missouri citizens) and the introduction of Amendment 2.<br /><br />Amendment 2 is framed around a very simple principle &#8212; a principle outlined in the first section of the initiative:<ul><li>&quot;To ensure that Missouri patients have access to stem cell therapies and cures, that Missouri researchers can conduct stem cell research in the state, and that all such research is conducted safely and ethically, any stem cell research permitted under federal law may be conducted in Missouri, and any stem cell therapies and cures permitted under federal law may be provided to patients in Missouri, subject to the requirements of federal law and only the following additional limitations and requirements:&quot;</ul>Missourians embraced this principle of equal treatment as they voted to pass Amendment 2.  Since all types of stem cell research are currently permitted under federal law (only federal funding is restricted), Missouri citizens ensured that their politicians would not be able to restrict access to the newest areas of medical research.  Voters also made certain that Missouri&#39;s world-class medical institutions can proceed in pursuing cures and that these institutions can provide new stem cell treatments in Missouri when they are found.  Importantly, Amendment 2 also added additional requirements, beyond federal law, to ensure that research done in Missouri will be conducted ethically and safely.  Among these newly enacted requirements is a strict ban on attempting to clone a human being through the initiation of a pregnancy.  This offense is now punishable by up to fifteen years in prison.  This ban on cloning a human being, along with other additional requirements in Amendment 2, previously did not exist in Missouri or under federal law.<br /> <br />The state constitutional amendment process in Missouri was designed to give citizens the opportunity to protect their individual rights.  What right is more fundamental than a citizen&#39;s right to equal treatment under laws that govern access to medical therapies and cures?  On November 7, Missourians stated clearly that they do not want to be second-class citizens when it comes to decisions about the health of their families.  By passing Amendment 2, Missouri voters ensured that these important decisions will be made by patients, their families, and their health care providers, not by politicians in the state capital.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philip Rosenthal [Director, <a href="http://www.Christianview.org">ChristianView Network</a>, South Africa]: &quot;Today, 14 November 2006, the National Assembly debated and voted to pass the Civil Union Bill. The Bill is an insult to marriage and a trashing of democracy.  It will open the door for more attacks on morality, religious freedom and children&#39;s rights.  This is a day of shame for South Africa.<br /><br />The revised Bill is a confusing piece of legislation which uses the term &#39;civil union&#39; and &#39;marriage&#39; interchangeably.  It thus insults and undermines true marriage more seriously than the previous version of the Bill.  <br /><br />The African National Congress (ANC) took the unprecedented step of not only denying their MPs the right to conscientiously object and vote against the Bill, but also abstain or be absent from the vote.  Thus the will of the democratic majority of South Africans has been trampled in favour of the views of eleven unelected and unaccountable judges on the Constitutional Court.  A structure set up to protect democracy has been abused to undermine it.  Despite the ANC instruction, many MPs did not attend the vote.   The IFP and ACDP opposed the Bill, while the DA allowed a free vote.<br /><br />The fight on this issue is not over.  To be implemented, the Bill will still need to go to the National Council of Provinces and be signed by the president.  An alternative Constitutional Marriage Amendment by ACDP MP Steve Swart, is currently being considered by the Portfolio Committee on Private Members Bills.  Thousands of people have signed petitions in support of this amendment.  The campaign will continue.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/"><strong>Lisa Madigan</strong></a> [Attorney General of Illinois, on the recent <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/jury-returns-48m-verdict-against.php">discrimination verdict against Amerigroup</a>]: &quot;Evidence at the trial established that from 2000-2004 the state of Illinois and the United States paid Amerigroup Corporation and its Illinois subsidiary over $243 million to set up a Medicaid HMO in Illinois that would provide healthcare services to Medicaid recipients.  Amerigroup instead engaged in a systematic scheme to avoid enrolling the very people they were paid to serve, the chronically ill and pregnant women.  By secretly working to enroll only the healthy people, Amerigroup was able to spend less than 50% of what they were paid on actually providing care while other HMOs in Illinois were spending between 80%-90%.  The scheme was brought to the attention of the United States Attorney and the Illinois Attorney General by Amerigroup&#39;s former vice president for government relations, Mr. Cleveland Tyson.<br /><br />The jury found that Amerigroup and its subsidiary submitted over 18,000 false claims for payment to the governments.  The jury found that these claims were based on Amerigroup&#39;s fraudulent promises that they would not discriminate against people based on a person&#39;s health status.  The jury awarded Illinois and the U.S. $48 million in damages.  This amount will be automatically tripled under the federal False Claims Act and its Illinois companion statute, the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act, to $144 million plus mandatory penalties potentially totaling in the hundreds of millions.  The verdict has been reported to be the largest verdict in the history of the False Claims Act and the largest civil verdict in the history of the Illinois Attorney General&#39;s office.<br /><br />The verdict will both reimburse the state of Illinois for the money Amerigroup obtained illegally and punish Amerigroup for their unconscionable conduct.  It sends a strong message that companies who contract with the State of Illinois to provide healthcare to its neediest residents cannot discriminate against those residents who need care the most.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp"><strong>Gitanjali Gutierrez</strong></a> [Guantanamo Global Justice Initiative Attorney, <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>]: &quot;In March 2003, Majid Khan, his brother, his sister-in-law, and his year-old niece were arrested by Pakistani intelligence. It was more than three years before Majid was heard from again. For much of that time, he was held incommunicado by the CIA, and subject to the Bush Administration&#39;s &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques.&quot; Now, the government is arguing that due to his knowledge of these techniques, Majid possesses classified information which cannot be shared with his attorneys.<br /><br />In other words, the government is essentially citing the fact that it tortured Majid as a reason to <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/doj-trying-to-block-legal-access-to.php">deny him prompt access to counsel</a>.<br /><br />Knowledge of the government&#39;s interrogation techniques is already public; Khaled el Masri, a detainee who was ultimately released without charge, has made a sworn statement that he was imprisoned along with Majid Khan, and described their conditions of confinement and the techniques they were subject to. <br /><br />The government has also falsely equated speaking to a lawyer with the public disclosure of information. Approximately 500 habeas counsel currently representing men detained at Guant&aacute;namo Bay do so under a protective order determining their access to classified information. No classified information has been revealed under this system. And yet the government has called for a new protective order, as a means to delay further Majid&#39;s access to counsel.<br /><br />Classification authority cannot be used to conceal Majid&#39;s personal experience of torture, disappearance, and indefinite detention at the hands of the United States. It is intolerable for the Bush Administration to assert its own unacceptable and notorious treatment of this man as the rationale for perpetuating his isolation. To do so will only make it more difficult for him to attain the justice he so desperately seeks. <br /><br />Meaningful access to counsel is a pillar of our justice system. Without it, there can be no justice.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.ahrcentre.org/management/pace.htm">John Pace</a>, former Human Rights Chief for the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq, says that the trial of Saddam Hussein has abjectly failed to do justice to his victims, provide a deterrent to future dictators, or generally advance the cause of freedom...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/johnpace.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n an interview with the BBC's John Simpson a few days ago, Iraqi Prime Minister Al-Maliki said that he thought that Saddam would be hanged before the year is out.  Of course there is an appeal but the assumption is that the sentence will be confirmed, and if that happens, there is a maximum of thirty days within which the sentence is to be carried out.  Such a statement is symptomatic of the nature of the entire proceedings in the trial(s) of Saddam.<br /><br />The human rights crimes committed during Saddam's reign are extraordinary and the cruelty and callous non-respect for the right to life, for the right to freedom from torture, have been documented in several reliable reports over the years.  These include the reports of the Commission on Human Rights (now replaced by the Human Rights Council) whose Special Rapporteur, (Max van der Stoel of the Netherlands and later Costas Mavromatis of Cyprus) between 1992 and 2003 presented to the international community the aberrations taking place against hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in Iraq during Saddam's dictatorship.  The international community failed then to take effective action to address and redress those aberrations.<br /><br />This time it has failed again.<br /><br />Crimes against humanity are defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court, and jurisdiction is attributed to the national courts; international jurisdiction is a supplementary one and generally speaking, kicks in whenever the national jurisdiction is either unable or unwilling to exercise its jurisdiction.<br /><br />The Tribunal in the Saddam trial may have been willing, but certainly cannot be said to meet the criteria to enable it to assume jurisdiction.  There are several good reasons for this. <br /><br />In the first place, the Tribunal itself is of doubtful constitutionality &#8212; the constitution which was voted on in the referendum of 15 October 2006 excludes ad hoc jurisdictions (Article 94[95]).  The Tribunal was originally set up as an ad hoc tribunal under the CPA on 10 December 2003.  [At that time, the then Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights had shared concerns about the need to ensure a proper trial consistent with international standards, and Paul Bremer had responded, reassuring the A/High Commissioner that the Iraqi Governing Council, where the IST Statute was purportedly being drafted, would ensure that].  In 2005 a series of attempts were made to amend the IST Statute.  This culminated in the establishment of the "Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal", which is what the tribunal trying Saddam Hussein is called.  In spite of the change of name and the introduction of new elements attempting to 'incorporate' it into the judicial organization of the State, the tribunal arguably remained a special tribunal in all but name. <br /><br />Secondly, the law setting up the SICT was passed by a Transitional National Assembly who was meant to be elected for one year to draft the constitution, and therefore whose powers to legislate on matters of such national importance may be disputed.   <br /><br />But even assuming that the IST was legally established, it was &#8212; and remains &#8212; questionable that you could find any person in Iraq who could possess the degree of objectivity that such a serious trial required.  This was confirmed by the conduct of the judges and the corresponding undue interference by the government in changing judges when they appeared to be unsuitable to other 'authorities'.<br /><br />But even assuming that the judges had the requisite qualities &#8212; the security situation and the threat to the proper conduct of the proceedings did not allow for a trial to be conducted with the requisite openness and transparency. No less than three members of the defense were assassinated and all were subject to threats on their lives, which, as we all know, cannot be taken lightly in Baghdad.  During the trial, defense counsel several times manifested their fear for their lives and those of their friends and relatives.<br /><br />Furthermore, the proceedings took place in war-like conditions, above and beyond the tight security that such trials warrant whenever and wherever they take place. The proceedings were not accessible to the public, although selected excerpts were broadcast.  The little that was shown confirmed the concerns regarding the proceedings.<br /><br />All this made a mockery of the seriousness of the proceedings that the crimes warranted.  After all crimes against humanity are exactly that: it is humanity at large that has an interest that such crimes are punished and punished in a manner that is consistent with international standards.<br /><br />Has justice been done?  The short answer is no: Saddam may have been found guilty, and, more than likely, he will be hanged -  as the Prime Minister has just reminded us, by the end of the year. <br /><br />But justice is not merely made up of a sentence and an execution.  For justice to be done, the victims need to be involved; this sentence is for the execution of the 148 victims of Dujail.  <br /><br />But what about the other victims, of the massacres in the north and in the south of the country? What about the terror on anyone who dared exercise freedom of opinion and expression?  <br /><br />What about and the surviving families of the victims, who number in the hundreds of thousands? What about those young men, now in their twenties who were then below the age of thirteen, whose fathers, and brothers above the age of thirteen were carried off to execution in their thousands?  Will Saddam's execution bring justice and compensation to them?<br /><br />And as far as we (humanity) are all involved, how much of a deterrent has this trial provided to the emergence of future dictators who turn on their own people?  The answer is none whatsoever.<br /><br />In Iraq, people are fighting to survive from day to day in a situation where security has never been worse.  In Baghdad, the trial was a non-event already since its inception; now more than ever, the mood is to search for ways to survive and if possible to remain in the country when so many are giving up and leaving Iraq, as the country falls apart.<br /><br />The international community has missed another chance to advance the cause of freedom and justice by allowing these trials to take place in Iraq in this 'jurisdiction'. <br />    <br /><br /><em>John Pace recently completed an assignment as Human Rights Chief for the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq, and more recently as Senior Adviser to the Humanitarian Coordinator for Lebanon following the recent hostilities. He served as Secretary to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for sixteen years; in 1991-1993 he was the Coordinator of the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in June 1993. Previous to that he was responsible for Special Procedures and for the UN Technical Cooperation Programme in Human Rights. A native of Malta, he currently resides in Australia, where he is associated with the Australian Human Rights Centre at the University of New South Wales Faculty of Law.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/faculty_m_cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law, president of the <a href="http://www.nlg.org/">National Lawyers Guild</a>, says that although Donald Rumsfeld is resigning as US Secretary of Defense, steps should be and will be taken to hold him accountable for breaches of international law and even war crimes sanctioned in Iraq and Guantanamo during his tenure ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></b></font>s the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and were on the verge of taking over the Senate, George W. Bush announced Wednesday that Donald Rumsfeld was out and Robert Gates was in as Secretary of Defense.  When Bush is being run out of town, he knows how to get out in the front of the crowd and make it look like he&#39;s leading the parade.  The Rumsfeld-Gates swap is a classic example.<br /><br />The election was a referendum on the war.  The dramatic results prove that the overwhelming majority of people in this country don&#39;t like the disaster Bush has created in Iraq.  So rather than let the airwaves fill up with beaming Democrats and talk of the horrors of Iraq, Bush changed the subject and fired Rumsfeld.  Now, when the Democrats begin to investigate what went wrong, Rumsfeld will no longer be the controversial public face of the war.<br /><br />Rumsfeld had come under fire from many quarters, not the least of which was a gaggle of military officers who had been clamoring for his resignation.  Bush said he decided to oust Rumsfeld before Tuesday&#39;s voting but lied to reporters so it wouldn&#39;t affect the election.  Putting aside the incredulity of that claim, Bush likely waited to see if there would be a changing of the legislative guard before giving Rumsfeld his walking papers.  If the GOP had retained control of Congress, Bush would probably have retained Rumsfeld.  But in hindsight, Bush has to wish he had ejected Rumsfeld before the election to demonstrate a new direction in the Iraq war to angry voters.<br /><br />Rumsfeld&#39;s sin was not in failing to develop a winning strategy for Iraq.  There is no winning in Iraq, because we never belonged there in the first place.  The war in Iraq is a war of aggression.  It violates the United Nations Charter which only permits one country to invade another in self-defense or with the blessing of the Security Council.<br /><br />Donald Rumsfeld was one of the primary architects of the Iraq war.  On September 15, 2001, in a meeting at Camp David, Rumsfeld suggested an attack on Iraq because he was deeply worried about the availability of &quot;good targets in Afghanistan.&quot;  Former Treasury Secretary Paul O&#39;Neill reported that Rumsfeld articulated his hope to &quot;dissuade&quot; other nations from &quot;asymmetrical challenges&quot; to U.S. power.  Rumsfeld&#39;s support for a preemptive attack on Iraq &quot;matched with plans for how the world&#39;s second largest oil reserve might be divided among the world&#39;s contractors made for an irresistible combination,&quot; Ron Suskind wrote after interviewing O&#39;Neill.<br /><br />Rumsfeld defensively sought to decouple oil access from regime change in Iraq when he appeared on CBS News on November 15, 2002.  In a Hamlet moment, Rumsfeld proclaimed the United States&#39; beef with Iraq has &quot;nothing to do with oil, literally nothing to do with oil.&quot;  The Secretary doth protest too much.<br /><br />Prosecuting a war of aggression isn&#39;t Rumsfeld&#39;s only crime.  He also participated in the highest levels of decision-making that allowed the extrajudicial execution of several people.  Willful killing is a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions, which constitutes a war crime.  In his book, <em>Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib</em>, Seymour Hersh described the &quot;unacknowledged&quot; special-access program (SAP) established by a top-secret order Bush signed in late 2001 or early 2002.  It authorized the Defense Department to set up a clandestine team of Special Forces operatives to defy international law and snatch, or assassinate, anyone considered a &quot;high-value&quot; Al Qaeda operative, anywhere in the world.  Rumsfeld expanded SAP into Iraq in August 2003.<br /><br />But Rumsfeld&#39;s crimes don&#39;t end there.  He sanctioned the use of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, which are grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and thus constitute war crimes.  Rumsfeld approved interrogation techniques that included the use of dogs, removal of clothing, hooding, stress positions, isolation for up to 30 days, 20-hour interrogations, and deprivation of light and auditory stimuli.  According to Seymour Hersh, Rumsfeld sanctioned the use of physical coercion and sexual humiliation to extract information from prisoners.  Rumsfeld also authorized waterboarding, where the interrogator induces the sensation of imminent death by drowning.  Waterboarding is widely considered a form of torture.<br /> <br />Rumsfeld was intimately involved with the interrogation of a Saudi detainee, Mohamed al-Qahtani, at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo in late 2002.  General Geoffrey Miller, who later transferred many of his harsh interrogation techniques to Abu Ghaib, supervised the interrogation and gave Rumsfeld weekly updates on his progress.  During a six-week period, al-Qahtani was stripped naked, forced to wear women&#39;s underwear on his head, denied bathroom access, threatened with dogs, forced to perform tricks while tethered to a dog leash, and subjected to sleep deprivation. Al-Qahtani was kept in solitary confinement for 160 days.  For 48 days out of 54, he was interrogated for 18 to 20 hours a day.<br /><br />Even though Rumsfeld didn&#39;t personally carry out the torture and mistreatment of prisoners, he authorized it.  Under the doctrine of command responsibility, a commander can be liable for war crimes committed by his inferiors if he knew or should have known they would be committed and did nothing to stop of prevent them.  The U.S. War Crimes Act provides for prosecution of a person who commits war crimes and prescribes life imprisonment, or even the death penalty if the victim dies.<br /><br />Although intending to signal a new direction in Iraq with his nomination of Gates to replace Rumsfeld, Bush has no intention of leaving Iraq.  He is building huge permanent U.S. military bases there.  Gates at the helm of the Defense Department, Bush said, &quot;can help make the necessary adjustments in our approach.&quot;  Bush hopes he can bring congressional Democrats on board by convincing them he will simply fight a smarter war.<br /><br />But this war can never get smarter.  Nearly 3,000 American soldiers and more than 650,000 Iraqi civilians have died and tens of thousands have been wounded.  Our national debt has skyrocketed with the billions Bush has pumped into the war.  Now that there is a new day in Congress, there must be a new push to end the war.  That means a demand that Congress cut off its funds.<br /><br />And the war criminals must be brought to justice - beginning with Donald Rumsfeld.  On November 14, the Center for Constitutional Rights, the National Lawyers Guild, and other organizations will ask the German federal prosecutor to initiate a criminal investigation into the war crimes of Rumsfeld and other Bush administration officials.  Although Bush has immunized his team from prosecution in the International Criminal Court, they could be tried in any country under the well-established principle of universal jurisdiction.<br /><br />Donald Rumsfeld may be out of sight, but he will not be out of mind.  The chickens have come home to roost.<br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn, a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, is president of the National Lawyers Guild, and the U.S. representative to the executive committee of the American Association of Jurists.  Her new book, </em>Cowboy Republic: Six Ways the Bush Gang Has Defied the Law<em>, will be published this spring by PoliPointPress.</em><br />

		<title>Thanksgiving and the Federal Courts</title>

First and perhaps foremost are the many legislative initiatives that will be halted or slowed by the November 7 federal elections in which the Democratic Party recaptured majorities in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives.<br /><br /> A number of the legislative efforts that the elections will apparently end, curtail or at least delay are initiatives whose institution would have threatened judicial independence. The House had adopted or advanced a majority of these ideas. One is the concept of an Inspector General who would oversee the federal courts. The proponents of this notion contend that an IG is necessary to regulate judicial misconduct, but the measure leaves unclear exactly what the IG would monitor. Moreover, federal judges have voiced concerns that an IG might affect substantive judicial decisionmaking.<br /><br /> The November elections also probably mean that Judge Manuel Real of the Central District of California can enjoy his Thanksgiving without fear of impeachment. This autumn, the House Judiciary Committee opened an investigation into allegations that the judge improperly assisted a litigant in his court. However, this inquiry will probably not be pursued further in the lame duck session of the 109th Congress or in the 110th Congress which opens in January. The recent publication of the Breyer Committee report on potential judicial misbehavior and of Judicial Conference strictures for "judicial junkets" and computerized conflict of interest checking indicates that the bench is taking seriously the duty to regulate itself.<br /><br /> Another proposition would revise Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which covers sanctions for filing improper papers, to reinstitute the 1983 amendment. The vast majority of federal judges have rejected this idea because it would promote costly satellite litigation. Neither the lame duck session nor the 110th Congress will pass the bill embodying the revision that the House has adopted.<br /><br />A third proposal would split the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit purportedly because the tribunal is too large, although a number of advocates have vigorously criticized the tribunal's substantive determinations. The twenty-three of 26 active judges on the Ninth Circuit who have refused to support publicly the division idea can enjoy their holiday secure in the knowledge that no split will occur soon.<br /><br />There are many other areas in which Democrats and Republicans can cooperate to help the courts during the lame duck session and the 110th Congress. One is judicial selection. There are currently 51 federal court openings for which President George W. Bush has nominated 37 individuals. The judiciary should be thankful that Mr. Bush acknowledged the election-day "thumpin&#39;" and pledged to work in a bipartisan way with Democrats and that Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), his party's leader on the Judiciary Committee, has suggested that Democrats would cooperate with Republicans on confirming judges. The judiciary should give thanks because a full bench would enable judges to resolve cases promptly, inexpensively and fairly.<br /><br />Mr. Bush's November 15 renomination of five controversial appellate nominees whom the Senate had twice returned might nonetheless frustrate the judicial selection process. The judiciary should be thankful that Democrats appear willing to set aside partisanship and help confirm judges. Democrats may decide which nominees will be very intelligent, independent and industrious, possess moderate ideological perspectives and have balanced judicial temperament and work to confirm those candidates. Democrats could seek expeditious floor votes on nominees whom the Senate Judiciary Committee has approved, prompt action on those who have not had Committee votes and quick hearings for the remaining nominees.<br /><br />Judges should also give thanks that the related idea of comprehensive judgeships legislation, the first such bill since 1990, might pass.  The Judicial Conference has proposed that lawmakers authorize 50 new judicial seats, recommendations that the courts' policymaking arm bases on conservative projections of workloads and filings. The House Republican leadership has made this measure's adoption contingent upon splitting the Ninth Circuit, so the judiciary can offer thanks that the elections may alter this dynamic.<br /><br />The federal judiciary apparently has much for which to be thankful on this Thanksgiving. However, the judiciary will only realize the apparent benefits enumerated above, if Democrats and Republicans end their partisan wrangling and work together in a bipartisan manner for the good of the courts, Congress and the nation.<br /><br /><em>Carl Tobias is the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/tobias.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/shane.html">Peter Shane</a> of Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, says that Democrats taking over Congress in the wake of the mid-term elections should begin by reasserting constitutional checks and balances in a wide range of critical policy areas...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petershane2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>ith only their control of the Senate in doubt, Congressional Democrats are presumably deciding how best to fulfill their campaign promise to take the country in "a new direction."  A good place to start would be a new direction in the operation of government checks and balances.<br /><br />Democrats have promised to open the next session of Congress with half a dozen bills, each reflecting the sentiments of an overwhelming majority of Americans, on subjects from the minimum wage and prescription drugs to stem cell research and tax deductions for college tuition.<br /><br />The importance of these bills should not be underestimated.  The President may decide to go along on some of them and, if not, Democrats will have dramatized for 2008 what the difference would be between Democratic and Republican control of the White House.  (And, by the way, 21 GOP Senate seats will be stake in 2008, as opposed to 12 Democrats, and at least nine of the 12 Democrats will be lopsided winners no matter who runs against them.)<br /><br />But the fact remains, for every Democratic attempt to set serious new national policy on the economy, the environment, education, health care, foreign affairs or national security, they face a President at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, sitting at his desk with a veto pen and no prospect of his own reelection to consider.  This political contexts only heightens the importance of a concerted effort to return checks and balances to a healthy equilibrium.<br /><br />Speaker-Apparent Nancy Pelosi has foresworn presidential impeachment, and this is a sensible starting point.  For political intents and purposes, the Bush Administration already stands impeached, and nothing we know about President Bush today could possibly elicit 67 Senate votes for conviction, no matter how egregiously he has ignored the Constitution.<br /><br />But Democrats in Congress can begin to whittle away at the Bush Administration's arrogant defiance of oversight and its preposterous claims of unilateral executive power.  Here are my recommended top starting points:<ol><li>Comprehensive hearings before at least the House Judiciary Committee on claims of executive power under the Bush Administration, ranging from claims of unbounded inherent power over national security to the authority to tell every member of the Executive branch how to do his or her job;<br /><br /><li>Comprehensive oversight hearings regarding the Department of Homeland Security, including FEMA and the TSA;<br /><br /><li>Oversight hearings into the NSA program of warrantless electronic surveillance;<br /><br /><li>Hearings on the manipulation of intelligence before Iraq;<br /><br /><li>Hearings on missing funds and the use of no-bid contracts in Iraq; and<br /><br /><li>Hearings on oil industry pricing practices since 2001, including a new demand for records regarding the Vice President's National Task Force on Energy Policy - to be followed up, if necessary, in court.</ol>Congress should insert into the next Defense Department appropriations bill a ban on using any appropriated funds for military action against Iran, unless Congress provides express statutory authorization, or unless Iran attacks the United States or its allies.  <br /><br />And, finally, Congress should declare, whether by statute or concurrent resolution, that it is the sense of Congress that no state of emergency or crisis in public safety currently justifies the suspension of habeas corpus - thus rendering unconstitutional and nullifying the suspension of habeas corpus in the Military Commissions Act.<br /><br />Democrats will face the dilemma of how to treat the minority party in the House and perhaps the Senate.  Given the Republicans' contemptuous and heavy-handed exclusion of the Democrats from policy making since 1995, the Democrats could be excused some temptation for payback.  But they should resist.<br /><br />Some Democrats will insist that treating Republicans at all respectfully will just prove to the world the inherent weakness of the liberal Democratic spine.  It's not true.  Democrats should insist that part of a reinvigorated checks and balances is again taking seriously the institutional role of the legislative branch as something more than an enabler of executive power.  In defending congressional prerogative, the Democrats need to get GOP lawmakers to act like lawmakers, not just GOP apparatchiks.<br /><br />It may be that the Democrats can even strike an informal deal with the Republicans.  If the GOP controls the Senate, the bargain is easy - House reform in exchange for Senate reform.  But, even if Democrats control both Houses, they can say to their GOP colleagues:  Go along with us in rebuffing executive privilege claims, at least in domestic affairs, and cross party lines in writing at least portions of a House Judiciary Committee report on separation of powers issues, and we'll treat you like partners.<br /><br />You don't need a crystal ball to know that a return to real public policy making in a robust constitutional framework is what the American people want.  A wonderful opportunity looms, politically speaking, to do well by doing good.<br />   <br /><br /><em>Peter M. Shane is the Joseph S.

But he also said the same pattern could be seen in the policies of the United Nations and other international bodies.<br /><br />&quot;What  we  see  here  is  a  vision of international law that if taken aggressively  would literally strike at the heart of some of our basic fundamental  principals  --  separation  of  powers,  respect  for the Senate&#39;s ability to ratify treaties and ... reject treaties,&quot; Chertoff said.<br /><br />This speech of Secretary Chertoff is a very important for Americans to ponder because it highlights one of the key aspects of international law - horizontal enforcement: other states (and international bodies through which those states operate) pushing one state to comply with international law obligations as each of those states determine what those obligations are.<br /><br />At the same time, what the vision of Secretary Chertoff simply does not appreciate is the internal capacity of American citizens to join with those external voices to insist on compliance by the United States with international law obligations. Or maybe, Secretary Chertoff is making an effort to create division between those Americans who support international law and non-Americans - appealing to nationalist sentiment in a hope of dividing and conquering.  It is an old tactic.<br /><br />It is important that internally we speak with great force about the need for the United States to comply with its obligations.  We must have fire in our belly, as Justice Robert Jackson said in a speech to the American Society of International in 1945.<br /><br />Key to Chertoff&#39;s vision is his limited sense of the Common Article 3 standard of detainee treatment under the Geneva Conventions.  In international law, however, there is a wonderful rule that no state can avail itself of its internal law to extract itself from its international obligations.<br /><br />Chertoff and the New Sovereigntists are seeking to subvert that rule to make United States internal law flow throughout the world as their unique vision of the only law that is to be respected.  <br /><br />Now, it is possible for state practice to evolve - and the United States may seek to make state practice evolve - so that torture, cruel inhuman and degrading treatment and other barbarities are considered fine in international law.  However, it is also possible that Americans and foreigners and parts of the American government and foreign governments may resist such a development by pushing the United States to comply with the spirit and letter, object and purpose of its international law obligations.  <br /><br />We must resist Chertoff&#39;s vision, for in that vision the result is precisely what we fought our American Revolution to avoid - the individual being put at the mercy of an all powerful state controlled by an all powerful leader.<br /><br />We can only hope that by continued pressure on our elected leaders, the bureaucracy, the Presidency and the courts we can help these persons understand that international law is OUR law and they as well as us are to comply with that law.  <br /><br />Thus, when Chertoff as head of the Criminal Division of Justice gave advice and comfort to torturers in other government agencies by agreeing that if certain harsh interrogation techniques were used then the Criminal Division would not prosecute, he should understand that as a matter of domestic (war crimes) and international law that was wrong.<br /><br />But the domestic law doctrine of prosecutorial discretion which might be of avail in a domestic arena would be of no help to him in a prosecution on the international plane for aiding and abetting torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  <br /><br />And a day of reckoning is coming.  Chertoff should dare to travel to Europe.<br /><br />Similarly the Military Commissions Act&#39;s attempt to pervert the Third and Fourth Geneva Convention is of no avail in extracting the United States from its international obligations.<br />  <br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/">Giovanni Di Stefano</a>, an Italian lawyer who has represented Saddam Hussein and former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, says that the recent trial of Hussein and seven co-defendants for crimes against humanity in Dujail is problematic not only as regards Saddam, but also in its conviction of Awad Hamad al-Bandar, former Chief Judge of the Iraqi Revolutionary Court ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/giovannidistefano.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Prime Minister of Iraq has yet again interfered with the judicial process in the Saddam Hussein case [see my <a href="/distefanolegality.mht">legal opinion on the detention</a>]. He has stated that Saddam will be executed by the end of the year. This is a presumption, or perhaps an order to the appeal court to dismiss the appeal that is automatic and of right.<br /><br />The whole trial of Saddam has been carried out under unacceptable circumstances. The first chief judge resigned because of political interference (an offence and violation under both the Iraqi constitution and the Statutes of the Iraqi Special Tribunal, now the Iraqi High Tribunal), the second was dismissed because of an alleged involvement in the Ba&#39;ath party and the third judge was appointed simply to carry out the political wishes of the Iraqi government.<br /><br />Let us look carefully at the impact of this and its implications for the future. Chief Judge of the Revolutionary Court Awad Hamad al-Bandar was in fact convicted with Saddam Hussein and sentenced to death simply because he was a judge who, the prosecution stated, carried out the orders of the Saddam Hussein government! Yet, throughout the whole proceedings lasting 55 weeks not a single piece of evidence or legal argument was advanced to show that the Revolutionary Court was a summary court, which is the only basis for a conviction. In the Nuremberg Trials a judge was indeed sentenced for similar allegations, but the prosecution there proved that the tribunals established by the Nazi party where indeed summary courts. No such proof has been adduced or advanced. The conviction of Judge Awad Hamad al-Bandar has been overlooked because we have all concentrated on the main player-Saddam Hussein. Yet, the case of al-Bandar is vital not only for himself but also for the others.<br /><br />The Iraqi High Tribunal is not required to find guilt &#39;beyond reasonable doubt&#39; but the standard of proof is only whether the Tribunal is &#39;satisfied&#39; that the charges are proved. All other safeguards have been thrown in the waste. It is why Salam Chalabi, the original head of the Tribunal,  refused to return to it. He was not going to accept any kind of political interference. The result? He was removed, accused of murder, no proceedings followed and the Iraqi government begged him to return. He refused. He is a proper lawyer with principles to match and I have always appreciated his candor.<br /><br />The Iraqi High Tribunal heard no evidence whatsoever regarding the Revolutionary Court. It could not, in any view, even be satisfied let alone beyond reasonable doubt, that the Revolutionary Court was anything other than a properly constituted court. It may have applied summary justice in both criminal and civil, but then so do most of the Courts within the EU and the US. In the civil jurisdiction summary judgment is the most popular of applications to make to cut the case short when there is really no defense. In criminal law there are statutory offences which, regardless of defense, the result is jail - sex with a minor is but one.<br /><br />I have bitterly complained of the way the Iraqi Special Tribunal has been deployed and used as a political tool. It is with the full knowledge and consent of the US and British governments. It is strange that in the United Kingdom and Italy extradition to a country that does not guarantee rights of a fair trial as per Art.6 of the ECHR or worse for the imposition of capital punishment is prohibited, yet there is support for the imposition of capital punishment on Saddam Hussein et al.<br /><br />I have felt for Mr. Ramsey Clark, the ex-US Attorney General, in the disgraceful way he was ejected from the court by Judge Rahman on the day of the verdict. Yet, it was inevitable. The US failed to protect its own citizen and chose instead a way that has inevitably cost President Bush dearly in the mid term elections. The appeal process has commenced. If the law is to be applied and not interpreted then at the least Judge Awad Hamad al-Bandar should have his conviction overturned as a matter of law and fact. No evidence has been adduced whatsoever that the Revolutionary Court was other than properly constituted and with approved rules. No evidence was adduced that it was a summary court. The only evidence was that as Chief Judge, al-Bandar should not have approved the convictions. A fallacious argument wholly unsupported by any evidence at all. If the Revolutionary Court was thus a &#39;right and proper court&#39; the convictions and sentences were &#39;right and proper&#39; within the laws of Iraq at that time and now.<br /><br />Saddam Hussein never denied he, as President, signed the execution orders for Dujail. He was entitled to as the Vice President of the current Government has signed 27 orders that have been carried out in the last month. <br /><br />History may repeat itself and that is what Judge Rahman and the current Iraqi government should clearly consider.<br /><br />The appeal process is expected to last two months. As I have stated, and reconfirm regardless, there is an existing agreement between the UK/Italy and the Iraqi government witnessed by the US in 2004 that precludes the execution of 11 indicted persons of which Saddam is but one. If there is any attempt to execute any of the 11 named in the agreement it is my intention to make an urgent application both to the US Supreme Court in forma pauperis for an extraodinary writ of habeas corpus and to the European Court of Human Rights under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court for urgent measures.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Giovanni Di Stefano is an international lawyer working at Studio Legale Internazionale in Rome, Italy.</em><br />

He was held without legal process.  His combatant status was never reviewed as required by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</em> (2004) nor as outlined in the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005.<br /><br />The Bush administration has labeled Khan a &quot;high-value&quot; detainee. The administration believes Khan was asked by al Qaeda operations planner Khalid Sheik Mohammed to study poisoning of U.S. reservoirs.  The government also believes Mohammed may have considered using Khan in a plot against the president of Pakistan.<br /><br /> How did the Bush administration reach these judgments?  What did they learn from Khan during his long internment in CIA custody?  How did they learn it?  Due to an extraordinary request recently filed by the Bush administration in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia it is possible we may never know the answers to these questions.<br /><br /> The Justice Department has asked U.S. District Court Judge Reggie B. Walton to forbid Khan from telling anyone, <u>including his own lawyer</u>, the<br />details or techniques <u>of his own interrogation</u>.  This remarkable request occurred in the context of a habeas corpus proceeding filed on Khan's behalf to challenge the legality and constitutionality of his detention.  <br /><br /> According to CIA Information Review Officer Marilyn A. Dorn, Khan's secret detention may have exposed Khan to "alternative interrogation techniques" which are classified as TOP SECRET.  Therefore, according to the government's logic,  Khan, while defending himself,  must keep these secrets.<br /><br /> Admittedly the government's legal position against Khan sounds as if it were scripted by Joseph Heller, a revised edition of <em>Catch-22</em>.  Nevertheless, the Justice Department's attempt to keep Khan silent in a hearing where he challenges the legality of his own detention raises fundamental questions.  The immediate issue is: &quot;how are terrorists suspects to be interrogated?&quot;  Are there any rules?  This question has been much debated since the McCain anti-torture amendment of 2005 to the recent arguments over the Military Commissions Act of 2006.  The more fundamental question, however, is whether the United States government currently believes in the rule of law.  <br /><br /> Sophisticated terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda specifically train their members to resist interrogation.  In fact there is evidence to suggest that U.S. military survival and evasion manuals have been used by a number of terrorist groups to teach resistance to interrogation.  In short terrorists can be both evil and  hard nuts to crack.  Yet such observations cannot justify the conclusion that anything goes.  <br /><br /> The recently retired President (Chief Justice) of the Supreme Court of Israel, Aharon Barak,  has of necessity faced the difficult problems raised by<br />detention and interrogation of terrorist suspects more frequently than any other major jurist.  As he has written, as a citizen of Israel he is aware on a daily basis of the horrific tragedies deliberately inflicted by terrorists.  As a judge he has consistently ruled, however, that a democratic state must meet basic democratic and human rights norms in dealing with terrorists.  <br /><br /> In perhaps his most famous decision, <u>Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v. The State of Israel and the General Security Service</u> (High Court of Justice, 1994) he rejected the government's argument that a necessity defense could be used by the Israeli General Security Service (Shin Bet) as a legal authorization for physical coercion of terrorist suspects.  He left open the possibility that in a rare, extraordinary situation an interrogator might be able to use a necessity defense if the interrogator was prosecuted for his actions.  He made clear, however, that necessity - to prevent greater harm - is a rare criminal defense, not an administrative authorization, and that in any case the Israeli Basic Law: Human Dignity contradicted the notion of coercive interrogations.   <br /><br /> In  <em>Marab, et al. v The Commander of IDF in the West Bank</em> (High Court of Justice, 2002)  Chief Justice Barak held that judicial oversight was integral to any administrative detention as was access to a lawyer.  He spoke of judicial access in a matter of days, not years as in the Khan case.<br /><br /> Israel has had a greater percentage of its population killed and wounded by terrorist attacks than has the United States.  Israel is hardly seen as soft on terrorism, but it has not abandoned the rule of law.  As Justice Barak has said, democratic values may at times require a democratic state to fight terrorism with one hand tied behind its back, but more importantly those same values give democracies the upper hand.  Democracies abandon the law at their peril.<br /><br /> A classic exposition of the rule of law was written by the famous English legal historian Albert Venn Dicey at the end of the nineteenth century.  He wrote the rule of law consisted of (1) the supremacy of "regular law" as opposed to arbitrary power, (2) equality of all before ordinary courts applying ordinary law of the land, and (3) the rights of individuals as defined and enforced by the courts.<br /><br /> I do not believe these values are violated by military tribunals if they<br />provide due process and fundamental fairness to those charged with war crimes or crimes against humanity.  But to <u>maintain</u> Dicey's rule of law it is by definition necessary to <u>ascertain</u> how the government treats all, including the most heinous individuals.   The veil of secrecy with which the United States has shrouded the detention and interrogation of terrorist suspects makes the rule of law impossible to determine and thus to maintain.  Telling the suspect he is forbidden to speak of his own interrogation is the logical outcome, and an almost literary symbol, of government by secrecy.<br /><br /> King Charles I of England, a seventeenth century chief executive, disliked traditional English legal procedure.  He also had to deal with a recalcitrant Parliament.  The King's solution was to rule by Royal Proclamation and to enforce such proclamations in the Court of Star Chamber.  While authorities have disagreed to what extent Star Chamber proceedings were open, The English legal historian William Holdsworth and others agree that common law procedure was not followed and the accused was examined in private and often tortured.  <br /><br /> Parliament abolished Star Chamber in 1641.  Charles I was convicted of treason by Parliament's High Court of Justice and beheaded on January 30th, 1649.  We should have faith in the rule of law and avoid such unpleasantness here in the former colonies.<br /><br /><em>James Friedman is a professor at the University of Maine School of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.uwe.ac.uk/school/staff/profile.cfm?no=8">Richard Edwards</a>, Principal Lecturer in Law at the University of the West of England in Bristol, UK, says that the ongoing &#39;Cash for Honours&#39; investigation into whether benefactors of Britain&#39;s ruling Labour Party made loans or donations in order to secure peerages points up the problematic position of the British Attorney General when it comes to initiating public prosecutions against members of the very government of which he is a part...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/cashhonours.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>nce more Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General of England and Wales, finds himself at the centre of a growing political storm. This time it is not legality of the war in Iraq, but the "Cash for Honours" affair. The affair arose in the spring of 2006 when it emerged that leading donors to the Labour party had subsequently been nominated for life peerages. It was alleged that donors had made loans at preferential rates or had given donations in order to secure a peerage. <br /><br />Under section 1(1) of the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 "if any person accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person, for himself or for any other person, or for any purpose, any gift, money or valuable consideration as an inducement or reward for procuring or assisting or endeavouring to procure the grant of a dignity or title of honour to any person, or otherwise in connection with such a grant, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanour." The Honours Act was passed in 1925 in order to prevent the sale of honours.  During the administration of David Lloyd George honours had been sold with some gusto. No doubt Lloyd George, a Welshman, was unencumbered by the specious reverence that the English and Scots place on titles. Be that as it may, by 1922 the sale of these baubles had raised &Acirc;&pound;3 million. Although the money raised was used for primarily for political purposes, destined in large part for Lloyd George's National Liberal Party, it was rumoured that the former Prime Minister bought his country estate at Churt with the proceeds. <br /><br />The 1925 Act was a reaction to what today would be called 'sleeze'. The control of the money raised and the disreputable nature of many honoured created an air of corruption. The 1925 Act was intended to prevent this situation arising again. To date only one person has been tried and convicted under its provisions, that person being Maundy Gregory an associate of Lloyd George. Many were, no doubt, unaware of the existence of this law. The police are also investigating other possible offences under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, and the Prevention of Corruption Acts. The latter requires the consent of the Attorney General before prosecutions can be brought.<br /><br />The police investigation into the 2006 allegations is still ongoing. But the possibility that charges might be brought against leading members of the government has thrown into sharp relief the office of the Attorney General and his role as the head of public prosecutions in England and Wales. It has been argued that Lord Goldsmith cannot be involved in any decision to prosecute members of his own party because of a conflict of interest.<br /><br />The AG is the member of the British executive who is charged with bringing prosecutions in the name of the Crown within England and Wales. As such he acts as the guardian of the general public interest in a quasi-judicial manner. It is an important tenet of the unwritten British constitution that prosecutions are not subject to political considerations. As Lord Scott observed in his recent report on arms sales to Iraq, "considerations of party political advantages or disadvantage should never play a part in decisions as to whether or not to prosecute." (Para C3.8) Of course prosecutions often include offences of a political nature such as treason and of course proceedings under the Honours (Prevention of Abuse) Act 1925. Indeed, in 1924 the alleged political interference of the MacDonald Cabinet in the decision of the then AG Sir Patrick Hastings to withdraw a prosecution led to the collapse of first Labour administration. Much of the Campbell Case is shrouded in a fog of disputed facts. But the Cabinet Minutes of the 6th August 1924 are clear: "No prosecution of a political character should be undertaken without the prior sanction of the Cabinet being obtained." This statement is rightly regarded as constitutionally improper and it is widely recognised and accepted today that there is no executive right to interfere in the decisions of AG to prosecute. Sir Patrick was later to remark that to be a law officer of the Crown was to be in hell. He turned his back on politics and returned to private practice.<br /><br />Thus when considering whether or not to bring a prosecution, any clash of legal and party political opinions should be resolved by the AG in favour of the former. Without doubt it is for this very reason that the AG has by convention not traditionally sat in the British Cabinet, although he might attend Cabinet to advise on individual matters. The potential for conflict is too great. The conflict of legal and political duties/interests is one reason why the office of Lord Chancellor was reformed becoming in effect a minister of justice.<br /><br />In the current Labour Administration Lord Goldsmith has attended Cabinet on a regular basis being de facto a member. Unlike the majority of recent Attorneys General Lord Goldsmith has not simply attended meetings for particular matters. Moreover, not only is he de facto a member of the Cabinet, he is also a donor to the party and the recipient of a life peerage from the Queen on the recommendation of Prime Minister Tony Blair. Of course, in Lord Goldsmith's case there is no allegation of any impropriety, the AG being a man of the utmost integrity. But nevertheless, Lord Goldsmith finds himself in a difficult position with a clear conflict of interest. He may be called upon to consider whether a prosecution is in the public interest and perhaps even to lead that prosecution under the Honours Act against his Cabinet colleagues (former and present). No doubt any such prosecutions would be highly embarrassing and from a political viewpoint dangerous. But equally a refusal to prosecute might leave the government open to the sort of administration ending affair that occurred over the Campbell Case. It is very difficult to see how Lord Goldsmith can advise on proceedings over other parties in this affair. Whatever claims might be made to the contrary any decision simply will not appear impartial under the circumstances. No doubt for this very reason opposition politicians have described his possible involvement in the decision making process as "unacceptable". <br /><br />This, however, is not the end of the constitutional complications. Where conflicts of interest have arisen before, the AG has delegated the decisions to either the Solicitor General or the Director of Public Prosecutions. But in this instance both have ruled themselves out because of conflicts of interest. That leaves the Treasury Solicitor who might have been expected to take the decision. But again in this case he also suffers from a conflict of interest. This amazing state of affairs is unprecedented. The decision will instead be taken by an independent senior counsel. Even so the AG would not stand aside completely: "There can&#39;t be any question of an attorney general standing aside because of the special constitutional and indeed statutory responsibilities that I&#39;ve got &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;. I&#39;m responsible - I&#39;m the only person that is answerable to Parliament - for the prosecutions that take place in this country.&quot;
This is undoubtedly correct. Just as the AG's similar claim that he or the Solicitor General would need to consent to prosecutions brought under statutes requiring his approval. However, the real issue here, for which there is no immediate solution, is the conflict of interest.<br /><br />Of course the police investigation may not reveal any evidence of possible offences. However, this affair has been far from academic so far as the office of AG is concerned. Like the House of Lords, the office of AG is a part of the British constitution that badly needs to be reformed. It is imperative that the independence of the office is preserved and protected.<br /><br />Traditionally the AG has sat in the House of Commons, but recently there has been a shortage of adequately qualified candidates amongst its members. Appointing a member of the House of Lords must have seemed a logical alternative. It certainly ensured that the AG was accountable to Parliament. However, this method as we have seen has run into difficulties.<br /><br />Arguably the time has come for the office of AG to be modernised. There are plenty of models available elsewhere in the common law world. In Ireland the AG is not a member of the government but is appointed on the recommendation of the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) and holds office concurrently with him. Whereas in Singapore the AG holds office under similar terms and conditions to those enjoyed by justices of the Supreme Court. But whatever model is in the end adopted, the independence of the office must be assured. Confidence in the impartial administration of the rule of law demands no less.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Richard Edwards is Principal Lecturer in Law at the University of the West of England in Bristol, UK.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.presidency.gov.lb/president/biography/career/career.htm"><strong>Emile Lahoud</strong></a> [President of Lebanon]: &quot;... I was among the first callers for an international investigation commission to conduct an enquiry into the <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/hariri-tribunal-proposal-goes-to.php">assassination of Prime Minister Hariri</a>.  Shortly after the heinous crime, I called up UN Secretary General Kufi Annan demanding him to send an international investigation team to Lebanon. <br /><br />Everybody in Lebanon wants to know the truth, and I have always supported the establishment of a tribunal with an international status to try the assassin and bring them to justice.<br /><br />However, I have considered the cabinet of Siniora&#39;s vote on the second draft for establishing the tribunal as both &quot;Unconstitutional and illegitimate&quot;, simply because the cabinet lost its legitimacy after a main sect &quot;the Shiites&quot; withdrew its ministers.  The Lebanese constitution stipulates clearly that Lebanon is based on consensus and on coexistence, and therefore the cabinet of Siniora breached the national pact and therefore in our view it is &quot;inexistent&quot;.<br /><br />Moreover, the cabinet has no right according to the constitution to ratify any international treaty.  Article 52 of the Lebanese constitution, states clearly that the president has the sole power, to discuss, and ratify any international treaty, after coordinating with the Prime Minister.  Only then would the cabinet be allowed to see the draft of the treaty.   <br /><br />My legal remarks to the United Nations on the draft of the tribunal aimed at securing that the tribunal issue would neither be politicized nor would it violate Lebanon&#39;s sovereignty.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University]: &quot; On January 4, 2006, Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) will make history by taking the oath of office as the first Muslim elected to the US House of Representatives. He has decided to take the oath on the Quran, the holy book of Islam. <br /><br />January 4th should be a day of celebration for Americans as well as Muslims in the World. It should be a day of celebration for Americans because Ellison&#39;s election to the House affirms the openness, generosity, and vivacity of American democracy. It is a day of celebration for Muslims because a Muslim will now sit as a lawmaker and show to the world that America can be a friend and not an enemy of Islam. It must also be a day of celebration because it will challenge the warped ideologies of bigotry, prejudice, violence, and Islamophobia. <br /><br />Unfortunately, some American opinion-makers doubt Ellison&#39;s loyalty to the United States Constitution, which states that &quot;no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.&quot; Some make the catastrophic suggestion that Ellison should be forced to take the oath of office on the Bible. Dennis Prager, for example, objects to Ellison&#39;s taking the oath on the Quran by arguing: &quot;I want Jews like myself to take the oath on the Bible, even though the New Testament is not our Bible.&quot; Some object to Ellison&#39;s relations with the American Muslim groups, such as the <a href="http://www.cair-net.org/">CAIR</a> (Council on American Islamic Relations).  Gary Bauer, the architect of the advocacy group <a href="http://www.ouramericanvalues.org">American Values</a>, mentions these relations to surmise that Ellison would &quot;vote against any kind of serious war against Islamofascism.&quot; <br /><br />The 5th District of Minnesota has sent Keith Ellison to make laws for America. Ellison must discharge his office within the confines of the US Constitution. Ellison is a Muslim and has no intentions of trading his faith for political gains. He deserves to serve his term without harassment from groups who see America as their <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/jaghir">jaghir</a>.&quot;<br />

		<title>MCA habeas suspension and Hamdan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34"><strong>Jordan Paust</strong></a> [University of Houston Law Center]: &quot;The Constitution expressly mandates that &quot;[t]he privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Case of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.&quot;  U.S. Const., art. I, s. 9, cl. 2.  During the formation of the Constitution, there had been a proposal by Charles Pinckney that suspension shall not occur &quot;except upon the most urgent and pressing occasions&quot; (emphasis added), a phrase relevant to the restrictive meaning of the word &quot;require&quot; that was finally adopted by the Framers even though the &quot;occasions&quot; were expressly limited to two (i.e., rebellion and invasion). <br /> <br /> While there are attempted suspensions of habeas corpus in two places within the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), there was no rebellion or invasion at the time of the law&#39;s enactment.  Moreover, suspension of habeas corpus had not been required in the five years since 9/11 and for two years after the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Rasul v. Bush</em>.  The attempted suspensions of habeas in the 2006 Act are additionally without limits concerning time, place, necessity, or invasion.  Thus, the attempt in Section 7(a) of the MCA to suspend habeas corpus is contrary to constitutional textual strictures and structural limitations on governmental power and is therefore ultra vires.  The attempt in Section 5(a) to suspend habeas for any person (citizen or alien), here or abroad, in time of peace or war, regardless of any alleged necessity due to invasion, and at all times in the future with respect to claims under the Geneva Conventions suffers from the same constitutional impropriety.  Congress has exceeded its lawful power by suspending habeas indefinitely, when not required, and when there has been no rebellion or invasion.<br /><br /> In <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> (D.D.C. Dec. 13, 2006), the district court correctly found that &quot;[t]he MCA is not a constitutionally valid suspension of the writ of habeas corpus,&quot; since &quot;[n]either rebellion nor invasion was occurring at the time the MCA was enacted,&quot; as required by the Constitution.  It noted that Congress had previously suspended habeas only four times and that each suspension was &quot;accompanied by clear statements expressing congressional intent to suspend the writ and limiting suspension to periods during which the predicate conditions (rebellion or invasion) existed.&quot;  However, the district court thought that &quot;Congress&#39;s removal of jurisdiction from the federal courts was not a suspension of habeas corpus,&quot; but a &quot;removal&quot; without limits, and merely a &quot;jurisdiction-stripping&quot; denial of Hamdan&#39;s &quot;statutory access to the writ.&quot;  This appears to be plain sophistry and ignores the fact that Congress simply has no constitutional authority to suspend or indefinitely remove habeas corpus in this instance. More particularly, the Framers did not allow Congress to terminate habeas and a claim that &quot;termination,&quot; which can be operative only until the next Congress (or the present Congress) changes the legislation, is not &quot;suspension&quot; is patently silly.  Similarly nonsensical is a claim that legislation is not suspending habeas when it suspends (or terminates) the jurisdiction of federal courts to hear habeas claims.<br /><br /> Recognition that there is a lack of congressional authority and  that relevant provisions of the Act are ultra vires does not address other problems, such as the fact that treaties of the United States guarantee the right of access to courts and to judicial review of the propriety of detention (see, e.g., 44 Harv. Int&#39;l L. J. 503 (2003), cited in <em>Hamdi</em>); that there was no clear and unequivocal expression of congressional intent to override such treaties, and that therefore under venerable Supreme Court rulings the treaties have primacy; and that, in any event, the &quot;rights under&quot; a treaty and the law of war exceptions to the last in time rule also guarantee the primacy of relevant treaty law of the United States (as documented in my treatise, <em>International Law as Law of the United States</em> 99, 104-09 (2 ed. 2003)). &quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.rosnerandlaw.com/aflc_bios_mansfield.html"><strong>Alan Mansfield</strong></a> [attorney for plaintiffs in Escondido CA anti-immigration ordinance case]: &quot;On October 18, 2006 the <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/federal-judge-blocks-california-city.php">City of Escondido</a> adopted local Ordinance No. 2006-38R &quot;Establishing Penalties for the Harboring of Illegal Aliens in the City of Escondido&quot;, finding that the state and federal government lacks the resources to properly protect interests of Escondido residents.  The need for the Ordinance was supposedly based on a university study that in fact did not study or identify illegal aliens as being a cause of the City&#39;s perceived problems, and based on a claim of increased crime when in fact crime in Escondido was down over 25% during the past year. <br /><br />The Ordinance requires any landlord who leases or rents a dwelling unit in Escondido to provide the City with undefined &quot;identity data&quot; about any tenant upon an unverified &quot;valid complaint&quot; from any person in Escondido that is not based on race or national origin (how that could happen is unexplained).  Within 10 business days after receiving notice from the City that the person identified in the Complaint is an &quot;illegal alien&quot; (a term not defined under federal law), the landlord must &quot;correct the violation&quot;. Since the violation is &quot;harboring illegal aliens&quot;, the only way to correct a violation is to immediately evict anyone found to be an &quot;illegal alien&quot;.  Landlords must also advise the City of the whereabouts of that &quot;illegal alien&quot; after eviction.  The penalties for refusing comply with these requirements are significant -- for multiple violations (each day that passes is a separate violation) up to $1,000 per day and/or six months in jail, and an immediate pre-hearing suspension of the landlord&#39;s license to do business in Escondido.  Since a landlord may need a business license to do business in the City, such a suspension could arguably result in a landlord from being unable to collect rents from any tenant while their license is suspended.<br /><br /> Plaintiffs (two landlords in Escondido, two DOE plaintiffs and the Escondido Human Rights Committee) contend the Ordinance violates numerous federal and state laws, including being  preempted by federal immigration laws and state law, violating federal and state anti-discrimination and housing laws, violating due process, equal protection and free speech rights for both landlords and tenants, and also violating the City&#39;s police powers and the Contracts Clause of the federal and State Constitutions. <br /><br />Consistent with the rulings of several other judges nationwide who have issued similar rulings on similar ordinances, on November 20, 2006, the Honorable John Houston of the United States District Court in San Diego issued a <a href="http://www.cooley.com/practices/content.aspx?id=Escondido">written opinion</a> [related documents] confirming his issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining the Ordinance from going into effect based on the &quot;serious questions&quot; raised by plaintiffs, and setting a preliminary injunction hearing for March 2007. <br /><br />While the ruling only granted a temporary restraining order and thus was a very preliminary assessment of the merits of the action, plaintiffs believe the issues the Court identified in its ruling will not go away as the action progresses.  There are two particular problems that doom this Ordinance.  As the Court noted in its ruling, this is an ordinance prohibiting the harboring of illegal aliens.  Yet there is a federal immigration statute that directly addresses the issue of harboring (8 U.S.C. Section 1324), which has been interpreted by federal courts and is administered exclusively by the federal judiciary. Moreover, determining if a particular person is lawfully present in the United States is a complex issue addressed by federal immigration laws, and is to be determined in very specific proceedings. Thus, these fields have been preempted by the federal immigration laws.  There is little the City can do to correct this fatal defect.<br /><br />In addition, there are serious due process concerns on all sides of this issue.  First, the landlord may simply be unable to obtain the &quot;identity data&quot; requested or have obtained the data for credit reporting purposes and thus not be able to provide such data for other purposes, yet be subject to Draconian penalties for failing to respond to a City&#39;s request.  The landlord may be put in the impossible position of having to evict a tenant in 10 days, even though under California landlord tenant laws the tenant may be entitled to 60 days&#39; notice or more.  In the interim their license is suspended and they may be deprived of the right to collect rents without any hearing for months.  And who makes the termination someone is an &quot;illegal alien &#8212; the City? A state court in an unlawful detainer proceeding?  And who pays the costs of that eviction process, particularly if a court believes someone is not an illegal alien?  The City&#39;s response is that they are permitted to access the SAVE database maintained by the federal government, but (1) there is no evidence the City can do so, (2) that database is for determining eligibility for federal and state benefits, and (3) the federal government has stated that a lack of verification in the SAVE database is not the equivalent of a determination someone is or is not lawfully present in the United States.  Without answers to these basic questions, both landlords and tenants have raised serious due process concerns.  <br /><br />There are other significant unanswered questions raised by the Ordinance.  What about the rights of U.S. Citizen children to live and go to school where they want, but they can only rent through their parents?  What about the fact undocumented immigrant children have an Equal Protection right to a basic education in the City under Plyer v. Doe?  What about the fact any inquiry is based on an unverified complaint that is not supposedly based on race, nationality or other criteria but can be submitted by any person in Escondido (and thus used for extortion), with no opportunity to initially challenge the Complaint before a demand for data is made?  To this point the City has not answered these basic questions.<br /><br />Numerous organizations and newspapers have called for a repeal of this Ordinance, and our hope is that the City will heed these calls.  Otherwise this will simply be very expensive and time-consuming litigation with little identifiable benefit for a clearly unconstitutional Ordinance.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jackson Chin [Associate Counsel, <a href="http://www.prldef.org/Index.htm">Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> (PRLDEF), currently challenging Hazleton PA illegal immigration laws]: &quot;Plaintiffs counsel have challenged <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/federal-judge-blocks-pennsylvania-city.php">local ordinances in Hazleton, PA</a> based on their unconstitutional and ambitious sweep in attempting to regulate immigrant residents. Misguided at best, these laws are preempted by and violate a number of federal laws. The passage and defense of such local anti-immigrant laws are part of an organized effort by  immigration restrictionist lobbies (i.e. FAIR). The fate of these type of xenophobic laws is being watched by other jurisdictions.<br /><br />The practical consequences of such ordinances have been to promote a climate of fear, and we envision a regime that allows invasions of privacy, violations of due process, and arbitrary discrimination towards those who appear or sound foreign. In addition, the ordinances&#39; imposition of tenant permitting, taking / suspension of landlord licenses, deprivation of owners; rental income, and, imposing monetary sanctions on property owners and local businesses accused of harboring &quot;illegal aliens&quot; (offering rental shelter) are illegal and go beyond the proper exercise of local police powers.<br /><br />Profound risks and consequences to our plaintiffs (immigrants and children) were noted by Judge James Munley:<br /><br />&quot;A monetary price cannot be placed on such matters as plaintiffs&#39; housing, livelihood and education. Therefore, monetary damages would not be sufficient to make the plaintiffs whole, and the plaintiffs&#39; risk irreparable injury if the temporary restraining order is not granted.&quot;<br /><br />The court recently extended the TRO order for 120 days to allow parties to conduct discovery and prepare for a merits hearing.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.glad.org/About_GLAD/staff.shtml"><strong>Gary Buseck</strong></a> [Legal Director, <a href="http://www.glad.org/">Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders</a> (GLAD)]: &quot;Mitt Romney is about to leave the Massachusetts governorship and enter a presidential primary campaign built almost exclusively around his opposition to the now recognized <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/romney-asks-court-to-put-same-sex.php">right of liberty and equality under the Massachusetts constitution</a> for two loving people to marry.  While he&#39;s certainly entitled to his angst over the legislature&#39;s vote to recess the 2006 Constitutional convention until Jan. 2, 2007, which effectively killed a proposed ballot initiative to end marriage equality, his rhetoric is overwrought and unprincipled, as is his lawsuit to try and force the legislature to vote.<br /><br />The Governor claims to be protecting the constitution.  Yet his meritless lawsuit ironically tramples on the constitutional principle of the separation of powers, by seeking a court order to direct the Senate President to conduct a specific vote in a legislative body.  The lawsuit also ignores the clear requirements of Massachusetts constitution in asking the Secretary of the Commonwealth to simply, by fiat, place this proposed amendment on the ballot.  The Constitution carefully spells out the role of the Secretary, which includes placing a matter on the ballot only after it has been certified by the clerk of the Constitutional Convention.  Does the Governor imagine winning a court victory?  Surely not.  But he certainly hopes to score political points on the national stage.<br /><br />It was precisely because of an abiding concern for deliberative representative democracy that the people of Massachusetts in 1918 adopted &#8212; unlike many Western states &#8212; a form of initiative that included a distinct deliberative role for the Legislature in the amendment process.   Contrary to what Mr. Romney has asserted in his complaint, our Constitution nowhere says in Article 48 that &quot;the legislature `shall&#39; vote&quot; on the merits of any given petition.  <br /><br />Turning to the merits of what the Legislature has done to protect the efforts of same sex couples to marry, they have met in Constitutional Convention several times over nearly five years, and have repeatedly debated various anti-gay amendments. Every time, they have voted not to move the amendments forward.<br /><br />Those are the judgments we elected our representatives to make; and that is what the Constitution directs them to do.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law says that the trial of Saddam Hussein for genocide of the Kurds should continue posthumously, notwithstanding his execution for crimes against humanity in Dujail...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kellyupdated.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he execution of Saddam Hussein by hanging today in Baghdad could bring to a close the troubled proceedings of the Iraqi High Tribunal.  Originally designed by U.S. occupation forces as the Iraqi Special Tribunal and subsequently renamed by the Iraqi government, the IHT was set to try Saddam for seven discreet crimes including the genocide of the Kurds, destruction of the Marsh Arabs, and multiple mass atrocities.  But it was his conviction for the 1982 massacre of 148 Shi&#39;ites from the opposition Dawa party in the town of Dujail that ultimately drew the death sentence and sealed the former Iraqi president&#39;s fate.  Under Iraqi law, death sentences must be carried out within 30 days of a final appeal, and the appellate court in Saddam&#39;s case confirmed his death sentence this week.<br /><br />The decision not to try Saddam before an international tribunal, but rather before an Iraqi court in occupied Baghdad, brought with it many complications.  First, because the court was established by the U.S., subsequently blessed by both the governing council and iterim government, then embraced by the elected Iraqi government without any significant changes, it never enjoyed the gloss of legitimacy that a domestic independent national court should have.  Moreover, due to the aggressive de-Ba&#39;athification policies of the U.S., higher level judges were removed from service, leaving only less-qualified lower-level judges to contend with sophisticated defense counsel, complex international legal charges (war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide) and an unruly group of former tyrants.  Thus, the IHT was ill-equipped to handle the trials on its docket from the outset.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/saddamtrial.php">Saddam Hussein Trial</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2007/01/saddam-hussein-dujail-appellate.php">Saddam Hussein Dujail appeals chamber decision</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2006/12/saddam-hussein-dujail-judgment-iht.php">Dujail trial judgment</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />Once the Dujail trial began, the IHT proved incapable of guiding the proceedings in a fair and unbiased manner.  The Chief Judge resigned in disgust amidst charges of government interference with the court&#39;s independence midway through trial.  Multiple defense counsel and associated personnel were gunned down in the streets, and some fled to Jordan in fear for their lives.  The unstable security environment also hampered defense counsel&#39;s ability to investigate and test evidence offered by the prosecution, which only had to meet a satisfaction of guilt standard by the IHT as opposed to a &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; standard used by international criminal tribunals. <br /><br />And human rights groups, no friend to Saddam while he was in power, nevertheless uniformly condemned the IHT trials as unfair, specifically noting a lack of familiarity with international criminal law on the part of Iraqi lawyers and judges despite the fact such crimes were being charged and the extensive use of anonymous witnesses, thereby limiting defense counsel&#39;s ability to adequately counter the evidence against their clients.<br /><br />So what happens now?  Only one of the seven trials has been completed.  Saddam was in the middle of the Anfal trial for the genocide perpetrated against the Kurds in northern Iraq during the end of the Iran-Iraq War.  Because the IHT was trying Saddam&#39;s crimes sequentially instead of together, five other trials have yet to begin.  The IHT&#39;s options are to end the trials of Saddam now, or continue to try Saddam posthumously.  Either way, the outcome is less than optimal.  Ending the trial process truncates exploration of the full guilt of Saddam Hussein for his crimes.  But continuing the trial posthumously would be a one-sided affair, disallowing a vigorous and active defense the ability to test the truth of the evidence presented.   Moreover, from the perspective of the victims, Kurds will be seen as not receiving justice while Shi&#39;ites (victims in the Dujail trial) did.  This would be especially true from the storytelling standpoint, which is key to national healing and reconciliation after long periods of traumatic rule by ruthless despots. <br /><br />The Iraqi government should have stayed Saddam&#39;s death sentence until the completion of the trials against him, or at least until the completion of the Anfal trial for genocide, not only as a matter of justice for Iraq&#39;s Kurdish population, but because there are many aspects of genocide that remain unsettled.  What the IHT may contribute to the small canon of genocide cases since Nuremberg is potentially significant.  For instance, the question of whether ethnic cleansing constitutes genocide continues to be debated within the academy.  Ethnic cleansing was a central aspect of Saddam&#39;s Anfal campaigns against the Kurds.  Moving the Kurdish population out of the area around the oil fields and repopulating those areas with Sunni Arabs occurred relentlessly during this time frame.  Kurds in northern Iraq are now dealing with the problem of resettled Arabs in traditionally Kurdish lands because of that ethnic cleansing.  A judgment on whether this is genocide would be extremely helpful in the development of the law of genocide, even it comes from a somewhat flawed tribunal.<br /><br />Consequently, although the great tyrant is dead, his trial should continue - even if posthumously, on the question of guilt for the Anfal campaigns.  His co-defendants in that trial will remain co-defendants, but his counsel should remain at table.  The law that will come out of it is important, and the quality of the trial, such as it is, will only be heightened if Saddam&#39;s more sophisticated counsel remain in the game instead of leaving it to the counsel of his co-defendants alone.  Moreover, Iraq&#39;s Kurds deserve to have their victimhood, and Saddam&#39;s role in it, as legally recognized as the Shi&#39;ite population.  To be sure, the full extent of Saddam&#39;s atrocities will not be as completely appreciated as if he physically stood trial for all his crimes.  But at least by letting the Anfal trial move forward, the IHT would finish some of what it started.<br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J.

Its exceptional status is the subject of renewed debate. The catalyst has been new Australian laws responding to the threat of terrorism.<br /><br />Since September 11, the Australian parliament has enacted a remarkable 40 anti-terror laws. They are extraordinary in their reach in providing for house arrest through control orders, preventive detention without charge or trial for up to two weeks, restrictions on speech through new sedition laws and even the detention of non-suspect citizens for up to a week for intelligence gathering by the Australian Security Intelligence Organization.<br /><br />Some of these laws extend further than the equivalent statutes in the United States and the United Kingdom. This proved possible due to the absence of the checks and balances provided by a Bill of Rights. <br /><br />Why then is Australia the exception in lacking such an instrument? The answer lies in our history. Although many think of Australia as a young country, constitutionally speaking, it is one of the oldest in the world. The Australian Constitution remains almost completely as it was when enacted in 1901, while the Constitutions of the Australian States can go back as far as the 1850s.<br /><br />These constitutions were conceived at a time when human rights, with the prominent exception of the 1791 United States Bill of Rights, tended not to be protected through a single legal instrument. Certainly, there was then no such law in the United Kingdom, upon whose legal system ours is substantially based. This has changed, especially after World War II and the passage of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948, but by then Australia's system of government had been operating for decades.<br /><br />Not only is the Australian constitutional system old by world terms, but it has resisted change. As far back as 1967 Australia was described by Geoffrey Sawer as 'constitutionally speaking &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; the frozen continent'. This is even more applicable today, with the last successful vote to change the Constitution in 1977 when it was amended, among other things, to set a retirement age of 70 years for judges of the High Court, Australia's top court.<br /><br />The Australian Constitution was drafted and consideration given to inserting guarantees of human rights at conventions held in the 1890s. At that time, it made sense to trust that the then British traditions of the common law and responsible government would protect human rights.<br /><br />There was also an additional reason why rights guarantees were not included in the new Australian Constitution. The framers sought to give the new federal and State Parliaments the power to pass racially discriminatory laws.<br /><br />This is demonstrated by the drafting of certain provisions. For example, the Constitution, as drafted in 1901, said little about Indigenous peoples, but what it did say was entirely negative. Section 51(xxvi), the races power, enabled the federal Parliament to make laws with respect to '[t]he people of any race, other than the aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws', while under s 127 'In reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth, or of a State or other part of the Common&Acirc;&not;wealth, aboriginal natives shall not be counted'.<br /><br />Section 51(xxvi) was inserted into the Constitution to allow the Commonwealth to take away the liberty and rights of sections of the community on account of their race. By today's standards, the reasoning behind the provision was racist. Edmund Barton, Australia's first Prime Minster and later a High Court judge, stated at the 1898 Convention in Melbourne that the power was necessary to enable the Commonwealth to 'regulate the affairs of the people of coloured or inferior races who are in the Commonwealth'.<br /><br />In a 1967 referendum Australians chose to strike out the words 'other than the aboriginal race in any State' in s 51(xxvi) and to delete s 127 entirely. However, the racist underpinnings of our Constitution remain.<br /><br />While Australia still lacks national Bill or Charter of Rights, and the very idea is strongly resisted by our Prime Minister and federal Attorney General, there has been change at the State level.<br /><br />The Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities enacted in July 2006 is a landmark in Australia's constitutional and political history. While it is not the nation's first Charter of Rights, that being the Human Rights Act 2004 of the Australian Capital Territory, it is the first such instrument in an Australian State. Like the former law, it is an innovative, if modest, change to the Australian system of government in the form of an unentrenched act of parliament that protects a range of civil and political rights.<br /><br />A like change is being considered in other States and is the subject of a <a href="http://www.humanrightsact.com.au/">national campaign</a>. They are all based on the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the United Kingdom Human Rights Act 1998 (UK).<br /><br />The United States Bill of Rights has not been as influential. It commands little political support in Australia because of a perception that it gives judges too much power in shifting contentious social issues like abortion and euthanasia away from parliaments to the courts. By contrast, many Australians remain attached to the idea of parliamentary sovereignty.<br /><br />Australia's new anti-terror laws have tipped the balance. More Australians see the need for some form of Australian Bill of Rights than was the case prior to September 11. Those laws are so extraordinary in how they affect fundamental values like no detention without trial, freedom of speech and the presumption of innocence that increasing numbers of people see a bill of rights as essential.<br /><br />Sometimes the case for better human rights protection only becomes clear when rights are taken away and the lack of safeguards exposed. This is the case in Australia today. The challenge is to grasp the opportunity to see the federal Government's overreaction to terrorism transformed into a national bill of rights.<br /><br /><em><a href="http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/staff/WilliamsG/">George Williams</a> is the Anthony Mason Professor and Director of the <a href="http://www.gtcentre.unsw.edu.au/">Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law</a> at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.

He will and should be remembered vividly for restoring a sense of integrity and trust in government following the Watergate scandal, for ending U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, for helping broker a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel, and for signing the Helsinki human rights treaty with the then Soviet Union.<br /><br />I would like, however, to remember and thank him for a decision he made that has had particularly lasting and significant impact on the life of this nation&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;his single appointment to the United States Supreme Court: that of Justice John Paul Stevens.<br /><br />President Ford would, I believe, be quite content in knowing that some focus was being paid to this aspect of his legacy.  Indeed, a few years ago, President Ford wrote a letter to the Dean of Fordham Law School in which he stated:<br /><br />"Historians study the significant diplomatic, legislative, and economic events that occurred during a Presidential term to evaluate that Presidency.  Normally, little or no attention is given to the long term effects of that President's Supreme Court nominees&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;Let that not be the case with my Presidency.  For I am prepared to allow history's judgment of my term in office to rest (if necessary, exclusively) on my nomination thirty years ago of John Paul Stevens to the U.S. Supreme Court."<br /><br />When President Ford made that decision to nominate John Paul Stevens in 1975 to replace Justice William Douglas, he selected a "judge's judge."  Since the time President Ford appointed him, Justice Stevens' thirty years on the Supreme Court bench have been marked by a tenacious consistency:  a deep commitment to principles of equality, justice, and liberty.  Evidence of this judicial consistency can be found in the fact that thirty years after appointing him, President Ford said that he continued to "endorse [Justice Stevens'] constitutional views on the secular character of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause, on securing procedural safeguards in criminal cases, and on the constitution's broad grant of regulatory authority to Congress."<br /><br />In that same letter to the Fordham dean, President Ford also praised Justice Stevens on his "charming wit and sense of humor."  His is an impish sense of humor born of kindness and compassion and devoid of any note of superiority.  No wonder President Ford liked him as much as he did; they were cut from a similar cloth woven of integrity, decency, and sense of duty.<br /><br />If, as President Ford requested, history judges his legacy at least in part on his appointment of John Paul Stevens to the Supreme Court, then history will judge President Ford, and his Judge, well.<br /><br /><br /><em>Alison J.

Kennedy Memorial</a> Center for Human Rights says that on International Human Rights Day we need to expand our understanding of rights to include working through - as opposed to around or against - government because in places like Haiti, the old way of thinking is only enabling abuses...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/monikavarma.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>H</strong></font>uman Rights Day is not only a day to commemorate the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but a day to look towards what challenges lie ahead for realizing human rights in even the world's most difficult of situations.  There is perhaps no greater challenge in the Western Hemisphere than Haiti, nor a greater opportunity. <br /><br />Haiti as a country has a tremendous commitment to human rights, one that we in the United States have a difficult time even recognizing.  This includes the right to health, "the right of every citizen to decent housing, education, food and social security." Haiti, the most impoverished nation in our hemisphere, accepts these greater responsibilities despite not yet having the resources to fulfill its obligations.  <br /><br />So what does a government that takes on such responsibilities do when it has no resources?  It reaches out to its friends in the international community to help it grow and provide for its people.  In 2004, countries around the world did just that &#8212; they pledged just over $1 billion to Haiti through the Interim Cooperation Framework, a plan to help the Haitian state develop the sustainable institutions and infrastructure necessary to provide access to health care, education and other human rights.  The framework called for funds to be used in a way that empowers the government with the capacity to do its job better over time.  <br /><br />Donors met again last week to check on their progress.  The Haitian government was commended for "sound fiscal policies" by international leaders including the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs.  <br /><br />The international community's performance report was less than positive.  Haitian Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis said that 99% of this money had not actually been disbursed.  He expressed his hopes for funds to be channeled to Haitian ministries so they could strengthen their own systems to successfully carrying such work on into the future &#8212; exactly as the plan had called for. <br /><br />For years, money has flowed directly through NGOs to carry out projects in Haiti, bypassing the government.  Although some NGOs like Zamni Lasante, run by 2002 RFK Human Rights Award winner Loune Viaud, do work with the Haitian government, most do not.  In many cases, the international community acts as an enabler, offering a quick fix instead of partnering with the Haitian government to build long term solutions. This approach takes an already weak public infrastructure and brings it to near collapse.  Without the resources and infrastructure to implement its plans, the government has no ability to improve the public health situation.  It is easy to point to concerns of corruption or the government's inabilities as reasons not to fulfill pledges or to sidestep the government, but the consequences of not improving the government's capability to eventually sustain itself infringes on Haitians' human rights.  <br /><br />Although there is no obligation to assist Haiti, many countries did come together to pledge their support after many years of questionable intervention in Haiti.  Once a country does choose to intervene, it bears a responsibility to the Haitian people.  This line of thinking breaks from human rights' traditional focus on a country's obligations only extending to its own people.  That paradigm fails to explain situations where wealthy donor countries have a greater impact on human rights situations than the government of a weaker host country, yet enact policies to the detriment of individual rights.  There is a legal basis for obligations applying outside of one's own borders that must be more closely examined and adhered to.  <br /><br />The $1 billion that the international community patted itself on the back for giving is not charity.  Once a nation makes this kind of a pledge, it must actually follow through with its commitments and use the funds in a way that, at minimum, does not undermine the Haitian government's ability to do its own job and help its own people.  Under the current system, Haiti can not fully develop its own capacity and the country and its people are forced to rely on international donors and NGOs who may or may not deliver on their promises on into the future to meet Haiti's human rights commitments. <br /><br />The Interim Cooperation Framework could empower Haiti to develop internally and fulfill its responsibilities, though donor states have all but ignored it. The Haitian government is currently finalizing its Poverty Reduction Strategy, a new framework utilizing the same sustainable philosophy for donor support that intends to do just that &#8212; reduce poverty.  The government developed a carefully thought out strategy to move forward. The difficulty is in getting the international community to support its plans.  <br /><br />Bypassing the government completely is at best wholly patronizing and at worst a direct violation of donor countries' human rights obligations.  As we celebrate human rights today, we should begin expanding our understanding of rights because in places like Haiti, the old way of thinking in only enabling further rights abuses.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Monika Kalra Varma is the Acting Director of the RFK Memorial Center for Human Rights and has worked extensively on advocacy and legal actions related to the United Nations, the Organization of American States and other donor states' obligations to human rights within Haiti.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a> of New England School of Law says the disparate charges brought against US Marine Corps officers and enlisted men in connection with the killings of Iraqi civilians at Haditha manifest a double standard of criminal liability that should not and need not exist...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/victorhansen.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> The US Marine Corps has announced criminal charges against 8 Marines allegedly involved in the unlawful killing of 24 Iraqi civilians last year in Haditha in November 2005.  Those Marines who were at the scene at the time of the killings face charges ranging from negligent homicide to murder.  In addition, the Marines charged four officers not present at the scene in Haditha with dereliction of duty and one officer was also charged with obstruction of justice.  The charges against these officers are based on their alleged roles in either covering up the incident or failing to adequately investigate the killings.  <br /><br />The disparity in the charges that the enlisted soldiers are facing as compared to the charges which the four officers in the chain of command face is nothing new, and once again raises the question of whether the U.S. military has a double standard in the way it treats its officers in comparison with its treatment of enlisted personnel.  It also points to the double standard that the U.S. has in how it holds its own commanders criminally responsible for wrongful acts as compared to the standard the U.S. applies to military leaders of other forces.<br /><br />In Haditha, the Marines on the scene who are charged with negligent homicide and murder can face potential punishments which include many years of confinement and quite possibly life sentences.  In contrast, the officers charged with dereliction of duty face a maximum of 6 months confinement, and this only if the prosecution can prove willful dereliction.  If the officer's dereliction was only culpably inefficient, the maximum sentence is three months confinement.  In the case of obstruction of justice, that officer faces a maximum punishment of 5 years confinement.  Significantly, in order for prosecutors to prove this offence they must show that the charged officer took some wrongful affirmative actions with the specific intent of influencing or impeding criminal proceedings.  Given these actus reus and mens rea requirements, proving obstruction charges against is likely to be very difficult.  The practical consequence in Haditha, like so many cases before, is that the enlisted soldiers are the only ones in the chain of command to face serious criminal liability.<br /><br />This double standard need not exist.  There is a well established doctrine of command responsibility under international law and the law of armed conflict which allows military leaders to face serious criminal sanctions if these leaders failed to prevent, stop, or punish war crimes that are committed by the forces under their command and control.  When it is established that military leaders failed in their duty to properly control their forces, these leaders can face the same criminal liability as their forces who actually committed the crimes.  <br /><br />This concept of command responsibility is nothing new.  In fact, it was due in large part to the efforts of the United States in the war crimes tribunals following World War II that the doctrine of command responsibility fully emerged as a basis of establishing criminal liability.  Since that time the United States has continued to be a proponent of this doctrine in the international context.  The doctrine has been codified in Articles 86 and 87 of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions.  A form of the doctrine has also been codified in the statutes authorizing the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), the International Criminal Court (ICC), and elsewhere.  <br /><br />Inexplicably, this doctrine has never been codified under U.S. domestic law.  Under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice the doctrine of command responsibility does not exist as a basis for holding commanders of our own forces criminally liable for their command failings.  One of the most well known prosecutions of a commander for his failings was the court-martial of Captain Ernest Medina following the Mai Lai massacre.  In that case prosecutors were repeatedly frustrated by the lack of a codified legal mechanism to hold Captain Medina accountable for his failings.  In the end, Captain Medina was acquitted of the charges against him.<br /><br />Nothing has changed in the UCMJ since the Vietnam era that would provide a better mechanism from holding military commanders criminally liable when their failings contribute to law of war violations committed by the forces under their command.  As a result, we continue to see the double standard in cases like Haditha.  <br /><br />This double standard has no place in our military system.  When only lower enlisted servicemembers face criminal liability for law of war violations, confidence and trust within the ranks and by the public at large suffers. In addition, the United States' stature on the world stage suffers when we apply one standard of command responsibility to the military leaders of other countries, but no similar standard to our own military leaders.  <br /><br />Congress has expressed an interest in the Haditha cases.  The Senate Armed Services Committee has requested copies of the investigations conducted on Haditha and the alleged cover-up by officers in the chain of command.  It is likely that Congress will conduct its own inquiry into these matters.  In doing so, Congress needs to look beyond the narrow facts of this case.  They need to ask broader questions.   Why does there exists such disparate treatment of enlisted servicemembers in comparison to the criminal liability faced by commanders?  What standards currently exist under the UCMJ to incorporate the doctrine of command responsibility?  Finally, Congress needs, at long last, to codify a standard of command responsibility under the UCMJ that ensures equal treatment of all our forces and shows to the world that we apply the same standards to our own military leaders that we apply to others.   <br /><br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps and currently teaches at New England School of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nimj.org/">Kathleen Duignan</a>, Executive Director of the National Institute of Military Justice, says that the Military Commissions Act of 2006 again puts US JAG officers in the awkward position of litigating the shortfalls of a military legal process that none of us would like to see our own service members tried under, and warrants amendment in the new Congress...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kathleenduigan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>fter the Supreme Court decided <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> in June 2006, academics, law of war experts, military justice practitioners, and everyday concerned citizens were eagerly awaiting Congressional action to cure the deficiencies in the previous system or sanction the use of courts-martial or civilian courts to try the fraction of those detained at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo awaiting trial.  Instead, Congress acted politically.  Instead of carefully deliberating and taking as much time as it needed to get the system right, Congress hastily created and passed The Military Commissions Act of 2006.  Now that this bill has been signed by the President, the United States will once again breathe life back into another new system of justice created for the sole purpose of trying 10 men who were charged under the original commission system, as well as 14 high-value detainees recently transferred to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo immediately before Congress was pressed into action, and perhaps a grand total of 80 detainees altogether.  <br /><br />An anonymous comment posted by a concerned reader of Professor Kermit Roosevelt's fine op-ed piece entitled <a href="/forumy/2006/10/why-guantanamo.php">Why Guantanamo</a>, published in JURIST on October 5, 2006, noted that "the U.S. deliberately selected Guantanamo as a prison site to evade U.S. law itself. . . and this clear intent needs to be kept in mind at all times." This is an insightful way to view the issue.  Ironically, instead of using time-tested processes that have worked in the past, there was a compelling need to rush into creating a new system that seemed designed solely for the purpose of offering apparent justice, but in reality has to date offered nothing more than a bare minimum of process.  Intent seems to be a good measure to evaluate our next steps in addressing the unresolved issue of how to apply the rule of law to alleged terrorists and co-conspirators worthy of facing criminal sanctions.<br /><br />Department of Defense Directive, 5525.1, "Status of Forces Policy and Information," sets minimum standards of justice for entry into Status of Forces Agreements with other nations and establishes DoD policy and procedures for trial of United States military personnel abroad by foreign courts and their treatment in foreign prisons.  Enclosure 2 of that directive lists fair trial guarantees the United States uses to evaluate other justice systems for fairness.  Some of the listed guarantees we look for are that the criminal statute violated must set forth specific and definite standards of guilt; the accused shall not be prosecuted under an <em>ex post facto</em> law; the accused is entitled to be present at the trial; the accused is entitled to be confronted with hostile witnesses; the accused is entitled to have compulsory process for obtaining favorable witnesses; the use of evidence obtained through illegal means is prohibited; the accused shall be protected from the use of a confession obtained by torture, threats, violence, or the exertion of any improper influence; the accused is entitled to be tried without unreasonable (prejudicial) delay; the accused is entitled to be tried by an impartial court; and the accused is entitled to a public trial."   This list is not exhaustive, but is used to guide the United States on whether our service personnel are subject to foreign jurisdiction.  The Golden Rule that we all learned as children would necessarily support the fact that we extend the same treatment to all those we detain and try in our systems, regardless of their alleged crimes, just as we expect in return.  Justice Brennan supports this notion of mutuality in his dissenting opinion in <em>United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez</em>, 494 U.S. 259 (1990) (Brennan, J., dissenting) "If we expect aliens to obey our laws, aliens should be able to expect that we will obey our Constitution when we investigate, prosecute, and punish them...Mutuality is essential to ensure the fundamental fairness that underlies our Bill of Rights."  <em>Verdugo-Urquidez</em>, 494 U.S. at 284.  "Mutuality also serves to inculcate the values of law and order. By respecting the rights of foreign nationals, we encourage other nations to respect the rights of our citizens.  Moreover, as our Nation becomes increasingly concerned about the domestic effects of international crime, we cannot forget that the behavior of our law enforcement agents abroad sends a powerful message about the rule of law to individuals everywhere."  <em>Verdugo-Urquidez</em>, 494 U.S. at 285.<br /><br />If these are the minimum standards we are willing to accept from other countries seeking to pass judgment on our service-members, does it not seem logical that we should then offer the same considerations in return to convince other nations that we are indeed a nation of laws and not of ideologues?  Otherwise, it begs the question of what form of democracy we are fighting to preserve and whether we are a nation that upholds the rule of law ourselves.<br /><br />Legislators and staff labored many long hours considering, drafting, and eventually passing the Military Commissions Act of 2006, but the question should not be what it provides, but why it is necessary.  Is it true that we now do not trust our established system of justice to hold accountable those pending trial at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay?  What was the intent in spending valuable Congressional resources and tax dollars (not including the $125 million that could potentially be spent to build courtroom facilities in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay) to create a new system from scratch, rather than either using the civilian courts that have been used to try the World Trade Center bombers of 1993 or our domestic terrorists, like Timothy McVeigh for his acts in the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City?  Another option would have been to mandate the use of  courts-martial as would be used under the Geneva Conventions in a traditional conflict with prisoners of war.  What differentiates these particular defendants in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, especially the low-level footmen, from other more culpable terrorists that we have already successfully prosecuted in civilian courts?  The conclusion the rest of the world sees is that the United States is not interested in true justice, but rather the appearance of justice.  This seems to be a true loss for the United States in its ability to wield moral authority, as well as for those who defend the rule of law in the United States, and especially for those who are proud to wear the uniform of our country. <br /><br />If we are to apply the war metaphor for our current conflict, then it needs to be applied consistently.  If terrorism is not merely criminal conduct, but has now risen to the definition of "war," then the laws of war need to be applied consistently.  This is now a "war" in which we have few allies and for which no end to hostilities is in sight.  If alleged terrorists (which might not necessarily apply to all those held at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo) are to be tried, there is no reason they cannot be tried as other criminal terrorists in existing federal courts, like Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 or Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman and nine others for the first attempt to blow up the World Trade Center in 1993.<br /><b
r />Or, if we stick with the war metaphor, then the prisoners are entitled to face general courts-martial under the laws of war and the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  Therefore, why have we hastily re-created another military commissions system to try these individuals five years after their initial capture?  The observant reader who commented on the earlier article got the answer right.  It all boils down to intent.  And the question is whether that intent is to paint a thin veneer of respectability on a new substandard system, or to do justice to those worthy of punishment while upholding a nation of laws, avoid complete alienation of our allies, and ensure continued protection by the Geneva Conventions for our men and women serving overseas. <br /><br />The National Institute of Military Justice (NIMJ) endeavored to provide sound recommendations to those in Congress who asked our advice.  Our proposed legislation would have made slight modifications to the procedures for general courts-martial that do not affect substantive fairness, but allow for deviation where good cause has been shown because the rules as they exist would be "impracticable."  This standard is taken straight from Article 36 (b) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  Unfortunately, Congress did not choose to start with general courts-martial rules as the norm and deviate only when using those rules would be "impracticable."  Instead, the only item Congress seems to have adopted from NIMJ's proposal was the name of the act, "The Military Commissions Act of 2006."  <br /><br />In an election year, development of a carefully crafted system fell by the wayside, leaving all of us to begin again &#8212; years after the initial processes started &#8212; with a repackaged version of the original commissions system that may not pass judicial muster.  To be sure, the Act incorporated some of the piecemeal improvements that have occurred during the last five years of this process, such as the right of appeal, the ability to attend one's own trial, the explicit exclusion of evidence derived by torture, and the right to self-representation.<br /><br />But any improvements are overshadowed by Congress' express desire to strip any ability to enforce these rights from detainees by prohibiting them access to federal courts.  And if the original Act stands, any meaningful check on abuses will have to wait for a time where the individual tried is convicted, appeals are filed with the interim Court of Military Commissions, which still falls under the control of the Department of Defense, and only then can the accused petition the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  By the time an individual accused reaches this point, he will have most likely already spent a decade incarcerated.  And only at this point will he be able to challenge his right to be tried in a system that appears to be pre-disposed toward conviction.<br /><br />Following the election, there have been several proposed amendments to the Military Commissions Act of 2006 introduced into Congress.  One that has received considerable attention was introduced by Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut.  His amendment would restore the ability to challenge detention using the rights available under habeas corpus as well as to send appeals to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, an already existing civilian court that is expert in military criminal matters.  This is a step in the right direction.<br /><br />Otherwise, if the system is implemented as it exists in the current Military Commissions Act, we will have once again missed an opportunity to get it right.  And our military JAG officers will once again be asked to make a half-baked system work.  If nothing else, our JAG officers will get plenty of practice in litigating the shortfalls of a system that none of us would like to see our service members tried under, and they may once again be seated at counsel's table in the Supreme Court of the United States.  As Humphrey Bogart proverbially said in a famous movie set in war-torn Europe and Morocco, "Play it again, Sam."<br />    <br /><br /><em>Kathleen A.

		<title>The Red Crystal: A New Universal Emblem for Humanitarian Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=54">Donna Arzt</a>, Director of the Center for Global Law and Practice at Syracuse University College of Law, says that the recent adoption by Geneva Convention states of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Crystal">Red Crystal</a> symbol to supplement the traditional Red Cross and Red Crescent is a landmark symbolic step reflecting the universal non-exclusionary character of international humanitarian law. ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/arztnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font> little-known development in international relations may turn out to be this past year's most symbolic if not most significant step forward in the decades-long impasse called the Arab-Israeli conflict. Last December, the signatory countries of the Geneva Convention adopted a new <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/615">Protocol III</a> concerning a new humanitarian emblem, the Red Crystal, joining the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems which purportedly represent the "humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence" of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement. The Protocol will enter into force in January 2007.<br /><br /> Prior to the Protocol, the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement was not a truly "universal" movement, at least in regard to the Israeli Red Shield of David disaster-aid society (or Magen David Adom), which was first chartered in 1929 and worked alongside other national Red Cross societies but was not permitted to fully join the international organization until this year. Its formal association allows the Palestinian Red Crescent Society to also join. This dual membership action encouraged the two to sign a formal operational agreement and both received crucial funding to assist in their life-saving work. Not surprisingly, the motion to accept the two into full membership was adopted in a vote after Arab and Muslim countries rejected all the compromise proposals aimed at reaching a consensus.<br /><br />  The Red Cross, a/k/a Geneva Convention, movement began its history in 1864 with, obviously, a single emblem, chosen for its simplicity and recognizability. The red cross &#8212; in those early days, often formed with two bloody bandages &#8212; on a white background was deliberately the reverse of the flag of Switzerland, itself neutral since 1815. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) claims that the red cross emblem is "sometimes wrongly perceived as having religious, cultural or political connotations." However, that is indeed the case because the Swiss flag had its origin in the flag of the 13th century German emperor, who always carried the cross as a holy sign, believing himself to be a protector of Christianity.<br /> <br /> Due also to the cross's association with the Crusades, it is understandable that Ottoman officials chose during the Crimean War to use, instead, a red crescent which later was officially adopted by the Red Cross movement &#8212; along with the now defunct Iranian red lion and sun &#8212; as a recognizable emblem. However, in order to avoid a proliferation of emblems, it limited the authorization to the countries that were already using the crescent, though that number eventually grew to 32. Thus developed the official reason that the Israeli Red Shield of David was repeatedly rejected for six decades: to avoid international proliferation. Yet a Jewish state would have similar reasons as Muslim states for refusing to carry the cross.<br /><br /> For the past year, any national symbol can be displayed inside the Red Crystal, which is more than just an additional protective emblem for humanitarian workers, free of any extraneous political or religious connotation.  (Eritrea, like Israel, uses the Crystal that way.) Unlike the Red Cross and the Red Crescent, the Crystal's origins are inclusive, not exclusionary.  It truly reflects the universal character of international humanitarian law. That effectively means that access to humanitarian assistance is universally available.<br /><br /> The addition also makes the movement truly neutral. Until now, a Muslim country such as Indonesia could turn down much-needed aid from Magen David Adom after the tsunami on the ostensible grounds that it was an unrecognized society. Concomitantly, Israelis and Magen David Adom supporters worried that denial for so many years meant that a political statement was being made. <br /><br /> Adoption of the new emblem can have many implications for the Arab-Israeli conflict. Realization by Israel that the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement is truly neutral might carry over to the United Nations, which heretofore in Israeli eyes has been tainted with anti-Israel bias. Cooperation between Magen David Adom and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society could pave the way for other forms of cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians. Finally, this resolution of the Shield of David saga could help Israelis to understand why its one million Arab citizens find the official symbols of their state &#8212; such as the flag, with its own Star of David, or the national symbol of a seven-stemmed Menorah &#8212; so alien.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Donna Arzt is Dean&#39;s Distinguished Research Scholar and Director of the Center for Global Law &amp; Practice at Syracuse University College of Law.

Pinochet, who had been the subject of criminal indictments at home, in Spain, and several other European states, died without facing criminal trial.  He did so on International Human Rights Day, an irony that has not gone without note.  Perhaps more important than the timing of his death, however, is the way in which it illustrates the mixed legacy of the so-called "Pinochet Precedent" or "Pinochet Effect". This mixed legacy can be seen, too, in the mixed response to his death in Chile.<br /><br />According to some human rights advocates, the "Pinochet Precedent" stands for the proposition that those who engage in serious violations of human rights, even current and former heads of state, cannot escape accountability somewhere, sometime, even if it is not feasible at home, now, for political reasons.  The most frequent mechanism cited is the exercise of universal jurisdiction, a principle of public international law also enshrined in some nations' legislation, that indicates that certain serious crimes, such as torture, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, are so serious that they may be prosecuted by any state.  A Spanish magistrate, Baltasar Garz&Atilde;&sup3;n, exercised the universal jurisdiction provision of the Spanish law on judicial power to indict Pinochet, and sought his extradition from the United Kingdom, where he was seeking medical treatment.  Human rights advocates celebrated this move as a great victory over impunity,  At last, they hoped, Pinochet would at last be held responsible for his crimes, which during his military rule from 1973 to 1990 caused the deaths or disappearances of over 3000 people, and the torture, detention, or exile of tens of thousands more.  Pinochet, who had granted himself an amnesty, and claimed immunity as a "Senator-for-Life", might face the justice he had eluded at home, in Madrid. UK judges rejected his claims of official immunity, rightly pointing out that he could not properly claim that torture was a protected official activity.<br /><br />As we know, however, while UK judges were prepared to extradite Pinochet, he was ultimately returned to Chile following a decision by the UK Home Secretary that he was too ill to face extradition and trial.  He was placed under house arrest, and successive legal decisions in Chile stripped Pinochet of his immunity, but due to ill health he never faced a trial. News reports have described him as having "cheated justice" by dying.  But that is to put too great an emphasis on nature and coincidence, and to miss the politics of international justice.<br /><br />For Pinochet is not the only high level official or ex-official to evade prosecution or accountability, whether through universal jurisdiction or civil accountability procedures, and this is no accident.  Legal immunities that attach to current state officials, and political fears and threats, mean that for the most part those who face accountability are not the "big fish" unless there has been a significant political change.  <br /><br />First, the legal immunities: the International Court of Justice, in the 2003 case <em>Democratic Republic of Congo v. Belgium</em>, ruled that a state could not pursue a case through the exercise of universal jurisdiction against a sitting foreign minister.  Such official immunities are well-enshrined in international law and practice, and may be necessary to ensure diplomatic engagement and exchange, but they also mean that those we might most want to prosecute now, those in the position to commit further crimes, are protected from prosecution by individual states exercising universal jurisdiction.<br /><br />Second, the political fears and threats: while independent prosecutors may seek to pursue cases, state officials may seek to constrain them, other states may threaten retaliation, or prosecutors may choose not to exercise their powers.  In each case, legal possibility is limited by political reality.  In Spain, for example, the ministry of foreign affairs indicated its strong opposition to the pursuit of Pinochet.  When cases were filed in Belgian courts against, among others, US General Tommy Franks for alleged crimes arising out of the second US war in Iraq, and against sitting Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for alleged massacres at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps in 1982, US pressure (including threats to compel the removal of NATO headquarters from Brussels) forced drastic changes in Belgium's universal jurisdiction legislation.  And in Germany, a complaint filed against then-US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in 2004 for alleged crimes arising from the second war in Iraq was not pursued by state prosecutors.  The complaint was re-filed after Rumsfeld announced his resignation, and it remains to be seen whether prosecutors will now choose to charge Rumsfeld with the crimes alleged.<br /><br />In fact, the only cases of prosecution of higher-level perpetrators through the exercise of universal jurisdiction (or, arguably, in international criminal courts) have occurred where the state affected by the crimes does not object.  In the instances of Adolfo Scilingo, and Ricardo Cavallo, former Argentine military officers accused of human rights abuses during that country's "Dirty War" of 1976-83, cases went forward in Spain with the blessing of Argentinean President Nestor Kirchner.  Kirchner even requested, successfully, that Mexico, where Cavallo was residing, extradite him to Spain.  Scilingo was sentenced to  640 years imprisonment for crimes against humanity, and Cavallo faces charges that could total 17,000 years.<br /><br />The "Pinochet Precedent", and indeed the legacy of Pinochet, is a mixed one.  While thousands of demonstrators went into the streets of Santiago to celebrate his death after it was announced, they clashed with police, and their jubilation was somewhat undermined by hundreds of mourners. Pinochet&#39;s demise may be seen as an escape from justice, or as the ultimate, final, justice for his victims and their families.  But it should be a stark reminder that the "Pinochet Precedent" has not been an unqualified victory for human rights. Indeed, it demonstrates the degree to which the powerful can retain impunity to the end.<br /><br /><br /><em>Chandra Lekha Sriram is Professor of Human Rights and Director of the Centre on Human Rights in Conflict at the University of East London.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=35">Nancy Rapoport</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that new instructions to federal prosecutors not to demand privileged documents as a means of inducing corporate co-operation with investigations may help preserve useful corporate structures while recognizing that threats of wholesale corporate prosecutions may not prevent wrongdoing by corporate officers...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/nancyrapoportnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>D</strong></font>eputy Attorney General Paul McNulty has instructed U.S. Attorneys and other DOJ staff to cease using some of the strong-arm tactics that have caused such a fuss with corporations accused of wrongdoing.  Instead of using the production of privileged documents as leverage &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; "give us the documents and maybe we won't indict the whole corporation" &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the Office of the AG has decided to play by the same rules that other litigants must follow.  Imagine our relief.<br /><br /> This is, of course, the same Office of the AG that told corporations not to pay the attorneys' fees for their employees if the corporations wanted to "cooperate" with the DOJ's investigation.  (In non-DOJ terms, the technical term for that instruction would be "intentional interference with a contractual obligation.")  Now the McNulty memorandum has backed off the use of that tactic as well.  Another way to put the McNulty Memo in perspective is to say that the government can't use dirty tricks to get to the facts about what a corporation did or didn't do.  <br /><br /> Don't get me wrong:  I'm all for finding out about corporate wrongdoing and prosecuting the offenders.  I find it appalling that, less than five years after the Enron-WorldCom-Global Crossings-Tyco-Adelphia-Parmalat-Royal Ahold-etc. scandals, we have to remind executives that backdating stock options is A Bad Thing.  We can't always rely on the research of "intrepid academic[s]" to ferret out the newest dirty tricks of officers and directors.  (FORTUNE MAGAZINE used that phrase in writing about University of Iowa Professor Erik Lie's research on the backdating of stock options.  See Geoffrey Colvin, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/26/magazines/fortune/colvin_fortune_0612/">A Study in CEO Greed: How one intrepid academic exposed the latest stock option scandal</a>, May 30, 2006. The government does need to investigate alleged wrongdoing.  <br /><br /> But why was the DOJ engaging in those types of pressure tactics in the first place?  Is it truly important to society to indict entire corporations?  (Just ask dear, departed Arthur Andersen how it feels to be vindicated by the U.S. Supreme Court.)  Is wiping out jobs for the many honest employees of a crooked company better for our economy?  There were good people at Arthur Andersen.  There were even good people at Enron, although Enron still sets the standard for corrupt companies.  Enron, now just a shadow of its former ("real asset") self, has good people on its payroll.  Do we want the government threatening to shut down an entire organization to shake the few bad apples off the tree?<br /><br /> What makes the McNulty Memo even more welcome is something that the DOJ doesn't want to admit:  those people clever enough to conceive of new ways to cheat investors aren't going to be deterred by wholescale prosecution of corporations anyway.  I don't think that any punishment is going to deter them.  The next Skillings-in-waiting aren't reading about Bernie Ebbers's drive to prison (in his Mercedes, no less) and thinking that they should cancel their plans to raid the corporate coffers.  They're thinking that they're smarter than Bernie, and Jeffrey, and Andy Fastow, and all the rest of the ones who got caught.  No bullying tactics by the government will change the calculus of hubris that these evil geniuses cook up.  The Office of the AG has figured out that there are easier, and fairer, ways to get at the information that it needs.  Score one for justice &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; this time.<br /><br /><br /><em>Nancy B.

This means that every person who participates in this trial and who did not try to stop it from being unfair is liable to prosecution for war crimes. These accomplices might also ponder the consequences of the United States&#39; example in this case. The United States has said to the rest of world that it will not respect the law and nobody can make it do so by using peaceful legal means.<br /><br />This is the type of world that American President George  W. Bush is promoting: one in which victims of American aggression must depend on using all necessary means--including violence--to respond to America&#39;s violations of international law because the United States is blind to the scales of law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/bransond.php">Douglas Branson</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that the latest US corporate scandal involves disclosures of backdated stock options upping the already-disproportionate compensation of CEOs and other senior managers, with criminal charges being laid against five corporate executives so far...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/douglasbranson.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font> November 17, 2006 <em>Wall Street Journal</em> headline reads "Backdated Options Pad CEO Pay By Average of 10%."  Daily, stories like this appear in the <em>Journal</em> and the business sections of newspapers.  Most recently, Corinthian College, Inc., the for-profit education provider, announced that the company had backdated 4 sets of option grants in 2001 and 2002, at least one set to reap further gain out of the stock market slide after September 11, 2001.  CEOs of many major corporations such as Corinthian have fallen from grace, in this our latest corporate scandal.<br /><br /> In 1990, the average Japanese Chief Executive Officer (CEO) made 16 times, and the average German CEO 21 times, what the average worker made in the CEOs' corporations.  Graef Crystal, a famous compensation consultant, found the ratio in the U.S. to be 150.  In 1991 he published <em>In Search of Excess</em>, a parody of a well know management tome of the time, <em>In Search of Excellence</em>.<br /><br /> Today the U.S. ratio is over 500 and heading north, as they say.  Some peg the number at around 535.  The average U.S. CEO made $14 million in compensation in 2005.  As an expense item, compensation to senior management reduced corporate profits by over ten percent last year.  In 1998, CEO Michael Eisner took home $585 million form the Walt Disney Company.  In 2002, CEO and founder Larry Ellison took home $735 million from Oracle, Inc., mostly from exercise of stock options and sale of the stock.  Across the board, the stock options "overhang" (options granted but not yet exercised by senior executives) is said to be equivalent to 14% of shares outstanding.<br /><br /> As if those numbers did not speak loudly enough, Corporate America has recently had to bare - or bear - yet another scandal, involving stock option grants to senior managers, mostly CEOs.  So far, beginning with Summer 2006, over 130 public corporations, Corinthian included, have confessed to backdating stock option grants so as to increase the "take" by upper echelons of management.  A subset of corporations admits to having "spring loaded options," timing grants of options to just before corporate announcement of material favorable developments, likely to spike the price further.  So far prosecutors have brought criminal charges against 5 corporate executives.  The average take is estimated at $1.3 million to $1.7 million per grant manipulation.<br /><br /> As the principal element of long term compensation for their executives, corporations grant options to purchase the corporation's stock (salary as the short term and annual bonus as the medium term currently are the two other principal elements of executive compensation).  The price at which the options are exercisable (the "strike price") has to be at or near the current market price.  In such a case (the vast majority of cases), the option is thus "qualified," meaning that, although the executive has received an element of compensation at the time of receipt, any income and payment of income tax is deferred to the date of sale in the stock market (following exercise).  The executive's contract may vest options only over several years (say, 200,000 per year over 5 years, beginning with the first anniversary of employment) and contain performance hurdles as well (for example, increase in sales, increase in profits, etc.)<br /><br /> So if the executive has 100,000 options, with the a strike price at $20, and two years out the stock price has reached $40, she might exercise them.  She pays $2 million, receives the shares, sells them in the market for $4 million, and pockets $2 million. The $2 million is a longer term reward for a job well done, or a rising stock market, or both.<br /><br /> As if that were not enough, a number of large corporations have come forward to reveal that they could not resist "gaming the system."  As noted, corporations backdated the options to a date when the market price, and therefore the strike price, was even lower, say, $10 in our example.  Now the executive has a gain of $3 million rather than $2.  One feels that CEOs, or advocates on their behalf, have played a role in all of this.<br /><br /> The consequences due to the discovery of backdating can be devastating.  One large publicly held company announced that is will have to go back 10 years, restating financials for each of those years.  It has also fired its chief financial officer (CFO) and its chief legal officer (CLO), presumably for not detecting the offenses.  One suspects that there is a degree of corporate scapegoating going on.  Fifty corporate executives, not all CEOs, have lost their jobs.  Based up last year's numbers (1,195 restatements, an all time high), option grant monkey business will account for 11 percent of 2006&#39;s restatements.<br /><br /> Needless to say, CEOs who benefitted from backdating and spring loading have been forced into resignation.  Moreover, because financial statements have to be restated, and restatement is due to "misconduct," under the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley legislation the CEO and the CFO, whether or not implicated in the wrongdoing, have to forfeit all incentive based compensation (options proceeds, bonuses, etc.) for the past year.<br /><br /> What a fine mess all of this is, as Stan would say to Ollie.  But options have been a little understood phenomenon for many decades.  Many onlookers believe that options are an unalloyed good as they result in larger stock holdings by corporate managers, aligning the executives' interests more closely with those of owners (viz., other shareholders).  The foregoing may be true, especially in areas such as high tech and information technology in which, needing cash to develop ideas and products, corporations have substituted generous option grants for cash salary and bonuses.  Experience shows that high tech entrepreneurs, such as the founders of Google, put less value on immediate cash compensation, compared to main stream corporate executives.  Many keep their shares.<br /><br /> With most U.S. corporations, however, the popular belief does not accord with senior executives' practices at all.  Options and the stock obtained by exercising them do not tie managers to companies, or align their interests with those of other owners, for the simple reason that common practice is to sell the shares in the stock market right away.  To take the example above, the executive would first borrow the $2 million exercise price from her bank, which puts some pressure on her to re-pay the loan.  If she then sells the 1000,000 shares obtained, she will receive $4 million, enabling her to re-pay the loan and related transaction costs of, say, $2.1 million.  She also must make income tax payments of, say, 35 % of the gain, or $700,000, more or less.  She then spends the $1.2 million obtained on re-modeling the kitchen (which will cost more than the house originally did) and purchasing new Mercedes Benzs for her and her spouse.<br /><br /> This usual scenario may be subject to further abuse.  At Enron, CEO Ken Lay made $200 million exercising options without ever going to the bank.  He received his loans from the Enron treasury, also known as &quot;Ken Lay's ATM.&quot;  He repaid the loans with Enron stock, thus enabling him to delay for up to 12 months disclosure of his exercise of options.<br /><br /> Palliatives suggested have include
d imposition of a holding period.  The executive would have to hold shares received pursuant to the exercise of options for 1 year prior to selling.  Another palliative long suggested has become <em>de rigeur</em>.  Accounting principles now require corporations to expense (count as a cost) the cost of options at the time the corporation grants them.  Using the &quot;Black-Scholes,&quot; the aptly named &quot;Monte Carlo,&quot; or other formulae, the corporation can guesstimate the options' value, usually at 15-20 % of the stock's market price.  Generous use of options, and the according deductions, can result in a reduction in profits, especially for high tech and Silicon Valley enterprises who have historically used many options.  Now that corporations must make a deduction the number of options granted has declined moderately.<br /><br /> Of course, the real cost to the corporation of stock options comes at exercise, not when they are granted.  Instead of selling the shares in the market for cash, the corporation must give them to the executive who has exercised options.  The difference (the market price foregone less strike price received) is a very real opportunity cost for corporations.  The momentum, and the adoption of a governing accounting principle, however, opts for expensing options at the time issuing corporations grant them, ending any debate for now.<br /><br /> In registering option grants, U.S. corporations have always had a number of choices.  They could list grants chronologically: last to first, or first to last.  Or they could list them by size of grant: smallest to largest, or largest to smallest.  Now, or so the events of the last several months reveals, they can list them by legality: illegal to legal, or legal to illegal.<br /><br /><br /><em>Douglas M. Branson holds the W.
