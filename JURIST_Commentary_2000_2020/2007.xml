		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don Gorton, Esq. [writer for <em>Gay and Lesbian Review/Worldwide</em>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/massachusetts-lawmakers-push-same-sex.php">political victory achieved</a> by opponents of same-sex marriage in the January 2, 2007 Massachusetts Constitutional Convention (both houses of the legislature sitting jointly) stemmed largely from dicta from the Supreme Judicial Court in a case in which the justices admittedly lacked jurisdiction. The Court, in a suit initiated by former Governor Mitt Romney, held that it lacked authority to force legislators to vote on the merits of a proposed ban on same-sex marriage, as opposed to a dispositive procedural motion, as had occurred on November 9, 2006. Unusually given the Court&#39;s lack of authority, they suggested in dicta that the legislature had a &quot;duty&quot; to vote up or down on the amendment. (A vote of 1/4 + 1 would suffice to advance the amendment in a substantive vote, while procedural questions are usually decided by simple majority.)<br /> <br />Although the Court&#39;s dicta lacked legal effect, they proved politically potent in swaying the legislators. Little attention was given to the fact that the &quot;duty&quot; was a non-justiciable political question the Justices said only the electorate could enforce. Opponents of same-sex marriage seized on the Court&#39;s rhetorical notion of &quot;duty&quot; to lobby swing lawmakers to take an up or down vote. The lobbying pitch proved highly persuasive, more so than anything the anti-gay forces had mustered to date.<br /> <br />The emptiness of the Court&#39;s advice as it dismissed Romney&#39;s case was forcefully illustrated by the fact that the legislature, shortly after taking up the gay marriage ban, refused to consider the merits of a health care initiative petition. The previous Constitutional Convention had sent the health care proposal to a study committee. Notwithstanding the Court&#39;s clear direction that a disposition on grounds of procedure was inappropriate, the presiding officer required a 2/3 vote of the body for the health care petition to be eligible for consideration on its merits. Slightly less than a majority of the legislators voted to discharge the petition from committee, though the proposal clearly had sufficient support to advance to the ballot if an up or down vote were taken.<br /> <br />In the wake of the Court&#39;s political commentary, and the selective reliance on those dicta to take a vote on the gay marriage ban only, observers of the process spoke of a &quot;gay exception&quot; to the rule that the legislature has plenary authority to dispose of initiative petitions as it will. Consider that the gay marriage amendment advanced on a vote of 62-134 against, while the health care amendment was defeated just a few votes shy of achieving a majority. It was this &quot;gay exception&quot; that the former Governor hailed as a victory for &quot;the people of Massachusetts.&quot; More precisely, it was a victory for Romney&#39;s political ambitions: he has sought to parlay fulsome opposition to same-sex marriage into support from social conservatives for his presidential bid. That the Court and the Democratic legislators contrived to give him this political victory is remarkable.&quot;<br />

		<title>Ex-Iraqi VP Taha Ramadan should be freed or retried</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/"><strong>Giovanni Di Stefano</strong></a> [Studio Legale Internazionale, Rome]: &quot;In the first proper legal ruling of the Iraqi High Tribunal the Court has decided to <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/iraqi-tribunal-delays-re-sentencing.php">adjourn the case</a> of my client Taha Ramadan not only based upon the submissions filed but because as a matter of law no defence lawyer had &#39;legally&#39; been notified of the hearing. Under normal circumstances and as we have seen in the Saddam Hussein, Barzan Al Tikriti and Awwad Al Bandar cases the IHT takes no notice whatsoever of their own Rules of Procedure. But the public outcry advanced by those such as myself at political, judicial and legal levels have created a wind of change that - although it comes too late for Saddam, Barzan and Awwad - may just save others. <br /><br />The question of notification is a fundamentally important factor in the legal process in any jurisdiction. Cases succeed based upon the failure to &#39;notify&#39; judgements, decisions, sentences, defendants, lawyers. One of the submissions that I had made to the IHT in the case of Barzan Al Tikriti and Awaad Al Bandar was that they had NEVER been legally notified of the Appeal Chamber decision dated 26 December 2006 rejecting their appeal. Thus in my submission since they had never been notified, Para. 266 of the Law on Criminal Proceedings 1971 could not &#39;kick in&#39; and as such the 30 day period stipulated for any appeal only started when legal notification had occurred. The Iraqi Government hung my clients the day after I lodged the said submissions and the application to President Talabani for commutation of sentence. The deaths of Saddam Hussein, Barzan Al Tikriti, and Judge Awwad Al Bandar may thus not have been wholly in vain. <br /><br />The IHT has ruled that since the defence lawyers were not &#39;notified&#39; legally of any hearing then the proceedings could and should not commence. They have also received my submissions and will no doubt have to try and find a way of answering what is clear, precise and plain law. In the meantime, Taha Ramadan lives on and if there is to be any hearing on 12th February 2007 I will be present, but at that time my submission will be quite simple - the time period for any further re-hearings has expired and any Court would not be properly constituted thus making any decisions ultra vires. The dilemma will then be whether Taha Ramadan should be freed or retried.&quot;<br /><br /><em>Giovanni Di Stefano is a lawyer with Studio Legale Internazionale in Rome, Italy, and represents Taha Ramadan.  He previously represented Barzan Al Tikriti, Awwad Al Bandar, and Saddam Hussein.</em><br />

It is bad enough that they have consistently flouted the Supreme Court&#39;s 2004 ruling that the detainees are entitled to habeas corpus.  Now they are attempting to prevent the detainees from having legal counsel at all.  It is truly incredible that Stimson, an attorney himself, does not appear to understand or care about the fundamental obligation of lawyers to represent unpopular and indigent clients.<br /><br />We and the other habeas counsel are very proud of the work we are doing on behalf of the Guantanamo detainees, and we are confident that the vast majority of our corporate clients feel the same way.  The true &quot;news story&quot; here is not that prominent law firms are trying to get the detainees a fair hearing but that the Bush Administration is trying to deny them one.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com"><strong>Giovanni Di Stefano</strong></a> [Studio Legale Internazionale, Rome]: &quot;On the 3rd January 2007 I saw both Judge Al Bandar and Barzan Al Tikriti at Camp Cropper. On the 5th January 2007 I duly presented to the Iraqi High Tribunal a motion in accordance with para. 266 of the Law on Criminal Proceedings With Amendments Number 23 of 1971 which precludes any execution until 30 days after the notification of the Appeal Court which occurred on 26th December 2006. On the 12th January 2007 I saw both Al Tikriti and Judge Al Bandar at Camp Cropper and right up to 5pm on the 14th January 2007 it was more than clear that no executions would occur until at least 25th January 2007. <br /><br />Mr Al Tikriti gave to me a letter for the UN Secretary General which I have in my hand and which I am authorized to disclose to the public by Mr Al Tikriti. Further, both men authorised me to make an application in accordance with para. 288 of the Law on Criminal Proceedings which gives President Jalal Talabani the right to commute a sentence. That was deposited with the office of the President yesterday and a copy in my hands. At 6pm I spoke with the US Military and made clear that if there was to be any execution I wanted to exercise my rights - as requested by my clients - to be present. It was unlikely there would be any executions until the 30 days had passed, was the information given to me. <br /><br />At 4am this morning my clients were executed after I had returned to Rome. Since the executions were carried during a period that (a) was pending a decision from President Talabani whether to commute or not and (b) during the 30 days period in accordance with para. 266  and (c) not in my presence the said executions are deemed an act of murder. It is for these reasons that I have requested the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into the events against Maliki personally and members of the Iraqi Government that authorised the said executions during the said period. <br /><br />The view shared by my clients at our meeting on the 12th January 2007 (Barzan Al Tikriti) are that Saddam Hussein was executed also during an unlawful period because the Iraqi Government did not wish him to continue in the ongoing Anfal Trial since it was a defense strategy to name all the foreign firms (known to me) who participated in the supply of chemical agents and the countries that financed such and that Barzan Al Tikriti feared he would be executed because during the period he was the Iraqi UN Ambassador in Geneva and knew the said events and that Judge Awwad Al Bandar would be executed solely for the purpose of credibility making the said executions seem judicial. <br /><br />I have in my possession the letter written by Al Tikriti to the UN Secretary General and will make it public as instructed. I will co-operate as will my colleague Issam Ghazzawi with notes and documents assisting the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in his investigation into the crimes of murder by the Maliki Government similar to the allegations faced by Saddam Hussein, Barzan Al Tikriti and Awwad Al Bandar. My colleague lawyer Badar Al Bandar the son of Judge Awwad Al Bandar has collected his father&#39;s body.&Acirc;&nbsp;&quot;<br /><br /><em>Giovanni Di Stefano is an international lawyer with Studio Legale Internazionale in Rome, Italy, and represented Barzan Al Tikriti and Awwad Al Bandar.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://doebbler.net/default.aspx"><strong>Curtis Doebbler</strong></a> [defense lawyer and former Saddam Hussein defense counsel]: &quot;The United States and Iraqi government carried out the summary, arbitrary and extra-judicial executions of Mr. Barzan al-Tikriti and Judge Awad Hamad al-Bandar. The executions were carried out in violations of international law and constitute a violation of the right to life and a war crime under international law because they were carried out after a trial that every independent expert that examined it called an unfair trial. On 1 September 2006, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions, who had examined the trial for two years gave a final opinion calling the trial unfair and a violation of international law. <br /><br />If the international community is to restore confidence in the rule of law in Iraq it must prosecute the individual responsible for the international crime of aggression against the Iraqi people and those who participated in providing the defendants in the Dujail trial an intentionally unfair trial. Only by calling for such prosecutions and ensuring they take place can the international community begin to restore trust in the rule of law. Failure to do so will send a clear message to vulnerable people everywhere who have been subjected to United States&#39; aggression that they cannot depend on the rule of law to stop the United States and its collaborators from violating their most basic human rights and require these people to take the law into their own hands and take all necessary measures to end these illegal actions.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm"><strong>Ben Davis</strong></a> [University of Toledo College of Law]: &quot;Charles &#39;Cully&#39; Stimson has had a hard week.  On January 11, 2007 he made shocking comments on the pro bono lawyers who are working on behalf of Gitmo detainees, calling for  corporate CEOs to blacklist the firms at which these lawyers work.  As we all saw, an uproar ensued and today he has made an apology.  All is fine, right?  Wrong.<br /> <br />As was noted to me by several colleagues, Mr. Stimson&#39;s apology merely apologizes for the aspersions made on the ethics of the Gitmo detainee lawyers.  It is not possible of course to hold the beliefs he said on January 11 and the beliefs he said in his apology today.  That duality is simply untenable.  Of most importance, however, is that today he does not apologize for calling for a blacklist by CEO&#39;s of the law firms which employ many of these individuals.  So, as it stands today, the call for a blacklisting and a boycott remains and it does not appear that all the aspersions (who is paying the lawyers) have been completely removed either (as another colleague has noted).  What remains therefore is a slur on these lawfirms and their lawyers.<br /> <br />We should understand that the hand of government intimidation has not been stayed by his apology.  Rather, the intimidation has become more indirect and insidious.  Having seen many of these passive-aggressive actions over the years, I never believe they are innocent.  Several years ago I noted in a Texas senatorial campaign that an operative made a blatant racist appeal as part of seeking to grab the white vote.  The senatorial candidate (Cornyn) disavowed the racist appeal and fired the worker.  To the more cynical it appeared that the worker had done his job for the candidate - he had pandered to a percentage of the electorate to tell them that the candidate was &quot;one of them&quot; so as to push more voters into the candidate&#39;s column.  In the Corker-Ford senatorial race in Tennessee this past fall, this was precisely the type of tactic done with the ad (the &quot;nude&quot; white woman but also the white man in blackface presented as a hunter) there - though the disavowal was different in that the candidate said he was &quot;powerless&quot; to do anything about it.  Of course, that changed quickly.  But, the message was sent to encourage the atavistic to vote Corker.<br /> <br />Not to sully Cully, but it seems to me that the message to the CEO&#39;s has been passed and not retracted.  All that is needed now are the phone calls of pressure and the deed is done - unseen and deniable.  This machination needs to be stopped immediately and the means to do that is to have Cully be fired or invited to resign.  Government intimidation of the legal profession is serious stuff in any democracy and it is prudent to protect against that in the most vigorous manner.<br /> <br />It is of some irony that the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Detainee Affairs  appears to be a descendant of Henry Stimson, Secretary of War for FDR.  Stimson was the Secretary of War at the time of the Nazi saboteurs case that became the subject of the Supreme Court decision In Re Quirin.  From a read of Louis Fisher&#39;s <em>Military Tribunals and Presidential Powers</em> it appears that the procedure for that military tribunal was suspect - much like the criticisms of the Presidential Military Order Commissions or those that are coming out of the Military Commission Act.  While dealing with detainees appears to be becoming a family business for the Stimsons as their form of national service (for which we all should be grateful), we must not let their zeal to please overshadow the terrible error made by Mr. Stimson on January 11, 2007 and left standing today.  <br /> <br />The world has changed enough since 1942 that even a Good Shepherd like Stimson can be invited to resign.  And the honorable thing in my humble opinion would thus be for Mr. Stimson to resign or for Secretary Gates to fire him.  I do not fear for his ability to get commensurate work somewhere else.&quot;<br />

		<title>Absolute disregard for law: liquidating the Russian Chechen Friendship Society</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.uic.nnov.ru/"><strong>Oksana Chelysheva</strong></a> [Deputy executive director, Russian-Chechen Frienship Society]: &quot;On 23 January 2007 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/russia-supreme-court-uphold-shutdown.php">upheld the decision</a> of the Regional Court of the Russian Federation to liquidate our organization, the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society. <br /><br />We were originally ordered to close down in October last year on the basis of a new NGO and anti-extremism law that made it illegal for an NGO to be headed by a person convicted of &quot;extremist&quot; activities. The Russian authorities wanted us to denounce the acts of our chair Stanislaw Dmitirevskiy and to remove him from our board. Furthermore, they expected us to announce this big news about our act of repudiation from our friend and colleague in public. It would have been dishonorable for us. Neither people in Nizhny Novgorod nor in the North Caucasus permitted such a disgraceful option of saving our bacon by sacrificing our friend. <br /><br />The proceedings at the Supreme Court were observed by representatives of the European Commission Delegation as well as embassies of the USA, Germany, Austria, Portugal, Lithuania, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Representatives of the Amnesty International and Human Rights watch also attended the court session. There were also observers from Russian human rights organizations, including Memorial human rights center, Civic Assistance Committee and For Civic Assistance Foundation. There were several journalists working for foreign media outlets as well as for &quot;Echo of Moscow&quot; radio. All of them became witnesses of absolute disregard to the law. <br /><br />Although we have expected this outcome, the undisguised farce of &quot;considering&quot; the appeal at the Supreme Court that the Russian authorities didn&#39;t hesitate to organize in presence of international observers was absolutely shocking. Although we did our utmost to prevent Russia from losing its face once again at the world scene, no miracle is possible under the current circumstances in Russia. We, the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society, have been liquidated as a Russia-based organization. Thus, the Russian authorities have proved once again that they remain absolutely indifferent to all voices of protest, regardless of what countries people who speak up in defense of liberal values and democracy come from or what is their level of recognition in the world community. <br /><br />We have been supported by more than hundred public figures from some twenty countries, including Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, France, Slovakia, Serbia, Montenegro, Estonia, Czechia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Norway, Ukraine, Turkey, Mexico, Belgium, Brazil, Finland, Portugal, Georgia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, the USA, Canada, Malaysia, Philippines, Syria, Zimbabwe. More than one hundred Russian human rights people and journalists have signed their Open Letter to President Putin in support of our organization. <br /><br />It is evident that the so-called positive image of Russia is also of no concern for the present Kremlin authorities. They keep complaining about somebody&#39;s evil intention to discredit them in the eyes of their free world counterparts when murders of dissident politicians and journalists in the contemporary Russia are raised at the international fora from time to time. They have got used to avoiding answering unsuitable questions about Chechnya for so long that now they feel free to mockingly neglect them. There has been no other response from the Russian authorities to the claim of the international public figures to the murder of Politkovskaya but mere words about continuing investigation. The Russian authorities have responded to the concerns expressed about the ruling to liquidate the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society on absurd extremist charges with the final decision to crack down on us.  <br /><br />The court session held at the Supreme Court yesterday was a farce. Firstly, the hearing was postponed until late afternoon without warning. It was an obvious attempt to get rid of observers but all of them were at the door of the Supreme Court at 3 pm. Then officers of justice claimed that there was not enough room for all the observers in a tiny court room where the hearing was organized. However, it turned out that they had deliberately brought a group of people who just occupied the seats in an attempt not to let observers attend the trial. When those people were asked what organization they represented, they mockingly responded, &quot;No organization. We are just public&quot;. Later two of those people confessed that some of them were students of the Law Academy and that they had been ordered to stay in the court room. <br /><br />All the arguments of the defense side presented by our lawyer Anna Stavitskaya and Stanislaw Dmitrievskiy were ignored by the judges whereas the prosecutor&#39;s side didn&#39;t offer any grounded proofs of extremism in actions of Stanislaw Dmitrievskiy in his positions of the chief editor of the newspaper and the executive director of the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society. <br /><br />The liquidation ruling came into force immediately after the judge had read it out. At present, the inter-regional public association Russian-Chechen Friendship Society has stopped their activities as a Russian legal entity. However, it doesn&#39;t mean that we, members of the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society, have ceased our work. Due to the circumstances, we have moved the legal entity to Finland. The Russian-Chechen Friendship Society in Europe has been registered there with Stanislaw Dmitrievskiy, Oksana Chelysheva and Tatiana Banina being board members. We have Nizhny Novgorod Foundation for Promoting Tolerance established in Nizhny Novgorod and another regional Tolerance association was registered in Chechnya a few days ago. We are continuing our projects &#8212; informational, humanitarian and the legal project on the tribunal - in spite of our innumerous problems. <br /><br />We are definitely going to appeal to the European Court on Human Rights in the liquidation ruling as we deal with obvious violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention.&quot;<br />

		<title>The Responsibility to Protect in Iraq: Re-deploying to Save Lives</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/profiles/DavidScheffer/">David Scheffer</a>, former US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues (1997-2001), now at Northwestern University School of Law, says that a US troop surge in Iraq could provoke the very atrocities its supporters claim it would prevent, and that a better strategy for saving the lives of Iraqis and Americans alike would be re-deployment of US forces to fortified positions outside urban areas where they could stand poised to intervene if Iraq descends into genocide, crimes against humanity, or unremitting war crimes...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidscheffernew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2 alt="photo by Jim Ziv"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he latest version of scare rhetoric on Iraq raises the specter of mass atrocities unless the Bush administration's "surge" of 21,500 more American forces into Iraq is completed.   President George W. Bush has warned, "To step back now would&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;result in mass killings on an unimaginable scale."  Senator Joe Lieberman has predicted "ethnic cleansing on an enormous scale."  Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, the new American commander in Iraq, testified before the Senate about the likelihood of increased ethnic cleansing if Bush's plan did not go forward. <br /> <br />Sound familiar?  In 2002 and early 2003 it was the prospect of Iraqi use of weapons of mass destruction, which we were told existed, along with mushroom clouds that were used to justify Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Now dire predictions of larger atrocities are being used in ways similar to the earlier fiasco that started the whole mess.   You might even imagine the Bush administration explicitly advocating, as the primary rationale for an immediate and escalated American engagement in the widening Iraqi civil war, an emerging international legal principle: the "responsibility to protect."  <br /> <br />After watering down the "R2P" principle, the United States joined in the United Nations General Assembly's endorsement of the principle on 16 September 2005 in the World Summit Outcome.  That document declared that "[e]ach individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity" and that the international community has a heavily qualified responsibility to intervene to save civilian populations if national authorities fail to do so. <br /><br /> Iraq indeed is already daily consumed by violent attacks on significant numbers of civilians.  This time, however, while we must take dire warnings of even larger atrocities seriously, U.S. policy-makers should craft a policy that prioritizes saving human life immediately, both among American soldiers deployed in Iraq and among civilians.  One assumes that the Bush administration has chosen to plunge headfirst into the civil war to achieve this objective.  An alternative would be to step back, with the clear long-term objective of exercising the responsibility to protect collectively with other nations if Iraq descends into genocide, crimes against humanity, or unremitting war crimes.  But a civil war absent unabated atrocity crimes against the civilian population or combatants is not our fight, at least not until the US Congress so declares.<br /> <br /> During the final two years of the Clinton administration I led the Atrocities Prevention Inter-Agency Working Group.  We met regularly to identify, analyze, and seek means to prevent atrocities that appeared possible, if not probable, within the next six or so months.  While our work informed senior leaders of likely scenarios of doom, we always confronted the obstructionist realities of the Washington bureaucracy and sovereign foreign governments in prioritizing the plight of civilian populations.<br />  <br /> The same would be true today, although the future arrived long ago.  If I could subject the Iraq imbroglio to the virtual scrutiny of that working group, which was disbanded in 2001, we would recognize that the civilian death count from violence now rates Iraq as an atrocity zone.  Estimates range between 12,000 and nearly 35,000 civilian deaths during 2006 alone, with countless more wounded. <br />  <br /> If the American escalation in Iraq works, and civilian deaths decline significantly and remain low, then a major priority will have been achieved, albeit at the probable cost of increased American casualties.  But from all that has been said by seasoned analysts, Members of Congress, and apparently from within the Pentagon itself, the odds of such "success" are so problematic as to constitute a dangerous gamble rather than a credible policy.   The prospect of an escalated American engagement triggering far more significant casualty counts appears more likely.<br /><br /> Unless the purpose of American forces in Iraq is to fight a civil war and choose sides on any particular day between Sunni and Shiite in the neighborhoods of Baghdad or other cities by seizing and holding them with the zeal of born-again occupiers, then we must focus on what can be done to save as many civilians (and GIs) as possible in real time.<br /><br /> Military commanders who are experts on the tactics of military deployments look to America's political leadership to establish a credible strategic imperative to guide future engagement in Iraq.  Let us provide them with one &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; to prevent atrocity crimes from engulfing the Iraqi people &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; but pair it with a strategy to lower current death rates and force a political solution.<br /><br />Congress and the administration should examine how to re-deploy American forces to "on-the-horizon" (as well as "over-the-horizon") fortified positions in Iraq.  Rather than continue high-casualty street patrols and launch a deadly offensive in Baghdad (will the Iraqi forces really watch our back?), American forces largely should pull back from areas of urban combat and stand poised to intervene with others to prevent far larger atrocities if they occur.  The current rate of killing stands a good chance of declining once American forces re-deploy and sap the militia, insurgents, and foreign terrorists of some of their most compelling targets.  <br /><br /> The United States should use this interlude of re-deployment to negotiate a new understanding with its allies, UN Security Council members, and Iraq's neighbors while pressing for an Iraqi political settlement.  Iraq is not exempt from its own and the global responsibility to protect civilian populations at risk, but the United States is currently seen &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; rightly or wrongly &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; as a prime cause of civilian deaths rather than the catalyst for preventing them. <br /> <br />If the situation following re-deployment were to slide into mass slaughter, it would be far preferable to have forged, in advance, a multilateral commitment to intervene quickly under Security Council authorization to protect the Iraqi people from the threat of atrocity crimes and other widespread killing and societal destruction.  The Bush administration may find it has to admit, at least in diplomatic consultations, grievous error and folly in its past policies to restore enough credibility to forge such a multilateral bond and build a genuine coalition of forces.  But it is human life, not the Bush administration's reputation, that matters. <br /><br />This re-deployment and atrocity watch should compel the Maliki Government to get serious about national reconciliation.  If there were established a UN-authorized multilateral "stand-by" force that is directed to intervene to stop widespread killings, and then does so, Maliki must know he would lose his political authority.   He would want to avoid that probability.  If his hidden agenda in fact is an intolerant Shiite-dominated government that aims to ethnical
ly cleanse Sunnis from wide swaths of Iraq, Maliki may find that the bloodshed he and his colleagues inflict to arrive at any such objective would be their ticket to war crimes trials (perhaps, this time, before an international tribunal) where they would join various indicted Sunni war criminals in the dock.<br /><br /> What I propose is a tall order for American diplomacy and military doctrine.  The time may have passed where U.S. diplomats have any chance of persuading anyone to join us in a stand-by force to stem a future tide of atrocities at least partly sourced to our original intervention.  But the daily death count in Iraq's civil war is rising.  Plunging United States forces even deeper into the civil war and essentially resurrecting the American occupation at a very high cost in lives and treasure could trigger the doom scenario, and offer little hope that six months hence we will be better prepared to confront it.    <br /><br /> <br /><em>David Scheffer is the Mayer, Brown, Rowe &amp; Maw/Robert A.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a>, Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court at The Hague, says that since he began work in late 2003 his office has already faced and met several key challenges in bringing to justice persons suspected of committing war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/luismorenoocampo.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font> took office as Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in November 2003.   As we begin 2007, I would like to take the opportunity to reflect on my office's achievements and some of the main challenges we have faced.   In the last three years, the Office of the Prosecutor has opened three investigations, collected evidence amidst on-going violence, requested arrest warrants and secured the arrest of a major suspect.  In accomplishing these results, the Office had to overcome considerable obstacles.  Specifically, I would like to detail the three major challenges the Office has faced in relation to its core activities of investigating and prosecuting crimes under its jurisdiction.  Each challenge has necessitated creative thinking and innovative solutions.  <br /><br /><strong>First Challenge: Beginning Cases</strong><br /><br />The first challenge faced by the Office related to how to begin its cases.  Two distinct issues arose in beginning cases: first, how to select situations to investigate, and second, which method to use to trigger the jurisdiction of the Court.  <br /><br />According to the Rome Statute (the main governing document of the ICC), there are three ways that a case may be brought before the International Criminal Court: 1) A State Party can refer a situation to the Prosecutor; 2) the Prosecutor can initiate an investigation (<em>proprio motu</em>), subject to authorization by ICC judges; and 3) the United Nations Security Council can refer a situation acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.  The ICC currently has jurisdiction over genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the territory or by a national of a State Party for crimes committed after July 1, 2002.  <br /><br />In the last three years, the Office has opened three investigations: Northern Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) -- both referrals from the respective States Parties -- and Darfur, the Sudan, which was referred to the Prosecutor by the United Nations Security Council.<br /><br />In selecting situations to investigate, once the requirements of temporal and subject-matter jurisdiction are met, the Office is guided by the standard of gravity.  Although any crime falling within the jurisdiction of the Court is a serious matter, the Rome Statute clearly requires an additional consideration of "gravity" whereby the Office must determine that a situation is sufficiently grave to justify further action by the Court.  <br /><br />In deciding whether this additional consideration of gravity is met the Office considers the following factors, amongst others, to be relevant: the scale of the crimes; the nature of the crimes; the manner of commission of the crimes; and the impact of the crimes.<br /><br />While my authority as the Prosecutor to initiate investigations by the <em>proprio motu</em> power is a critical aspect of the Office's independence, I have adopted the policy of inviting and welcoming voluntary referrals by territorial states as a first step in triggering the jurisdiction of the Court.  This policy resulted in referrals for what would become the Court's first two situations: Northern Uganda and the DRC.  The method of inviting investigations by voluntary referral has increased the likelihood of important cooperation and on-the-ground support to carry out the investigation and prosecution.<br /><br /><strong>Second Challenge: Working in the Context of On-going Conflict</strong><br /><br />The second significant challenge faced by the Office was how to conduct investigations into situations of on-going violence, where even traveling to the areas in question may be impossible, or where the territory suffers from a collapse of functioning institutions.  Working in an environment of persistent violence has made protecting victims and witnesses more difficult. The Office had to learn how to approach and interview possible witnesses without exposing them, including identifying safe sites for interviews, securing discreet transportation for investigators and witnesses and providing for the contingency of moving to safe locations.  <br /><br />In addition, the Office had to communicate effectively with witnesses in different languages, some of which have no corresponding words for the legal terminology required for the interview.   Because there are few qualified professional translators, finding persons with the appropriate skills and background required exceptional efforts.  Furthermore, conditions on the ground for investigators are usually quite difficult, with poor facilities, in some cases 90% of the Office's investigators returned from their missions with illnesses. <br /><br />In order to address the challenges presented by these exceptional logistical difficulties, the Office endeavored to reduce the length and scope of the investigation.  Based on the Statute, the Office adopted a policy of focusing its efforts on the most serious crimes and on those who bear the greatest responsibility for these crimes.   Determining which individuals bear the greatest responsibility for these crimes is done according to and dependant on the evidence that emerges in the course of an investigation.  <br /><br />In thinking about the Office's prosecutorial strategy, it is important to acknowledge that the ICC does not have primacy over domestic judicial systems.  Instead, the ICC is a court of last resort; it will not act if a case is investigated or prosecuted by a national judicial system unless the national proceedings are not genuine.  In this sense, the ICC is complementary to national systems.  When the Court decides not to prosecute a particular person, it does not mean that impunity is thereby granted.  Part of the Court's work is to encourage national measures against other offenders.<br /><br />The challenge of working amidst violent conditions requires the Office, whenever possible, to present expeditious and focused cases while aiming to represent the entire range of criminality.  In principle, incidents will be selected to provide a sample that is reflective of the gravest incidents and the main types of victimization.  In Northern Uganda, for example, the Office selected six incidents out of hundreds that occurred and charged the five top leaders of the Lord&#39;s Resistance Army (LRA) with crimes against humanity, including, sexual slavery, rape and murder, and war crimes, including intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population, enlisting children and inducing rape and pillaging.  <br /><br />Sometimes there are conflicting interests which force the Office to focus on only one part of the criminality in a particular conflict.  In the situation in the DRC, the Office initially investigated a wide range of crimes allegedly committed, seeking to represent the broad range of criminality.  The Office subsequently decided in its first case, the case against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, to focus on the crime of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15 and using them to participate actively in hostilities.  After careful consideration of the evidence gathered, including linkage of the accused to the crime and in accordance with the requirement to prove charges beyond a reasonable doubt, the Office decided to limit the charges in its first case to those mentioned above.  Meanwhile, the Office continues to investigate crimes under its jurisdiction alleged
ly committed by various parties to the conflict in the DRC.<br /><br />The approach used in the selection of incidents and charges assists the Office in reducing the number of witnesses called to testify.  This is one of the measures taken to address the security challenge.  Additionally, the Court developed plans to adequately protect witnesses and ICC Staff, including immediate response systems. These response systems have already been used effectively in several instances where threats were reported. <br /><br /><strong>Third Challenge: Executing Arrest Warrants</strong><br /><br />The third challenge faced by the entire Court is how to execute arrest warrants.  This is perhaps the most critical and difficult issue of the system created by the Rome Statute.  The Court does not have its own enforcement force.  Under the Statute, it is the States Parties that bear the responsibility for arresting suspects and delivering them to the Court for prosecution.  Although territorial states have the mandate to control their territory, in the context of the situations where the Court operates, they often have difficulties executing arrest warrants.  The Court was able to effectively address this challenge in the Thomas Lubanga Dyilo case because he was already in custody, but more assistance is needed to enforce the outstanding arrest warrants that have been issued in the LRA case.  The Office anticipates that this will be a key challenge in the next phase of its operations.<br /><br />Looking forward, the Office will face new challenges and will likely need to continue to devise creative ways of approaching the current ones.  I encourage academics and practitioners to engage and publish on these topics in order to contribute to this rapidly evolving field of international criminal prosecution and to help enhance the quality of our work as prosecutors.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Luis Moreno-Ocampo is Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court at The Hague.</em><br />

The Vice-President has stated time and again his view that prior occupants of the Oval Office allowed too much interference with executive decision-making in these areas.  Recently, Seymour Hersh, writing in the New Yorker, reported that, even if the new Congress voted to prohibit the United States from planning to overthrow or destabilize the current regime in Iran, the Vice-President "would find a way to work around [such a law]."  See Seymour M. Hersh, &quot;Is a Damaged Administration Less Likely to Attack Iran, or More?,&quot; <em>The New Yorker</em>, Nov. 27, 2006.<br /><br /> If this sounds familiar, it should:  representatives of the Reagan administration put forward precisely these arguments for executive power in connection with the passage of the Boland Amendment in 1984.  The amendment essentially forbade the United States government from providing military support to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua with funding appropriated to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, "or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities."  In the event, the administration skirted the prohibition by relying upon funding derived from, among other sources, the sale of weapons to the government of Iran.  A scandal erupted when the administration's actions became known to the public.<br /><br /> In all the attention given the issue of executive power in the wake of the Iran-Contra scandal, the question of whether, consistent with the United States Constitution, Congress could limit the President's decision-making in respect to foreign policy went without a definitive response.  This question is still relevant today, as the new Congress may well consider limiting the President's discretion in respect to Iran, just as Vice-President Cheney is reported to have predicted.  <br /><br />We are not without guidance in addressing the constitutionality of such a Congressional limitation.  In 1989, in a short and prophetic article that appeared in the <em>American Journal of International Law</em>, Louis Fisher maintained that Congress has the authority to limit Presidential actions in foreign affairs and national security.  See Louis Fisher, &quot;How Tightly Can Congress Draw the Purse Strings?,&quot; 83 <em>American Journal of International Law</em> 758 (1989).  <br /><br /> Fisher argued that the beginning and end of the discussion lies in the appropriations power:  Congress has the sole power of the purse.  Article I, section 9, provides that "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations Made by Law."  The President enjoys no similar authority.  Further, while the President is the Commander-in-Chief, the text and practice make clear that his power in respect to foreign affairs and national security is not unilateral:  in addition to the power to declare war, the Constitution permits Congress to "provide for the common defense," U.S. Const., Art. I, &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 1; to raise and support armies, see id. &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 12; and to "make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces," see id. &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 14.  Though it would be possible for the President to conduct federal operations with funds gathered from non-Congressional sources, such action still must be approved by Congress:  as Fisher concluded, the Constitutional design simply does not suggest that either the executive or legislative branch of the federal government could involve the nation in military operations and fund those operations without any reliance upon the other.  See Fisher, <em>supra</em>, at 762.  <br /><br /> Fisher was right then and his argument has lost none of its force today, notwithstanding the events of September 11.  The Constitution does not allow decisions regarding military operations to be made outside the system of checks and balances upon which our constitutional democracy depends.  That system ensures that decision-makers remain accountable, and it prevents the accretion of too much power in any one branch of the federal government.  <br /><br /> It is true &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; as Justice Jackson famously remarked &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; that the Constitution should not be viewed as a suicide pact.  But neither should it be seen as a mere technicality:  members of the Bush administration may well believe that military operations in Iran are necessary to protect the citizenry, but the government the framers designed does not permit them to act on that belief when the people's Congressional representatives, in their collective wisdom, conclude that it is ill-considered.  And, if the President were to ignore Congressional will as expressed in a condition on military or national security appropriations, then, as Fisher argued almost two decades ago, he would be inviting impeachment proceedings.  See <em>id.</em> at 765.<br /><br /> In the face of Congressional opposition, the President is not without options:  he can always attempt to make a stronger case for military action in Iran and demonstrate why any limitations on his discretion to pursue military options there ought to be lifted.  That may be a difficult task:  leaked information from the most recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iran suggests that the country is some ten years away from developing a nuclear weapon.  Soon after this information became public, the administration began to disavow the accuracy of the report and suggested that a nuclear Iran is a more immediate threat.  <br /><br />In light of the case the administration made for the war in Iraq, members of Congress could be forgiven for viewing the President's argument with some skepticism.  Indeed, the new Congress must be much more willing then its recent predecessors to challenge and question the assertions put forth by the administration regarding a nuclear Iran.  While there is little doubt that a nuclear Iran would threaten U.S. and western interests in the region, Congress cannot let that possibility weaken its resolve to ask probing questions of administration officials, carefully review all available intelligence, and exercise its own independent judgment with regard to the threat posed by Iran and the best way to deal with that threat.  Such inquiries and determinations represent a critical structural check on presidential power, and the ability of Congress to act on them is a constitutional prerogative.<br /><br /><br /><em>Lawrence Friedman teaches courses in constitutional law at New England School of Law; Victor Hansen, a former lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps, teaches courses in criminal law there.</em><br />

In some sense, with this execution, the end of mankind's bloodiest century ended.  During the 20th century, it is estimated that 215 million human beings perished, 135 million at the hands of their own governments.  The likes of Hussein were a scourge upon that century.  Importantly, this sad and tragic chapter in history was closed not by force but by the law.  The trial of Hussein for the Dujal massacre was rough justice, but justice nonetheless. Is this a harbinger for the 21st century?  Will the standard be that the law will bring down tyrants or will it be something else? The record is mixed, the way uncertain indeed, yet the year 2006 augers well for the future of the rule of law.  How so?<br /><br />Slobodan Milosevic died in custody, under indictment and on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity.  With his death, ended the long and drawn out agony of a trial that showed the world the monster that he was.  This trial exposed the strengths and weaknesses of international criminal law.  From this years-long trial will come lessons learned that will assist the advancement of the practice.  The world faced down the butcher of the Balkans, the first head of state to be tried for war crimes and crimes against humanity.<br /><br />Charles Taylor, the first head of state in Africa indicted for war crimes, was handed over by an African head of state to an African based international tribunal via an African country for war crimes and crimes against humanity. As his helicopter touched down at the tribunal's compound in Sierra Leone, a country he personally destroyed, thousands of Sierra Leoneans cheered in the hills surrounding the compound.  As he entered the court room several days later to be arraigned on those war crimes and crimes against humanity, Africans came to know that their lives mattered and that cynical African leaders could no longer take for granted their power.  The beast of impunity was leashed in West Africa, and perhaps, over time, the continent.   <br /><br />Augusto Pinochet died a disgraced outlaw in his own country that he kept in utter terror for decades.  Chileans sent a powerful signal to their government and to all of South America that the old ways of absolute power are no longer acceptable.  His passing reflects the end of centralized power in a dictatorial regime, bolstering the concept of good governance in Chile and within Latin America.  <br /><br />Saddam Hussein was tried, convicted, and executed by an American-backed Iraqi court set up to prosecute his regime for the deaths of his own people. Though the process followed Iraqi criminal law, the specter of justice delivered so swiftly by the Iraqis will always be an asterisk next to this court from an international point of view.  As he was led to the gallows, the manner of his execution also showed the indignity by which he died as political partisans shouted insults. In some sense that execution was a final reflection of the sloppy mix of law and politics that floated around that Iraqi court.  History will tell whether justice was done.  All in all, the law prevailed.<br /><br />Yet there are wrinkles related to international criminal justice in 2006:<br /><br />Darfur is the festering and fetid wound that exposes the cynical politics that surrounds international criminal justice.  With the limited successes at the end of the last century and the beginning of the 21st century, Darfur reminds us that the path of justice is rocky, strewn with practical and political obstacles that highlight the reality of how politics plays out along with justice at the international level.  <br /><br />In the former Yugoslavia, Messrs. Karadzic and Miladic continue to hide behind the protection of the Serbs, in some way hiding in plain sight.  Their continued freedom will keep the tragedy of the Balkans an open chapter in a sad book of agony and horror.  Without their handover for trial at The Hague, that tribunal's work will be incomplete.  Closure and reconciliation continues to be fleeting for the victims.<br /><br />The world's superpower, the United States, has stepped away from its responsibility of conducting its military operations in accordance with international standards and this administration is openly attacking the international criminal law regime set up by the Rome Statute.  Without the moral leadership of the United States the global effort to face down impunity and international terror will continue to struggle.  Only through the rule of law can this so-called ideological struggle against these terrorists be successful.  <br /><br />International justice is as much a political act as it is a legal process.  The legal act can only take place after the political one is complete, which can be awkward and unsure to say the least.  Darfur is just such an example, as well as Charles Taylor's sanctioned exile for three years.  However, the international community is putting together a political framework which may allow the condition for justice to take place for the victims in Darfur; and the international community finally moved efficiently in March of 2006 to hand over Charles Taylor to the Special Court for Sierra Leone as the political atmosphere cleared for that to happen.  He awaits trial in this spring, the first African head of state ever to be indicted for violating international humanitarian law.  <br /><br />Despite this, mankind, in general, recognizes that impunity must be faced down wherever it rears its ugly head, of that I am now convinced.  Nothing that civilization has done related to atrocity has been precise, yet today we tend not to look the other way, but to act. Historians will look at the beginning years of this century, particularly 2006, with mixed feelings on how the international community dealt with atrocity.  All in all, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, it will either be the beginning of a new dawn for international humanitarian law or a more bleak future.  Only time will tell.  Regardless, 2006 will be looked on as a watershed year in the evolution of justice at the international level.<br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist William Teesdale, an attorney in the Federal Public Defenders Office in Portland, Oregon representing Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://www.projecthamad.com ">Adel Hamad</a>, a Sudanese national transferred to Guantanamo in early 2003 from Pakistan, says that on the fifth anniversary of the US terror detention camp we should remember that the detainees held there are individual people with names and stories and cases that deserve to be heard by a court of law...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/williamteesdale.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n the fifth anniversary of the first prisoners arriving at the US base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, let me address a question just asked of me yesterday: how many innocent people are there at Guantanamo?<br /><br />I do not know for sure, but I do know one.<br /><br />The Federal Public Defenders office in Portland was appointed by the D.C. District Court to represent Guantanamo detainee Adel Hamad in October 2005 as a direct result of a handwritten plea for freedom he had sent the court six months before.  Adel wrote to the court as a result of the Supreme Court decision in <em>Rasul v.Bush</em>, 542 U.S. 466 (2004), which had confirmed the detainee's right to file federal habeas petitions.  At the beginning all we knew about him was that he spoke Arabic and that he was detainee 940, because that was all the Government would agree to tell us.<br /><br />They would not even tell us what country he was from.<br /><br />I first learned Adel's story during the long night of March 3/4, 2006, when I stayed up all night searching through thousands of pages of military tribunal (CSRT) records released by the Department of Defense to find a reference to detainee 940. I read through those first public CSRT records with great excitement.  We had been told by the President and his administration that all these detainees are the "worst of the worst." What I found was entirely different.  Adel was from Sudan but had lived with his wife and children in Pakistan and Afghanistan, working for various Muslim charity organizations since 1986.  The Government suspected Adel because they didn't like the groups he worked for, including, most recently, the World Assembly of Muslim Youth.  WAMY is a major Muslim charity group with some 2,000 employees and a presence in many countries.  Adel was arrested at his home in Peshawar, Pakistan, at about 1:30 a.m., along with his downstairs neighbor, a United Nations refugee.  Adel spent time in custody in Pakistan and at Bagram airbase in Afghanistan before being transferred to Guantanamo in early 2003.  Adel told the military tribunal that he had worked for WAMY since 2000, as a hospital administrator in Chamkani, Afghanistan and then later providing relief supplies to refugees in Peshawar, Pakistan, who were fleeing Afghanistan because of the war. Before that he had taught at an elementary school.  He didn't sound like the worst of the worst to me.<br /><br />After returning from our first Guantanamo visit, the group in our office with security clearances met behind locked doors with curtains closed.  I remember Steve Wax and Patrick Ehlers telling me about Adel and their impressions of him as a good man, a strong, honest man with a nice smile.<br /><br />Steve said that Adel could not let go of his hand when the meeting came to an end; I suppose he could not bear to be parted from the first people to have tried to help him.  We talked about how we could find the evidence to present to the court, how we could show that Adel had told the military tribunal the truth.  I took the lead role in the international investigation of Adel's case, with great assistance from many of my colleagues.<br /><br />Then, in May, 2005, the Government produced the factual return, as ordered by the District Court.  We learned something stunning.  There was a dissenting voice on the military CSRT panel that declared Adel an Enemy Combatant.  An army major, whose name is classified,  had the courage to file a dissenting report calling the result in Adel's case "unconscionable."<br /><br />We made contact with Adel's family in Sudan and confirmed that Adel had left Sudan in 1986 to find better job opportunities.  His wife, brother in law, and others confirmed that he had worked as a teacher, then at the hospital and in Peshawar helping refugees.  Adel's wife described the death of their youngest child while Adel has been in custody in Cuba.<br /><br />It was not easy to find the evidence we needed in Afghanistan and Pakistan; it took many of us a great deal of work.  Phone calls in the middle of the night with Zabi Noori, our excellent Pashto interpreter and calls at all hours with Professor Sbait, our wonderful Arabic interpreter.  Then finally the breakthrough came, when Zabi, who had made it his personal mission to find someone at the hospital, made contact with Dr. Najib, the former Director of the hospital, an Afghan surgeon living in Kabul, who agreed to meet with me in Kabul, Afghanistan.<br /><br />During August 2006, I went with Assistant Federal Public Defender Ruben Iniguez and Investigator Martin Caballero from Portland to Kabul, then by road to Jalalabad, and on through the Khyber pass to Peshawar, and then Islamabad in Pakistan.  Ruben and Martin were gathering evidence on behalf of another detainee client, Nazar Gul, an Afghan citizen who fled his homeland after the Soviet invasion, who had lived peacefully for 25 years in the refugee village of Doaba and who had recently returned to work under the Karzai government.  Nazar was arrested in Gardez, Afghanistan, apparently because of confusion about his name.  We worked cooperatively as a group on both cases, filming sworn video interviews with over 20 witnesses.  It was an intense, somewhat dangerous, period and the most rewarding experience of my professional life, because we did everything we had set out to do and more on behalf of Mr. Gul and Mr. Hamad - we found the evidence of innocence we had been seeking.<br /><br />All of the information gathered in this investigation was filed with the court in Mr. Hamad's case in the form of a motion for summary judgment.  On October 17th, 2006 President Bush signed the Military Commissions Act, which attempts to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction to hear Guantanamo detainee habeas cases.  All of our cases are presently stayed pending resolution of this issue.<br /><br />We have long valued and relied on the Great Writ, yet its very existence in now challenged by the Government.  In 1215, King John of England, at Runnymede meadow, was forced to sign the Magna Carta, the first in a series of documents recognizing the right to challenge detention by the king through the great writ of habeas corpus.  The American Bar Association built a memorial at that site with a plaque inscribed: &quot;To commemorate Magna Carta, symbol of Freedom Under Law.&quot;  Today is a very different, less auspicious moment - the fifth anniversary of the arrival of the first detainees at Camp X-Ray, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  But the importance of the fight for justice is just as great.<br /><br />On January 5, 2007 our office released <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E3w7ME6Fs">Guantanamo Unclassified</a>, a short video about Adel Hamad's case,  on YouTube, the video sharing website. <br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/D5E3w7ME6Fs"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/D5E3w7ME6Fs" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br />It is meant to give you a sense of Adel, through me and some of the people who knew him.  I hope that you can watch it and see him as I do, a good man, a family man and an innocent man.  But his story is onl
y a part of the answer to the question I was asked.<br /><br />You see the truth is that the detainees are not numbers, they are individual people with names and stories and cases that deserve to be heard by a court of law.  So speak with Steve Sady in our office about Abdul Rahim, a young Syrian tortured by the Taliban, speak with Ruben Iniguez and Amy Baggio about Nazar Gul.  Speak with Steve Wax and Pat Ehlers and me about Adel Hamad, or Mr. Wax about the other four detainees my office is representing.<br /><br />On this fifth anniversary of Guantanamo please spare a thought and a prayer for Adel Hamad and all other innocents imprisoned without trial in Cuba, in the hope that the courts and Congress will rise to the occasion and restore in America the right established in that English meadow eight centuries ago, the right of an individual to challenge detention before a court of law.<br /><br /><br /><em>William Teesdale is an investigator and attorney working with the Federal Public Defenders Office in Portland, Oregon.

		<title>The White House Retreat on NSA Surveillance: Puzzles Remaining</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/shane.html">Peter Shane</a> of Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, says that while the timing of the White House climbdown on court supervision of its warrantless surveillance activities may be explained by Democratic dominance of the new Congress, questions remain as to why the administration previously believed the FISA process inadequate, and whether Congress will now press its political advantage to rein in other instances of executive lawlessness...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petershane2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>J</strong></font>ames Bamford called his 1983 book about the National Security Agency "The Puzzle Palace."  Somebody should use the same name for a book about the 2007 White House.<br /><br /> Attorney General Alberto Gonzales disclosed this week to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the President will not reauthorize the National Security Agency's so-called Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP), the program of warrantless electronic surveillance created by secret presidential order in early 2002.  The Bush Administration has insisted that the TSP targeted only international communications to or from the United States when the Government had reason to believe one party to the conversation was affiliated with al Qaeda.  It likewise maintained that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act process for securing judicial warrants to authorize such surveillance was inadequate to support the kind of program necessary in a post-September 11 world.<br /><br /> That, of course, poses Puzzle #1.  FISA permits the issuance of a warrant whenever the Attorney General certifies that the purpose of the surveillance in question is the acquisition of foreign intelligence information.  In any case where the Government reasonably believes one party to a telephone conversation is affiliated with al Qaeda, such a certification would seem to be the proverbial "no-brainer."  It might be that the Government would want to initiate surveillance more quickly than a completed application process would allow, but FISA explicitly anticipates that problem.  It allows the Attorney General to pursue surveillance without a warrant in emergency circumstances, so long as an application is forthcoming within 72 hours.  The process would seem tailor-made for authorizing wiretaps of the kind the Administration claimed to be pursuing.  So why wasn't FISA adequate?<br /><br /> This question provokes Puzzle #2: How was the TSP determining that at least one party to each wiretapped phone call was affiliated with al Qaeda?  One obvious possibility is that the NSA was actually using computers to sift through data about thousands of telephone communications &#8212; things like call length, points of origin and reception, and so on &#8212; as well as word sampling from the conversations themselves, and then using these data to determine if a phone call might be al Qaeda-related.  If the NSA were sampling the content of the calls, then this would mean that the Administration was lying &#8212; it was dipping into phone calls, without a warrant, even before some basis existed to suspect that a party to the call was affiliated with terrorists.<br /><br /> If something like this was happening, then we would now face Puzzle #3: Does the Administration think that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court can authorize a program of data mining?  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court only has authority to decide matters over which Congress has vested jurisdiction in the court through FISA.  With regard to electronic surveillance, warrants may issue only upon an application that includes "the identity, if known, or a description of the specific target of the electronic surveillance."  The reference to a "specific target" would seem to foreclose the possibility that the FISA court could sign off on any broad program of data mining.<br /><br /> But maybe this is just overheated over-thinking.  The White House explained the President's change of heart on the basis of new rules issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that have answered what Press Secretary Tony Snow called "questions we have had in the past about speed and agility."  This, however, merely returns us to Puzzle #1: How much faster than "immediately" did the Attorney General need to go?<br /><br /> What is not a puzzle is the timing of this change &#8212; on the eve of the first Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing in a Congress newly led by the Democrats.  The White House surely hopes that its change of course will make it politically unpalatable for the Democrats to keep asking whether the TSP, in its 2002-2007 form, was a violation of law, involving both private telecommunications providers and government officials in serious felonies.  And that's today's final puzzle: Will Congress muster the necessary backbone to investigate past Administration lawlessness, even as it keeps its focus on the future?  The American people deserve answers to these questions, and only a Congress committed to the faithful execution of its institutional responsibilities can elicit them.  Nothing puzzling about that.<br />   <br /><br /><em>Peter M. Shane is the Joseph S.

Still, the ugly show managed to surpass even the most cynical observer's expectations of tawdriness.  It achieved the unimaginable: it made a mass murderer appear more dignified than his executioners.  Worse yet, it has cast a pall over the trial that ended in the sentence of death.  In an <a href="/forumy/2006/11/hussein-verdict-beyond-justice.php">earlier JURIST column</a>, I argued that Hussein's trial had not been a complete sham. However flawed &#8212; and deeply flawed it was &#8212; it appeared that the trial had disappointed the doomsday prognostications of those who had foretold a legal catastrophe.  The trial court's written judgment, released a few weeks after its announced verdict, ran to three hundred single-spaced pages in its English language version, and included closely reasoned discussions of the case's thorny procedural and evidentiary issues.  Yet whatever fairness, good faith and juridical sobriety were evinced in this document has been entirely eclipsed by the execution itself.  In our global culture, the battle between the word and the image is no battle at all.  Three hundred pages of legal argument cannot answer <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/saddam-hanging-shown-on-web-video.php">two minutes of grainy cell-phone video</a>. <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/saddamtrial.php">Saddam Hussein Trial</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2007/01/saddam-hussein-dujail-appellate.php">Saddam Hussein Dujail appeals chamber decision</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2006/12/saddam-hussein-dujail-judgment-iht.php">Dujail trial judgment</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />  For many, then, particularly within Iraq, the shameful execution will supply the final proof that the trial was, from the get-go, about nothing more than revenge.  Retribution obviously is an acceptable and widely accepted goal of systems of criminal justice.  As a sober act respectful of the punished, retribution seeks, in the words of Hannah Arendt, "to put an end to something that without interference could go on endlessly."  Revenge, by contrast, "acts in the form of re-acting against an original trespassing&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;permitting the chain reaction contained in every event to follow its unhindered course."  Or in the words of philosopher Jean Hampton, the "vengeful hater does not respect but aims to diminish the worth of the offender."  Other commentators have already observed that far from contributing, however modestly and belatedly, to the goal of a unified and peaceful Iraq, the vengeful display on the gallows will simply fuel further sectarian violence.  Arendt's and Hampton's arguments, however, cast this insight in sharper focus.  Ending in a display of vengeance, the trial itself has now been irrevocably cast as an exercise not of the rule of law but of tribal hate. <br /><br /> For some, this may be seen as further evidence of the larger folly of the death penalty. Headlines on the <em>New York Times</em> front-page for January 3 neatly made this argument in bookends.  Next to an article describing Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki's pledge to uncover the source of the leaked video, the <em>Times</em> ran a piece about a legislative commission in New Jersey that had recommended the abolition of the death penalty as a practice "inconsistent with evolving standards of decency."  It goes without saying that the Saddam video would appear to support New Jersey's conclusion.  Indeed, from the perspective of a staunch opponent of the death penalty, the Saddam video could be seen not as anomalous but as representative of a deeper truth about the penalty: that it is always about revenge.  If anything, our attempts to render the death penalty clinical, antiseptic and invisible, a "humane" practice administered by persons in lab coats, are all the more sinister.  The Iraqi display, unseemly as it was, at least had the candor of reminding us of the penalty's inevitable connection with violent spectacle and bloodlust.<br /><br /> And yet I would insist that it is possible to oppose the death penalty as a general matter, while still endorsing its use only for perpetrators of genocide or the most egregious crimes against humanity.  Israel, for example, abolished the death penalty for murder in 1953, yet retained it for perpetrators of Nazi crimes.  In its sixty-year history, Israel has had occasion to execute but a single individual: Adolf Eichmann in 1962.  Even in that case, a debate raged in Israel about the appropriate punishment for Eichmann, a debate that anticipated some of the controversies surrounding Saddam's execution.  In his summation before the court, Israeli Attorney General and lead prosecutor, Gideon Hausner, invoked the Prophet Joel in urging the tribunal to do justice to the "blood of innocents" &#8212; an appeal that appeared to conflate legal justice with religious vengeance.  Martin Buber, the famous philosopher, took exception with Hausner's argument, insisting that Eichmann's execution would be a "mistake of historical dimensions." Buber argued that inasmuch as no punishment could do justice to the crime of genocide, Eichmann's execution would fail the end of retribution and would only create an illusion of expiation.<br /><br />The best answer to the colloquy between Hausner and Buber came from Arendt, of all people.  Although Arendt famously found fault with many aspects of the Eichmann trial, she never, it's worth remembering, called into question the appropriateness of the death penalty.  But in an effort to move the debate beyond the familiar arguments about revenge versus retribution, Arendt understood Eichmann's execution in radically different terms: as a form of lustration, an act of purging, or cleansing.  At the end of <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em>, she delivers her own act of judgment: "And just as you supported and carried out a policy of not wanting to share the earth with the Jewish people and the people of a number of other nations&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;we find that no one, that is, no member of the human race, can be expected to want to share the earth with you."  Her words address Eichmann directly: not through taunts or imprecations, but in terms of reasoned justification.  And her judgment issues not in the name of Jews or any particular group, nation or people, but in t
erms of the human race. <br /> <br />It is only in defense of humankind that the death penalty can be justified, Arendt suggests.  When it merely defends the sensitivities of the group, the penalty does not purge, but pollutes.  Saddam's execution spreads that noxious stench. <br />  <br /><br /><em>Lawrence Douglas is Professor of Law, Jurisprudence &amp; Social Thought at Amherst College</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=35">Nancy Rapoport</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that lawyers who provide free legal representation for poor and/or unpopular clients - including detainees at Guantanamo Bay - should be thanked for their efforts, not shunned or sanctioned at the behest of government officials...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/nancyrapoportnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>C</strong></font>harles Stimson, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs, recently excoriated several large law firms, suggesting that the firms' pro bono representation of Guantanamo detainees rendered them unfit to continue their for-profit representation of corporations.  Apparently, Mr. Stimson has missed the recent renaissance of Harper Lee, Truman Capote's friend who wrote <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>.  In that famous book, lawyer Finch represents Tom Robinson, an African-American man falsely accused of raping a white woman, at a time when such accusations typically resulted in public lynchings.  Suffice it to say that Atticus Finch represented a very unpopular client.<br /><br /> Before someone accuses me of equating innocent Tom Robinson with alleged terrorists, let's get one thing straight.  It's a professional obligation for lawyers to represent indigent clients, even highly unpopular ones, and that obligation is necessary for the administration of justice.  The Preamble to the Model Rules of Professional Conduct provides that<blockquote>A lawyer should be mindful of deficiencies in the administration of justice and of the fact that the poor, and sometimes persons who are not poor, cannot afford adequate legal assistance.  Therefore, all lawyers should devote professional time and resources and use civic influence to ensure equal access to our system of justice for all those who because of economic or social barriers cannot afford or secure adequate legal counsel.</blockquote>Now look at Mr. Stimson's suggestion about lawyers who take on this particular type of pro bono work:<blockquote>I think, quite honestly, when corporate CEOs see that those firms are representing the very terrorists who hit their bottom line back in 2001, those CEOs are going to make those law firms choose between representing terrorists or representing reputable firms, and I think that is going to have major play in the next few weeks.  And we want to watch that play out.</blockquote>In fact, my guess is that those corporate CEOs already know about their law firms' representation of the accused at Gitmo.  I'm reasonably certain that the firms are not undertaking the representation of Gitmo detainees if there is a conflict of interest between the Gitmo representation and the representation of the firms' other clients.  The law firms &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and the list of those firms reads like a Who's Who of major firms &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; are justifiably proud of their pro bono work.  Some of those CEOs (and their general counsel, who likely are key determinants of which firms the corporations use) want to be represented by lawyers who use their considerable skills for paying and non-paying clients alike.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Comment: <a href="/hotline/2007/01/bush-administration-bashes-attorneys.php">Bush administration bashes attorneys for defending Guantanamo detainees</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />What troubles me most about Mr. Stimson's remarks is the same thing that troubles me when I hear law-trained members of Congress complain about judges whose decisions they don't like.  (I believe that the phrase "activist judges" is the one most bandied about.)  Representing an unpopular client is not the same thing as endorsing the client's views or actions.  Making an unpopular judicial decision is not the same thing as rewriting the law.  <br /><br /> Lawyers get enough bad press (and some of them deserve it).  But when we see good lawyers doing the right thing for the legal system as a whole, we should thank them, not shun them.<br />  <br /><br /><em>Nancy B.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=35">Nancy Rapoport</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that recent revelations about stock option backdating at Apple Computer suggest that it may be time for corporate board members even in the most highly-respected companies to make some needed New Year&#39;s resolutions to protect their enterprises, their reputations, and their investors...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/nancyrapoportnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ast week we learned that Apple Computer, too, had a piece of the backdating-of-stock-options pie and that it may have ginned up a fake board meeting to demonstrate authorization of stock options to Steve Jobs.  According to news reports, Jobs knew about some of the backdating activities, although he didn't benefit financially from the options.  <br /><br /> Let's review:  Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, etc., scandals hit the news about six years ago.  Thanks to Erik Lie of Iowa , we now know about the backdating of options problem, some of which was happening while the other 2001 news was breaking.  We have Sarbanes-Oxley and the related rules, and the SEC is trying to get a handle on all of the issues with executive compensation measurements.  I can't resist poking fun at the model of clarity to get to the new rule:  the SEC Website PDF Redirect Page says that:<blockquote>Final Rule Release 33-8732 (issued August 11, 2006) was replaced by Amended Final Rule Release 33-8732A (issued August 29, 2006), which reflects revision of Release No. 33-8732 to conform with the publication of two releases in the Federal Register &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; Release No. 33-8732A and Release No. 33-8735. Release 33-8732A reflects the addition of cross references to proposing release No. 33-8735.</blockquote>No wonder people have a hard time parsing government-ese, right?<br /><br />So what gives?  How difficult is it, really, to walk the straight and narrow in terms of corporate governance?  I'm not talking about trying new types of financing or creating new markets, although there are all sorts of legal risks inherent with being a first-mover in an area.  I'm talking about basic officer and director behavior.<br /><br />I don't have any first-hand experience serving on a corporate board yet, although I'd actually like to see what it's like to serve on one.  I wonder how ideas like backdating options, getting information by pretexting, or falsifying minutes of board meetings that never took place were presented to the various people who had to approve the ideas.  Maybe I'm missing the nuances here.  But in the spirit of making some New Year's resolutions, here are my top five nominees for Corporate Board New Year's Resolutions:<ol><li>I will think twice before I endorse any action that involves "misstating," "misrepresenting," "falsifying," or other descriptions that are kinder, gentler versions of "lying."<br /><br /><li>If I am still tempted to endorse any action that involves lying, I will ask myself why the company needs to hide or change information, and I will spend time trying to fix the underlying problem legally.<br /><br /><li>If I cannot fix the underlying problem, I will do everything in my power to tell the truth about the problem.<br /><br /><li>I will link pay to performance after thinking long and hard about appropriate performance indicators for my company, and I will look for multiple types of performance indicators to ensure that the company's long-term and short-term needs are taken into account.  I will also conduct spot-checks at reasonable intervals to make sure that I am measuring the correct performance indicators.<br /><br /><li>I will remind myself and my colleagues that the level of CEO compensation is not an indicator of the company's performance and that the arms race towards excessively high executive compensation is not a winnable race.  At the point when money becomes just a way of keeping score, compensation is probably too high.</ol>(That last resolution alone is probably sufficient to keep me off corporate boards.)  <br /><br />What saddens me about Apple Computer's news is that there are many good companies out there &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; public and private &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; with solid, dedicated management and boards.  These companies now suffer from being lumped together with companies that have been cheating in blatant ways.  Investors are likely to conclude that they will never be able to tell the good from the bad, because the bad ones may never get caught.<br /><br />Apple continues to be an innovator in design and technology, and there are numerous other companies caught in the options backdating problem that are also good companies.  But good companies won't stay good if the market loses all confidence in the character of those at the top.  After all, one bad Apple spoils the whole barrel.<br /><br /><br /><em>Nancy B.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.uel.ac.uk/law/staff/chandrasriram.htm">Chandra Lekha Sriram</a>, Chair of Human Rights at the University of East London School of Law (UK), says that China&#39;s economic interests in the Sudan - especially as the consumer of over 60 percent of Sudan&#39;s existing oil production and the holder of large concessions for further exploration - make it an unlikely agent of pressure on the government for human rights improvements in Darfur...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/chandrasriramnew2small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n the eve of President Hu Jintao&#39;s visit to Africa, including a stop in Sudan, attention is focused on what China&#39;s interest in the continent is, and whether it can have a positive rather than negative effect on resolving the Darfur crisis. The Chinese government has announced that the situation in Darfur will be one of the topics for discussion. Unfortunately, China&#39;s record of supporting the Sudanese government through previous conflicts and severe human rights abuses, and the Sudanese government&#39;s intransigence in the face of continuing international pressure, even from the African Union, would indicate that China is unlikely to put significant pressure on Sudan, and that Sudan could and would easily resist such pressure. This is true not least because of China&#39;s significant economic interest in Sudan, which means it needs to stay on the good side of the government or risk losing out to Russian companies.<br /><br />Last November&#39;s China-Africa summit drew a great deal of attention, and concern, for obvious reasons. China is becoming an economic powerhouse, with rapidly increased capacity to offer trade, aid and investment, and to engage in extractive industries such as oil exploration and mining, around the world. Its interest in Africa in particular has an obvious potential benefit-bringing trade to, and developing the resources of, a desperately poor continent. This was highlighted by the announcement on Monday that China will make some $3 billion in loans over the next two years. The Chinese interest in Africa is not new, although we are just beginning to notice it. In the decade between 1995 and 2005 trade between China and Africa increased tenfold, and Chinese loans to the continent also grew significantly.<br /><br />However, given China&#39;s long-standing enmity to many facets of international human rights law, its interest in a continent, and in particular countries, where conflict and human rights violations are endemic, has naturally raised severe concerns among human rights advocates. China not only does not, as many Western democracies do, condition trade and aid on human rights criteria, but it has actively engaged countries with abusive regimes.<br /><br />Nowhere is this more true than Sudan. <br /><br />China&#39;s interest in Sudan is entrenched, predates the situation in Darfur, and will likely contin?ue for the foreseeable future. China&#39;s rapid growth relies upon oil, and it currently consumes about 64% of Sudan&#39;s oil production. To gain access to that oil, China has been a staunch supporter of the Sudanese government, selling it some $100 million in arms between 1996 and 2003 alone. These weapons included jets and helicopter gunships, reportedly used for repression of civilians in the south as part of the now-terminated north-south conflict. The weaponry, including helicopters, which China sold to Sudan through the 1990s helped the government to target villages in the South during the long-running conflict with the Sudan People&#39;s Liberation Army (SPLA), resulting in massive civilian casualties and forced displacement, effectively depopulating Unity State in the south, as a means to remove populations from areas targeted for oil exploration by the Chinese National Petroleum Company. And Chinese companies have had no interest in curbing abuses by the Sudanese government, but rather have benefited from and facilitated them. The Sudanese army provided &quot;security&quot; to the Chinese company in question, the Chinese National Petroleum Company. The Chinese government helped to build the road that facilitated the attacks on civilians. While Western oil companies, based in countries which place human rights and conflict conditionalities upon investments, and in which companies can even face civil suits for commissioning of or complicity with human rights abuses, withdrew operations from Sudan, Chinese (and to a lesser degree Russian) companies seized the opportunity. Oil exploration and arms sales to the government of Sudan continued notwithstanding the north-south conflict and human rights abuses. <br /><br />That record provides a clue to likely Chinese behavior regarding Darfur: economic interests will probably trump any desire to pressure Sudan. Already, Chinese arms sales to the government continue despite despite UN Security Council Resolution 1591 of 2005, imposing an arms embargo to all parties to the Darfur conflict. Inevitably many of those have been reported to be in use in the conflict in Darfur, in particular through government air support for attacks on civilians by the janjaweed militias. The Sudanese government is engaged if, not genocide, then crimes against humanity, resulting so far in the deaths of some 200,000 and displacement of another 2.5 million people.<br /><br />China holds the concession for exploration of a huge tract of Sudanese territory, ranging from West Kordofan to large parts of Darfur. Given the patterns of displacement and attacks on civilians that have come with oil exploration elsewhere in Sudan , oil development could exacerbate what is already termed by Jan Egeland, the UN&#39;s chief humanitarian official, the world&#39;s worst humanitarian crisis.<br /><br />So much for China&#39;s interest in resolving the Darfur situation. Even if President Hu placed serious pressure on Sudan&#39;s President Bashir to accept the expansion of the UN Mission in Sudan&#39;s mandate and presence to cover Darfur, authorized by UN Security Council Resolution 1706 last August, it is unclear that Bashir can be pressured. He has already withstood intense pressure from the international community and has prevented the expansion of the mission currently on the ground to support the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the north and the south. The African Union (AU) mission has proven woefully unable to prevent janjaweed attacks and has several times threatened to withdraw before any handover is possible. Bashir has offered to support the AU mission, which is a bit like to fox offering to guard the henhouse. In this light the triumphant announcement by new UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, that Bashir seemed prepared to accept a joint AU-UN mission, must be regarded with some skepticism. Indeed, speaking on Monday at the AU summit, the Secretary-General placed public pressure on Bashir, an acknowledgment of Sudan&#39;s continued intransigence.<br /><br />That intransigence has continued despite a pressure and a snub by the African Union for the second year in a row. Last year&#39;s AU summit deferred Bashir&#39;s expected chairmanship of the organization because of the conflict in Darfur. This year, Bashir expected to take up the post, but neighbor Chad threatened to quit the organization if that happened. AU members instead chose the leader of Ghana to chair the continent&#39;s premier diplomatic body. This is perhaps particularly remarkable given the AU&#39;s, and African governments&#39; generally, reluctance to condemn states for internal activities, even atrocities. Instead, deference to sovereignty has been the norm, with states insisting that no action should be taken, or that any action should entail &quot;African solutions to African problems&quot;, which were generally not forthcoming. As I noted last year, in the
context of AU recommendations regarding the disposition of former Chadian dictator Hissene Habre, that deference seems to be eroding, and &quot;African solutions&quot; are being proffered.<br /><br />In the case of the AU mission, however, the solution is too weak. And unfortunately, even the repeated rejection of Bashir for the chairmanship seems unlikely to sway him. It certainly has not done so, so far.<br /><br />In light of the intransigence of the Sudanese government, it is perhaps not surprising that some are looking for leverage in the Chinese. Even the United States has apparently asked China to pressure Sudan. And the record, while extremely bad, is not all negative. On the positive side, China has encouraged Sudan to accept a UN peacekeeping mission, and did not veto resolution 1706, although it might have done. It also may have significant leverage in Sudan, precisely because of its investments there. It may have not only the leverage but the credibility, precisely because of its criticism of so-called Western human rights. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely, given Chinese economic interests, and the potential for Russian investors to replace Chinese ones, that strong pressure will be forthcoming or that Bashir would bow to it.<br /><br /><br /><em>Chandra Lekha Sriram is Professor of Human Rights and Director of the Centre on Human Rights in Conflict at the University of East London.</em><br />

President George W. Bush, for his part, was seeking tangible accomplishments to demonstrate that his administration retains vibrancy. Federal judicial selection is one prominent area in which bipartisanship could yield positive results.  If Republicans and Democrats work constructively together, they could fill the federal bench.<br /><br />            Throughout the Bush Administration, partisanship and contention have plagued judicial appointments.  When Congress assembled, there were 16 appellate, and 40 district, court vacancies out of 875 active lower court judgeships.  The openings are critical because they prevent litigation&#39;s expeditious, inexpensive and fair resolution, imposing unnecessary costs on litigants and the public.<br /><br />Several reasons can explain these vacancies.  Some accuse Democrats of blocking nominees' confirmation, despite the large 109th Senate Republican majority. Certain observers contend that many nominees were obstructed in the Judiciary Committee or were ignored on the Senate Calendar, so that the Committee and Senate leadership and the entire upper chamber were responsible. Others blamed the president for not submitting nominees or for continuing to renominate candidates the Senate clearly opposed. For example, Mr. Bush did not tender nominees for two 4th Circuit vacancies and renominated two candidates the Senate returned twice last year.<br /><br />Numerous measures could facilitate filling the 56 present openings. After the elections, Mr. Bush promised to work closely with Democrats who captured a Senate majority, and he later warned that the electorate wants more bipartisanship in Washington, pledging to find common ground. Nonetheless, Mr. Bush's lame duck renomination of five controversial nominees whom the Senate had returned on two occasions and granted no floor votes apparently conflicted with his bipartisanship calls. <br /><br />Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the new Chair of the Judiciary Committee, which exercises lead responsibility for the confirmation process, has indicated that Democrats would promptly confirm nominees who are smart, diligent and independent, have balanced judicial temperament and possess moderate legal and political views. Democrats will cooperate by expeditiously holding hearings and votes for the nominees and by scheduling Senate floor debates and votes. <br /><br /> Mr. Bush demonstrated that he wishes to confirm judges for all of the openings by taking several actions on Tuesday. The first and perhaps most important step was inaction by not renominating several controversial nominees. Second, the chief executive submitted to the Senate a package of five appellate court and 24 district court nominees, practically all of whom had been nominated when the Senate adjourned on December 9, 2006. The president may also want to consult Democrats by mentioning candidates who are under review prior to formal nominations while submitting nominees who possess the qualifications assessed earlier. If Republicans and Democrats follow these approaches, they can fill every vacancy.<br /><br /><br /><em>Carl Tobias is the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/tobias.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<title>FISA and Terrorist Surveillance: Building a Better Policy</title>

Keefer</a>, former senior counsel and chief of staff in the US Department of Justice Office of Legal Policy now teaching national security law at Charleston School of Law and practising with Haynsworth Sinkler Boyd, says that lawmakers, critics and the public at large should consider warrantless electronic surveillance and FISA in context, and welcome the Administration's development of a voluntary method for terrorist monitoring that works in concert with congressionally established parameters...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wendykeefer.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>ttorney General Alberto Gonzales recently informed Congress that President Bush would not reauthorize the Terrorist Surveillance Program ("TSP") conducted by the National Security Agency.  Critics of the TSP, rather than embracing the Administration's plan to proceed under an order or orders of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, continue to criticize the Administration and to characterize this change in policy as an admission of wrongdoing in the face of the new Democratic takeover of Congress.  Instead of insisting the Administration is unscrupulous or unlawful, lawmakers, critics and the public at large should consider these events in historical context and welcome the Administration's development of a voluntary method for working in concert with congressionally established parameters.<br /><br />Prior to enactment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ("FISA") in 1978, it seemed unquestioned that at least in certain circumstances involving the protection of national security, the President could engage in warrantless electronic surveillance.  From President Roosevelt to President Truman and beyond, United States Presidents authorized and engaged in electronic surveillance to obtain foreign intelligence information.  Indeed, only in a case involving domestic surveillance for domestic security purposes, the <em>Keith</em> case, did the Court suggest that Congress might create a separate warrant and judicial system for sensitive domestic matters.  <br /><br />Instead of directly heeding that advice, Congress opted to create a separate system, not for domestic surveillance related to domestic issues, but for foreign intelligence gathering &#8212; a topic previously left to the discretion of the Executive.  That system, established in 1978 by FISA, purported to be the exclusive means for undertaking electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes.  Merely asserting exclusivity, however, cannot alter constitutionally permissible activities of the Executive Branch.  President Carter's October 25th FISA signing statement recognized that this legislation for the first time required prior judicial approval for electronic surveillance.  If no warrant was required prior to FISA, it must be that the new FISA warrant and surveillance approval structure was not a constitutional mandate but merely a statutory requirement.  <br /><br />Much of the debate about the TSP focused on this issue:  whether the President had inherent or constitutional authority to engage in warrantless surveillance activities such that Congress could not, via a statute such as FISA, eliminate that authority.  Regardless what conclusion one reaches on this issue, it can hardly be debated that the President, as Commander in Chief, may undertake surveillance of the enemy and suspected spies on the military battlefield.  Interception of enemy communications was crucial to our nation's success in past wars.  It is no less important in the ongoing war on terror.  What creates constitutional dilemmas in this new battle is the prevalence of potential enemies within our own borders.  <br /><br />The new focus on gathering foreign intelligence within our borders led to several court challenges to the TSP.  Court cases were filed not only against the government but also against telecommunications providers who cooperated with the government in its operation of the TSP.  These cases no doubt distracted the government from its primary mission &#8212; stopping terrorists from again perpetrating atrocities on the United States and her people.  It is unfortunate that terrorists hide within our borders to plot against us &#8212; taking advantage of the freedoms and protections offered by our constitutional structure.  The government &#8212; both the Executive and Legislative Branches &#8212; is left to determine how to confront these enemies.<br /><br />Confronting both external and the new internal threats of terrorism presents new issues for our government and it must be expected that novel policies will be implemented, changed, and when necessary discarded to ensure the country's efforts to prevent future attacks are effective.  To be truly effective this prevention must both stop while protecting our liberty and freedom.  That the Administration has found a way to work within a congressionally created system &#8212; the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and the dictates of FISA &#8212; whether constitutionally required or not, should be viewed as an example of the best of government policy development, not the worst.<br />  <br /><br /><em>Wendy J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Chibli Mallat, visiting professor at Princeton University and a Middle East human rights lawyer who in 2003 turned down an invitation to join what became the Iraqi High Tribunal which eventually tried Saddam Hussein and sentenced him to death, says that sound legal process in the Saddam case was overwhelmed by passions unleashed by his rule, chaotic Iraqi politics after the US invasion, and the trial itself...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/chiblimallatnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>P</strong></font>assion runs high in Iraq, even by the standards of a Middle East where the Arab-Israeli conflict has been an emotional hotbed for almost a century. Every issue seems to befuddle rational action. The hanging of Saddam Hussein is the latest and perhaps strongest instance of Iraqi passion violently trumping reason and humanity. <br /><br />In twenty years of academic and political involvement in matters Iraqi, I have learnt the dangers of passions over Iraq, and not only amongst Iraqis. Those have affected anyone who has dealt with the country. It is palpable in the United States nowadays, where Iraq hardly leaves the limelight of front page news, but it was also true in the considerable struggle within the US government between the State and Defense Departments in the run-up to and aftermath of the March-April 2003 invasion, not to mention the CIA&#39;s dogged support for its own candidates in a determination that borders on the irrational. Successive episodes since at least 1995 show the depth of passionate struggle over Iraq, within the US government, in ways unwarranted by traditional bureaucratic rivalry. <br /><br />Nor did passion spare the UN: oil-for-food money consistently trumped any attempt to sway successive secretary-generals on the side of Iraqi human rights, and the period of direct UN involvement in Spring and early Summer 2004 was no less passionate, whether in the appointment and then brutal death of Sergio de Mello, or the heavy hand of his successor, Lakhdar Ibrahimi, who got embroiled with a fierce battle between contenders to the prime ministership in ways for which Iraq suffers to date. <br /><br />Passion over Iraq was not only American. In the 1990s, an extremely passionate argument developed between the late Edward Said and Kenaan Makkiyye, famous for authoring the <em>Republic of Fear</em> under the pseudonym Samir al-Khalil. Having then friendly ties to both, and not quite understanding the reasons why they should be so strongly opposed to each another considering their common inclination to denounce dictatorship and injustice, I tried to deflect the passion in their exchanges, which split the Arab intellectual community. I failed. Working with the Iraqi opposition leadership, I could see how passionate the animosity between its better protagonists despite their common goal of bringing Saddam Hussein&#39;s rule to an end. It proved extremely difficult to put together a working opposition, let alone a working government after their return to Baghdad in 2003. <br /><br />So I wasn&#39;t surprised at the amount of passion which the trial and execution of Saddam Hussein triggered, and the conflicting, excessive reactions before and since. Nor was the ugly end surprising, embroiled as the execution was in Iraqi bloody politics, with relatives of Muhammad Sadeq al-Sadr and Muhammad Baqer al-Sadr, respectable religious figures whom Saddam had assassinated in 1999 and in 1980, wanting to have a last jibe at a clearly unrepentant assassin. At least Saddam was buried in his village, but one may wonder how many people will die in the battle over his sepulchre. <br /><br />Passion and controversy will continue to run high. The trial is over for Saddam, but not for Ammar Bandar and Barzan Takriti, both now on death row. And in the middle of passion, few people noticed that the Appeals&#39; Court of the Iraq High Tribunal sentenced on 26 December a third person to death, Taha Yasin Ramadan. The Court held that the lower court&#39;s life sentence was too lenient, reversed it, and remanded his case for harsher sentencing to conform with its judgment. As the Anfal trial proceeds, with &#39;Chemical Ali&#39; standing in the dock for the killing of thousands of Kurdish Iraqis, passion will continue, this time of an ethnic-nationalist nature as opposed to the sectarian passion one has witnessed so far all the way to the gallows. <br /><br />I know from experience that the rule of law is often sacrificed in the tide of passion. One should try nonetheless, and hold on to one&#39;s ideals and beliefs in adverse moments. <br /><br />It is time to stay the hand of the executioner. Being for or against the death penalty is a strong personal choice, one that arouses great passion the world over. I have chosen to be against it, with no exception. That includes Saddam Hussein, who, of all mass murderers on earth since the end of the Second World War, probably deserved it most. This is not a mere personal conclusion about Saddam&#39;s rule. In the 1990s Max van der Stoel was in charge of the human rights file as UN Special Rapporteur for Iraq. He concluded in one of his reports that the exactions of Saddam Hussein&#39;s government were the worst since World War II. Still, no death penalty means no death penalty, and examples abound on the  wisdom of its abolition, from the wide revulsion at the execution of Nicolae Ceaucescu and his wife in 1989 - a sad blot on Eastern Europe&#39;s non-violent revolution &#8212; all the way back to the French Revolution. History would have kept a better place to &#39;the Incorruptible&#39;, Maximilien Robespierre, had he been consistent with his declared opposition to the death penalty. Instead, he turned into the architect of Terror, which claimed through judicial means thousands of innocents, after leaving his beliefs at the door of Louis XVI&#39;s trial in December 1792. &#39;Louis must die&#39;, Robespierre said, &#39;so that the Nation can live.&#39; Surely France did not need Louis to die, nor will Iraq owe its survival to the execution of Saddam Hussein. <br /><br />These are times that grip one&#39;s conscience. Maybe I could have saved Saddam Hussein, when colleagues on the then-Iraqi Governing Council asked me to sit on the Court. But I couldn&#39;t join the Court: there was a conflict of interest because I had helped establish Indict in 1996, whose mission was to bring Saddam and other mass murderers to trial. It was also difficult to contemplate living in Baghdad through what turned out to be an unprecedented butchery of witnesses, defence lawyers, and judges. But I made the case as strongly as I could that Iraq would be better served by an appropriately monitored &#39;reality camera&#39; for the rest of Saddam&#39;s life, rather than his execution, at a meeting held in Amsterdam in preparation of the Tribunal. I also made the argument that when Saddam Hussein was arrested, the death penalty had been frozen by the &#39;occupation forces&#39; in an order issued by Paul Bremer, and that a harsher penalty could not be meted on him without undermining basic principles of criminal law.<br /><br />Before the first decision was issued last November 5, I worked for the court to be moved abroad. Afterwards in a <a href="/forumy/2006/11/saving-rule-of-law-in-iraq-move.php">JURIST column</a> I urged that the appeal of the verdict be moved outside Iraq, and I even looked for jurisdictions where the death penalty was not officially banned to make the possibility more acceptable to Iraqis. I also made the argument that the Iraqi constitution, no less, required the president to sign the death warrant for Saddam. Why should the Prime Minister end up doing so against an explicit Article 70 vesting that essential responsibility in the president? <br /><br />Only in a place not overrun with high human emotions, as Iraq is, can one av
oid the contradictions between law and a reality gripped by passion. In Saddam&#39;s death, I can see the fate of so many Middle Eastern dictators and their families. When Saddam was arrested and filmed coming out from the spider-hole, Libyan dictator Qaddafi stayed mesmerized hours on end before the television set. Since then, his international policy has somewhat changed, though not his brutal home practice, and one knows that Saddam&#39;s copycat rulers in the Middle East will be shaken by his brutal demise. And so they should. What has Saddam Hussein achieved? His whole family, including wives and daughters, lives in exile and in fear of being surrendered to the Iraqi government when it stabilizes. Saddam Hussein killed his two sons-in-law, along with a grandchild. His two sons, and another grandson, were killed in a battle where they were doomed. He was removed from a hole, his head full of lice, to be incarcerated for two years while continuing to fan the flames of death and killings. His trial was the occasion of so many unnecessary deaths: almost a dozen people were killed in direct connection with the trial, including witnesses and families of witnesses and judges, and three defense lawyers, including two innocent souls assigned to him by the tribunal and one who served by his own choice. For what? Does any of his family or supporters believe that it was worth it? Wouldn&#39;t Saddam and his family, and so many others, be still alive had he relinquished power in March 2003 and gone into exile? More importantly, will those lesser figures than Saddam who rule the Middle East end up differently as hatred in society, their clinging to power for life, and the resulting spiral of death, turn them into increasingly harsh despots?<br /><br />What struck me most this past week is the contrast in the death of two former presidents. I could not stop thinking of Gerald Ford and Saddam Hussein&#39;s deaths, and the way their respective publics dealt with them. What explains the chasm between the controversies swirling in America in the last week of 2006, one about the pardon by Gerald Ford to Richard Nixon, the other about the way Saddam Hussein was put to death? What is it that makes us in the 21st century appear to be living on different planets? <br /><br /> <br /><em>Chibli Mallat is a visiting professor at the Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/staff.asp"><strong>Jonathan Hafetz</strong></a> [attorney for Ali al-Marri and Litigation Director,<a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/index.html">Brennan Center</a> Liberty &amp; National Security Project]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/federal-appeals-court-questions-bush.php">al-Marri case</a> raises critical issues in defining the limits of executive detention power. The government not claims the right to indefinitely detain without charge individuals arrested the United States but also asserts that non-citizens living in this country do not even have the right to challenge their detention by habeas corpus if designated an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; by the President. Under the government&#39;s view, the President can seize any immigrant off the streets of this country and subject him to prolonged incommunicado detention without any judicial review.<br /><br />The government&#39;s position contradicts the laws and Constitution of the United States. Congress has not suspended habeas corpus, and, therefore, al-Marri unquestionably has a right to challenge his detention by way of the Great Writ, which has served as a bulwark of individual liberty for centuries. The President&#39;s claim he can imprison al-Marri without criminal charge indefinitely, if not for life, is also unfounded. Indeed, if this claim were accepted, it would eviscerate the line between civilian and military jurisdiction in the United States and sanction unprecedented and unchecked domestic detention power.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/"><strong>Giovanni Di Stefano</strong></a> [defense lawyer for Taha Ramadan; Studio Legale Internazionale, Rome]: &quot;If <a href="/pdf/ramadanstatement.doc">this</a> [sworn statement by ex-Saddam VP Ramadan alleging torture by US personnel] is the manner in which my clients have been treated and indicative of how the US/UK security services conduct their interrogations then it is no wonder that there is so much opposition to the United States of America. This matter has been now reported to the UN Human Rights Commissioner but with the military might of the United States the reality is that not much any organization can do to curb these excesses. It is ironic that the civil case in the US District Court of DC against Saddam Hussein et al (including Taha Ramadan and Tariq Aziz) may now save Taha Ramadan&#39;s life primarily thanks to the Omar judgement, will now be used against the United States of America in a new suit which I will file for the same allegations. The continued disrespect for international law by the US/UK will truly indeed make those countries potential targets for those who oppose these methods of interrogations and turn such episodes into motives for attack. Saddam Hussein, Barzan Al Tikriti, Awwad Al Bandar were totally against violence as a means to an end. I know because they said so. But it is becoming more and more difficult to make the Iraqi people understand that Saddam, Barzan and Awwad were against vendetta action. They sought an Iraq governed and run by Iraqi people but not by means of murder. I am grateful to those within the US military that have deemed appropriate in the spirit of full disclosure the delivery to me of documents that should have been in my possession in 2006. Awwad Al Bandar complained to me that he had been promised by the US not to be prosecuted if he would testify against Saddam Hussein. Barzan Al Tikriti had also told me he had been promised nulle proseque if he testified against Saddam Hussein. Tariq Aziz has stated that when interrogated by the US/UK the sole line of interrogation was the relationship that George Galloway MP had with Iraq. I am calling upon the Secretary of Defense in the US to now call for an open and public enquiry into the treatment of those detained since 2003 including releasing the interrogations transcripts of Saddam Hussein, Barzan Al Tikriti, Awwad Al Bandar to ensure open justice. It must be done forthwith.&quot;<br />

		<title>US must not hand over Ramadan for Iraqi execution</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/"><strong>Giovanni Di Stefano</strong></a> [defense lawyer for Taha Ramadan; Studio Legale Internazionale, Rome]: &quot;The decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in the recent <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/dc-circuit-blocks-transfer-of-us-terror.php">case of Shawqi Omar</a> confirms the submissions we made in the cases of Saddam Hussein, Barzan Al Tikriti and Awwad Al Bandar; namely that the US government cannot use the question of jurisdiction to preclude our clients being protected by US law. In Omar the judges rejected the US contention that, although it has custody of Omar, US court jurisdiction is precluded because the forces are part of a multinational effort. This was the argument that the US Government successfully made in the case of Saddam Hussein on 29th December 2006. I was appalled by the conduct of the US, which handed over Saddam Hussein within 40 minutes of the DC Court&#39;s decision and allowed the Iraqi Government to execute him BEFORE I had an opportunity to appeal. The Omar case makes evident that had Saddam not been handed over until an appeal was made (as in the case of Omar) that appeal would have succeeded. It follows that the rights of any citizen before a US Court is no less than that of a US citizen. There cannot be a system of a fair trial and fair rights for US citizens, and less for others. Omar was a naturalized US citizen still holding Jordanian citizenship. <br /><br />In the <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/iraqi-tribunal-sentences-saddam-vp-to.php">case of Taha Ramadan</a>, I will now go to [US federal court] to preclude the US Government in handing him over for execution until his civil suit in the US is resolved. In the event the US hands him over prior to such, it may well be the case that those responsible for the decision will answer to the legal consequences in both the civil and criminal courts. It is time that the US ceased playing the part of Pontius Pilate in these matters and exhibited a respect for law and order. I am personally grateful to the US DC Circuit Court for having the intellectual courage to reach the correct decision in Omar. It is too late for Saddam Hussein, Barzan Al Tikriti and Awwad Al Bandar but may not be too late for others.&quot;<br />

		<title>North Carolina doctors should be commended for refusing to aid executions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://nodeathpenalty.org/content/index.php"><strong>Liliana Segura</strong></a> [Campaign to End the Death Penalty]: &quot;The Campaign to End the Death Penalty applauds the decision of the North Carolina Medical Board to <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/north-carolina-judge-blocks-executions.php">refuse physician participation in executions</a>, leading Judge Donald Stephens to halt executions in the state. The North Carolina doctors are just the latest in a growing trend of medical professionals who refuse to carry out state-sanctioned killing. In California last February, Judge Jeremy Fogel demanded that the killing of prisoner Michael Morales be carried out &quot;in a manner comparable to that normally used in medical settings&quot;, only to have medical personnel walk out at the last minute, refusing to go through with it, and effecting a de facto moratorium on the country&#39;s biggest death row. <br /><br />After a year when 17 death row prisoners were granted stays based on problems with lethal injection, executions are now on hold in ten states as a national debate develops over whether executions are cruel and unusual punishment.  In this context, states clinging to the death penalty will continue to call upon doctors to betray the Hippocratic oath and the ethical standards of the American Medical Association and carry out their deadly bidding. We stand in solidarity with those in the medical community who call lethal injection torture. But we also believe this is only one part of the death penalty&#39;s injustice. Even if it were possible to &quot;fix&quot; the procedure, the 30 years since the reinstatement of the death penalty in the U.S. have taught us that there is no fixing the racism, class bias, corruption, and human error that define capital punishment in this country.   They are as much a part of the &quot;machinery of death&quot; as the needle and the gurney.  The time to abolish the death penalty is long overdue.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://globalintegrity.org/index.cfm"><strong>Jonathan Werve</strong></a> [Director of Operations, <a href="http://globalintegrity.org/index.cfm">Global Integrity</a>]: &quot;Global Integrity, an independent nonprofit group tracking corruption and governance trends worldwide, has followed with interest the recent appeal to eject <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/nigeria-vp-named-on-commission-list-of.php">allegedly corrupt Nigerian MPs</a> from party lists. Our experience shows that political leadership in the legislature is key to improving all areas of governance. <br /><br />The 2006 Global Integrity Report, released last month, shows that worldwide the mechanisms that hold government accountable tend to be less strictly applied to legislatures than they are to executives, judges and the civil service. It&#39;s not hard to imagine why; while MPs are happy regulating asset disclosure, gifts, hospitality, and conflicts of interest in others, one suspects there is less enthusiasm for taking the same medicine themselves. <br /><br />The Global Integrity Country <a href="http://globalintegrity.org/reports/2006/nigeria/index.cfm">Report for Nigeria</a> shows that it follows this pattern. While implementation is still very poor, there are at least basic regulations to prevent corruption in the civil service. Our report shows that the Nigerian legislature has managed to avoid several of these safeguards. Disclosure of an MP&#39;s assets, for instance, is mandated by the constitution, yet this information is never available to the public or press, and these asset statements are not audited. Without strong political will in the legislature itself, this is unlikely to change.&quot;<br />

		<title>US senators should back Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="www.stopclustermunitions.org"><strong>Thomas Nash</strong></a> [Cluster Munition Coalition Coordinator]: &quot;Efforts to ban or restrict the use of cluster munitions are ongoing in dozens of countries around the world and have been spreading in response to growing awareness of the humanitarian problem and increased pressure from civil society. Most prominently Belgium banned the weapon in February 2006 and Norway instituted a permanent moratorium in November 2006. The two most recent countries to be added to the list of states where parliamentary initiatives are underway on cluster munitions are the UK and US, two of the biggest users of the weapon over the past decade.<br /><br />In the UK a draft bill to prohibit cluster munitions has passed through the House of Lords to the House of Commons. This bill would prohibit the use, production, trade and stockpiling of cluster munitions. Whilst public support for a prohibition on cluster munitions is strong in the UK (polling suggests 81% favour a ban) the government and the main opposition party both oppose this bill.<br /><br />In the US a <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/feinstein-leahy-introduce-bill-limiting.php">bill has been introduced</a> that would prohibit all cluster munitions with a failure rate of more than 1% - a policy standard to which all newly acquired cluster munitions must already adhere. The bill would also prohibit the use of any cluster munitions in or near populated areas. From one perspective of most campaign groups this proposed legislation does not go far enough, clearly a prohibition on cluster munitions rather than regulation would offer the most protection to civilians. Using percentage failure rates to determine the legitimacy of a weapon prone to indiscriminate use and effects during and after attacks is neither a sound logical approach nor an adequate humanitarian response.<br /><br />The actual implications of this bill in the US though are extremely far reaching. If taken seriously and adhered to strictly, using realistic and transparent tests to measure failure rates, it would prohibit all but some 30,000 sensor-fuzed weapons stockpiled by the US (which would also be excluded under the draft UK law because they are precision guided.) This would put out of service nearly a billion stockpiled submunitions, the very weapons that sparked an international campaign against cluster munitions. Although the US draft bill contains a presidential waiver it is difficult to envisage a situation where national security depended on the use of cluster munitions with high failure rates.<br /><br />All Senators concerned with the protection of civilians during and after conflict should give their full support to this bill, which offers the most effective and achievable chance for real progress in the US on a key humanitarian issue. Passage of this bill would move the US out of the ranks of Russia, China, Pakistan and others that refuse to acknowledge the need for action on this problem and into the ranks of those progressive states already committed to taking action on cluster munitions.<br /><br />As 43 states, many of them with ongoing parliamentary processes, meet in Oslo this week to work out a plan to develop, negotiate and conclude a new international treaty on cluster munitions by 2008, this bill offers a sign that even in the major user and producer states the calls for action are strong and growing. This bill comes at an important moment in time and deserves the support of all Senators.&quot;<br />

		<title>Nashville English language ordinance unnecessarily divisive</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.nprjlaw.com"><strong>A. Gregory Ramos</strong></a> [North, Pursell, Ramos &amp; Jameson PLC; Nashville For All]: &quot;On February 6 in Nashville, TN, the Metropolitan Council, the legislative body for Nashville and Davidson County, TN (&quot;Metro Council&quot;), <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/nashville-city-council-approves.php">passed</a> a <a href="http://www.nashville.gov/mc/ordinances/bl2006_1185.htm">controversial and much debated English language ordinance</a>. The announced purpose of this ordinance, according to its sponsor, is to  prohibit certain Metro government communications from being translated or interpreted into languages other than English.<br /><br />The ordinance itself is not about the importance of the English language. On the contrary, virtually everyone, including those critical of the ordinance, agrees that it is very important for the residents of Nashville to be able to communicate effectively in English, the common and unifying language of this country.  Learning the English language however, especially for adults, is a gradual process that requires time and patience.  There is no empirical evidence to show that an English language ordinance, such as the one passed in Nashville on February 6, hastens or even assists this gradual process.  Additionally, on January 16 the Metro Council itself, by way of a <a href="http://nashville.gov/mc/resolutions/rs2007_1724.htm">resolution</a> (Resolution No. RS2007-1724) as opposed to an ordinance, formally reaffirmed the significance of English to Nashville&#39;s culture. During debate on the resolution, the members of the Metro Council learned that Nashville immigrants are eager to learn English but often have little access to formal learning opportunities. Community English classes have waiting lists and backlogs, and unfortunately, the English language ordinance does absolutely nothing to address this situation.<br /><br />During the debate and in response to the English language ordinance that ultimately was passed on February 6, <a href="http://www.nashvilleforall.com/">Nashville For All</a> was formed.  Nashville For All is a broad coalition of groups that values Nashville&#39;s reputation as diverse, friendly and welcoming, and believes Nashville residents benefit greatly from the city&#39;s growing prominence as the International City of the South.  Nashville For All strongly believes the English language ordinance is unnecessarily divisive, has limited practical significance and enforceability, and will have the unfortunate effect of erecting artificial and symbolic barriers for the city&#39;s international residents and guests.  Additionally, the English language ordinance broadcasts to the world that the Metro Council for Nashville and Davidson County does not value the contributions of its newest residents and supports a policy of exclusion.  Nashville For All believes the English language ordinance is bad for business, economic development, local government, and the community.&quot;<br />

		<title>The Bush Administration believes in international law...when it&#039;s convenient</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/staff.asp"><strong>Aziz Huq</strong></a> [attorney for Shawqi Omar; <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/index.html">Brennan Center For Justice</a>]: &quot;When does the Bush Administration love international law?<br /><br />For those who have followed the Administration&#39;s seemingly implacable hostility to the International Criminal Court and the Kyoto Protocol, the answer has seemed to be &quot;never.&quot; <br /><br />But when it comes to its quest for unchecked powers in the name of national security, international law can become suddenly convenient. In a sequence of cases, the Administration has argued that if it can claim to be acting in the name of an &quot;international authority,&quot; then it has unfettered power to detain U.S. citizens and non-citizens alike. And in the cases of two U.S. citizens swept up in the Iraq conflict, it has told federal courts to get lost: So long as there is a &quot;United Nations&quot; sign on the door, a court cannot look in to make sure the government is acting in conformity with the law and the Constitution.<br /><br />That&#39;s why a judicial decision issued a few days ago by the federal court of appeals in Washington, D.C. is so important: It rejects the government&#39;s new grasp at essentially unchecked detention power almost wholesale. <br /><br />The decision is in a case called <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200702/06-5126a.pdf">Omar v. Harvey</a>, and it concerns a <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/dc-circuit-blocks-transfer-of-us-terror.php">U.S. citizen who&#39;s been detained</a> by U.S. officials in Iraq for almost two and a half years (caveat emptor, I argued the case in the D.C. Circuit for Mohammad Munaf). The government took the position that even though it was a U.S. official who held the jailhouse key, and even though his chain of command ended in Washington, D.C., there was no judicial review &#8212; even for a U.S. citizen. <br /><br />Sound familiar? It should: This is a variant on a basic theme the government has been sounding now for five years: that of the legal black hole. First, it was Guantanamo that was the area of darkness. Then it was the term &quot;enemy combatant,&quot; a label that the Administration used to stop all inquiry into its detention decisions. The argument that a U.N. label means the end of all judicial review is simply the latest in a string of government claims at unchecked detention power. <br /><br />The Court of Appeals rejected this argument &#8212; and rightly so. The government&#39;s argument would have not just applied to Iraq. There is no logical reason why it should not also apply to the homeland. <br /><br />As Fritz Schwarz and I explain in our forthcoming book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unchecked-Unbalanced-Presidential-Power-Terror/dp/rate-this-item/1595581170">Unchecked and Unbalanced: Presidential Power in a Time of Terror</a>, such claims by the government to stand above the rule of law are nothing new. In the Cold War, what the intelligence agencies did was, for all practical purposes, an area of darkness. The courts didn&#39;t know and Congress didn&#39;t care. What ensued was error piled on abuse: Cointelpro, the spying on MLK, and misbegotten covert operations in Cuba and Chile.<br /><br />The stakes are higher today: It is no longer a case of lone agents ignoring the Constitution. It is now executive branch policy to warp the law to the end of creating unlimited spigots for executive power. The argument for unlimited detention power with an &quot;international&quot; or &quot;foreign&quot; label is both the most recent of these, and should receive no more credit than past efforts at evading judicial oversight.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp"><strong>Emi MacLean</strong></a> [attorney, Guantanamo Global Justice Initiative, <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>]: &quot;On Friday, the Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/us-re-charging-guantanamo-detainees.php">announced charges</a> against three detainees in Guant&aacute;namo - Omar Khadr, Salim Hamdan, and David Hicks. These three men promise to be test cases. Their proposed commission hearings will force an examination of the intelligence value of the military base at Guant&aacute;namo, the coercive interrogation tactics that have been roundly criticized, and the unbalanced procedures authorized by the Military Commissions Act rushed through Congress on the eve of the midterm elections. Each had been charged under the prior military commissions, which were subsequently declared illegal by the Supreme Court in June 2006, and are now charged a second time under military commissions which purport to have a congressional stamp of approval.<br /><br />The renewed charges against these three men demonstrate the serious flaws of the new military commissions, and the indefensibility of the continued indefinite detention at Guant&aacute;namo. The jurisdiction for the commissions rests in part on the determination of a procedurally flawed &quot;combatant status review tribunal&quot; (CSRT) that the accused are &quot;unlawful enemy combatants.&quot; In the CSRT proceedings, detainees are denied access to counsel, and determinations are made based on secret evidence and statements made through coercive interrogations. Some of the charges have no basis in the law of war, including providing material support for terrorism and conspiracy. And, as before, the allegations against the three men are largely based on claims about membership in or association with groups, with minimal allusions to evidence that would demonstrate each individual&#39;s direct involvement in internationally accepted war crimes.&quot;<br />

The Nashville Chamber, which remains for legal immigration and comprehensive immigration reform at the federal level, maintains this ordinance is an ill-conceived law that is both unnecessary and unfortunate. Everyone recognizes English as the official language of Nashville, the state of Tennessee and the United States. No on is challenging this. <br /><br />Our leadership and community partners in fighting this law strongly believe such legislation would be costly to comply with and defend if challenged in court. Legal opinions by Metro&#39;s legal counsel confirm this.<br /><br />The Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce and others are working hard every day to stimulate economic growth for the Nashville region.

		<title>New Mexico death penalty repeal bill should become law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://legis.state.nm.us/LCS/legdetails.asp?Name=181"><strong>Rep. Gail Chasey</strong></a> [New Mexico House of Representatives]: &quot;I am delighted and encouraged, although not surprised, that the New Mexico House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/new-mexico-house-passes-death-penalty.php">passed a bill to repeal the death penalty</a> by 41-28 votes on Monday, February 12. This is now the second time in four years that the House has voted to repeal the death penalty in New Mexico. Although I am cautious, I feel an increasing sense of optimism that the bill will pass the Senate and that Governor Richardson will sign the bill into law. This will not be easy and perhaps the greatest hurdle will be convincing Governor Richardson: (1) that the death penalty is a public policy failure; and (2) that leading the country on this issue will distinguish him and will garner profound respect and support both nationally and internationally.<br /><br />Passage of <a href="http://legis.state.nm.us/LCS/_session.asp?chamber=H&type=++&number=190&year=07">House bill 190</a> reflects a growing awareness of the problems which plague the death penalty, not just in New Mexico but throughout the United States. Thirty-five Democrats, joined by six Republicans cast their votes on Monday against an exorbitant, ineffective, and error-prone system which is imposed unfairly on the basis of race and socio-economic status and perhaps most importantly of all, risks executing the innocent. Other compelling arguments voiced by legislators during the floor debate included that the death penalty fails murder victims&#39; families, fails law enforcement and severely undermines the credibility and stature of the United States among its international allies, many of whom consider the death penalty a violation of fundamental human rights, entirely incompatible with basic principles of fairness and democracy. <br /><br />A unique aspect of the repeal bill is that it was not introduced in isolation. It is part of a legislative package. The repeal bill is accompanied by several bills which provide for meaningful and expanded support and services for murder victims&#39; families. This legislation provides that some of the funds that the state of New Mexico would save by abolishing the death penalty shall be redirected towards the families of murder victims. <br /><br />Murder victims&#39; family members have been a vital and compelling force within the New Mexico abolition movement. Their courageous and heart-wrenching testimonies, together with their articulate and passionate explanations of their opposition to the death penalty have undermined the traditional reason so often invoked by prosecutors and law enforcement representatives, namely that we need the death penalty for the victims&#39; families. Although murder victims&#39; families are drastically and understandably split on the issue of the death penalty, there is common ground between all of the families. It is the purpose of our legislation to find that common ground and provide victims families with meaningful assistance in their time of grief. By abolishing the death penalty we further hope to free up resources which can be redirected towards proven crime prevention measures&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;measures which will reduce violence and will save innocent lives&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;possibly the single most important concern of all murder victims families.&quot;<br />

		<title>UN Mission to Darfur should be non-negotiable</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bec Hamilton [representing the <a href="http://www.genocideintervention.net/index.php">Genocide Intervention Network</a>]: &quot;In April 2006, the UN General Assembly established the Human Rights Council to replace the much beleaguered Commission on Human Rights. In December 2006, the 47-member Council held a special session to discuss the situation in Darfur. Its decision to send an independent mission of experts to assess the situation in Darfur was adopted by consensus and Sudan itself agreed to the resolution. However this week, the Sudanese Foreign Ministry stated it would <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/sudan-to-block-un-rights-team unless.php">deny the UN Mission entry to Sudan</a>.<br /><br />This about-face by the Government of Sudan should be viewed as &quot;business as usual&quot; in terms of how Khartoum plays politics with the international community. When it agreed to the UN Mission in December, its eye was on its upcoming bid for the Chairmanship of the African Union (AU). The AU remains the only organization with a presence on the ground in Darfur to protect civilians - - Sudan&#39;s bid to chair the AU was an attempt to allow the fox to guard the hen house (their bid was appropriately denied at the AU Summit in late January this year). Although it served Khartoum&#39;s interests to appear to be complying with the Human Rights Council&#39;s resolution before the AU Summit, it should have been obvious that they would take any opportunity to prevent the resolution actually being implemented when the time came.<br /><br />The Sudanese Foreign Ministry is now objecting to the UN Mission, claiming that one of its members, former Acting UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, Bertrand Ramcharan, is biased. But if it was not this excuse, it would be something else - - at the end of the day, having independent experts verify the ongoing devastation in Darfur is the last thing the Government of Sudan wants. Even the International Criminal Court (ICC), backed by a Security Council resolution authorized under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, has conducted its investigation into war crimes committed in Darfur without setting foot inside Darfur.<br /><br />Nobel Peace Prize winner, and head of the UN Mission, Jody Williams is sticking to her guns, asserting that &quot;This is the mission composition today and this is the way it&#39;s staying.&quot; Williams approach is the only way to deal with the Government of Sudan&#39;s attempt to thwart the UN Mission. To give in to Khartoum&#39;s demands and replace Ramcharan would not only compromise the independence of the UN Mission, but it would send a signal to other human rights violating governments that the resolutions of the Human Rights Council are negotiable. This would set the Human Rights Council on a path to becoming the &quot;non-credible threat&quot; that its predecessor was.<br /><br />If the Government of Sudan holds its ground, the only option may be to take the route of the ICC and conduct an investigation from outside Darfur. More likely though, is that the Government of Sudan will ultimately give in to Williams&#39; tough stance - but not until it has stalled for long enough to generate significant media coverage of its argument that the UN Mission is biased. In doing so it will hope to preemptively undermine the ultimate findings of the UN Mission, and delay its work to the point that it is left without the time or access it needs to conduct a thorough assessment. Such are the well-rehearsed tactics of a genocidal regime. If Khartoum finally does allow the Mission in, let us hope that the international community does not exercise its equally well-rehearsed response - of praising the Government of Sudan for accepting something that should have been non-negotiable in the first place.&quot;<br />

		<title>Military Commissions: War Crimes Courts or Tribunals of Convenience?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Geoffrey_Corn.htm">Geoffrey S. Corn</a>, Lt. Col. US Army (Ret.) and former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters, now a professor at South Texas College of Law, and JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a>, also a former lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps and now a professor at New England School of Law, say that although the new US military commissions recently established by President Bush under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 may look like war crimes courts staffed by military professionals, a reading of the statute and its attendant manual of procedures suggests they are something more (or less)...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/geoffreycornnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/forumy/hansennew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>ne of the most controversial legal issues related to the US &quot;Global War on Terror&quot; has been the decision by President Bush to establish military commissions to try "enemy combatants." Serious questions related to the procedures originally established for these military tribunals culminated in the Supreme Court's decision last June in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> to invalidate the original construct for the commissions. Last week, however, trials by military commission were formally re-initiated when President Bush issued an executive order to try alien enemy combatants under the terms of the new Military Commissions Act.<br /><br />Although the revised commission process is much improved from the original construct, many doubts linger about the legitimacy of the new tribunals. Much of this doubt stems from a persisting and rather fundamental question: what is the purpose of creating these tribunals? Are they intended to serve the legitimate purpose of leveraging the unique competence of the profession of arms to sit in judgment of alleged violations of the laws of war? Or are they intended to serve the much less credible purposes of simply providing a more "convenient" forum to adjudicate crimes that do not fall into this category, or even worse did not even exist when the commissions were created? A review of the punitive articles of the Military Commission Act and the elements for these crimes established by the new Manual for Military Commissions suggests an unfortunate conclusion.<br /><br />In October last year, Congress responded to the Supreme Court's invalidation of the President's order creating the military commissions by providing statutory authority for their resurrection. This took the form of the Military Commission Act of 2006. Much of this new statute reflects the recommendations by many military and civilian experts to model military commissions on existing courts-martial. While many of these provisions are substantial improvements from the original construct, others have drawn intense criticism, including the habeas-stripping provision and the authority for the introduction of coerced statements. However, it is the punitive articles &#8212; the part of the statute establishing the actual offenses available to the military commission prosecutors &#8212; that expose the overly broad nature of this continuing government effort to "square the circle". <br /><br />This section of the MCA begins by indicating that purpose of the statute is to "codify offenses that have traditionally been triable by military commissions" and that the statute "does not establish new crimes that did not exist before its enactment, but rather codifies those crimes for trial by military commission." However, because jurisdiction of military commissions has historically been derived from the laws of war (with the exception of the "martial law" jurisdiction discussed by the Supreme Court in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>, a theory of jurisdiction clearly inapplicable to enemy combatants), jurisdiction has also been historically limited to violations of the laws of war. Accordingly, the reference in the statute to "offenses that have been traditionally triable by military commissions" must be understood to refer to violations of the laws of war.<br /><br />The actual enumerated offenses, however, seem to stray far from this jurisdictional mooring. They include not only the offense of conspiracy (considered invalid by a plurality of the Hamdan Court), but other inchoate offenses, offenses against the judicial process, terrorism, hijacking, and material support to terrorism, none of which can legitimately be characterized as "traditional" war crimes, but are instead "traditionally" considered violations of domestic law. Vesting the military commission with jurisdiction over these type of offenses seems inconsistent with the assertion that the statute merely codifies offense previously triable by military commission. More troubling, vesting the commission with jurisdiction over offenses beyond the special competence of the profession of arms suggests that convenience result facilitation is the principal purpose of the statute.<br /><br />The recommendations to emulate established courts-martial also resulted in the explicit grant of authority for the development of rules to implement the statute, rules that were recently published as the Manual for Military Commissions, or MMC. Like the Manual for Courts-Martial, the MMC puts the proverbial "flesh on the bones" of the MCA. It provides pre-trial, trial, and post-trial procedures for the trial of alien enemy combatants. It also provides the elements for the offenses established by the MCA. Like the Manual for Courts-Martial, these elements articulate the proof requirements for each offense. Clarifying the elements of proof through such a process would be considered unremarkable for military practitioners. What is remarkable, however, is how the MMC appears to actually transform the nature of the offenses it is purportedly clarifying. <br /><br />One clear example of this transformation is with the offense of killing a protected person. Under the MCA the offense is defined as follows; "Any person subject to this chapter who intentionally kills one or more protected persons shall be punished by death or such other punishment as a military commission under this chapter may direct." However, the MMC defines the elements of this offense as follows (1) The accused without justification or excuse, intentionally and unlawfully kills a protected person; (2) The accused knew or should have known of the factual circumstances that established that person&#39;s protected status; and (3) The killing took place in the context of and was associated with armed conflict.<br /><br />The MMC's clearing of the path of obstacles for the prosecution is both telling and troubling. Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice there are several crimes where the status of the victim serves as an aggravating factor. Examples include; assault on an officer/non-commissioned officer under Article 128, assault on a sentinel or look-out under Article 128, disobeying a superior officer under Article 91, and disrespect towards a superior officer under article 89. All of these offenses require the prosecution to prove that the accused knew the victim's status. Likewise with the offense of premeditated murder under Article 118, one possible aggravating factor which could warrant a death sentence is the status of the victim as an officer, non-commissioned officer, or law enforcement official in the performance of their duty. In order to prove this aggravating factor, the prosecution is required to prove that the accused knew of the victim's special status. It is telling that by abandoning the proof of knowledge requirem
ent on this issue in favor of a negligence standard, the MMC is departing significantly from long established proof requirements under the UCMJ.<br /><br />This articulation of elements is also troubling, for it raises a serious question of whether the MMC has fundamentally altered the nature of the statutory offense. This is because the MMC has limited the requirement to prove the mens rea of intent to only the act of killing. According to the MMC, it is not necessary that the government prove that the accused had knowledge of the protected status of the victim, even though the offense is defined as an intentional killing of a protected person. Instead, the government need only prove that the accused was negligent with regard to the victim's status. As long as the accused knew or should have known of the victim's status, he may be guilty of this offense. Reducing the defendant's mens rea to negligence on this point, makes this an easier case for the government to prove. However, it also seems to transform an offense that is properly derived from the law of war &#8212; the intentional killing of a protected person &#8212; to an offense beyond the scope of that source of prohibition by eliminating the requirement of knowledge of the status of the victim. <br /><br />There is no authority in the MCA for the Department of Defense to effectively redefine and lessen the proof requirements of the statute. If the MCA represents the codification of already existing crimes under the law of war (which is itself questionable), it appears that as codified by Congress the killing of a protected person requires the accused to know of the victim's status. Yet with sleight of hand, the MMC states without citation or reference to any legal authority that the standard is actually a negligence standard of know or should know. <br /><br />The nature of the offenses established by the MCA and the apparent use of the MMC to modify the nature of these offenses is both telling and troubling. By disconnecting the realm of available offenses from a solid mooring to the laws of war, the military commissions are invariably disconnected from the pragmatic foundation that has historically justified such tribunals. No matter what procedural changes may have been implemented by the MCA, this most fundamental question about the legitimacy of these tribunals will persist until the charges genuinely reflect that law from which the authority for such tribunals is derived. Until then the military commissions will be rightly viewed as a tribunal implemented for the convenience of the government. <br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S.

While much public attention has focused on the unlawful nature of Khodorkovsky's persecution and seizure of his company Yukos (as detailed in our recent <a href="http://www.robertamsterdam.com/Abuse%20of%20State%20Authority%20in%20the%20Russian%20Federation.pdf">White Paper</a>), many people fail to realize that the Kremlin's campaign has extended far beyond just the defendant and his company to target the very lawyers who are simply doing their job of defending the constitutional rights of their client.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the first unmistakable signals of the Kremlin's attack on the Khodorkovsky legal team was my <a href="/forumy/2005/10/wake-up-call-khodorkovsky-and-rule-of.php">middle-of-the-night visit</a> from plainclothes FSB officers and my subsequent expulsion from the country. This was followed by the tragic and baseless <a href="http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/01/grigory_pasko_political_prison_3.htm">imprisonment of lawyer Svetlana Bakhmina</a> last April. And now, with hearings resuming over the new money laundering charges being applied to Khodorkovsky, again his legal team is facing a barrage of threats, acts of intimidation, interference, and arbitrary arrests.<br /><br />In response to this harassment of the legal team, we are posting here an <a href="http://www.robertamsterdam.com/MotionMoskalenkoGPO%20%23254619.pdf">important nine-page statement</a> from noted human rights defender Karinna Moskalenko, which details the violations and irregularities perpetrated against counsel by the Russian Federation in this case. The fact that these aggressive tactics are still being used in the 21st century, and the fact that the rulings of Russian courts are still being granted the presumption of regularity by foreign courts, poses a threat to all of us, as the Russian procuracy feels increasingly emboldened with the impunity to treat lawyers as they see fit. Unless the basic rights of lawyers are protected, and a minimum level of professional standards are observed and enforced, there is little hope for rule of law to ever take root in Russia. <br /><br />Moskalenko's statement must serve as wake up call to the international legal community to demand that Russia respect the rights of counsel to defend their client. While today it might just be the Khodorkovsky case, tomorrow these tactics may extent to your business or simple civil dispute. Russia's courts must not be allowed to become a mere instrument of the executive.<br /><br /><br /><em>Robert Amsterdam is international defense counsel for Mikhail Khodorkovsky</em><br />

		<title>Apologizing to Maher Arar: A Beginning, Not an End</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.faisalkutty.com">Faisal Kutty</a>, vice-chair and counsel to the <a href="http://www.caircan.ca/">Canadian Council on American Islamic Relations</a> and a doctoral candidate at Osgoode Hall Law School York University in Toronto where he also practices law, says that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper&#39;s apology to Maher Arar provides a unique opportunity to address the erosion of civil and human rights in Canada&#39;s own &quot;War on Terror&quot;...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/faisalkutty.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>&quot;M</strong></font>y priority right now is to clear my name," said Maher Arar during his first public appearance in 2003 upon his return after being tortured for over a year in Syria. The Canadian Arar Commission findings which cleared him and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's recent apology &#8212; which came after months of negotiations -- go a long way in helping Arar fulfill his first wish, even though some believe the apology did not go far enough (Harper apologized "for any role Canadian officials may have played", while the Commission squarely blamed Canadian and American officials). <br /><br />The Syrian-born Arar was detained by U.S. authorities on September 26, 2002, during a stopover in New York en route from Tunisia to Canada. The Canadian citizen was subsequently sent to Syria for torture under the controversial American practice of "extraordinary rendition" even though he had repeatedly requested that he be sent to Canada. He was eventually released and returned to Canada in October 2003 after Canada put pressure on Syria.<br /><br />According to the inquiry called after public outcry in Canada, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service agents acted on false and misleading information supplied by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The comprehensive inquiry which lasted more than two years was headed by Ontario's Associate Chief Justice and cost the public purse more than $16 million. The Commission findings paved the way for the Prime Minister's formal apology to Arar on behalf of the Canadian government and an offer of $10.5 million plus legal fees to a settle a lawsuit launched by Arar. <br /><br />Canada's top cop, RCMP Commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli, resigned as a result of the Maher Arar controversy.<br /><br />Meanwhile, American authorities are refusing Canada's request to purge Arar's name from U.S. watch lists. His inclusion on U.S. lists effectively excludes Arar from at least one third of the world's nations, according to his lawyers. U.S. Senator and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Patrick Leahy has threatened to hold extensive hearings into Arar&#39;s case, lambasting the US&#39;s removal of Arar to Syria as absurd and outrageous and noting that instead of sending Arar a &quot;couple of hundred miles to Canada and turned over to the Canadian authorities... he was sent thousands of miles away to Syria.&quot; He has called for the U.S. to apologize to Arar as well.<br /><br />Arar and his wife, Monia Mazig, are true champions and will push this matter as far as they can &#8212; hopefully getting a "terrorism-free" stamp from U.S. officials through the courts eventually. In addition to the Canadian lawsuit which was just settled, Arar has launched a separate lawsuit against American authorities. The U.S. suit revolves around the practice of his deportation to certain torture. <br /><br />Yet, the Arar settlement in Canada does not close the book. It only opens a new chapter of a book that is about more than Maher Arar &#8212; it is about the erosion of civil and human rights in Canada as a result of the "War on Terror."<br /><br />The Arar saga brought into focus the unintended victims of draconian laws and policies hastily enacted post 9/11 in Canada and south of the border. It also shed light on the potential of religious and racial profiling inherent in such laws and practices.<br /><br />We can only hope that Arar's second wish which was to "make sure this does not happen to any other Canadian citizens in the future," will also come true. For this to happen, however, more people must realize that due process and fundamental rights must be respected at all times and more so during times of real or perceived crisis when society has a tendency to overreact.<br /><br />At the broader level, we hope that this admission of responsibility signifies a renewed interest in addressing the myriad issues emanating from the "War on Terror." Canadians must demand that the government:<ul><li>Speedily implement all of the recommendations made by Justice Dennis O'Connor with respect to National Security, essentially centering around the issues of accountability, transparency, national security oversight, checks on information sharing, etc.<br /><br /><li>Ensure that the public inquiry into allegations similar to Arar raised by Canadians, Abdullah Almalki, Ahmed Elmati and Muayed Nuredin moves forward in an open, transparent and public manner in order to have the confidence of the Canadian public. <br /><br /><li>Seriously evaluate the impact of Canadian anti-terror laws and policies, but also the impact of U.S. laws and policies on Canadians, particularly those of Muslim and Middle Eastern heritage. The differential treatment of Canadian citizens based on religion and origin at the border must be vociferously opposed or a travel advisory be issued. The government must express strong opposition to the extra-territorial application of American laws effectively forcing Canadian companies on domestic soil to discriminate against citizens based on origin if they wish to contract with the United States. We took a stand against the Arab boycott of companies dealing with Israel &#8212; why is this any different? Surely, there are ways to ensure security while upholding the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. <br /><br /><li>Ground the No-Fly list , which will be shared with other countries and to which names will be added, no doubt, based on information from foreign sources before it takes off in the next few weeks. As confirmed by the Arar case, the information may be unreliable and, in fact, may even be obtained through illegal methods. The arrangements and protocols for information sharing with foreign governments and agencies must be reconsidered. <br /><br /><li>Reevaluate the ground realities in terms of racial and religious profiling by police and security agencies. As the Canadian Justice Department's own study concluded two years ago, Canada has fallen behind even the U.S. and Britain in taking steps to combat this "high-profile and pressing issue." Those are the Justice Department's words, not mine. <br /><br /><li>Stand up for Canadian citizen Omar Khadr, sent to Guantanamo Bay from Afghanistan at the age of 16. Canada should join the other nations, including staunch U.S. allies such as Britain and Australia, who have spoken out for their citizens and even had a number of them released. Khadr's guilt or innocence is not the issue &#8212; he must be treated, charged and tried in accordance with international standards or be released.<br /><br /><li>Reexamine the security certificate process under which five Muslim men are detained without charges or even a chance to challenge the "secret" evidence against them -- which even a number of Federal Court judges and even a high ranking intelligence officer has questioned and expressed concerns about. The Canadian Supreme Court is set to render its decision soon in three security certificate appeals &#8212; but whatever the decision, the government should scrap them as contrary to our notions of fairness and justice.</ul>As Arar said during his press conference upon his return to Canada:<br /><br />"What is at stake here is the future of our country, the interests of Canadian citizens, and most importantly Canada
&#39;s international reputation for being a leader in human rights where citizens from different ethnic groups are treated no different than other Canadians."<br /><br />With his apology and settlement, the Prime Minister helped raise Canada's stature one notch in the eyes of many local and foreign observers. It's time to continue onto the next chapter in the book.<br /><br /><br /><em>Faisal Kutty is a Toronto lawyer and doctoral candidate at Osgoode Hall Law School of York University.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law says that Vladimir Putin&#39;s insistence on the illegality of using force abroad without UN authorization may be technically correct, but it irresponsibly undercuts new interpretations of international law allowing humanitarian intervention even in the face of Security Council deadlock...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kellyupdated.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>R</strong></font>ussian President Vladimir Putin chastised President Bush in a speech at the 43rd annual Munich Conference on Security Policy on Feb. 10 for America&#39;s illegal and unilateral use of force outside the parameters of the United Nations. Specifically targeting Bush&#39;s revitalization of the old preventive war doctrine (used most recently to invade Iraq), Putin noted that even with the backing of NATO or the EU, international law prohibits use of military force without the backing of the Security Council, over which Russia wields a veto. President Putin technically has a point on the merits. The U.N. Charter makes no room legally for operating outside its provisions with respect to military action absent an invocation of Article 51&#39;s self-defense provisions, which require an armed attack to trigger a return military response. Thus, from the standpoint of the Charter, America&#39;s 2001 invasion of Afghanistan was legal while its 2003 invasion of Iraq was not. Secretary-General Kofi Annan noted that distinction on several occassions.<br /><br />However, President Putin misses the point, probably intentionally, on the current state of international law with respect to unauthorized humanitarian intervention. Kosovo was a major test case in this regard. During the ethnic cleansing of that province by Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in 1999, the U.S., Britain and France attempted to move the Security Council to intervene. Russia and China balked, aware that such precedent for allowing intervention by foreign powers in a state&#39;s &quot;internal affairs&quot; could be turned back on them and their brutal repression of Chechens in Russia and Tibetans and Muslims in China. In the face of a frozen Security Council and a mounting humanitarian disaster, NATO undertook round-the-clock bombing of Serb ground forces and targets within Serbia proper until Milosevic relented and recalled his forces. NATO then managed the return of refugees to Kosovo, which project later came under the mantle of the United Nations. Secretary-General Annan recognized this as a newly emerging customary norm.<br /><br />President Putin is seizing the opportunity to condemn American unilateralism around the world, which the vast majority of states have already condemned (along with President Bush&#39;s shaky legal theory on preventive war) to advance his own agenda of shoring up the notion that states remain masters of what goes on within their borders. While it remains true that complete sovereignty over one&#39;s territory is the rule rather than the exception of the state-centric system of international law, there are exceptions. Even 19th Century scholars such as Woolsey recognized that humanitarian intervention could be undertaken by foreign powers against the will of the state being interfered with if the gravity of humanitarian concerns were great enough, citing the 1827 intervention by Britain, France and Russia against the Ottoman Turks on behalf of the beleaguered Greeks. Needless to say, Westphalian sovereignty prerogatives were much more muscular back then than today. <br /><br />The Russian leader also assailed any further expansion of NATO eastward toward his country as an unnecessarily threatening move, and condemned the extension of a U.S.-backed anti-ballistic missile shield over NATO territory in Europe. From the perspective of Moscow, blunting the ability of military alliances like NATO to intervene militarily around the world without U.N. backing is becoming more personal the closer that alliance creeps toward the Russian border. However, pulling down the supports underpinning a newly useful theory of humanitarian intervention for completely self-interested reasons is unbecoming for a permanent member of the Security Council which, after all, is supposed to be filling its seat in that capacity with a fiduciary duty to act on behalf of the 187 nations not so represented.<br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J. Kelly is Professor of Law at Creighton University School of Law in Omaha, Nebraska. His recent article on this subject is </em>Pulling at the Threads of Westphalia: "Involuntary Sovereignty Waiver"&acirc;&#8364;&#8226; Revolutionary International Legal Theory or Return to Rule by the Great Powers?, 10:2 <em>UCLA Journal of International Law &amp; Foreign Affairs (2005), available at</em> <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=960581">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=960581</a><em></em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/Port.asp">Kenneth Port</a> of William Mitchell College of Law says that the looming amendment of Japan&#39;s so-called &quot;pacifist&quot; constitution to overtly allow greater Japanese military involvement in world affairs may prove to be one of the more tragic consequences of the so-called war on terror...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kenport.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>lthough few in the West realize it, the Japanese &quot;pacifist&quot; Constitution drafted by post-World War II occupation forces - principally Americans under General Douglas MacArthur - is about to be amended.<br /><br />The present Constitution already exists in a strange limbo between law and fact. The Japanese populace-at-large is very proud of living in a &quot;pacifist&quot; State. They believe that their Constitution, generally assumed to ban &quot;collective self-defense&quot; (in international law, using force to stop an armed attack on a foreign country with which a state has close relations, even when the state itself is not under direct attack), constrains militarism in Japan. Under the present Constitution, however, Japan has quietly amassed the third largest military budget in the world in total dollars spent. Now the new Japanese government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe apparently wants to translate fact into legal reality, just in time to cooperate militarily with President Bush&#39;s &quot;war on terror.&quot; <br /><br />When Abe and his supporters in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) - which is neither liberal nor democratic - talk of &quot;amending&quot; the Constitution, they are not, however, talking about simply altering the wording of one part of the document, or even just adding one or two Articles in the American &quot;amending&quot; style. Rather, the result of amendment will likely be a wholesale redrafting of the document which will have a critical impact on the nature and manner of Japanese international and domestic policy, and the most significant development in Japan since World War II.<br /><br />A major focus of the amending debate will be Article 9, the so-called &quot;war renouncing&quot; clause of the Constitution. Article 9 is often quoted as requiring that &quot;land, sea and air forces and other war potential will never be maintained.&quot; The language &quot;will never be maintained&quot; is, in fact, the standard, accepted translation of that portion of Article 9.<br /><br />This English translation is not, however, a literal translation of the Japanese document. The English version supports the notion that Japan is a pacifist country, but the Japanese version does not. <br /><br />The English version is cited whenever the Japanese Constitution and Article 9 are raised. This error has been carried forward for nearly 60 years. The literal Japanese version of Article 9 does not say &quot;will never be maintained.&quot; If that were the case, the Japanese version of the Constitution would say something like &quot;issai hojishiteha naranai.&quot; It does not. It only says &quot;hojishinai.&quot; Translating &quot;hojishinai&quot; as &quot;will never maintain&quot; is incorrect and extremely misleading. This clause merely means the negative form of the verb &quot;to maintain&quot; in the illocutionary force.<br /><br />This is more than just semantics. This is a major, substantive difference. &quot;Hojishinai&quot;, in the illocutionary force of the verb, is like saying something similar to, &quot;I will return at 6.&quot; Without more information, the listener does not know if the speaker of that sentence is promising to return at 6 or merely predicting the speaker will return at 6. This is the problem with the actual, literal Japanese version of Article 9. When reading it, one does not know if Japan is promising to not maintain arms or only predicting it will not maintain arms.<br /><br />The evolution of the language used in this clause of Article 9 is apparent from the legislative history of the Constitution and quite supportive of the Japanese notion that Article 9 manifests Japan&#39;s pacifist intentions. In March of 1946, what became Article 9 of MacArthur&#39;s draft was initially translated into Japanese as &quot;senryoku no hojiha koreo yurusezu.&quot; This version could be translated as &quot;war potential will not be allowed.&quot; Later, in the version of March 26, 1946, this clause read &quot;ijisurukotoha koreo yurusanai.&quot; The verb for &quot;maintain&quot; was changed from &quot;hoji&quot; to &quot;iji&quot; but otherwise clearly indicates that the maintenance of war potential will not be allowed. An even later version, dated April 13, 1946. once again used the word &quot;hoji&quot; for &quot;maintain&quot; but stayed with the verb &quot;yurusanai&quot; meaning &quot;not allowed.&quot;<br /><br />While the negotiations regarding the Constitution progressed during the spring and summer of 1946, many Japanese Privy Council members went on record concluding that Article 9 prevented Japan from having any war potential for any reason. Many members believed that Article 9 did not allow Japan to possess any military potential for any reason. Moreover, many members believed that if Japan were militarily attacked, someone else would have to come to her defense. Many members believed that there were ways to defend Japan from military attack other than engaging in the use of military might herself. (What that was precisely is not clear from the record.) In the legislative history kept by the National Diet Library, this is all very clear. In fact, the June 21, 1946 version of Article 9 actually said &quot;senryoku ha koreo hojishitehanaranai.&quot; This is precisely the current English translation: &quot;military power will never be maintained.&quot;<br /><br />Unfortunately, a short time thereafter, in August of 1946, Ashida Hitoshi, another Privy Council member, proffered what has become known as the &quot;Ashida Amendments.&quot; Most relevantly, the clause in question was changed again to its current &quot;hojishinai.&quot; This got lost in the shuffle because he also added an introductory clause to that same part of Article 9 restricting the application of the notion of not maintaining arms to &quot;for purposes of paragraph 1&quot; of Article 9. All attention was apparently on that clause and not on the changes made that resulted in &quot;hojishinai.&quot; That is, as the Japanese Constitution currently reads, military potential will not be maintained for purposes of waging a belligerent war. Nothing in the current version of the Japanese Constitution says anything like &quot;will never maintain&quot; for any purpose whatsoever. The notion that it does is a fiction perpetuated by many.<br /><br />One can see this understanding is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the Japanese Constitution as articulated by Privy Council members during the summer of 1946. The only problem is that is not what the final version of the Japanese Constitution actually says.<br /><br />This has not stopped the Japanese government from relying on Article 9 of the Constitution as justification for everything from not selling missile guidance technology to America, not engaging in military armed conflict in a collective manner in Iraq (Japan&#39;s contingency in Iraq has been limited to non-military roles, such as building water purification plants), and (initially) not sending Aegis-class destroyers to the Indian Ocean to support American troops in anti-terror operations.<br /><br />The direction the LDP now wants to take Japan in with its proposed amendments is very clear. Article 9, for example, used to be titled &quot;The Renunciation of War.&quot; The proposed new title will be &quot;The Guarantee of Security.&quot; The clause addressed above (Art. 9-2) will be repealed. It w
ill be replaced with four new Articles that clarify that the Prime Minister shall be the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces (still called &quot;Self Defense Forces&quot; or SDF), that the SDF will act in accordance with the law or other &quot;approvals&quot; of the Diet, that the SDF will be allowed to engage in collective self-defense when done &quot;to assure international peace and security&quot;, and the SDF may engage in activities to secure the life and liberty of Japanese citizens.<br /><br />Japan is now the third largest military in the world by dollars spent. The Constitution as it currently reads does not prevent this. The legislative history to the Constitution is clearly inconsistent with the final language selected for the Constitution. The understanding that the Japanese Constitution is a pacifist document is in complete and utter error. The Japanese people&#39;s intent may be pacifist, but their Constitution is not, and will be even less so when the latest amendments are made.<br /><br />Therefore, when the Japanese Constitution is amended, accurate translations must be had to determine what the true Japanese intent might be. Certainly the LDP&#39;s version of the amended Constitution will no longer perpetuate the myth that the Japanese are pacifists. But amending the Constitution so that Article 9 is no longer an obstacle to Japan&#39;s military involvement in world matters and no longer acts as a crutch supporting the Japanese myth of pacifism might prove to be one of the more tragic consequences of the so-called war on terror.<br /><br /><br /><em>Kenneth Port is a professor at William Mitchell College of Law.

Secretary of Defense Robert Gates insisted a few days ago, however, that the United States is not planning a war. [<a href="#1">1</a>] Let's hope Gates is speaking the truth because in the circumstances of today the United States has no legal basis to use significant armed force on the territory of Iran.  If we learn nothing else from the Iraq debacle it should be the high price of unlawful war. <br /><br />International law provides only two bases for the lawful use of force: self-defense and Security Council authorization.  The Security Council refused to authorize America's tough economic sanctions package against Iran, so there is little likelihood it would authorize a military strike. [<a href="#2">2</a>] <br /><br />As for self-defense, in an NPR interview on January 31, Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns invoked United Nations Charter Article 51 with respect to our relations with Iran (although he also said the U.S. is not planning a war). [<a href="#3">3</a>]   Article 51 provides an exception to the Charter's general prohibition on the use of force.  States have the right to use force in individual and collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs.  Secretary Burns seemed to suggest that such a right exists vis-&Atilde;&nbsp;-vis Iran.  In fact of all Iran's many infractions, none qualify as a trigger for the right of self-defense, meaning that there is no right to use major military force on Iran's territory. <br /><br />The International Court of Justice (ICJ) clarified in the 1986 <em>Nicaragua Case</em> that it is not just any attack that triggers the right of self-defense: the attack must be significant. The Court said "the concept of armed attack includes &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; acts by armed bands where such acts occur on a <em>significant scale</em>." [<a href="#4">4</a>] The Court said that the supply of weapons did not amount to an armed attack nor could mere frontier incidents give rise to the right to use force in self-defense. [<a href="#5">5</a>]<br /><br />Moreover, to be acting in lawful self-defense, any response to a significant attack must be defensive in nature.  States may not act out of motives of revenge, future deterrence or punishment.  The victim of an initial attack may respond in self-defense if there are on-going attacks or, at the least, if it has clear and convincing evidence that more attacks are imminent. <br /><br />The Court also said there is no right of "collective counter-measures."  In other words, while a victim of a significant armed attack may request the help of other states in collective self-defense, there is no collective right of response to lesser wrongs. [<a href="#6">6</a>] The Court added that a victim state must formally request other states to join it in collective self-defense. [<a href="#7"> 7</a>] The Court was concerned to limit third state involvement in conflicts and interpreted the Charter provisions on collective self-defense narrowly. [<a href="#8">8</a>]<br /><br />This is all common sense.  The rules on the use of force in international law are intended to restrict armed conflict as much as possible.  International law is a peace regime, not a war regime.  The right of self-defense is an exception for emergency situations only.  Indeed, the right to use force in self-defense ends when the Security Council takes effective action.<br /><br />The Bush Administration is complaining about several actions by Iran at the current time. Iran is allegedly supplying weapons and training to fighters inside Iraq. [<a href="#9">9</a>] It may be doing the same regarding Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon.  It has sponsored acts of terrorism, such as bombing a Jewish community center in Argentina. [<a href="#10">10</a>] Iran is defying the Security Council by refusing to end its program for enriching uranium. [<a href="#11">11</a>] These are all serious international wrongs; none of them, however, may be righted by the significant use of American force on the territory of Iran.<br /><br />This is not only because none of the acts meets the threshold to allow for lawful use of force in self-defense; it is also because the United States is not the victim of these wrongs. Burns alleged that Iran is killing Americans in Iraq.  But the U.S. is in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi leadership, namely Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.  Attacks in Iraq, even on Americans, are still attacks against Iraq.  Therefore, Iraq is the state with the legal authority to respond to such wrongs.  Maliki, a Shi'a Muslim with close ties to Iran, seems very unlikely to take forceful countermeasures against Iran.  But it is Maliki who has the authority to make such a decision, not President Bush.  If the U.S. does not like how Maliki is responding to American deaths, its option is to pull Americans out of Iraq and sue Iraq for failing to make efforts within its capacity to protect Americans.<br /><br />Indeed, in response to a United States military briefing in Baghdad on February 11 about alleged Iranian weapons shipments to Iraq, the Iraqi deputy foreign minister was quoted after the briefing in the <em>Washington Post</em> as saying, "'If they [the Americans] have anything really conclusive, then they should come out and say it openly, then we will pick it up from there and use diplomatic channels' to discuss it with Iran&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;." [<a href="#12">12</a>]<br /><br />It may be, however, that the United States is not really interested in responding to the wrongs it is complaining about, but rather is developing a pretext for attacking Iranian nuclear research sites.  Iran may have aspirations to acquire nuclear weapons in violation of its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. [<a href="#13">13</a>] While unlawful and open to countermeasures, the acquisition of nuclear weapons is not an armed attack giving rise to a right of self-defense. Thus, the U.S. simply has no right to take armed action against Iran for developing nuclear weapons.  <br /><br />So the U.S. may be talking up Iran's involvement in Iraq just now as an alternative basis for justifying an attack.  It may not, however, justify bombing Iranian nuclear research sites in response to Iranian support for insurgent groups, incursions into Iraq, or similar conduct.  If any of these actions gave rise to the right to use force in collective self-defense, the response would have to aim at ending the conduct giving rise to the right as required by the fundamental principles of necessity and proportionality.  States may only use force if necessary to accomplish a lawful end and only that force proportionate in terms of the loss of civilian life and property to the value of the military objective.  Even the Security Council is limited in what it can authorize with respect to military force under these principles. As the ICJ said in the <em>Nuclear Weapons</em> case, "'there is a specific rule whereby self-defence would warrant only measures which are proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it, a rule well established in customary international law'.  This dual condition applies equally to Article 51 of the Charter, whatever the means of force employed." [<a href="#14">14</a>] <br /><br />Even if the development of nuclear weapons was a lawful trigger to armed self-defense, bombing will have little or no effect on the research program bu
t would, in all likelihood, result in widespread civilian casualties and terrible destruction.  In order to degrade Iran's nuclear program, the U.S. would have to bomb heavily populated areas all over the country.  Yet, according to <em>Newsweek</em>, "the generals are convinced that no amount of firepower could do more than delay Tehran's nuclear program." [<a href="#15">15</a>]  Killing and destroying in such a pointless exercise would clearly violate the restraints of necessity and proportionality.<br /><br />Thus, any use of force against Iran by the United States based on a claim of individual or collective self-defense would be unlawful in the current circumstances.  The Bush Administration has attempted to change the law as it applies to the U.S. in its National Security Strategies of 2002 and 2006, but one state alone cannot change the law&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;not even the United States.  The world community just re-affirmed the UN Charter rules on the use of force at the World Summit in September 2005, in effect rejecting the U.S. attempts to re-define the law. [<a href="#16">16</a>]<br /><br />Some may argue that the international legal regime on self-defense is too restrictive, that it does not give the "good guys" enough options to defend themselves against rogue states with leaders like Ahmadinejad.  But the "good guys" should be employing diplomacy, turning to armed self-defense only in situations involving significant armed attack.  The proven strategy that works to end nuclear weapons programs is not force anyway, but diplomacy: South Africa gave up nuclear weapons and transformed itself into a nation that respects international law and human rights. Libya elevated its status almost overnight when it ended its nuclear weapons program.  Making a generous offer to North Korea right now to give up its program could be very valuable toward persuading Iran to do the same. <br /><br />By exercising diplomacy rather than engaging in the unlawful use of force, the U.S. would go a long way toward convincing the international community that it has the best interest of the Middle East in its plans, not another war.<br /> <br />------------------<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes<br /><br /><a name="1">[1]</a> <em>Gates: U.S. Can Prove Iran's Iraq Role</i>, ASSOC.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.johnmcgee.org/"><strong>Senator John McGee</strong></a> [Idaho State Senate; sponsor of a <a href="http://search.state.id.us/search97cgi/s97_cgi.exe?action=View&VdkVgwKey=http%3A%2F%2Fwww3%2Estate%2Eid%2Eus%2Foasis%2FS1157%2Ehtml&doctype=raw&Collection=2007+Session+Legislation#billtext">bill</a> to block illegal immigrants from using most taxpayer-financed public assistance programs]: &quot;We are a nation of immigrants. Legal immigrants have played, and continue to play, an integral and welcome role in our country&#39;s growth and development.<br /><br />But the key word is &quot;legal.&quot; <br /><br />In the last 15 years, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/idaho-senate-passes-bill-targeting.php">&quot;illegal immigration&quot; has become a baffling problem</a> that puts enormous financial and social pressure on states all over the nation, including Idaho.  <br /><br />Of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in this country, the Pew Hispanic Center estimates that two-thirds have been in the United States for 10 years or less &#8212; and 40% of those (4.4 million people) have been in the country for less than 5 years. <br /><br />Our systems of welfare, education, law enforcement, health care, and employment benefits are being stretched not only to provide help for tax-paying citizens, but also to absorb the demands of people who have broken the law to enter the country, and then break the law again by accessing support programs to which they have no legal entitlement. <br /><br />The federal government has had little success in stopping the flood of illegal immigrants into this country. But once the illegal immigrants have broken the law and entered the country, the states &#8212; not the federal government &#8212; must pay for benefits like welfare education, health care, and law enforcement.  <br /><br />This federal failure to solve the illegal immigration problem thus has imposed a de facto &quot;unfunded federal mandate&quot; on states.  <br /><br />It&#39;s time for states to address the illegal immigration problem on their own level. In fact, many already are doing that. Last year, 30 states passed some 57 laws to crack down on illegal immigrants, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That flurry of legislation reflects states&#39; mounting frustration with federal inaction. <br /><br />Now Idaho has begun taking action to protect the education, health care, employment and legal systems that are paid for by and designed to help our citizens, not illegal immigrants.  <br /><br />Last December, then-Gov. Jim Risch issued an executive order directing state agencies to provide their services only to people who are lawfully entitled to work in Idaho. I&#39;ve now introduced a bill that will write that same requirement into state law, and Gov. Butch Otter also backs action on the state level.<br /><br />My legislative proposal will build on the federal standard known as &quot;Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements&quot; (SAVE). The SAVE program gives local/state governments and businesses the tools to verify that applicants are lawfully present in the United States before granting a variety of tax-supported benefits. <br /><br />Simply put, if people can show proof of legal residency (such as an Idaho driver&#39;s license, a U.S. military ID, a passport, or a valid Social Security number), they can access the services they need.  <br /><br />Waiting on Congress to solve a problem can be a recipe for delay and frustration. Idaho must do what we can to address the illegal immigrant problem on our own state level.  <br /><br />Otherwise, the drain on taxpayer resources and services will simply continue and increase, eroding our ability to provide those services to people who are legally entitled to receive them.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/"><strong>Giovanni Di Stefano</strong></a> [defense lawyer for Taha Ramadan; Studio Legale Internazionale, Rome]: &quot;The defence counsel team for Taha Ramadan have filed with the IHT [Iraqi High Tribunal] the <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/saddam-vp-asks-iraq-tribunal-to-lift.php">appeal in the re-sentencing of Mr Ramadan</a> which substituted life imprisonment to that of the death sentence. I have also taken the steps at requesting President Talabani under the extenuating circumstances to commute the sentence of death to that of life imprisonment as permitted under Iraqi Law. I have deposited the request for commutation with the Iraqi Embassy in Rome since President Talabani was unable to receive such personally whilst I was in Jordan having returned from Baghdad attending my clients. The grounds of appeal are based upon well established recognised laws. <br /><br />Whatever is decided by the Appeal Court in Baghdad (which incidentally is the same Appeal Court that without solicitation of the Prosecutor referred the sentence of life imprisonment back to the Trial Court) I hope that President Talabani will use the powers vested in him to intervene under these circumstances. We have seen the aftermath of the three executions and the ICC has opened an investigation pursuant to my request dated 16th January 2007 into the executions. If Iraq is to heal then in any healing process any bleeding must be stopped. It is why this execution must be halted to avoid further spillage of blood. President Talabani has now to decide which path he prefers to take Iraq and any reconciliation must commence with the commutation of any death sentence.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="www.nmjg.com"><strong>Victor Kelley</strong></a> [President, National Military Justice Group; Civilian Counsel to Corporal Trent D. Thomas, USMC]: &quot;I am a retired Marine and my profession since &quot;retirement&quot; is the defense of service members accused of crimes under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  If someone has a better job than I, I haven&#39;t met him.  I have the privilege of traveling the world, defending those who defend America.  <br /><br />Last summer I received a call from Corporal Trent D.Thomas&#39; wife, asking if I would represent her husband.  Corporal Thomas is one of eight who are being charged with murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy in the Hamdaniya incident in Iraq last April.  Along with Marine Major Haytham Faraj, Senior Defense Counsel Camp Pendleton; and Major Dale Saran, Instructor, the United States Naval Justice School, we are Corporal Thomas&#39; defense team.<br /><br />The required brevity of this submission to JURIST is such that my comments here must be limited.  Suffice to say that Corporal Thomas has served his country with distinction during three combat tours in Iraq.  During his second deployment to Iraq he was wounded in battle while attempting to save the life of a fallen brother during the battle for Falujah.  He was awarded the Purple Heart, the Combat Action Ribbon, and meritoriously promoted to corporal.   <br /><br />Trent is married &#8212; he &quot;celebrated&quot; his third wedding anniversary this past week.  He and his wife, Erica, have a beautiful two year old daughter whom they affectionately call &quot;Bear&quot;.  <br /><br />Corporal Thomas has now been confined &#8212; he is at the Camp Pendleton Brig &#8212; for eleven months.  If convicted the maximum jurisdictional limit of the court is life without the possibility of parole, and a dishonorable discharge.  His trial is to begin at Camp Pendleton California on June 18, 2007 and I anticipate will last two to three weeks.  He will plead &quot;not guilty&quot; to all charges and specifications.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="www.norml.org"><strong>Allen St. Pierre</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="www.norml.org">NORML</a>, Washington, DC]: &quot;[The <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/ninth-circuit-rules-drug-laws-can-be.php">recent Ninth Circuit ruling</a> in <em>Raich v Gonzales</em> (part II)] is troubling on a few different levels. One, from a lay person&#39;s point of view, it appears that the court has ruled that the supremacy of the federal government&#39;s law making abilities trumps individual&#39;s freedoms, liberties and abilities to engage in medical self-preservation.<br /><br />Second, the United States Supreme Court, along with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in this case, appears to have created a great impediment for individual citizens to effectively challenge government actions or law-making that deprive citizens of property, access to medicine or life itself unless the aggrieved citizen can prove that their liberty (or potential loss of such therein) is in fact a &quot;fundamental&quot; liberty or one that is derived from &quot;ordered liberty.&quot;<br /><br />The definition of &#39;fundamental&#39; by judges is subject to extremely broad or very narrowly constructed interpretations. One can argue that &#39;Raich&#39; grants far too much judicial subjectivity regarding individual judges&#39; definition of the word &#39;fundamental&#39; and how that interpretation casts the citizen&#39;s constitutional claims against an over-zealous government.<br /><br />Also, the court erred in constructing the legal history of medical cannabis in its attempt to demonstrate that the medicinal use of cannabis was not &quot;deeply rooted in the nation&#39;s history or traditions.&quot;<br /><br />The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals wrongly asserts that between 1970 and the passage of California&#39;s Prop 215 in 1996 there was a dearth of concern in America and in the medical profession in researching and employing medicinal cannabis. <br /><br />The court failed to recognize the well-documented history of legal challenges (NORML v. DEA), administrative proceedings (Gettman, NORML, et al v DEA) and states&#39; legislative efforts to effectively end the federal government&#39;s mis-scheduling of cannabis in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. The court failed to recognize that medical cannabis was only made illegal in 1937; the federal government was successfully sued by medical cannabis patient Robert Randall, which led to the federal government creating the Compassionate Investigative New Drug program in 1976, a program that to this day supplies selected medical patients with over 300 pre-rolled cannabis &#39;joints&#39; per month; 35 state legislatures between 1982-1994 passed legislation requesting the federal government re-schedule cannabis for medicinal purposes or, pending amending legislation in Congress, re-scheduled cannabis at the state level; and the legislative history in California between 1992-1996 where two medical marijuana bills passed the legislature, but were vetoed by then Governor Wilson.<br /><br />Again, it appears as if the court has effectively told Ms. Raich and other seriously sick Americans that the federal government and its courts can arrest sick, dying and sense-threatened medical patients, even when those actions and prohibition of their physician-recommended medicine are known to harm individuals and/or their health.<br /><br />Rightly, confusion abounds in the legal and medical communities post-<em>Raich</em> because <em>Lawrence v. Texas</em> in 2003 defined the liberty unconstitutionally infringed by anti-sodomy laws quite broadly, as &quot;a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.&quot;<br /><br />One wonders how Ms. Raich, a seriously ill medical patient, who, with her physician&#39;s recommendation, needs immediate access to medicinal cannabis, does not qualify for the same individual protections (and liberties) aptly described in <em>Lawrence v. Texas</em> or the &quot;careful&quot;, not narrow, description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest described in <em>Washington v. Glucksburg</em> (1997)?&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm"><strong>Ben Davis</strong></a> [University of Toledo College of Law]: &quot;I have been greatly troubled reading the censored transcript of the hearing of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed before the Combat Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) - antechamber to the Military Commissions created under the Military Commissions Act of 2006. As I read what Mr. Mohammed said, my immediate reaction was &quot;A mechanism is grinding - this man needs a lawyer, not a personal representative.&quot; When I learned that Senators Carl Levin and Lindsay Graham were permitted to watch the proceedings by closed-circuit television, I was reminded of the one-way mirror scene in the movie <em>The Good Shepherd</em>, and my disquiet was heightened.  Finally, I note that no Supreme Court Justice was invited to watch also - an unusual step but possibly something that might have been warranted.  I suspect all these CSRT&#39;s will get to the Supreme Court years from now and we will read a dissent like that of Justice Rutledge in <em>Yamashita</em> - maybe even one written by Justice Scalia.  Why do I speak of Justice Scalia?  See below.<br /> <br />By happenstance last week I met Justice Scalia and heard him speak passionately of his respect for Associate Justice Robert H. Jackson and - in particular - of Jackson&#39;s dissent in the <em>Korematsu</em> case.  I commend to all those now reading and watching the news about Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the other high-value detainees and the CSRTs to read the full text of Justice Jackson&#39;s address to the American Society of International Law on April 13, 1945 entitled <a href="http://www.roberthjackson.org/Man/theman2-7-7-1">The Rule of Law Among Nations</a>. I excerpt only a few sections that resonate strongly today.   <br /> <br />Justice Jackson said:<BLOCKQUOTE>... But all experience teaches that there are certain things you cannot do under the guise of judicial trial.  Courts try cases, but cases also try courts.<br /><br />    You must put no man on trial before anything that is called a court, if you are not prepared to establish his personal guilt.  I do not, of course, mean that every step must be taken in accordance with technical common law rules of proof.  The evidence to be received depends upon what the circumstances make available.  But there is no reason for a judicial trial except to reach a judgment on a foundation more certain than suspicion or current rumor.  Men of our tradition cannot regard as a trial any proceeding that does not honestly seach for the facts, bring forward the best sources of proof obtainable, critically examine testimony.  But, further, you must put no man on trial if you are not willing to hear everything relevant that he has to say in his defense and to make it possible for him to obtain evidence from others.  Nothing more certainly discredits an inquirry than to refuse to hear the accused, even if what he has to say borders upon the immaterial or improbable.  Observance of this principle is of course bound to make a trial something of a sounding board for the defense.  We all remember the war guilt trials which were begun by the Nazis and their collaborators in France.  The Court was at once put to the choice of suppressing the defense or of allowing the trial to become an instrument for disseminating the views of the accused.  Any United Nations court that would try, say, Hitler or Goebbels would face the same choice.  That is one of the risks that are taken whenver trials are commenced.  The ultimate principle is that you must put no man on trial under the forms of judicial proceedings if you are not willing to see him freed if not proven guilty.  If you are determined to execute a man in any case, there is no occasion for a trial; the world yields no respect to courts that are organized to convict....<br /><br />    I merely say that our profession should see that it is understood that any trials to which lawyers worthy of their calling lend themselves will be trials in fact, not merely trials in name, to ratify a predetermined result.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>If Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is as evil a man as he is said to be, I do not understand why we are so fearful of using mechanisms that provide transparency throughout the CSRT process - a process that opens ourselves to review as we stand in judgment of someone who is considered an enemy of the state.  The Nazis at Nuremberg had their own lawyers. Mr. Mohammed should have one too - one of his choosing.<br /> <br />As a Kuwaiti, Kuwait could assert diplomatic protection of him.  However, that does not appear to have happened.  No other nations are available to assert diplomatic protection normally.  So, it is left to citizens of the United States not only to tell the United States to protect us, but also to insist that certain things not be done in our name.  If we are silent to the wisdom of Justice Jackson, then we are silent to not only our best selves but to our core selves.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> [Washburn University School of Law]: &quot;Making a sensible reversal, the Bush Administration has decided to negotiate with Syria and Iran, the two Muslim nations of the so-called Axis of Evil. (The US is already talking to North Korea, the third nation of the Axis).<br /><br />This policy reversal is in line with the letter and spirit of the UN Charter that urges nations to resolve all outstanding disputes through negotiation, conciliation, mediation, and other peaceful methods. The policy of invasions and threats of force in international relations is unlawful. It has also failed to achieve satisfying results. The invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq have been utter disasters and the threats of force to North Korea and Iran have hardened these nations to pursue nuclear weapons. (Covert threats even to Pakistan have emboldened this ally to say &#39;no&#39; to a proposed policy of murder and destruction in the tribal areas, which would destabilize Pakistan more than it would eliminate terrorists.)<br /><br />The US policymakers must realize that the use of force has limited utility. Dealing with Muslim nations will be easier if they are respected and consulted. The Bush Administration must abandon the fallacious &quot;neoconservative thesis&quot; that Muslim nations understand nothing but the logic of bloodshed.<br /><br />Muslim Iran is a sophisticated nation, the author of a long history and a proud civilization. So is Syria. The US cannot reduce Iran and Syria to &quot;dangerous and irresponsible regimes.&quot; Such characterizations are contrary to the dynamics of negotiation. The international community will welcome the development that saner heads have prevailed in the Bush inner circle and a decision has been made to shun the rhetoric of evil and undertake the serious business of resolving disputes through good faith and compromise.&quot;<br />

		<title>Quick Supreme Court review of Al Odah/Boumediene needed</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp"><strong>Lynne Kates</strong></a> [attorney, Guantanamo Global Justice Initiative, <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>]: &quot;In their <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/federal-appeals-court-upholds-mca.php">decision in Al Odah/Boumediene</a> on Tuesday, the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit produced a heavily formalist decision upholding the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and declaring the Guantanamo detainees&#39; petitions for habeas corpus outside the jurisdiction of the court. For the two judges in the majority (Judges Randolph and Sentelle), the decision hinged on whether the historical understanding of the writ of habeas corpus in 1789 extended beyond sovereign territory. Even in that context, heavily weighting form over substance, the court failed to apply the Supreme Court&#39;s test as to whether Guantanamo Bay Naval Base - where the United States controls all aspects of civilian and military life, and where no other legal system applies - qualifies as territory of the United States for the purpose of extending the writ. In that framework, the court determined that the detainees&#39; petitions were outside the court&#39;s jurisdiction in light of the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the Military Commissions Act of 2006. The dissent, by Judge Rogers, held that Congress had exceeded its powers under the Suspension Clause in stripping jurisdiction from the federal courts to hear Guantanamo detainees&#39; petitions for habeas corpus, and that the MCA was therefore invalid.<br /><br />In their decision, the Court of Appeals panel majority substantially ignored the Supreme Court&#39;s decision of 2004 in Rasul v. Bush. We expect to file a petition for certiorari within the next two weeks, and we have every expectation of a hearing in the spring. This will be the third time the Supreme Court must intervene to preserve the rule of law from abuse at Guantanamo Bay, and it marks five years of detention for our clients at Guantanamo, who are the victims of policies that uphold executive lawlessness. There is a pressing need for quick Supreme Court review in this case; our clients have been held without recourse for over five years, despite the Court&#39;s decision nearly three years ago in Rasul. The Court of Appeals took nearly two years - eighteen months - to issue a ruling in Al Odah/Boumediene, and every day longer is yet one more day that justice is delayed, and justice denied, for the detainees at Guantanamo Bay.&quot;<br />

		<title>No need for Dodd bill revisiting Military Commissions Act</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/jamescarafano.cfm"><strong>James Jay Carafano</strong></a> [Senior Research Fellow, <a href="http://www.heritage.org/">Heritage Foundation</a>]: &quot;The United States military has in its custody a number of enemy combatants at the detention facility Guantanamo Bay. Detainees that are a threat to the United States and its friends and allies should be kept off the battlefield as long as they represent a real danger to innocents. Those accused of serious war crimes should be brought to trial quickly under processes that both respect the rule of law and protect U.S. national security. Congress recognized this necessity when it passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006. Now, Senator Christopher Dodd (D-Connecticut) has <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/dodd-introduces-bill-to-restore-habeas.php">introduced the &quot;Restoring the Constitution Act of 2007&quot;</a> that would undermine the work that the Congress has just accomplished without a clear justification for new legislation.<br /><br />The Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that Congress must explicitly authorize the commissions used to try alleged war criminals. The Congress achieved this end when it passed, with bi-partisan support, and the President signed the Military Commissions Act. In addition, the act, as legal scholar John Yoo has written, &quot;was a sharp rebuke to the U.S. Supreme Court, which had attempted to take control over antiterrorism policy in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. The legislature essentially told Hamdan&#39;s five-justice majority to cease and desist their misguided efforts to second-guess the president&#39;s wartime decisions.&quot;<br /><br />What is lacking is a clear justification for why Congress should revisit its decision. By passage of the act, the Congress addressed the most serious criticisms of U.S. detention policies &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; that they were inconsistent with Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Common Article 3, which is &quot;common&quot; to the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949, defines standards for humane treatment. Its framers intended the article&#39;s wording to be vague, recognizing that states should have wide latitude to adapt enforcement to their unique cultural, political, and strategic circumstances so that they can protect their peoples and individual human rights. The only germane issue is the interpretation of Common Article 3&#39;s requirement of &quot;judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.&quot; This requires some due process, such as that which status review boards and military commissions provide. When Congress explicitly ratified the Administration&#39;s proposed military commissions this satisfied U.S. obligations under the Conventions.<br /><br />As for the many alleged &quot;defects&quot; of the law, they are either based on positing hypothetical situations or based on unproven assertions. For example, it is not clear why Congress should allow the unprecedented extension of the right of habeas corpus to detainees. There is no requirement that they be granted such rights under the US Constitution or the international treaties to which the United States has obligated itself. Nor, is there compelling evidence that the current system the US military uses to review the status of the detainees to determine whether further detention is warranted is inadequate. <br /><br />Congress has already spoken thoughtfully and firmly on the requirements for dealing with the detainees under US military custody. There is no compelling reason to do more.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://unrefugees.org/usaforunhcr/dynamic.cfm?ID=76"><strong>Gonzalo Vargas Llosa</strong></a> [Senior Policy Adviser, Advocacy &aamp; Communications, <a href="http://unrefugees.org/usaforunhcr/dynamic.cfm?ID=76">UNHCR</a> office in New York]: &quot;I think that there are three important points to underline [regarding the increasing number of <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/us-to-admit-7000-iraqi-refugees-in.php">Iraqi refugees</a>].<br /><br />First of all, the enormity of the problem of displacement of Iraqis: today, close to two million uprooted within Iraq itself, with little or no resources of their own left, and at the same time, major security problems faced by the international community to deliver relief aid. And another two million who have escaped to neighbouring countries, mainly Jordan and Syria. This huge problem has so far been largely ignored - and it must no longer be.<br /><br />Secondly, the key to resolving the problem of displacement of Iraqis, of course, is a political solution that will reduce and hopefully end the violence, and enable people to go back home in safety - but this evidently falls outside the mandate of UNHCR. In the meantime, however, what is urgent is to address the enormous needs of the close to four million uprooted - inside and outside Iraq. This requires increased funding - including for the recent donor appeal for 2007 launched by UNHCR last month, to which the USA has pledged US$ 18 million - but also a more coordinated and effective approach to the problem by all stakeholders: Governments, donors, international organizations, etc. A major challenge here will be to provide more support to Jordan and Syria, which have been hosting very large numbers of Iraqis at great cost. In this context, the initiative taken by UNHCR to help organize an international Conference on Iraqi displacement on 17-18 April in Geneva, and which will bring all these relevant actors together, is critical.<br /><br />And thirdly, the resettlement of Iraqis with special needs - be it those who run high security risks because they are associated with the USA side for instance - but also vulnerable women and children, is important. UNHCR is planning to process some 20,000 such cases in 2007 and we welcome the pledge by the USA to take in some 7,000 Iraqis in the current fiscal year. We will all need to act with speed and will need to be able to count on the necessary resources to achieve this target, as the resettlement process is a complex one: setting the right criteria, screening, interviewing, and then eventually transferring them to a third country - including the USA. While evidently this option only provides a solution to a very small number of those uprooted, it is nevertheless a crucial one, because it benefits those who are often the most needy and exposed.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.aclu.org/about/staff/20118prs20050707.html"><strong>Caroline Fredrickson</strong></a> [Director, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/natsec/gen/26861leg20060925.html">ACLU Washington Legislative Office</a>]: &quot;When the 109th Congress passed the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/natsec/gen/26861leg20060925.html">Military Commissions Act</a> in September of last year there was a fear in the legal and human rights communities that this meant that detainees held in Guantanamo Bay and other facilities would be stripped of their due process rights. The Military Commissions Act gave the president new unchecked powers to detain abuse and try people at <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/27970res20070111.html">Guantanamo Bay</a> and other government facilities around the world. <br /><br />On February 13, Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/dodd-introduces-bill-to-restore-habeas.php">introduced legislation</a> that would realign the balance of power. The &quot;<a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/28347prs20070213.html">Restoring the Constitution Act of 2007</a>&quot; would restore habeas corpus and due process to those being held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. It defines &quot;enemy combatant&quot; as someone who is involved in an armed conflict with our country &#8212; not simply a person the Bush administration finds suspect and wishes to detain. The Dodd bill would also block the federal government from making up its own rules on <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/index.html">torture</a> by returning to the basic human rights standards required by the time-honored Geneva Conventions.<br /><br />Senator Dodd&#39;s legislation will restore the vital habeas corpus protection of having a court decide whether a person is being imprisoned unlawfully. This right is vital to many of those held at Guantanamo Bay &#8212; a place where nearly 400 men are being held, some of them for as long as five years, without being charged. Even the government has admitted that some of the detainees should not be there and are caught in a legal limbo without rights. <br /><br />America has always been and must remain a nation that stands for the rule of law. The fundamental rights stripped from detainees must be restored. We should not be a country that runs the risk of putting innocent people in a cell and throwing away the key without any right to know why they are there &#8212; and without any right to appeal. The American Civil Liberties Union is committed to working with Members of Congress to reverse the damage done by the Military Commissions Act.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.turkishembassy.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=74"><strong>His Excellency Nabi Sensoy, Ambassador of the Republic of Turkey</strong></a> [Turkish Embassy, Washington DC]: &quot;House Resolution 106 on Armenian genocide allegations was <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/turkish-pm-warns-us-on-armenian.php">introduced</a> by five Representatives on January 30, 2007 at the 110th Congress 1st Session. The phrasing of the resolution implies acceptance, as an established fact, of the existence of the &#39;genocide&#39; and its scale, a matter that the Turkish side maintains is a subject open to query. The Armenian claims, to this date, have never been historically or legally substantiated. Indeed, it is precisely because the accusers have not been able to establish the crime based on international law or on irrefutable evidence, that they seek to manipulate foreign parliaments to provide legislative validation to their claims. There is no doubt that the introduction and consideration of Armenian resolutions have become a major sour point in the Turkish-US relationship and that to dwell on a one-sided picture of the past will not help improve America&#39;s ties with its key Atlantic-Middle Eastern ally.<br /><br />Many governments, including that of the US, have not called the Armenian incidents of 1915 genocide. If H.R. 106 is adopted, Turkish-US relations could be ruptured by what would prove to be the most devastating nonbinding legislation ever devised. Turkey&#39;s geopolitical importance for the US continues, and may yet increase. Serving as a bridge between the West (including NATO) and the Moslem world, maintaining very good relations with Israel, and providing military bases for current and potential future US operations in the fight against terrorism, Turkey is a friend and partner for the US in a wide geography from Europe and the Balkans to the Caucasus and Central Asia. Most recent developments in the Middle East reinforce Turkey&#39;s value as an interlocutor for the American administration. The oil and gas reserves of the Caspian countries, as well as Turkey&#39;s growing economic and demographic importance in the region, add further inducements to these political and security considerations.&quot;<br />

It was a statement I staked my personal and professional reputation on to prove to a horrified and beaten-down population that the law is the cornerstone of any free and democratic nation. As an American lawyer I used the United States as the example of how we hold our senior leaders accountable for their transgressions.<br /><br />On Friday, FBI Director Robert Mueller stated that he was the one in charge and should be held accountable for the apparent misuse of an important, yet intrusive law enforcement tool: national security letters. Absolutely, he should be held accountable. This Department of Justice, under the leadership of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has not served our republic well. From missteps related to prisoners of war, torture, political pressure on district attorneys, to arrogant abuse of power related to national security, including violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and this recent misuse of authorities under the Patriot Act, the chief law enforcement office of the United States has bungled his job.<br /><br />The cornerstone to this great nation is the law. We are in our second Cold War, an ideological struggle with religious criminals who seek to dominate an entire ancient religion for their own personal agenda. Civilization can only win this struggle by holding fast to the rule of law, using it as the ultimate weapon against those who seek to harm us. When we step away from that principle we begin to move down a very dark path indeed.<br /><br />Both Gonzales and Mueller admitted publicly that members of our FBI broke the law. Those who did should be appropriately dealt with under the law. Yet the report hints of systemic problems, lack of oversight, sloppy administration and follow-up. It even appears that there was some intent to under-report the use of national security letters. This is a leadership and management issue at the highest level. <br /><br />As a former senior inspector general in the Department of Defense and someone who has lead and managed federal and international organizations, large and small for over three decades, I know when an agency is poorly led. The FBI and the Justice Department are poorly led. This recent report by the Inspector General of that department shows this fact. <br /><br />New leadership is needed in the Justice Department. As these violations of law and policy were under the watch of Robert Mueller, he should resign. No one is above the law, not even the Director of the FBI. <br /><br />Congress should show leadership, as well and oversee more closely the Attorney General. The term "trust, but verify" is so apt here to ensure that the rule of law is followed in our own Justice Department. How many times can you forgive, overlook, or second-chance conduct that clearly steps away from a document that boldly declared centuries ago: "We the people of the United State, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;" <br /><br /><br /><em>David M. Crane is a professor at Syracuse University College of Law, and former founding Chief Prosecutor for the UN Special Court for Sierra Leone (2002-2005). He previously spent over 30 years in US federal government service as a Senior Inspector General, Department of Defense, Assistant General Counsel of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and Waldemar A.

		<title>The Un-American Way: The Kafkaesque Case of Khalid El-Masri</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that the dismissal of Khalid el-Masri&#39;s rendition appeal on state secrets grounds leaves him without right or remedy, just like the iconic Joseph K. in Franz Kafka&#39;s <em>The Trial</em>, a legal and personal powerlessness which might have been expected under various historically-notorious regimes, but not in the United States of America...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavis.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in a unanimous decision has dismissed the action of Khaled el-Masri asserting claims related to his extraordinary rendition. The basis of the dismissal is the state secrets doctrine.<br /><br />This decision presents us with the lawlessness of the internal law situation we have. The Executive cannot be criminally prosecuted domestically (above a few low level soldiers - Abu Ghraib - or CIA interrogators - <em>Passarro</em>) for its acts because it controls the federal prosecutors. If the Executive charges someone in court, then as a defense the person can seek to have evidence of horrible treatment brought in but will be confronted with the state secrets doctrine (see <em>Padilla</em>). If the Executive charges the person in a military commission the evidence issues again will come up against the state secrets doctrine (watch <em>Hicks</em>). If the person injured brings a civil suit as did el-Masri, the Fourth Circuit has told us that the state secrets doctrine will be allowed to trump and dismissal will occur.<br /><br />On the international plane, el-Masri can seek to have the German government raise his claims in a state to state manner with the United States by having his claims espoused by his government. However, if he does that it is expected that the state-to-state solution, if it does occur, will be binding on him. His claim will fall into the pile of issues that impact US-German relations. One poor schmuck in that situation is not usually considered very important. Secretary of State Rice has apparently apologized to Germany and if Germany accepts that as the remedy, that appears to be all that el-Masri can get - an apology to his country for the treatment that happened to him. The United States has not apologized to el-Masri. El-Masri might sue other countries that allowed this to happen and maybe even Germany but would be unable to get relief from the principal cause of his injury - the United States.<br /><br />Obviously the state secrets doctrine is one of the tools the US courts use to balance liberty and security concerns. The problem is that there appears to be absolutely no limit in our courts as to what kind of lawless executive behavior will be allowed to pass without judicial scrutiny as a matter of internal US law. The 4th Circuit understands in its opinion the gravity of what it is doing. Yet, it does not display the judicial will as a coequal branch of government to do otherwise.<br /><br />A report by the Council of Europe of June 2006 concluded that el-Masri&#39;s account of having been abducted and mistreated was substantially accurate. This type of public information, it would seem to me, is not frivolous but raises a strong case for a need for the judiciary in the United States to allow a much closer look in a US court of law of the actions taken by the United States. In a setting where the person concerned is 1) not a national of a country hostile to or in armed conflict with the United States and 2) where credible corroborative evidence is present of official executive misconduct that violates fundamental domestic and international law in the treatment of human dignity, it would seem that the judiciary might wish to do its job of protecting us all by requiring an appropriate hearing of the claims.<br /><br />This kind of limitation on the state secrets doctrine should be fashioned as part of the doctrine itself. Doctrines like this have in the background, I believe, an implicit assumption that the Executive is going to act within a lawful framework. There may be situations where the doctrine would &quot;cover&quot; some lawless conduct in a case by case type of analysis also - the tendency to err on the side of protecting state secrets is a reality. However, the judiciary might accept its task of stricter scrutiny when the level of official misconduct of the United State that is alleged with substantial evidence is of such an egregious nature, corroborated by independence sources, and goes to fundamental human/humanitarian rights.<br /><br />While there are concerns about what the defense might have to bring forward as part of its defense, it seems to me that this is much like the child who killed his parents asking for mercy from the court as he is an orphan. I have faith that our judiciary can find a way to help this process work so that the truth - yes the truth can come out and justice be done and be seen to be done.<br /><br />One argument that might be made is that the Inspector General system is the solution. This approach is simply not true. The Inspector General process will provide a report but that is it. The Executive retains total discretion so these reports (whatever the eloquence of the arguments) will not by themselves lead to any action.<br /><br />Another argument is that the Congressional oversight should be able to address these situations. It is true that a Congressperson could introduce legislation to provide an apology and compensation to el-Masri for his ill treatment at the hands of the United States. But, just like the weakness of will in all those years in which Congress failed to enact an anti-lynching law (with the Senate finally apologizing about that recently), I do not expect that kind of statesmanship from Congress. Further, the issue of Congressional complicity in the whole extraordinary rendition program is something that the Congressional leaders - Democrat or Republican - would be reluctant to have aired I would imagine. So once again, there is no room at the inn for a schmuck like el-Masri - an alien truly abroad.<br /><br />Not providing some mechanism in the United States for addressing this kind of official misconduct ordered at higher levels places us in the unfortunate situation of being an emperor with no clothes as regards our commitments.<br /><br />Moreover, the person who has been treated this way, who is innocent, who is the iconic Joseph K., finds in the United States the exact type of trial of which Kafka wrote. Such a person can look to the left or to the right, to those above or around him, to all the powers that be, and the message that keeps coming back is that he has no rights which we will recognize. That is a recipe from Dred Scott for objectification of the human being that I thought we had long since transcended. Put another way, el-Masri ends up being just a poor schmuck that the judiciary will not hear. That might be fine in Pinochet&#39;s Chile, Argentina under the generals, or Soviet-era Russia, but it is not fine today, now, in the USA. Shame on us.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Moeen Cheema, professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan, says that the suspension of Pakistan Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry by President Pervez Musharraf shows that the country&#39;s military leadership has finally overreached itself by assailing the country&#39;s last independent public institution, the judiciary...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/pakistanflaglong.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Chief Justice of Pakistan was unceremoniously suspended from office on Friday, March 9, for alleged misconduct. In fact, to be legalistic, the Chief Justice was made 'non-functional' and an acting Chief Justice was appointed in his place. The President of Pakistan, the military strongman going by this recent evidence, has also referred his case to the Supreme Judicial Council. <br /><br />The Chief Justice has been detained in his residence and his movements restricted. He was not allowed to meet with a number of lawyers, journalists, politicians and brother justices who showed up at his doorstep over the last three days. It was widely rumored that he was being pressured to resign rather than undergo a judicial inquiry before the Supreme Judicial Council, the first hearing for which has been scheduled for today, Tuesday, March 13. The Chief Justice has now communicated his desire to defend himself and has insisted on a public hearing of his case.<br /><br />The legal community in Pakistan is up in arms. All of the leading bar associations have openly protested against the action of the President. By latest accounts, a protest rally organized by the legal fraternity in Lahore was violently dispersed by the police resulting in injuries to a number of the participants. <br /><br /><strong>The Legal Debate</strong><br /><br /> The incident has sparked a contentious legal debate between government functionaries, foremost among them being the federal Law Minister Mr. Wasi Zafar, and representatives of various bar associations. The bar councils' leaders are arguing that although the President has the power to refer a case of misconduct by a judge to the Supreme Judicial Council, he does neither have the power to suspend, or render non-functional, such a judge nor the authority to appoint an acting Chief Justice. An overwhelming majority in the legal community, including most Supreme Court advocates, have supported the stance of the bar associations.<br /><br />However, it must be pointed out that Article 209 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, does not contemplate an action against the Chief Justice. The article states that the composition of the Supreme Judicial Council shall be as follows: the Chief justice, the two next most senior judges of the Supreme Court and the two senior-most Chief Justices of the High Courts. The government has argued that since the Chief Justice cannot be judge of his own cause, he therefore has to be replaced, and that in such a scenario Article 180 should come into play. Article 180 empowers the President to appoint the next senior-most judge of the Court as an acting Chief Justice in case of the existing Chief Justice's incapacity to function.<br /><br /> The composition of the Supreme Judicial Council in this particular case has also raised a number of additional issues. The acting Chief Justice was appointed in a hurry and took oath within hours of the notification suspending the Chief Justice. He shall sit on the Supreme Judicial Council in his new-found capacity. Justice Rana Bhagwan Das, the most senior judge on the bench after the suspended Chief Justice and the only minority judge on the bench, is presently in India and hence could not be made the acting Chief Justice. This raises the question whether he will be appointed as the acting Chief Justice and included in the Supreme Judicial Council upon his return. <br /><br /> It is also being argued that the current acting Chief Justice, Justice Javed Iqbal, has discredited himself from sitting on the Supreme Judicial Council by taking the oath of office in circumstances when the existing Chief Justice was in detention in the Army House. Similarly, Justice Addul Hameed Dogar, another member of the Supreme Judicial Council, has lost some credibility by administering the oath to the acting Chief Justice in such a hurried fashion and publicly congratulating him in this dark hour. Justice Chaudhry Iftikhar, Chief Justice Lahore High Court and another member of the Supreme Judicial Council, is known to be a vocal opponent of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. There are several applications of serious corruption charges against him, all of which are pending to be referred to the Supreme Judicial Council. Justice Sabih-ud-Din, Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court and another member of the Supreme Judicial Council, is alleged to be a victim of the misconduct of the Chief Justice's desire for protocol and official facilities.<br /><br />Most importantly, the reference appears to be prima facie based on <em>mala fides</em>. The exact nature of the allegations have not been made public. The reference is rumored to be based on an open letter written by a lawyer, known more for his media appearances than legal acumen. The said letter, the contents of which have now been widely publicized, contains no allegation of corruption. Instead, it criticizes the Chief Justice for his desire for protocol, extravagant public expenditure on his official residence and office, and his role in the illegal transfer of his son to an important law enforcement position. In a society where a number of judges are believed to be corrupt; where references are pending against several members of superior judiciary, where every public functionary craves protocol and extravagant public expenditure; where both the federal law minister and his son conveniently escape prosecution after brutally committing public assaults, it is ironic that the Chief Justice is being singled out for what appear to be petty charges in comparison.<br /><br /><strong>The Political Games</strong><br /><br /> The context to this legal wrangling is provided by a number of high profile politically charged cases that are likely to come before the Supreme Court in the next few months. These cases are expected to include a ruling on the legality of the President's re-election by the existing legislative assembly dominated by the so-called King's party or the postponement of the elections and a declaration of emergency if the elections scheduled for end-year 2007 are postponed.<br /><br /> Although the Chief Justice was not believed to be an individual likely to take on the President himself, some of his recent decisions caused significant nervousness amongst the upper echelons of government. These include the decision overturning the privatization of the steel mills which directly implicated the Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in the under-priced sale of a strategic national asset. Petitions of habeas corpus filed by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan on behalf of the families of those 'missing persons' believed to have been illegally detained by national security agencies as part of Pakistan's cooperation in the War on Terror were also entertained by the Chief Justice. Many of these missing persons are believed to be in Guantanamo Bay, and the petition has caused severe embarrassment for the government. <br /><br /><strong>Long-Term Implications</strong> <br /><br /> The message, whether intended or not, that has been received by the public through this action of the President is that he has become a military dictator in the true sense of the word. The fa&Atilde;&#167;ade of a hybrid system of governance characterized by a mixture of limited democracy and benevolence that this military regime had erected so successfully through manipulated elections, ill-conc
eived devolution plans, economic stability and freedom of the media has suddenly fallen. Caesar has shown his face and it is not a pretty sight. <br /><br /> The public confidence in the judiciary, the last standing institution, has been placed on the guillotine. The Supreme Judicial Council is expected to play the part of the executioner in the coming days. The crisis of confidence is such that no one expects the Chief Justice to win even though an overwhelming majority believes that the charges are misplaced and politically motivated. The biggest loser in the long term, however, is likely to be the Army.<br /><br />Every institution has now been held accountable by this military regime,<br />although on a patchy and politically motivated fashion, save the army<br />itself. Now that all institutions and branches of government have been<br />held subject to accountability (but not accountable), in the least we must<br />ask why the serving and retired Army personnel thrust upon every civil<br />institution are immune from prosecution!<br /><br /><br /><em>Moeen Cheema is an Assistant Professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/staff.asp">Aziz Huq</a>, Director of the Liberty and National Security Project at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, says that the <em>El-Masri v. Tenet</em> ruling represents a dangerous trend in &quot;state secrets&quot; cases towards immunity from litigation at the discretion of the executive...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/azizhuq.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he U.S. Court of Appeals for Fourth Circuit recently upheld a district court dismissal of a tort case brought by a German citizen against former Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet, three private airplane corporations, and twenty John Does. The case, <em>El-Masri v. Tenet</em>, sought to cast light on a government practice that until now has been shrouded in careful secrecy: Extraordinary rendition, or the extra-legal transfer of suspects to the custody of another sovereign for likely torture.<br /><br />The <em>El-Masri</em> case presents important challenges both to the international rule of law, and to the quality of justice delivered in the U.S.'s own federal courts. Professor Benjamin Davis, in an earlier JURIST <em>Forum</em> <a href="/forumy/2007/03/un-american-way-kafkaesque-case-of.php">column</a>, has pointed to some of the moral concerns the decision yields. My interest is in the technical aspects of the "state secrets" privilege on which the Fourth Circuit based its decision.<br /><br />The facts of El-Masri's case, as Professor Davis has explained, are stark. Initially arrested in December 2003 in Macedonia, El-Masri alleges he was handed over to the CIA by Macedonian authorities and then imprisoned for almost five months in an American facility in Afghanistan known as the "Salt Pit." While imprisoned, El-Masri represents, he was beaten and interrogated under circumstances that arguably rise to the level of torture. <br /><br />These facts, in my view, are credible. An official German inquiry, for example, has confirmed that El-Masri was arrested in Macedonia and was later held in Afghanistan (in part through chemical analysis of El-Masri's hair). The American Civil Liberties Union, who are El Masri's counsel, have identified another prisoner in the same U.S. facility in Afghanistan who corroborates the German citizen's detention there. And German Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated in December 2005 that she had discussed El-Masri's case with Secretary of State Rice, and that Rice had acknowledged that El-Masri's disappearance and prolonged detention had been a "mistake." Indeed, German prosecutors credit El-Masri's account sufficiently that they have sought indictments of thirteen CIA agents on criminal charges. <br /><br />But the Fourth Circuit would have none of this. Upholding a decision by Judge T.S. Ellis III, a panel of the appeals court held that the federal government had properly intervened in the case and upheld its objection to any litigation on "state secrets" grounds. <br /><br />First christened by the Supreme Court in 1953 in <em>United States v. Reynolds</em>, the "state secrets" privilege originally allowed the government to shield specific pieces of evidence from discovery in the course of civil litigation. Once invoked by the head of a government agency, it serves as an absolute bar to judicial inquiry. From its inception, the state secrets privilege has been exercised with deference to executive judgment. Rare are the cases in which judges carry out even in camera examination of contested evidence to test whether it is properly kept secret. <br /><br />In <em>Reynolds</em>, the Court held that the state secrets privilege protected Air Force documents pertaining to a plane crash, claiming that the documents contained sensitive materials, and that the plaintiffs in a tort case concerning the crash could not force their disclosure. As historian Louis Fisher has chronicled in his book <em>In the Name of National Security</em>, the documents, which emerged almost four decades later, in fact contained nothing of the kind: Rather, they revealed negligence on the Air Force's part that would have made a determinative difference in the case. State secrets was thus flawed at birth. <br /><br /><em>Reynolds</em> crafted the state secrets privilege out of whole cloth. Congress gave no warrant for the privilege, and the history the Court pointed to was fragmentary. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Vinson stated that a "reasonable danger" that disclosure would harm national security stopped any discovery. <br /><br />Vinson's "reasonable danger" test has superficial appeal. But it lacks doctrinal roots. And in practice it has no teeth. All the government has to do to cloak itself in secrecy is use an ex parte proceeding to scare a non-specialist judge into believing that their claim of confidentiality is reasonable. More than anything, the <em>Reynolds</em> test echoes the deferential posture Vinson took toward government claims about security risks in the 1951 <em>Dennis</em> case. Of course <em>Dennis</em> hardly represented an accurate bellwether of First Amendment jurisprudence. <br /><br />Once named, the "state secrets" privilege had the potential to grow. Like the doctrines of qualified and absolute immunity, which have been judicially expanded by insidious degrees, "state secrets" endows the executive branch with a substantial discretionary margin of error &#8212; or a discretion to abuse constitutional rights. Hence, there is a heavy incentive for the government, which is a repeat player in the federal courts, to push for doctrinal expansion. <br /><br />In <em>El-Masri</em>, the Fourth Circuit held that "state secrets" had been properly invoked and required wholesale dismissal of El-Masri's complaint before any evidence had been presented. Judge King starkly explained that the Court would sacrifice El-Masri's "personal interest" for "the collective interest in national security." <br /><br />The Fourth Circuit's decision to authorize threshold dismissal of El-Masri's complaint, while not unprecedented, represents a dangerous trend in "state secrets" cases: Rather than an evidentiary doctrine, the privilege is becoming an immunity from litigation (just like qualified and absolute immunity). This is a qualitatively different kind of power for the executive to yield &#8212; and yet courts have never fully justified this subtle, yet consequential, transformation.<br /><br />Judge King gave three reasons for the ruling. Each has troubling implications. First, he argued that any hearing into the facts of El-Masri's case would reveal facts about "how the CIA organizes, staffs, and supervises its most sensitive intelligence operations." Note that this reason is dramatically open-ended: Virtually any case that touches on intelligence operations could be dismissed under that logic. <br /><br />The second ground that the Fourth Circuit relied upon was the possibility that defendants in El-Masri's case might raise defenses that implicated state secrets. But this is curious speculation. El-Masri had not had a chance to elaborate his full case. Whatever defenses the one former state employee, Tenet, or the private contractor defendants had yet to make was a matter for future litigation. Even if certain facts could not be litigated, a court might have explored other procedural options. <br /><br />Finally, the Court concluded that the "subject matter" of El-Masri's case &#8212; the fact that the American government erroneously kidnapped, detained, and tortured an innocent German citizen &#8212; constituted a "state secret." Again stated baldly, this means that any time the Government abuses its vast intelligence powers ($44 billion in government overhead as of 2005 and counting), the court must stand aside.<br /><br />While the Fourth Circuit insisted that it, and not the executive, maintained co
ntrol over the course of litigation, and that its decision did not constitute rank abdication of the judicial role, the breadth of its reasoning means that executive discretion to invoke "state secrets" is basically without limitation. <br /><br />Yet it is simply not clear why the judiciary should be disabled so wholly in national security matters. None of the reasons for judicial abdication in fact hold water. Is it because they require the handling of specialized knowledge? This does not distinguish them from trademark, antitrust, patent, or medical malpractice cases. And there are ample procedural mechanisms to ensure the secure the safe handling of classified evidence, as the 1980 Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA, which is used in the criminal context) demonstrates. <br /><br />Alternatively, is the responsibility of the democratic branches to make decision about matters of such great weight as national security? This cannot be right either. From <em>McCulloch</em> to <em>Dred Scott</em> to <em>Brown</em>, our federal courts have taken center-stage in adjudicating the great national debates of the day. Without doubt, Frederick Schauer, writing recently in <em>Harvard Law Review</em>, is correct that the Court works at some remove from key national political debates of the day. Yet it is equally true that when the Courts will, they can enter the fray, and often give as good as they get. <br /><br />So is it then that classified evidence cannot safely be handled by federal courts? At the threshold, it is important to recognize the alarming premise on which this claim is based: That federal judges cannot be trusted. There is, thankfully, no evidence for this amazing claim. Less than Congress and certainly less than the executive branch &#8212; as the Libby trial ought to have reminded us &#8212; the judiciary is simply not a source of secret disclosures.<br /><br />There is in fact a range of procedural options available for handling classified evidence without compromising either security or the vindication of fundamental liberties, not least CIPA. While Congress is better positioned than the courts to devise ways of sifting creditworthy from bankrupt executive branch claims of secrecy, the federal courts ought not to wait for congressional direction. As the <em>El-Masri</em> decision shows, there is clear need for more rigorous analysis of the "state secrets" privilege's dangerous and unwarranted breadth even now. <br /><br /><br /><em>Aziz Huq directs the Liberty and National Security project at the Brennan Center and is co-author of </em><a href="http://www.thenewpress.com/index.php?option=com_title&task=view_title&metaproductid=1632">Unchecked and Unbalanced: Presidential Power in a Time of Terror</a><em>.</em><br />

They had been severely tortured over weeks and months. But they showed up in court without external marks of torture. With all apparent voluntariness, they admitted subverting the Five-Year Plans that would have provided the Soviet people with necessary food items. They sabotaged factories, making sure the production lines were inefficient. They managed to import inferior metals so that Soviet tanks and automobiles would fall apart after a few months' use. They infiltrated the Soviet Army and through dint of their persuasiveness, convinced the foot soldier that it was absurd to risk his life defending a dictatorial government. In short these accused persons, briefly in court on their way to the firing squad, took responsibility for everything that had gone wrong for the past two decades in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.<br /><br />So why is it today that no one draws the connection between the Soviet purge trials and the confession of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed? Mohammed said that he had been tortured by his American captors. No one contradicted his assertion. Then he went on, with a straight and sincere face, to take responsibility for a long list of crimes recently perpetrated. <br /><br />Mr. Mohammed personally decapitated "the head of the American Jew, Daniel Pearl, in the city of Karachi, Pakistan," he testified. He must have been on an overnight flight from South Korea, where he personally identified targets "such as American military bases and a few night clubs frequented by American soldiers." Perhaps it was on that flight that he planned the "Shoe Bomber Operation to down two American airplanes."<br /><br />The busy Mr. Mohammed planned, financed, surveyed, trained, and followed up the operations to destroy American military vessels and oil tankers in the Straits of Hormuz, the Straits of Gibralter, the Port of Singapore, and the Panama Canal. On a side trip to the Philippines, he masterminded the assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II.<br /><br />What about the Big One, namely, the crash into the World Trade Center Towers on 9/11? Mr. Mohammed was responsible "from A to Z," he said. He also was responsible for the earlier attack on the World Trade Center in 1993.<br /><br />This person really got around; you've got to give him credit for that. Maybe he had a job as a chef aboard Air Force One; he didn't say. But he did manage to get all the way to Bali, Indonesia, where he supervised the infamous nightclub bombing that killed many British and Australian nationals. <br /><br />At least he was arrested before he managed to carry out a few of his plans, such as assassinating President Carter (Mohammed surveyed and financed this assassination plan), and blowing up Library Tower in California, the Sears Tower in Chicago, several suspension bridges in New York, Heathrow Airport in London, the Canary Wharf Building, New York Stock Exchange, the Plaza Bank in Washington State, and last but not least, the Empire State Building in New York City. It's a good thing the latter was averted as it would have drained all the drama out of the remake of King Kong.<br /><br />Anything else you want to say for yourself, Mr. Mohammed? Why yes, he replies. Don't forget my responsibility for the Filka Island Operation in Kuwait that killed two American soldiers, the destruction of numerous nightclubs in Thailand, planning the destruction of buildings in the Israeli city of Elat by using Saudi airplanes, planning and financing for the destruction of American embassies in Indonesia, Australia, and Japan, the bombing of the hotel in Mombasa that is frequented by Jewish travelers, and planning, surveying and financing to hit several nuclear power plants in the United States. And . . .<br /><br />O.K., Mr. Mohammed, just ask your lawyer to hand over the complete list. Do you have any explanations for the Court?<br /><br />Yes, "not I'm making myself hero when I said I was responsible for this or that. If America they want to invade Iraq they will not send for Saddam roses or kisses, they send a bombardment. This is the best way if I want. I'm American enemies."<br /><br />It gives me a warm feeling that these proceedings took place on board U.S. Naval Base Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with the Review Tribunal made up of a Captain from the United States Navy, Lieutenant Colonels from the United States Air Force and Marine Corps, and a Gunnery Sergeant as Reporter (all names redacted). A confession before a tribunal is the best evidence of guilt, isn't it? Whether it's Guantanamo Bay or the Gulag Archipelago.<br /><br /><br /><em>Anthony D.Amato is Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University, where he teaches international law and human rights.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/damato.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='120' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/faculty_m_cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law, president of the <a href="http://www.nlg.org/">National Lawyers Guild</a>, says that the recent ruling by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on habeas-stripping under the Military Commissions Act was erroneous and is likely to be overturned by the US Supreme Court...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/cohncolor.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ast week, in <em>Boumediene v. Bush</em>, two judges on a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the provision of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 that strips the rights of all Guantanamo detainees to have their habeas corpus petitions heard by U.S. federal courts.  If that decision is left to stand, the men and boys detained at Guantanamo can be held there for the rest of their lives without ever having a federal judge determine the legality of their detention.  In my opinion, this appellate decision will likely be overturned by the Supreme Court next term.<br /><br />A little background:<br /><br />In November 2001, President Bush established Military Commissions to try non-citizens accused of war crimes. <br /><br />In June 2004, the Supreme Court decided <em>Rasul v. Bush</em>, which upheld the right of those detained at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo to have their petitions for habeas corpus heard by U.S. courts, under the federal habeas statute.<br /><br />The ink was barely dry on <em>Rasul</em> when Bush created the Combatant Status Review Tribunals, ostensibly to comply with the <em>Rasul</em> ruling. But, as I will explain, setting up these tribunals was really an end-run around <em>Rasul</em>.  They were established to determine whether a detainee is an unlawful enemy combatant.  They are not criminal courts, like the military commissions.   <br /><br />On December 31, 2005, Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act, which included the famous McCain &quot;anti-torture&quot; amendment.  But it also stripped habeas corpus rights from Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees who had not already filed habeas petitions before December 31, 2005.  Some 200 detainees had pending petitions.<br /><br />At the end of last term, the Supreme Court struck down Bush&#39;s military commissions in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> because they did not comply with due process guarantees in the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions.<br /><br />Then, in October of last year, in another end run, this time around <em>Hamdan</em>, Bush rammed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 through a Congress terrified of appearing soft on terror in the upcoming midterm elections.  The Act does many things, but it notably strips statutory habeas corpus rights from all Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees, even those whose petitions were pending on December 31, 2005.<br /><br />The two-judge majority in <em>Boumediene</em> upheld the Military Commissions Act&#39;s stripping of statutory habeas jurisdiction that the Supreme Court had recognized in <em>Rasul</em>.  (Congress had passed the original habeas statute, and amended it in the Military Commissions Act).  The <em>Boumediene</em> decision found the Act&#39;s elimination of habeas to be constitutional.<br /><br />Art. I of the Constitution contains the Suspension Clause, which says that Congress can suspend the right of habeas corpus only in times of rebellion or invasion when the public safety may require it.  As the dissenter in <em>Boumediene</em> pointed out, Congress has only suspended habeas corpus four times before, and made findings of rebellion or invasion in each case.  We are not now in a state of invasion or rebellion, and Congress did not make such a finding.<br /><br />The two-judge majority in <em>Boumediene</em> said: (1) in the absence of a statutory habeas right (which Congress had eliminated in the Military Commissions Act), the Constitution only protects the right of habeas corpus that was recognized at common law in 1789; (2) the law in 1789 did not provide the right of habeas corpus to aliens held by the government outside of the sovereign&#39;s territory; and (3) Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo is outside U.S territory for constitutional purposes, even though the U.S. has complete control over it.<br /><br />This reasoning is erroneous for three reasons:<br /><br />First, the Supreme Court held in <em>INS v. St. Cyr</em> that the Constitution protects the writ as it existed in 1789 &quot;at the absolute minimum.&quot;  The Supreme Court in <em>Rasul</em> cited <em>St. Cyr</em>.<br /><br />Second, although the <em>Boumediene</em> majority relies on the treaty that says Cuba, not the U.S., has sovereignty over Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, the Supreme Court rejected that argument in <em>Rasul</em>, when it said: &quot;By the express terms of its agreements with Cuba, the United States exercises &#39;complete jurisdiction and control&#39; over the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay Naval Base, and may continue to exercise such control permanently if it so chooses. . . Aliens held at the base, no less than American citizens, are entitled to invoke the federal courts&#39; authority under &Acirc;&#167;2241.&quot;<br /><br />Third, although the <em>Rasul</em> Court was analyzing the pre-Military Commissions Act habeas statute, it also cited <em>Johnson v. Eisentrager</em>, which construed the constitutional right of habeas corpus.  The Supreme Court in <em>Eisentrager</em> denied habeas jurisdiction to German citizens who had been captured by U.S. forces in China, and then tried and convicted of war crimes by an American military commission in Nanking.<br /><br />The <em>Eisentrager</em> court cited six factors to determine whether an alien is entitled to constitutional habeas jurisdiction in U.S. courts.  These factors were cited in <em>Rasul</em>, which said:<blockquote>In reversing that determination, this Court [in <em>Eisentrager</em>] summarized the six critical facts in the case:<br /><br />"We are here confronted with a decision whose basic premise is that these prisoners are entitled, as a constitutional right, to sue in some court of the United States for a writ of habeas corpus. To support that assumption we must hold that a prisoner of our military authorities is constitutionally entitled to the writ, even though he (a) is an enemy alien; (b) has never been or resided in the United States; (c) was captured outside of our territory and there held in military custody as a prisoner of war; (d) was tried and convicted by a Military Commission sitting outside the United States; (e) for offenses against laws of war committed outside the United States; (f) and is at all times imprisoned outside the United States." <br /><br />On this set of facts, the [Eisentrager] Court concluded, "no right to the writ of habeas corpus appears."</blockquote>The <em>Rasul</em> court said:<blockquote>Petitioners in these [Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo] cases differ from the <em>Eisentrager</em> detainees in important respects: They are not nationals of countries at war with the United States, and they deny that they have engaged in or plotted acts of aggression against the United States; they have never been afforded access to any tribunal, much less charged with and convicted of wrongdoing; and for more than two years they have been imprisoned in territory over which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction and control.<br /><br />Not only are petitioners differently situated from the <em>Eisentrager</em> detainees, but the Court in <em>Eisentrager</em> made quite clear that all six of the facts critical to its disposition were relevant only to the question of the prisoners' <em>constitutional</em> entitlement to habeas corpus.</blockquote>Congress can suspend habeas corpus if there is an adequate substitute for it.  In <em>Boumediene</em>, the Bush administratio
n asked the Court of Appeals to review the Combatant Status Review Tribunals.  But the court declined, saying it had an inadequate record before it.<br /><br />The Combatant Status Review Tribunals do not provide a meaningful opportunity to challenge detention.  The prisoner is not entitled to an attorney, only a &quot;personal representative,&quot; and anything the detainee tells his personal representative can be used against him.  After reviewing the cases of 393 detainees, a Seton Hall legal team found that in 96 percent of the cases, the government had not produced any witnesses or presented any documentary evidence to the detainee before the hearing. Detainees were allowed to see only summaries of the classified evidence offered against them, and that evidence was always presumed to be reliable and valid.  Requests by detainees for witnesses were rarely granted.  <br /><br />In addition, the personal representatives said nothing in 14 percent of the hearings and made no substantive comments 30 percent of the time.  Some personal representatives even advocated for the government&#39;s position.  In three cases, the detainee was found to be &quot;no longer an enemy combatant,&quot; but the military continued to convene tribunals until they were found to be enemy combatants.  These detainees were never told of the favorable ruling and there was no indication they were informed or participated in the second or third hearings.<br /><br />As the dissenter in <em>Boumediene</em> pointed out, the procedure set up in the Detainee Treatment Act for reviewing decisions of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals &quot;is not designed to cure these inadequacies.  The court may review only the record developed by the CSRT to assess whether the CSRT has complied with its own standards.  Because the detainee still has no means to present evidence rebutting the government&#39;s case - even assuming the detainee could learn of it contents - assessing whether the government has more evidence in its favor than the detainee is hardly the proper antidote.&quot;<br /><br />The suspension of habeas corpus will certainly have profound effects on non-citizen detainees.  Consider the case of Abu Bakker Qassim, an Uighur from China who was held at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo for four years.  He wrote in the <em>New York Times</em>: &quot;I was locked up and mistreated for being in the wrong place at the wrong time during America&#39;s war in Afghanistan.  Like hundreds of Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees, I was never a terrorist or a soldier.  I was never even on a battlefield.  Pakistani bounty hunters sold me and 17 other Uighurs to the United States military like animals for $5,000 a head.  The Americans made a terrible mistake.&quot;  <br /><br />How did Qassim obtain his release from Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo?  &quot;It was only the country&#39;s centuries-old commitment to allowing habeas corpus challenges that put that mistake right&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;or began to.  In May, on the eve of a court hearing in my case, the military relented, and I was sent to Albania along with four other Uighurs,&quot; Qassim said.  He added:<blockquote>Without my American lawyers and habeas corpus, my situation and that of the other Uighurs would still be a secret.  I would be sitting in a metal cage today.  Habeas corpus helped me to tell the world that Uighurs are not a threat to the United States or the West, but an ally.  Habeas corpus cleared my name&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and most important, it let my family know that I was still alive.</blockquote><em>Rasul v. Bush</em> was a 6-3 decision.  Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, Breyer, O&#39;Connor and Kennedy voted with the majority.  The dissenters were Justices Scalia, Thomas and Rehnquist.<br /><br />I predict the Supreme Court will reverse the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Boumediene</em>, probably in a 5-4 vote with Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito voting with the dissent.  I doubt whether the Court will decide that Bush has succeeded in placing the detainees beyond the reach of our federal courts by sending them to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.  It will likely decide that the judicial review of the decisions of Combatant Status Review Tribunals does not provide an adequate substitute for constitutional habeas corpus.<br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, president of the National Lawyers Guild, and the U.S. representative to the executive committee of the American Association of Jurists.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.utoronto.ca/faculty_content.asp?profile=47&cType=facMembers&itemPath=1/3/4/0/0">Kent Roach</a> of the University Toronto Faculty of Law says the Supreme Court of Canada&#39;s ruling that security certificates for the indefinite detention of foreign terror suspects are unconstitutional may help propel new Canadian anti-terror legislation, although the travails of that for Canada&#39;s minority Conservative government may be greater than those encountered in other Commonwealth jurisdictions such as the UK and Australia...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kentroach.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n a landmark and unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court of Canada has declared immigration law security certificates used to detain suspected terrorists to be <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2007/2007scc9/2007scc9.html">fundamentally unfair and unconstitutional</a>. <br /><br />The Court, however, did not order the immediate release of six men presently subject to security certificates in Canada. It gave the Parliament of Canada 12 months to fix the legislation, likely through the use of British-style security-cleared special advocates who could challenge secret intelligence presented to the court to justify the detention and deportation of non-citizens. The Court did not exempt the three cases before them from this grace period.<br /><br />The Court's decision recognized the fundamental unfairness of not being allowed to meet a case one does not know. Although recognizing the need to keep intelligence confidential and Canada's reliance on foreign intelligence, it stressed the importance of allowing adversarial challenge to the evidence that the government presents against suspected terrorists. <br /><br />It also held that the denial of judicial review to foreign nationals (ie non permanent residents) until 120 days after their security certificate was upheld as reasonable - a process that can take years - constituted arbitrary detention and an unjustified denial of habeas corpus. This part of the ruling has immediate effect, as opposed to the Court's decision that Parliament has one year to provide for some form of adversarial challenge in the process.<br /><br />Although holding that the specialized Federal Court that reviews security certificates remained an independent court, Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin expressed skepticism about its ability to decide cases fairly in the absence of full adversarial argument. She stated:<blockquote>There are two types of judicial systems, and they ensure that the full case is placed before the judge in two different ways. In inquisitorial systems, as in Continental Europe, the judge takes charge of the gathering of evidence in an independent and impartial way. By contrast, an adversarial system, which is the norm in Canada, relies on the parties &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; who are entitled to disclosure of the case to meet, and to full participation in open proceedings &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; to produce the relevant evidence. The designated judge under the IRPA does not possess the full and independent powers to gather evidence that exist in the inquisitorial process. At the same time, the named person is not given the disclosure and the right to participate in the proceedings that characterize the adversarial process. The result is a concern that the designated judge, despite his or her best efforts to get all the relevant evidence, may be obliged &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; perhaps unknowingly &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; to make the required decision based on only part of the relevant evidence. As Hugessen J. has noted, the adversarial system provides "the real warranty that the outcome of what we do is going to be fair and just" (p. 384); without it, the judge may feel "a little bit like a fig leaf" (Proceedings of the March 2002 Conference, at p. 385).</blockquote>The Court rejected arguments that the security certificate regime constituted only a three wall prison given the risk of torture that the men may face if they returned to their countries of birth. It also approved of the decisions of Federal Court judges to release some of the men under controls and held that judges should continue to review the detentions in light of the reasons for the detention, the length of the detention, reasons for delay in deportation, anticipated future length of detention and alternatives to detention.<br /><br />In examining less drastic alternatives, the Court noted that Canada's <a href="http://www.ararcommission.ca/eng/index.htm">public inquiry</a> on the activities of Canadian officials in relation to Maher Arar used and recommended that security-cleared special advocates be available where the directly affected parties were excluded from hearing classified information. It also looked at a previous practice used in Canada where independent counsel representing a review agency for Canada's security intelligence agency were able to challenge classified intelligence introduced in support of a security certificate and the process used in the Air India terrorism trial in which classified information was disclosed to defence counsel on initial undertakings that it not be disclosed to their client. The Court concluded that all of these procedures provided more adversarial challenge than the present system. No adequate justification had been provided about why they were excluded from the present immigration regime.<br /><br />The Court's decision is largely compatible with <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/39/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/anti-e/rep-e/rep02feb07-e.htm">recommendations</a> made a day earlier by a special committee of Canada's unelected Senate. That committee had recommended that security cleared special advocates be available in all security cases where the government sought to make ex parte representations to a court. It also recommended increased judicial review of security certificates and that appeals be allowed. The Senate Committee also recommended legislative abolition of the Supreme Court's controversial holding in <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2002/2002scc1/2002scc1.html">Suresh v. Canada</a> that deportation to a substantial risk of torture might be constitutional in undefined "exceptional circumstances". The Supreme Court declined to revisit this issue in its case striking down the security certificate decisions on procedural grounds. The Court will, however, likely have to revisit the issue given the government's decision to seek to deport some of the men to Egypt and Syria.<br /><br />The Court also did not deal with the reliability and accuracy of the intelligence used in security certificate cases despite the recent findings of the Arar Commission about the use of unreliable intelligence and the Senate Committee's recommendation that judge reviewing security certificates only received evidence that is "reliable and appropriate."<br /><br />Although it noted criticisms of the British special advocate system that severely restricted the ability of the special advocate to consult the affected person after having received classified information, the Court did not mandate that such consultation should occur, even though it did occur in the Arar Commission and was recommended by the Senate Special Committee.<br /><br />The Canadian Court's decision is in some respects less bold than the House of Lords 2004 Belmarsh decision. The Canadian Court declined to hold that indeterminate detention under security certificates was unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment provided that appropriate procedural review of detention decisions was available. The Court tried to distinguish the Canadian from the British legislation on the basis that the former does not authorize indefinite detention. At the same time, the Canadian legislation places no limits on detention pending deportation and in
some of the men have been detained over 6 years under the security certificate regime because reviewing judges still believe their release to be a danger to national security. <br /><br />The Canadian Court also did not find that long term detention of terrorist suspects under immigration law constituted discrimination against non-citizens given that the terrorist threats is not limited to non-citizens. The Court ruled that the Canadian Charter itself contemplated differential treatment of citizens and non-citizens with respect to deportation.<br /><br />The ball is now in Parliament's court. The Court's decision comes a week before what many anticipate will be a failure of the minority Conservative government to renew two of the most controversial provisions of the 2001 Anti-Terrorism Act, preventive arrests and investigative hearing, from a sun-setting provision. The end result may be new security legislation, but the Canada government may find it more difficult to legislate than their counterparts in the United Kingdom and Australia who have majorities in their legislatures.<br /><br /><br /><em>Kent Roach is the Prichard-Wilson Chair in Law and Public Policy at the University of Toronto and the author of September 11: Consequences for Canada (McGill Queens Press, 2003) and co-editor of Global Anti-Terrorism Law and Policy (Cambridge University Press, 2005)</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/about_us/aboutus_bios.html#jonathan">Jonathan Hafetz</a>, Counsel with the <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a> at New York University School of Law, says that recent court rulings in the US (<em>Boumediene</em>) and Canada (<em>Charkaoui</em>) on the interpretation of laws governing the detention of terror suspects exemplify contrasting approaches to the balancing of rights and national security concerns and that the Canadian ruling, although certainly not perfect, exposes two important shortcomings of the American approach. <br /><br /><em>This op-ed was co-written with Brennan Center intern Anand Balakrishnan, a 2L at Yale Law School.</em><br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/jonathanhafetz.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the Canadian Supreme Court recently handed down opinions that exemplify two distinct judicial approaches to defining the legal bounds of counter-terrorist detentions. In both cases, the courts heard challenges to legislation limiting judicial review over the detention of suspected non-citizen terrorists&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the Military Commissions Act of 2006 ("MCA") in <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200702/05-5062b.pdf">Boumediene v. Bush</a> and the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act ("IRPA") in <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2007/2007scc9/2007scc9.html">Charkaoui v. Canada</a>. The responses could not have been more different. <br /><br />"Federal Courts have no jurisdiction in these cases," Judge A. Raymond Randolph wrote in his 2-1 opinion for the D.C. Circuit in <em>Boumediene</em>. By upholding the MCA's jurisdiction-stripping provisions as they apply to Guantanamo detainees, the D.C. Circuit tied the hands of the judiciary and granted the legislative and executive branches a blank check to detain non-citizens outside the sovereign boundaries of the United States, bereft of substantive constitutional or common law protections. <br /><br />Already, the Executive has held thousands of detainees outside the U.S. borders. If upheld, <em>Boumediene</em>'s reasoning would sanction the creation of extra-territorial prisons beyond the law, notwithstanding the mounting evidence of individuals wrongfully detained in the administration's "war on terror." The decision would also help entrench an emerging two-tier justice system in which foreign nationals may be denied basic protections provided by the U.S. Constitution and international law.<br /><br />Under the D.C. Circuit's decision, Guantanamo detainees may be held indefinitely as "enemy combatants" based upon a summary decision by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal, which denies them the right to see the evidence against them, to have access to an attorney, to present evidence in their defense, and to have their case heard by a neutral decision-maker. No court can review the factual basis for their detention, including whether they are being held based upon evidence gained by torture and other coercion.<br /><br />In contrast to the D.C. Circuit's blanket authorization of the MCA, Canada's Supreme Court took the opportunity in <em>Charkaoui</em> to fine-tune a piece of legislation&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;IRPA&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;to better balance the civil liberties of detainees against the pressing danger of terrorist activity. Put simply, Canada's Supreme Court embraced its institutional responsibility to adjudicate the "fundamental fairness" of IRPA.<br /><br /><em>Charkaoui</em>, a unanimous decision of nine justices, recognized both the real chance of error in detention decisions and the serious consequences of such mistakes. <em>Charkaoui</em> addressed the judicial review afforded by IRPA to permanent residents and foreign nationals detained as security threats. Under IRPA, government ministers are authorized to issue a certificate of inadmissibility for an individual deemed a security risk on terrorist grounds. Upon the issuance of this certificate, a non-citizen is automatically subject to detention. IRPA authorizes Canadian federal judges to review the reasonableness of this classification and detention decision. In such a review, however, any evidence the government declares secret is presumptively sealed from the defense and reviewed in camera with only the government and the judge in attendance, severely curtailing the detainee's ability to contest the factual basis of his detention. <br /><br />To underscore the danger of this detention scheme, the Canadian Supreme Court mentioned the case of Maher Arar, the Syrian terrorist suspect who was arrested at New York's JFK International Airport and illegally rendered to Syria where he was detained for nearly a year and tortured. The court also discussed the Canadian Commission of Inquiry's investigation into Arar's rendition to show how easily an individual could be mistakenly labeled a security threat. <br /><br />With the stakes so high, the Court explained, a detainee must be given every possible chance to contest the evidence marshaled against him and to prove his innocence. Therefore, the current statutory language was held inconsistent with the Canadian Charter guarantee of procedural protections. <br /><br />The Canadian Court's decision is by no means perfect. A recent article in the <em>Globe &amp; Mail</em> points out that, as laudable as the Court's reasoning was, <em>Charkaoui</em> may have erred too far on the side of national security, providing an inadequate guarantee of a fair hearing to detainees. Still, when compared with the D.C. Circuit's reasoning in <em>Boumedienne</em>, the <em>Charkaoui</em> decision exposes two important shortcomings with the American approach to the detention of suspected terrorists. <br /><br />First, the D.C. Circuit failed to understand the centrality of judicial review and due process to a liberal polity that respects the rule of law. The Supreme Court rejected this approach more than 2 &Acirc;&frac12; years ago in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/03pdf/03-334.pdf">Rasul v. Bush</a>, when it explained that "Executive imprisonment has been considered oppressive and lawless" since the Magna Carta. When <em>Boumediene</em> is appealed, the Court will have the opportunity to affirm that it meant what it said in <em>Rasul</em> &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a decision that <em>Charkaoui</em> cites approvingly in support of the principle that "foreign nationals, like others, have a right to prompt review to ensure that their detention complies with the law."<br /><br />Second, the <em>Charkaoui</em> decision exposes the failure of Congress and the Executive to signal to the judiciary and the American people that mistakes have been made in post-9/11 detentions and that the reigning policy should be rethought. The <em>Charkaoui</em> Court could point to the Arar Inquiry to support its decision to grant detainees greater procedural rights. American courts can point to no similar acknowledgement by the U.S. government that mistakes have been made and that existing procedures may have contributed to the torture of innocent individuals. <br /><br />It is doubtful that President Bush will offer an apology to Jose Padilla for wrongly detaining him as an "enemy combatant" or to Maher Arar for the United States' complicity in his illegal rendition to Syria. Congress, however, can step in where the Executive will not, calling for greater oversight of counter-terrorist measures, hearings on extraordinary detention and the elimination of habeas corpus, and investigations into the procedures whereby classifications and decisions to detain have been made. <br /><br />Unlike <em>Boumediene</em>, <em>Charkaoui</em> seeks to promote a rights-respecting approach to counter-terrorism policy. Through an ac
tive judiciary and a national government willing to admit and learn from its previous mistakes, Canada has made steps to crafting a more humane approach to terrorist policy. It is precisely the United States' refusal to embrace this approach that has made Guantanamo a symbol of injustice and lightening rod for criticism throughout the world. <br /><br /><br /><em>Jonathan Hafetz is an attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Kevin Govern, Assistant Professor of Law at the US Military Academy, West Point, NY, discusses the evolution of rule of law challenges in Iraq post-2003 and proposes new criteria for achieving and assessing Iraq&#39;s status as a &quot;rechtsstaat&quot;, i.e. a law-based state...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kevingovern.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>S</strong></font>ince 19 March 2003, when Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) commenced, literally thousands of individuals, in nearly two dozen governmental and nongovernmental entities, business enterprises, and organizations, have worked on rule of law activities in Iraq. These entities, enterprises, and organizations often work without a common concept of what constitutes &quot;rule of law.&quot; They lack a concerted strategy with, by, and for the people and Government of Iraq to achieve a "rechtsstaat," an Iraqi state in which the rule of law prevails. The recent Iraq Study Group and National Intelligence Estimate assessments, reflecting upon increasingly unsettled conditions in Iraq, indicate the time has come for a revised approach to rule of law efforts in Iraq. <br /><br /><strong>Historical Challenges to Defining Rule of Law</strong><br /><br />Some scholars trace the origins of rule of law to Article 39 of the 1215 Magna Charta legally limiting the king's power. In fact, there is no one consistent or binding definition for rule of law or "rechtsstaat" in international law or U.S. law and policy. The German term "rechtstaat", often translated as "the rule of law" in English, comes from the root words "Recht" (the law) and "Staat" (the State) and was first used by nineteenth century legal theorists Roben von Mohl and Rudolph von Gneist. Von Gneist firmly believed in 1867 that a "free legal profession would be the Archimedean lever for accomplishing the liberal project of personal rights and the rule of law." Even Nazis and Communists exercising unchecked authority have claimed the use of laws to achieve "rechtsstaat" status, but V.J.J.M Bekkers, amongst others, has asserted that in a "rechtsstaat" law defines the constitutional rights of citizens against governmental abuses of power.<br /><br />In 1991, the European Commission for Democracy defined "rechtsstaat" (alternatively &quot;&Atilde;&copy;tat de droit,&quot; &quot;stato di diritto&quot;) as "the requirement that the law be respected: domestic law within the State, and international law in the context of international society. Put another way, the State &#8212; in the broadest sense of the term &#8212; must rule out force, arbitrariness and injustice, abiding scrupulously by the law." <br /><br />From the U.S. political and military perspective, there is no one shared definition or set of goals and objectives in law, policy, or doctrine to define "rule of law" or "rechtsstaat." The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has, in testimony before Congress, conceded that "there is no commonly agreed upon definition for the rule of law, [but the DOS] takes it to mean a broad spectrum of activities including a constitution, legislation, a court system and courthouses, a judiciary, police, lawyers and legal assistance, due process procedures, prisons, a commercial code, and anticorruption activities." <br /><br />The US Agency for International Development (USAID) is independent from the DOS but operates in accordance with DOS foreign policy guidance. USAID finds that rule of law "embodies the basic principles of equal treatment of all people before the law, fairness, and both constitutional and actual guarantees of basic human rights." Curiously though, in the FY 2004-2009 Department of State and USAID Strategic Plan, "Security - Democracy &#8212; Prosperity Aligning Diplomacy and Development Assistance," uses the term &quot;rule of law&quot; sixteen (16) times, yet that strategic document never defines the meaning of rule of law.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Defense's (DOD) most recent Annual Report to Congress from 20 November 2006 noted that "rule of law requires a functional legal code, police to investigate crimes and enforce laws, criminal and civil courts to administer justice, and prisons to incarcerate offenders." Curiously, the DOD had not previously defined rule of law in such annual reports to Congress, but did identify which institutions in Iraq contributed to rule of law.<br /><br />Joint Publication (JP) 3-57.1, the DOD's Joint Doctrine for Civil Affairs, issued in post-9/11 April 2003, only cites rule of law twice by way of quotes but lacks definitions for same. The DOD's most recent pronouncement on post-conflict operations (or "Stability, Support, Transition and Reconstruction &#8212; "SSTR" operations), dated November 2005, endorsed but did not define the concept of rule of law. <br /><br />The ground breaking, highly-touted, and long-awaited Field Manual (FM) 3-24, Counterinsurgency, has thirty-three (33) references to the rule of law, yet no clear and explicit definition of what constitutes that.<br /><br />Finally, the U.S. military force most likely to revise its rule of law operations, the U.S. Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command (USACAPOC), recently reissued doctrine on rule of law operations. Field Manual (FM) 3-05.40, Civil Affairs (30 June 2006), contains some definitions which comport with, but do not exactly mirror, the aforementioned rule of law definitions, such as "[t]he purpose of rule of law operations is to create security and stability for the civilian population by restoring and enhancing the effective and fair administration of justice." <br /><br />Just as the old "Army of One" recruiting motto passed out of use, when the necessity for multilateral efforts became more evident, FM 3-05-40 emphasized that "[r]ule of law operations will rarely, if ever, be exclusively a military or even a USG [U.S. Government] activity. Rule of law operations must be a collaborative effort including &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; U.S. military assets &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; other agencies of the federal government, &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; coalitional and other national elements, &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; NGOs engaged in judicial and legal reform &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; HN legal professionals &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; HN law enforcement personnel, and other HN government officials."<br /><br />Departing United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said 11 December 2006 that "the only way to achieve the key principles of international relations &#8212; collective responsibility, global solidarity, the rule of law, mutual accountability and multilateralism &#8212; is by making the best possible use of the United Nations" and that there can be "no security without development and no development without security, and neither can be sustained in the longer term without being rooted in the rule of law and respect for human rights."<br /><br /><strong>Back to Babylon &#8212; Iraq's Rule of Law Heritage, or Lack Thereof</strong><br /><br />If we were to look back to the days of Babylon, we would note that Iraq was quite possibly the birthplace of the rule of law. Hammurabi's rule over Babylon from 1795-1750 BCE had the first discovered, publicly proclaimed and published laws that "regulate[d] in clear and definite strokes the organization of society." <br /><br />In "modern" legal history, we might look back to classical Islamic civilization, when in 632 CE the assembly of the faithful followers of Muhammad (praise be unto him) elected Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) as the first Caliph, or khalifat rasul Allah&#39; (successor of the Prophet of God). The Caliph's inaugural speech reminded those ruled that "[i]f I give you a command departing from the Qur&#39;an or the practice of the Prophet, you owe me no obedience, but must correct me. Truth is righteousness, and falsehood is treason."<br /><br />Professor Khaled Abou El Fadl, testifying befo
re the U.S. Congress in 2003, said Iraq before Saddam Hussein was the "cradle of civilization" in developing legal institutions and substantive laws of the Arabic speaking world and that the "major urban centers of Iraq, Baghdad, Basra, and Kufa, played central roles in the birth of Islamic jurisprudence &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; over the span of a thousand years."<br /><br />El Fadl conceded, though, that "since the late 1970&#39;s the Iraqi legal experience can be summed up as the following: There was no rule of law in Iraq, but only the rule of fear." America's officially-broadcast position on the pre-OIF Iraqi "rechtstaat" was that "Saddam Hussein didn't believe in the rule of law. He exercised power through a sophisticated structure of security services, revolutionary courts, emergency decrees, informers, and the crushing of dissent."<br /><br />On February 19, 2003, a month after Operation Iraqi Freedom commenced, the U.S. Institute for Peace (USIP) held a workshop on "Establishing the Rule of Law in Iraq." The USIP anticipated that the immediate post-war period was likely to be difficult, confusing, and dangerous. The USIP opined that the U.S. was "ill prepared to perform this function," yet establishing the Fourth Geneva Convention would oblige the U.S-led coalition to advance rule of law in Iraq.<br /><br /><strong>Rule of Law Challenges in Iraq: Evolution, Not Resolution</strong><br /><br />The "Future of Iraq Project" was a $5 million DOS effort commissioned in October 2001 and continued through March/April 2003. More than 200 lawyers, engineers, and business people in twelve of seventeen working groups issued reports crafted by Iraqi and other experts on the way ahead for Iraq's government, education, and commercial systems in a post-intervention Iraq. The Future of Iraq Project predicted it would require time, money, effort, and indeed lives to move beyond discussion and accomplish actual implementation.<br /><br />Journalists Eric Schmitt and Joel Brinkley noted the report "forecast[ed] widespread looting in aftermath of Hussein&#39;s fall and recommended force to prevent chaos." Internet archivist Russ Kick claimed "[t]he project&#39;s observations and recommendations were almost wholly ignored by the administration during its pre-war planning for the occupation [but soon] after the invasion, though, CD-ROMs of the reports were sent to the staff of the Coalition Provisional Authority." <br /><br />Fast-forward nearly four years to July 2005, when the DOD assessed its efforts to date through a report to Congress on "Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq." That report asserted that "[t]he ultimate goal of the transitional political process is for Iraq to be governed by an effective and representative democratic system that is: supported by the Iraqi people; capable of exercising responsibility for managing Iraq's affairs, including security; accepted as legitimate by the international community; and committed to promoting civil society, the rule of law, and respect for human rights." <br /><br />The DOD believed that one key measure of progress in Iraq was the establishment of a constitutional and democratic Iraqi government &#8212; law enforcement, justice, and the corrections system, along with Iraqi Security Force (ISF) development. <br /><br />The DOD also recognized the DOS' role in rule of law advancement. The U.S. Embassy in Iraq had been promoting the rule of law through what the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotic and Law Enforcement Affairs' (INL) touted as a "comprehensive, integrated Rule of Law program." <br /><br />In late 2005, the DOS Office of Inspector General (OIG) identified approximately $400 million being spent by multiple federal agencies for rule of law programs in Iraq, in addition to $1 billion for police training. Approximately $300 million went to programs for building Iraq's physical infrastructure for justice, and the remaining $100 million provides for a variety of capacity-building programs. <br /><br />The DOS OIG found "[m]ost of the money for rule-of-law programs appears to have been well spent." Also that "[a] fully integrated approach to rule-of-law programs in Iraq is essential and does not exist at present." Further, the DOS found that "[a] new phase is beginning, in which the defining characteristic must be the successful transition from a U.S.-funded and directed program to a sustainable Iraqi-directed program." The DOS believed that there was "less than optimal coordination within Washington, among U.S. elements in Iraq, and between Washington and Iraq," and that "[b]asic to the success of democracy and good governance is an effective anticorruption regime &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; and [s]ecurity requirements and logistics must be heavily factored into the current cost of activities in Iraq."<br /><br />In August 2006, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales met with Iraq&#39;s deputy prime minister ostensibly to promote &quot;the rule of law.&quot; Gonzales met with the Barham Saleh and the Iraqi High Tribunal to provide &quot;what we can ... to help promote the rule of law and also help promote security in this country.&quot; <br /><br />This effort came none too soon, as the DOS' assessment of Iraqi justice, most notably the Iraqi Ministry of Justice (MOJ) Iraqi Corrections Service (ICS) was that "ICS [Ministry of Justice Iraqi Corrections Service] generally imprisoned civilians under the rule of law, accompanied by a valid confinement order from a judge &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; [but in] practice ministries acting outside the scope of their legal authority detained numerous individuals and enabled many other serious abuses."<br /><br />The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in October 2006, opined regarding "rechtsstaat" aspirations in Iraq that "[t]here is no real consensus on what legal system to use, courts do not exist in many areas and are corrupt and ineffective in many others. Legal authority, like governance, is devolving down to the local level."<br /><br />The Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal's trials of Saddam Hussein and seven co-accused were noted as rule of law challenges and triumphs, especially in spite of the October 2005 killings of defense team members and suspension of proceedings until representation was reconstituted. <br /><br />All of this introspection and assessment so far has lacked a certain precision. To find that, we can look at the World Bank's measures of "rechtstaat"-related measures in Iraq. For the World Bank, "rule of law measures the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, in particular the quality of contract enforcement, the police, and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence." In 2005, however, Iraq came almost dead last among 213 nations evaluated (see generally <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/1740479-1150402582357/2661829-1158008871017/gov_matters_5_tables.pdf">http://siteresources.worldbank.org/ INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/1740479-1150402582357/2661829-1158008871017/gov_matters_5_tables.pdf</a>), tying for second-to-last place overall (along with the Democratic Republic of the Congo / Zaire, and only ahead of Somalia). The Bank report noted that in Iraq was in the:<ul><li>9th percentile for Voice and Accountability (vs. 12th percentile for Afghanistan and 89th % for the U.S.);<br /><li>0 (zero) percentile for Political Stability (vs. 2nd percentile for Afghanistan and 49th percentile for the U.S.);<br /><li>1st percentile Government Effectiveness (vs. 9th percentile for Afghanistan and 92nd percentile for the U.S.);<br /><li>6th percentile for Regulatory Quality (vs. 5th percentile for Afghanistan and 92nd percentile for the U.S.), and;<br /><li>0 (zero) percentile for Rule of Law (vs. 1st percentile for Afghanistan and the 92nd percentile for the U.S.);<br /><li>5th percentile for Control of Corruption (vs. 2nd percentile for Afghanistan and the 92nd percentile for the U.S.).</ul>Perhaps the way ahead to rule of law "rechtstaat" success in Iraq should include one common definition for what rule of law is, what it must includ
e, and commonly accepted measures of effectiveness for rule of law efforts! <br /><br />In 2004 the US Institute of Peace (USIP) came to the following conclusions on Rule of Law in Iraq:<ul><li>Establishing public order in the aftermath of an international military intervention is "job one." <br /><li>Military combat units, however, are neither trained nor equipped for riot control and law enforcement functions. <br /><li>No rapidly deployable U.S. civilian capacity exists to provide the full spectrum of rule of law functions.<br /><li>The optimal way to remedy this critical deficiency would be to establish a Rule of Law Reserves (RLR) and a single federal Office for Rule of Law Operations (ORLO) that would have the permanent authority to recruit, deploy, and manage constabu&Acirc;&not;lary police units and individual police, judges, attorneys, court staff, and corrections officers in peace and stability operations. <br /><li>Locating ORLO in the Office of the Secretary of State would give it the access to senior policymakers that its mission requires. <br /><li>ORLO should be placed within a larger construct, perhaps a new agency or organiza&Acirc;&not;tion for stability operations. <br /><li>By preventing a public security gap, the process of providing relief and reconstruction assistance will be greatly facilitated and the transition to stable governance accelerated.</ul><strong>A Modest Proposal for Achieving Complex Goals &#8212; Three Criteria for Rule of Law in Iraq</strong> <br /><br />I would offer the following three criteria as certain requirements for making real rule of law inroads in Iraq:<ul><li>Creating a baseline of security and order in Iraqi society;<li>Harmony if not unity of effort towards accomplishing identified rule of law objectives, and;<li>Continuity of effort in the way ahead.</ul><em>Creating a baseline of security and order in Iraqi society</em><br /><br />Referring back to the first USIP conclusion, security is "job one." Even before Operation Iraqi Freedom, experts recognized the necessity for creating the baseline of security and order in Iraqi society, where there never had been a baseline under Saddam Hussein's brutal regime. <br /><br />The Working Group on Transitional Justice in Iraq and Iraqi Jurists Association said in March 2003 that "the role of an independent judiciary cannot be over-emphasized, particularly in a society where individual rights and freedoms have been trampled upon so comprehensively as they have been in Iraq under Saddam Hussein."<br /><br />Karl Rohr noted in a recent Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) thesis that: "Immediate security, rule of law, and governance are accomplished by the rapid establishment of regional development zones (RDZ) and insertion of provincial reconstruction team's (PRT)." Rohr went on to explain that a PRT "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;as envisioned in Progressive Reconstruction is an interdisciplinary civilian-military unit designed to provide a stabilization and reconstruction capability to a military intervention." <br /><br />Rohr had pessimistically observed that: "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; during OIF-1 [initial combat operations of Operation Iraqi Freedom] the rear areas were not organized to accomplish this task [or restoring public order] and it was not accomplished. The rear area commanders did not exercise the rule of law as they were not manned to do so." Rohr observed those commanders' entire focus was "supplying of the frontline troops &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a monumental task in and of itself."<br /><br />Ensuring adequate and appropriate training of judges, prosecutors, and attorneys is also a challenge. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2004 that the U.S. DOJ "trained hundreds of Iraqi judges on basic tenets of human rights, due process, and rule of law." <br /><br />Predicting into the future, the DOJ anticipated that: "Iraq's judicial system would take years as a competent body of legal professionals is developed. The lack of a system of data collection and measurement makes it difficult to accurately assess the functioning of the judicial system &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; by February 2004 no progress had been made on developing these measures."<br /><br /><em>Harmony if not unity of effort towards accomplishing identified rule of law objectives</em><br /><br />Is there some supreme irony that the people of Iraq, whose home includes the legendary town of Babel, would find themselves hearing the tongues of many nations and organizations pronouncing rule of law differently, let alone seeing their efforts as sometimes divergent and other times convergent? In a word, YES! <br /><br />During the initial phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the USIP did suggest another sort of trained, equipped, deployable and integrated rule of law organization that would employ interagency and coalitional efforts as a variation on the above-mentioned "ORLO" theme: "a civilian 'Stability Force' composed of constabulary, police, and legal teams of prosecutors, judges, and corrections officers &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; [to] arrive in Iraq as soon as possible after conclusion of the conflict. It should work with local police, courts, and prisons to maintain public order, control crime, prosecute war criminals, protect minorities, and ensure respect for human rights." The USIP believed the U.S. should be prepared to bear the burden of establishing the rule of law in Iraq: "[t]his will not be easy, but the contribution of a U.S. Stability Force to creating sustainable security will be more than worth the effort.<br /><br />As of the date of this writing, no overarching interagency-coalitional solution has yet to be introduced as a way to establish harmony, if not unity, of effort towards accomplishing identified rule of law objectives.<br /><br />What has been accomplished in harmony and unity of effort as a distinct success story has in large part been a tribute to the so-called "Provincial Reconstruction Teams" (or PRTs). These distinctive and highly successful interagency teams in both Afghanistan and Iraq advance not only harmony but unity of effort towards accomplishing rule of law objectives In 2006, the GAO noted how the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I) was developing provincial assistance teams as a component of an integrated counterinsurgency strategy. These teams would consist of coalition military and civilian personnel who would assist Iraq's provincial governments by:<ol><li>Developing a transparent and sustained capability to govern;<br /><li>Promoting increased security, rule of law, and political and economic development; and<br /><li>Providing the provincial administration necessary to meet the basic needs of the population.</ol>U.S. President Bush announced on 10 January 2007 that the PRT program would expand in Iraq; that it will include at least 8 new coalitional PRTs, in addition to the existing 10 (i.e. at least 18 in total): five new PRTs in Baghdad, two in Anbar, and one in Balad, in addition to already existing U.S.-led PRTs in Ninewa, Kirkuk, Salah ad Din, Diyala, and Babil and Coalition-led PRTs in Basrah (UK), Dhi Qar (Italy), and Erbil (Korea).<br /><br /><em>Continuity of effort in the way ahead</em><br /><br />The President's 30 November 2005 National Strategy for Victory in Iraq laid out a three-tracked, integrated strategy for creating and continuing conditions for the rule of law in Iraq:<ul><li>The security track emphasizes developing the capacity of Iraqis to secure their country. <br /><li>The economic track will help the Iraqi government set the foundation for a sound and self-sustaining economy with the capacity to deliver essential services. <br /><li>The political track works to forge a broadly supported national compact for democratic governance.</ul>On continuity of effort, Rohr recognized that long term planning and setting conditions is critical for measurable, tangible rule of law successes: "[c]reating the organization for governance, security and the rule of law is the most important step of Progressive Reconstruction." <br /><br />In the DOD's most recent, November 2006, report to Congre
ss on "Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq," the DOD noted "incremental progress in the Government of Iraq's willingness and ability to take over responsibility, to build institutions, and to deliver essential services. This progress is notable given the escalating violence in some of Iraq's more populous regions and the tragic loss of civilian life at the hands of terrorists and other extremists." The DOD also observed how "Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) ha[d] assumed more leadership in counter-insurgency and law enforcement operations as they approach[ed] completion of the programmed goals for training and equipping."<br /><br />Sustainable continuity in rule of law efforts is measured not so much by money spent but whether money is spent well. Towards that end, the USAID's Office of Democracy and Governance Rule of Law Program obligated and made available through Fiscal year 2007 nearly $5.9 million on democracy, conflict and humanitarian assistance dollars.<br /><br />Regardless of whatever rule of law or "rechtsstaat" definition is used, these funds have and will be used in public-private partnerships with US, Iraqi, and other national entities. In USAID's estimation these efforts will be<ul><li>Supporting the role of legal systems in consolidating democracy;<br /><li>Promoting respect for human rights;<br /><li>Improving the institutional administration of justice;<br /><li>Increasing access to justice; and<br /><li>Building local constituencies for justice sector reform and improvement.<br />Keeping to its USAID objectives from 2003, Iraq must, at a minimum, ultimately defeat the insurgency, transform the Iraqi government, create a market economy, and prepare for the future.</ul>Considering all this, some elemental but essential questions remain yet unanswered on this and all other aspects of advancing rule of law in Iraq:<ul><li>Who will help the Iraqis achieve rule of law? <br /><li>What additional measures may become necessary as rule of law progresses or regresses in Iraq?<br /><li>When will success be achieved and what will it look like?<br /><li>Where do these initiatives have to be implemented and secured if not everywhere?<br /><li>Why will Iraqis and others continue this effort or resist it?<br /><li>How much will this cost in lives and in currency if rule of law is not achieved in Iraq?</ul><em>Conclusion</em><br /><br />This commentary has drawn mightily, if not entirely, upon the ideas and efforts of others, yet I hope this collection, analysis, and commentary might cause readers to rethink recent rule of law efforts in Iraq as the &quot;way ahead&quot; is contemplated and implemented. <br /><br />Perhaps the following two quotes best capture the essence of a comprehensive and multifaceted rule of law &quot;way ahead&quot; strategy:<br />  <br />&quot;Recognizing that order must come through law and that the rule of law requires ordinary citizens to have a stake in upholding the rules means paying attention to those citizens&#39; most basic economic and social needs around the world.&quot;<br />  <br />- Princeton Project on National Security, 27 September 2006; and<br /><br />&quot;Development, security and human rights must go hand in hand; and that there can be no security without development and no development without security and neither can be sustained in the longer term without being rooted in the rule of law and respect for human rights.&quot;<br /> <br />- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, 14 December 2006<br /><br /><br /><em>Kevin Govern is an Army Judge Advocate General's Corps Officer, teaching Comparative Legal Systems, Constitutional and Military Law, the Law of Armed Conflict, and lecturer on other legal aspects of armed conflict and stability, support, transition and reconstruction operations.

I am grateful to the Attorney General in the fair manner upon which he has approached this matter.<br /><br />It is my contention, supported by many, that Saddam Hussein et all did not receive a fair trial. This view is supported by a number of organisations, including the UNHRC which filed a brief in the case of Taha Ramadan.<br /><br />I shall be responding to Lord Goldsmith and expect to be granted leave to indict Rahman at the Central Criminal Court in London. He has sought the protection of the United Kingdom. He must now abide by its jurisdiction and laws.&quot;<br />

		<title>Restoring the Second Amendment in Parker v. Columbia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.gurapossessky.com/"><strong>Alan Gura</strong></a> [attorney, Gura &amp; Possessky, PLLC, lead counsel for plaintiffs in <em>Parker v. District of Columbia</em>]: &quot;Fear and disinformation have long been the hallmarks of the movement to end private gun ownership.  Not surprisingly, the D.C. Circuit&#39;s decision in <em>Parker v. District of Columbia</em>, confirming that people have an individual right to keep and bear arms, has elicited outrageous predictions of doom from gun prohibitionists.  The Violence Policy Center&#39;s Josh Sugarmann neatly summed up the hysteria in warning that <em>Parker</em> &#39;may mark the beginning of a long, national nightmare from which we will never recover as a nation.&#39;<br /><br />Allow me to offer a more optimistic view: <em>Parker</em> not only marks the beginning of the end of gun prohibition, it might also reverse the erosion of our individual rights by re-enforcing the primacy of judicial review and preventing sophists from defining rights out of existence.<br /><br />Most Americans are not Second Amendment absolutists, in either the negative or positive sense of the term.  We tend to appreciate the individual right to arms without excessive regulatory harassment, understanding the value that firearms provide in securing individuals from violent criminal predation and precluding a dangerous government monopoly on force.   We likewise understand that not all weapons should be possessed by all people at all times.  <br /><br />In practical terms, <em>Parker</em>&#39;s correct interpretation of the Second Amendment &#8212; a cherished individual right which, like all other rights, is subject to some measure of regulation &#8212; happily coincides with the public&#39;s appreciation of constitutional liberty.<br /><br /><em>Parker</em> is thus a bitter pill for prohibitionists who have grown comfortable invoking the language of moderation to conceal their agenda.  The laws struck down in <em>Parker</em> prohibited law abiding adult citizens from having <em>any</em> functional firearms, and <em>all</em> handguns, in their homes.  Such laws are extremist and absolute, far from reflecting &#39;common sense,&#39; &#39;safety,&#39; or &#39;moderation.&#39;  Critics of <em>Parker</em>&#39;s immediate result are outside the mainstream of thinking on gun control.  And they know that <em>Parker</em>&#39;s recognition of the individual right forecloses an incremental regulatory assault on private firearms ownership just as it forecloses Washington, D.C.&#39;s complete ban.  Hence their despair. <br /><br />The individual right to arms will not bring (additional) anarchy to the streets of Washington any more than the First Amendment&#39;s free exercise clause has spawned a wave of ritualistic human sacrifice.  The ultimate contours of the Second Amendment right will never be fully defined, just as no single court decision will for all time resolve the precise boundaries of free speech under the First Amendment or a &#39;reasonable search&#39; under the Fourth.  <em>Parker</em> means merely that courts will evaluate gun laws the same way that courts review laws touching upon other constitutional rights: by balancing the fundamental individual right at stake against the purported regulatory interest.  <br /><br />At times, the government interest will prevail.  For example, laws barring felons from accessing guns will undoubtedly be upheld, and metal detectors for airline passengers are here to stay.  But complete bans, arbitrary and capricious interference with the right to arms, and oppressive regulations based on flimsy reasoning with no apparent empirical support or genuine public benefit will yield to the individual right &#8212; as they should.<br /><br /><em>Parker</em>&#39;s benefits also extend well beyond the narrow issue of gun regulation.  This is not a forum for me to review the immense literature debunking the so-called &#39;collective right&#39; theory of the Second Amendment.  Suffice it to say that the theory tries to jam a square constitutional peg into anti-gun activists&#39; round policy hole.  Frustrated by the Constitution&#39;s inescapable command, the government&#39;s efforts generated gems such as this, from the opposition to our summary judgment motion in <em>Parker</em>:<blockquote>Conditions and practical considerations, not arcane legal theories and historical excursions, should determine the outcome of cases like the present and the constitutionality of statutes like those at issue here.</blockquote>There you have it.  Who needs the Constitution, anyway?  If the government believes it&#39;s practical, then let&#39;s consider it constitutional.  People generally sympathetic to other civil rights, but who are personally uncomfortable with guns or skeptical of the Second Amendment&#39;s utility, should pause before welcoming this sort of logic to the Bill of Rights.  The alarming theme of expedience-over-law permeates the government&#39;s pending petition for <em>en banc</em> review (emphasis added):<blockquote>How best to control gun violence is a complex topic, with many competing, passionately held views.  The politically accountable legislatures . . . . are the best fora for considering such competing views.  Whether or not they are correct, constitutional rulings like that of the panel majority severely limit what measures the political branches can take . . .</blockquote>&quot;Whether or not they are correct?&quot;  Imagine if that chestnut were applied to other Constitutional provisions.  The Second Amendment reflects one of many policy preferences enshrined in our basic law.  None is universally popular.  Could the Fourth Amendment be adopted today, with the full acquiescence of drug- and terror- warriors?  It&#39;s mid-April once again: is everyone still happy with the Sixteenth Amendment?  Even the creation of a federal district lacking voting representation in Congress remains controversial today.<br /><br />Contrary to what city officials believe, it still matters &#39;whether or not [courts] are correct&#39; in stopping the government from overstepping its constitutional bounds.  Gun rights advocates look forward to <em>Parker</em>&#39;s positive impact on public safety.  Striking down the gun ban will raise the risk to home invaders in Washington, and bring peace of mind to many of the city&#39;s vulnerable residents.  But <em>Parker</em>&#39;s greater ameliorative effects on lawlessness may lie in the decision&#39;s affirmation of judicial review as a check on government officials who presume that their &#39;practical considerations&#39; trump the Constitution.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=56125><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: &quot;House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is moving on the right path in exploring the possibilities of negotiated solutions to the problems that threaten the peace of the Middle East. Her bold initiative to meet with two Muslim rulers, the Syrian President and the Saudi King, is in line with the UN Charter and customary international law that require nations to resolve disputes without threats and employment of force. <br /><br />As the Speaker of the US House of Representatives--which reflects the will of the American people in the most recent general elections (more so than the White House)--Pelosi has every right to take foreign policy initiatives that involve the enumerated constitutional powers of the Congress. According to the Constitution, the Congress provides for the common defense of the United States; it has the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations; to define and punish offenses against the law of nations; and to declare war.  Speaker Pelosi&#39;s Middle East visits involve the constitutional issues of defense, commerce, law of nations, and war and peace. She must gather facts on her own, in light of the lies that have been told to the Congress.<br /><br />Furthermore, the United States is bogged down in a bloody war that refuses to go away. American soldiers are dying in dozens. The country has lost respect across the world. Americans face ill-will when they travel abroad. The US foreign policy is anti-commerce as American businessmen are losing opportunities in the Muslim world and elsewhere. American universities and colleges are losing foreign students due to stupid and paranoid visa policies (a complaint that the Saudis made to Speaker Pelosi). In view of these grave matters, Speaker Pelosi must explore the possibilities of turning the matters around so that the House can discharge its constitutional duties in an informed manner.&quot;<br />

		<title>More Guantanamo hunger strikes: the silence is deafening</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://medweb.bham.ac.uk/http/depts/clin_neuro/djn.html"><strong>David Nicholl</strong></a> [neurologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK; British human and medical rights activist]: &quot;The legal black-hole of Guantanamo is well recognised, however it is less well realised how the ongoing breaches of medical ethics in Guantanamo are damaging the normally high standards of US medicine. In <a href="/forumy/2006/06/guantanamo-and-medical-ethics.php">June 2006</a>, I and over 250 physicians criticised the use of forcefeeding and restraints on Guantanamo Bay hunger strikers as being in breach of accepted international treaties such as the Declarations of Malta and <a href="http://www.wma.net/e/policy/c18.htm">Tokyo</a>. I lodged formal complaints regarding one of the physicians concerned with the Medical Boards for Georgia and California in February 2005 and also pointed out to the American Medical Association, a co-signatory to the Declarations of Tokyo and Malta, that at least one of the doctors concerned was an AMA member. Over a year later, none of these esteemed bodies have replied or taken any action. Sadly, the medical establishment has a good track record of failing to investigate such matters. For example, in apartheid South Africa 30 years ago, the regulatory authorities initially failed to take any action against the negligent treatment in custody of the activist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Biko">Steve Biko</a> who died whilst being interrogated. Ironically, the authorities initially claimed he had died as the consequences of being on prolonged hunger strike. It was only grass-roots doctors who ended up taking action to have the <a href="http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/media/1997/9701/s970130a.htm">2 doctors responsible</a> <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9407E5DA1E39F934A25753C1A963948260">reprimanded</a> eight years later for their complicity with torture.<br /><br />Thus it should be no surprise to have the <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/guantanamo-detainee-hunger-strikes-up.php">recurrence of hunger strikes</a> again in Guantanamo with the absence of any proper legal process after over 5 years of detention. Doubtless the solution will be the use of more of the <a href="http://www.restraintchair.com/">restraint chairs</a> which proved so effective at ending the 2006 hunger strike. The challenge now is what action will the US medical establishment take to restore its reputation. A doctor&#39;s first duty, even in the military, is to respect patient autonomy as stated by the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList302/F18AA3CE47E5A98BC1256B66005D6E29">International Red Cross</a> in their guidance for the management of hunger strikers.<br /><br />Guantanamo has become a by-word for the abuse of both the principles of law and medical ethics. The failure of the US medical establishment to take action over such abuses is to be lamented. <a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/332/7545/854-c?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=nicholl+guantanamo&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT">Their silence is deafening</a>.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp"><strong>Shane Kadidal</strong></a> [Managing Attorney, <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> Guantanamo Global Justice Initiative]: &quot;On April 2, 2007, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-declines-to-hear.php">denied cert</a> in <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/september_11th/sept11Article.asp?ObjID=LC1mo1eLnN&Content=971">our appeal</a> of the D.C. Circuit&#39;s decision denying federal court jurisdiction over habeas corpus petitions of Guant&aacute;namo detainees. Justices Breyer, Souter, and Ginsburg dissented, with the first two also stating that they would have granted an expedited hearing this May. The decision, while by no means a death blow to the detainees&#39; fundamental claims, ensures additional long delays before the court process can result in release for any of the many acknowledged innocent men held at the base.<br /><br />Justices Stevens and Kennedy, who voted to deny review, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/BoumedieneDenial.pdf">issued a statement</a> indicating that detainees should exhaust the process set up by the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA) to better allow the Court to determine if that review process is an adequate substitute for habeas corpus. This inquiry itself implies strongly that five justices agree that the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), which the government claims strips jurisdiction in these cases from the courts, suspends the writ of habeas corpus. The DTA nominally allows detainees to challenge in the Court of Appeals the decisions of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) determining they are so-called &quot;enemy combatants.&quot;<br /><br />However, the CSRT process is fatally flawed: the government controls what evidence and witnesses are permitted; classified evidence, hearsay, and evidence obtained by torture is admissible; and the detainees have no right to counsel. The end target of the process is also elusive: the definition of &quot;enemy combatant&quot; has shifted several times in the past three years, and the current statutory definition in the MCA is virtually limitless in who can be classified as an &quot;enemy combatant.&quot; Even with the system heavily stacked against them, some detainees have been exonerated by the panels&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;in some cases, some of the men were then sent through the process a second or third time until the military got the result it wanted.<br /><br />Moreover, review from the decisions of these military panels is exceedingly limited under the terms of the DTA. The DTA states that the Court of Appeals can inquire only into whether the government adhered to its own rules and contains no provision for considering additional facts not admitted during the CSRT process. While the DTA also says the Court should ask, &quot;to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent&quot; with them, the D.C. Circuit has already claimed the Constitution does not protect the detainees &#8212; a ruling in direct conflict with the 2004 Supreme Court Rasul decision, but one that the government will likely argue vastly narrows the scope of review.<br /><br />If this limited appeal fails, the DTA purports to foreclose further review in the Supreme Court. Even if the D.C. Circuit did rule in favor of the detainee, the DTA doesn&#39;t spell out a remedy, and the government has argued that the remedy may be yet another CSRT proceeding (although Stevens and Kennedy pointed out that should the government create further unreasonable delays, other ongoing injuries, or take steps to &quot;prejudice ... review in this Court,&quot; the Court could act promptly in response via a number of alternative procedural pathways, presumably including the filing of original writs of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court itself). <br /><br />In light of all the fundamental flaws with the DTA, it is puzzling why Justices Stevens and Kennedy felt this process should be exhausted (a few guesses are <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2007/04/what-now-at-gtmo.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/washington/03gitmo.html">here</a>), although the inevitable delays now give Congress a prime opportunity to fix the process as well as underline the need for such a legislative solution.<br /><br />The military, likely exaggerating, says that it will charge up to 80 or so of the 380 men remaining at Guant&aacute;namo. The Supreme Court&#39;s actions yesterday effectively sentenced the remaining 300 to another year in prison before they can argue for their release in a fair forum.&quot;<br />

		<title>Beyond Orwell: the existential threat of Guantanamo detainees</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm"><strong>Ben Davis</strong></a> [University of Toledo College of Law]: &quot;Taking together the report of the Justice Department filing to reduce access of lawyers to GITMO detainee clients, the medical establishment&#39;s approach to those detainees, and snippets of George Tenet&#39;s interview on <em>60 Minutes</em> about his new book, one can see that these detainees are perceived as much more than just enemies of the state.  Rather they are existential threats to the self-image of all the persons saying &quot;We do not condone or do torture.&quot; <br /><br />What the representatives of the state say and what these detainees say was done to them is too much of a contradiction. To eliminate the contradiction, the representatives of the state do everything to eliminate the existential threat to their self-worth - to silence the threatening other vision. Of course, this can be psychologically reconciled through seeing these detainees also as existential threats to the state - enemies of the state - against whom all can be done as the end justify the means. In this regard, they seek to remind us of the feeling after 9/11 to help them rationalize their actions beyond law.<br /><br />This reminds me of the discussion of thanatophores (&quot;death bringers&quot;) in a book entitled the <em>Psychopathology of Institutional Links</em>. The way to battle death bringers in that book was to &quot;bring light&quot;.  This effort to bring light is precisely what so many persons are trying to do to fight this very twisted stuff that goes even beyond Orwell. We should continue to resist these efforts to legitimize an illegality and gain our acquiescence - if for no other reason then to lay down a marker that certain types of state action are simply not acceptable.  This is the task of citizens as they speak to their government.  We should not grant (nor permit these representatives of the state to grant themselves) some type of absolution - way too convenient.  Not before the full story comes out and high-level civilians are made accountable for what they countenanced and ordered.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp"><strong>J. Wells Dixon</strong></a> [attorney, <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> Guantanamo Global Justice Initiative]: &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2007/03/guantanamo-tribunals-begin-top-terror.php">In the last week</a>, the government has released unclassified excerpts of Combatant Status Review Tribunal proceedings for four men who were transferred from secret CIA prisons to Guantanamo Bay in September 2006. These documents are remarkable not only because they reveal confessions to horrible acts of violence &#8212; in the cases of Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Walid Bin Attash &#8212; but also because they raise concerns about the use of evidence obtained by torture and coercion so serious that Senators Graham and Levin, who surreptitiously witnessed KSM&#39;s hearing, have called for a thorough investigation.<br /><br />The government&#39;s dual purpose in releasing selected portions of the transcripts is abundantly clear. First, it must go through the proverbial motions to obtain a finding that these men are &quot;unlawful enemy combatants&quot; &#8212; i.e., that they are somehow associated with the Taliban or Al Qaeda &#8212; which is a technical jurisdictional requirement to make them eligible for trial by military commission. Second, the government is plainly attempting to legitimize their continuing detention by showing that they have received some measure of fair process. But the CSRTs cannot justify the unlawful detention of these men &#8212; which has included their disappearance into secret CIA prisons overseas for several years, infliction of &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; amounting to torture, and denial of access to counsel and isolation for the last six months at Guantanamo &#8212; or the flawed military commission process through which they will likely be charged and tried.<br /><br />While the government may seek to convince the public that the CSRT process is fair and effective in meting out justice to terrorists by parading the so-called &quot;worst of the worst&quot; before these tribunals to announce their confessions, these hearings in no way resemble fair proceedings. Rather, they have all of the hallmarks of the infamous Star Chamber in Tudor England &#8212; proceedings conducted largely in secret, without formal charges or access to counsel, with no opportunity for a defendant to view or test evidence against him or to call witnesses or present other evidence in his own defense, and with frequent reliance on evidence obtained through torture and coercion. Like their royal predecessor, the CSRTs are sham proceedings established to try unspecified or undefined offenses without public scrutiny and to conceal the circumstances under which alleged confessions to these offenses were likely extracted. Any suggestions that the CSRT proceedings comport with our values and traditional notions of justice insults our nation&#39;s Founders who insisted on due process and strict adherence to the rule of law.<br /><br />We have a system of justice in this country with rules that are fair and fully capable of trying individuals accused of heinous offenses &#8212; the criminal justice system &#8212; which notably has been used successfully to prosecute alleged terrorists, both foreign and domestic. Indeed, it is only in an open court before a neutral judge, with access to counsel and a fair opportunity to present and test evidence against a detainee, that we will really know whether that person has made a knowing and voluntary confession or is otherwise guilty of terrorist acts. And it is in open court that the torture and abuse that these men have likely suffered at the hands of U.S. officials, and the possible complicity of foreign governments in the CIA&#39;s secret prison program, will be exposed. <br /><br />Ultimately, by labeling these detainees as unlawful enemy combatants and refusing to give them fair trials in the civilian court system, the government creates a substantial risk of validating what men like KSM want most &#8212; to be seen as legitimate warriors against the United States &#8212; rather than what they may actually be &#8212; perpetrators of crimes against humanity.&quot;<br />

		<title>The Hazleton immigration ordinance trial: an inside perspective</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jackson Chin [Associate Counsel, <a href="http://www.prldef.org/Index.htm">Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> (PRLDEF)]: &quot;This federal lawsuit [Lozano et. al v. City of Hazleton] raises novel issues of law, e.g., whether municipal ordinances that seek to regulate and punish business and property owners who provide shelter to illegal aliens are federally preempted and violate the U.S. Constitution, and a host of federal statutes and state laws. The bench trial opened on Monday, March 12, 2007 in the Middle District Federal Court in Scranton before the Hon. James Munley; it is being monitored by courts in pending trials challenging similar anti-immigrant ordinances.<br /><br />Some pre-trial highlights include the Court&#39;s grant of a Plaintiff&#39;s Motion for a Protective Order to prohibit disclosure of the names, specific identity and immigration status data of Doe Plaintiffs during discovery, denials of both parties&#39; motions in limine to preclude evidence (including Defendant&#39;s untimely submission of expert witnesses and reports after close of discovery), extensions of the TRO to permit Defendant City to amend its ordinances, and, the Court&#39;s non-decision regarding motions for summary judgment and a motion to dismiss. <br /><br />On the first day of trial, outside the courthouse, national and broadcast media fueled a media circus along with a colorful afternoon &quot;pro-immigrant&quot; rally with over two hundred attendees. The courthouse barred all electronic recording devices. A handful of regional and local print reporters tracked the trial with varying degrees of balanced coverage.<br /><br />Plaintiffs&#39; case-in-chief consisted of live testimony from 5 plaintiffs, 6 fact witnesses (Defendant City&#39;s Mayor and city officials), 3 experts, and the submission of deposition testimony for four of the Doe Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs presented its case: that after its Complaint identified flaws in the first ordinance which penalized all who provided goods and services as aider-abettors of illegal immigration, Defendant City of Hazleton repealed its first ordinance (passed in July 2006). The City enacted and amended its ordinances two more times with the help of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a D.C.-based immigration restrictionist lobby and its attorney Kris Kobach. In promoting the ordinances, the Mayor repeatedly cited a particular murder incident involving illegal alien suspects, but testified he had possessed no empirical crime data or population data to support his claim that swelling numbers of illegal aliens had created a wave of terror in its city. Of the tens of thousands of crimes recorded in Hazleton&#39;s Police data in a five year period, only 20 were credibly by attributed to the undocumented. <br /><br />With a series of amendments, the Hazleton ordinances are confusing to its residents. Each tenant and household occupant (over the age of 18) is required to apply in-person at City Hall for a Tenant occupancy permit upon showing document proof of citizenship and legal status; landlords are prohibited from renting to tenants without such permits risking $1000 a day fines. Any person can file a bare complaint with the City alleging that a business or landlord is harboring an illegal immigrant, triggering burdens upon landlords and business owners to cure or lose their business license and right to collect rents. And, the City&#39;s English-Only law governs the provision of city services.<br /><br />Plaintiffs showed that in the months that followed and in a national election year, the Defendant Mayor&#39;s media driven campaign stoked panic and fear among the City&#39;s newcomer Latino residents and business owners. Latinos complained about illegal police ID checks of Latino immigrants in the streets, public insults, and, parents fretting over the welfare of their school-age children. These led to Latinos staying at home, the flight of immigrant families, businesses in the City&#39;s Hispanic district losing customers, mounting sales income losses due to a &quot;ghost-town&quot; effect, mortgage defaults arose, Latino businesses closing, and landlords with hardships renting to tenants. The court issuance of the TRO (October 31, 2006) provided a stabilizing effect but the ordinance&#39;s intended impact was palpable. Plaintiffs also showed that the police chief and other officials were not consulted by the Mayor, that no research existed tending to show a crisis of illegal immigrants existed before the bills were proposed, and, that the City&#39;s blame failed to distinguish its Latino residents, whether citizen, immigrant or undocumented, causing community fear and discord.<br /><br />The Defendant conceded on Day One that it would voluntarily remove a reference to race and national origin in the text of its ordinance to vitiate Plaintiffs&#39; equal protection claim. Three days later, the City amended the challenged ordinance in a special session.<br /><br />Defendant&#39;s case included testimony from 4 experts, 5 fact witnesses, and, the Defendant City&#39;s Mayor. The thrust of Defendant&#39;s case was to attempt to justify the City Mayor&#39;s motto that &quot;illegal is illegal&quot; and that such persons must be driven out of his city. Even if mixed status families lived in his city. Defendant&#39;s experts asserted that national data could be used to project the adverse fiscal impacts of illegal immigrants with low job skills on localities, as seen in local schools&#39; increased ESL enrollments, particular crimes, low payroll taxes, and, the longer waiting times in the region&#39;s hospital emergency room. A battle of experts discussed whether the city ordinance&#39;s reliance on accessing federal immigration databases was realistic or problematic, and, whether databases were error-prone and incomplete. <br /><br />At trial, the Court made frequent favorable rulings for both parties on admissibility and &quot;relaxed&quot; the federal rules of evidence on hearsay evidence, etc. desiring to hear as much as possible.  The parties will submit their post-trial briefs due in April 2007. Then, the court will make a decision. It is likely the losing party will take an appeal to the 3rd Circuit.<br /><br />Plaintiffs&#39; trial counsel include: Denise Alvarez, Jackson Chin, Foster Maer (Puerto Rican Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund), Shamaine Daniels (Community Law Project, Harrisburg), Witold &quot;Viv&quot; Walczak, Omar Jadwat (ACLU-Pa. and ACLU-IRP) and Thomas Wilkinson, Thomas Fiddler, and Ilan Rosenberg (Cozen O&#39;Connor). Defendant&#39;s trial counsel include Kris Kobach, Harry &quot;Hank&quot; Deasey, Drew Adair, and, Karla Maresca (Deasey Mahoney &amp; Bender). Additional co-counsel for each side are named on the papers.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.fairuk.org/"><strong>Iram Janjua</strong></a> [Legal Consultant, Forum Against Islamophobia &amp; Racism (FAIR)]: &quot;The number of practising Muslims in Britain and Europe is increasing with some women preparing to manifest a more stricter affirmation of their religious identity by choosing to wear the niqab (face veil) as opposed to the more common hijab (headscarf) and this is where the controversy lies. Here, I do not discuss the rights and wrongs of the niqab for that is an individual choice to be made by Muslim women, but rather I intend to draw attention to the legal implications of <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/uk-court-upholds-school-islamic.php">banning the niqab</a> at various public institutions.<br /><br />In practice, most institutions, such as schools, are free to devise their uniform policies which are, in most cases, open to interpretation. The case of the student, Shabina Begum, instigated the inquisitiveness in Islamic dress in schools. The school objected to the student&#39;s decision to wear the jilbab (long gown) and in a judicial review the student claimed interference with her right to manifest her religion and right to education protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. After several deliberations (by the courts and media alike) a final decision by the House Of Lords ruled in favour of the school.<br /><br />The Shabina Begum case provides very little insight as far as niqabs are concerned as it was an individual ruling, a different element of dress (as opposed to a face covering) and, therefore, unlikely to have set any precedent, as Lord Bingham put it &quot;The House is not, and could not be, invited to rule on whether Islamic dress, or any feature of Islamic dress, should or should not be permitted in the schools of this country&quot;. Therefore, the current legal position of niqabs is a lot more uncertain. However, the recent interest surrounding the niqab invoked by the British Minster Jack Straw MP (who wrote in a column that he considered the veil a &quot;visible statement of separation and of difference&quot;) [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5410472.stm">1</a>] could eventually bring a challenge to the Lords. <br /><br />Last year a Muslim classroom assistant was suspended by a school for wearing the niqab in lessons, she was later sacked. The employment tribunal dismissed her claim for religious discrimination but did award her &Acirc;&pound;1100 compensation for victimisation. [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6068408.stm">2</a>] She appealed against the decision which is scheduled to be heard at the Employment Appeals Tribunal later this year. [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bradford/6282459.stm">3</a>] In a hotly contested trial, holding not only legal ramifications but also social and political, the tremulous decision will be controversial whatever the outcome. <br /><br />A High Court case involving a 12 year old pupil and her head-teacher, who banned her from wearing the niqab in the classroom, is in progress. The Head-teacher explaining her actions said &quot;it [the veil] would hamper the teaching and learning of the pupil and impact on her communication and socialising with others.&quot; [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6353601.stm">4</a>] Conversely, evidence revealed that the young pupil&#39;s three elder sisters spent their time in the same school wearing the niqab without interference. All her sisters had progressed well at school, university and beyond whilst wearing the niqab. [<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/02/12/do1202.xml">5</a>] We await the judgement. In the meantime, an Education Minister announced a policy for schools granting them the green light to ban the niqab on &quot;safety, security and teaching&quot; grounds. [<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,,2038240,00.html">6</a>]<br /><br />Universities have affianced in these acts too, with Imperial College in London announcing their ban on niqabs last summer. The students&#39; union in revising the dress code chose to keep the veils ban in December, but as noted by FOSIS, it remains controversial among the college&#39;s Muslim students. [<a href="http://www.fosis.org.uk/media/inthenews_read.php?id=132">7</a>]<br /><br />Now with universities and schools banning the niqab it is only a matter of time other institutions will follow. Unless the problem is curtailed earlier, this could open the floodgate to other cases invoking similar claims. The Courts will, needless to say, have to perform a balancing act where, on the one hand, they need to acknowledge concerns with, what seems to be, fostering social cohesion and a myriad of other issues, including security and preventing crime, and on the other hand against those wishing to simultaneously exercise their right to religious freedom and education. <br /><br />On initial analysis it appears that such cases brought before the judiciary will warrant their own analysis because of their specific considerations and, therefore, it could be for some time before we see any consistency, perhaps because of the judges own reluctance to legislate in this sphere vis-&agrave;-vis Lord Bingham. <br /><br />As a last resort then the British Executive may intervene and legislate to achieve consistency and follow in the footsteps of the Netherlands, Turkey and even France, but the question remains, just how far will they go? As far as the European Court of Human Rights is concerned the case of Leyla Sahin v Turkey upheld Turkey&#39;s decision to ban the hijab at her university as it was in line with Turkey&#39;s secular aspirations. [<a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2004/June/ChamberjudgmentsSahinandTekin.htm">8</a>] Nevertheless, as the aforementioned pending cases indicate we may be on course for a renewed decision by the European Court of Human Rights. <br /><br />This is one to watch out for&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bulgaria-embassy.org/welcome.htm"><strong>Her Excellency Ambassador Elena Poptodorova</strong></a> [Ambassador of the Republic of Bulgaria to the United States]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/libya-death-row-medics-given-more-time.php">tragedy of the Bulgarian medics in Libya</a> began on 9 February 1999 when the Libyan authorities detained a group of 23 Bulgarian medics working at the &quot;Al-Fatih&quot; hospital in Benghazi. Six of them were held incommunicado for several months, while the others were released. The six Bulgarians (one doctor and five nurses) and a Palestinian doctor were falsely charged with committing actions leading to the uncontrolled murder of people with the aim to undermine the state security - the Libyan authorities represented these actions as a plot allegedly organized by the CIA and Mossad; spreading epidemics by injecting 393 children in Benghazi with HIV; committing murder by using substances leading finally to death, by injecting children with HIV. <br /><br />During the investigation and the initial legal procedures the Libyan authorities  committed numerous flagrant violations of the rights of the defendants. At least two of them were severely tortured. All of them were kept in prison under appalling conditions. The Libyan authorities intentionally ignored all demands of the defence aimed at clarifying all aspects of this complex case. In February 2002 the People&#39;s Court dropped the plot charge and the case on the other remaining charges was then transferred to an ordinary criminal court in Benghazi. <br /><br />On 6 May 2004 the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor were sentenced to death. The Bulgarian doctor was sentenced to four years in prison and given that he had been imprisoned for more than five years, he was released. However, the Libyan authorities continue to deny him permission to leave Libya and he is still in the country.<br /><br />In 2005 the Libyan Supreme Court overturned the death sentence and the case had to be retired. Bulgaria is extremely concerned with the December 19, 2006 decision of the Libyan court, which sentenced once again to death by firing squad the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor. <br /><br />Bulgaria cannot accept a decision, which ignores the very clear facts, confirmed, among others, in the most recent research of world&#39;s leading experts rejecting any connection between the work of the Bulgarian medical staff and the HIV infection in the Benghazi hospital. This verdict has clearly set back the efforts to solve this painful case. The protraction of the case for eight years now is a strong argument for the international community to urge the Libyan authorities, including the judicial authorities not to delay any further the final conclusion of the trial and to allow for the return of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor to their home countries. After eight years of detention in the Libyan prisons they deserve justice and a fair and speedy trial. <br /><br />Bulgaria is confident that world public opinion, governments of friendly countries, international organizations and the whole international community will persist with their active support to the just cause of the Bulgarian medics and the Palestinian doctor.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that amidst the political furor over the role of US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in the firings of US Attorneys we should also remember his involvement in the development of US policy denying Geneva Conventions protection to prisoners and authorizing &quot;coercive interrogation&quot; outlawed by the customary and treaty-based laws of war...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/paustbig.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he chorus grows in support of removing Alberto Gonzales. No need to keep an Attorney General who lies to Congress and the American people with respect to the firing of U.S. attorneys and political prosecutor-packing, but why is the chorus seemingly silent in the face of increased reasonable suspicion that he has abetted war crimes during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq? Why has there been no call for a congressional committee hearing on his direct participation in the creation and effectuation of what John Yoo has admitted was a "common, unifying approach" to "coercive interrogation" devised by an inner circle of the Bush Administration during meetings that were often chaired by Gonzales?<br /><br />As John Yoo has disclosed, the inner circle knew that following Geneva law would "interfere with our ability to ... interrogate," since "Geneva bars 'any form of coercion'". For the inner-circle "[t]his became a central issue," and following "'Geneva's strict limitations on ... questioning'" "made no sense." They calculated that "treating the detainees as unlawful combatants would increase flexibility in detention and interrogation;" and the question became merely "what interrogation methods fell short of the torture ban and could be used" as "coercive interrogation," which includes cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment outlawed by the customary and treaty-based laws of war, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and customary and treaty-based human rights law.<br /><br />Alberto Gonzales wrote a subsequently well-publicized memo to the President in January 2002 furthering the common, unifying plan to deny Geneva law protections (especially "Geneva's strict limitations on questioning") and to authorize and effectuate coercive interrogation. Gonzales knew that "any violation of common Article 3" of the Geneva Conventions is a war crime and advised the President to further the plan to avoid Geneva law's proscriptions of coercive interrogation by "[a]dhering to your [earlier] decision that GPW does not apply." On February 7, 2002, the President authorized the denial of protections under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions to members of al Qaeda and the Taliban and authorized violations of Geneva law more generally by ordering humane treatment for detainees merely "to the extent appropriate" and "consistent with military necessity," despite the fact that humane treatment is an absolute requirement of Geneva law "in all circumstances," it is never appropriate to deny treatment required by Geneva law, and alleged military necessity does not justify the denial of treatment required by Geneva law. On September 6, 2006, the President also publicly admitted that part of the common, unifying plan concerning coercive interrogation had involved the crime of forced disappearance of persons. As the President stated, a CIA program has been implemented "to move ... [high-value] individuals to ... where they can be held in secret" and interrogated using "tough" forms of treatment and the CIA program would continue.<br /><br />Clearly, the Gonzales memo, other memos from members of the Administration, and the President's authorizations, directives, and findings substantially facilitated the effectuation of the common, unifying plan to use coercive interrogation. Moreover, such conduct in furtherance occurred when use of coercive interrogation tactics were either known or substantially foreseeable consequences. <br /><br />When an Attorney General lies to the American public, we should be outraged. But we should also be outraged by the conduct of an Attorney General and former White House Counsel who is reasonably accused of responsibility for war crimes.<br /><br />The chorus against Gonzales might ponder the values portrayed in a popular TV series.  In particular, the people should be represented by those with courage to enforce the law, who reaffirm the demands of the Founders and Framers that no one is above the law, who assure younger generations that power is not law, and who seek to end impunity.<br /><br /><em>Jordan Paust is the Mike &amp; Teresa Baker Law Center Professor at the University of Houston and a former Captain, U.S. Army JAGC and member of the faculty at the Judge Advocate General's School. His <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/jtl/Vol_43_3_files/Paust.pdf ">article</a> in the </em>Columbia Journal of Transnational Law<em> and forthcoming works document the role of Gonzales and several other members of the Bush Administration in effectuating the common, unifying plan.</em><br /><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/paust.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<title>David Hicks&#039; Guilty Plea: Another Blow to US Moral Authority</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a> of New England School of Law says that the overbearing terms imposed on Australian Guantanamo detainee David Hicks in his recent military commission plea agreement are the product of an overly and unfairly coercive system and have further undermined America&#39;s moral authority in rule of law matters...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hansennew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he recent safe return of 15 British marines and sailors held in Iran for two weeks is good news. As details of their captivity become public, few are surprised that the videos released by the Iranian government which depicted the sailors and marines being treated humanely did not tell the full story of their treatment. After their release, some of the UK personnel revealed that they had been placed in small isolation cells for long periods of time, subjected to psychological manipulation, and threatened by their captors with long prison terms as a way to coerce confessions from the captives that they had strayed into Iranian territory prior to their capture. <br /><br />Assuming that the allegations of the British sailors and marines are true, these actions by the Iranian government are reprehensible and a violation of international law. Prior to the Bush Administration's war on terror, both American politicians and the American people would have been justifiably indignant at the conduct of the Iranian government, particularly given our own history with Iranian hostage-taking. However, five years into this war on terror, many of us do not feel so willing to express our indignation at the kind of conduct we see from Iran.<br /><br />The Bush Administration is fond of saying that 9/11 changed everything. Many legitimately dispute whether everything has in fact changed. However, no one can dispute that some things have certainly changed. As Americans we must now look at the behavior of counties like Iran through the lens of &quot;black sites,&quot; CIA renditions, torture memos, Abu Ghraib, water boarding, habeas-stripping statutes, military commissions, and indefinite detentions. Iran's 15-day detention of British sailors and marines and the subsequent ham-fisted propaganda stunts by the Iranian government look pretty tame by comparison.<br /><br />One only needs to compare the treatment of these captured British sailors and marines to the case of the Australian David Hicks to understand why the United States has lost the ability to complain about Iran's conduct. David Hicks is the first person to be tried under the new Military Commissions Act. Not surprisingly, he is also the first person to plead guilty. <br /><br />A careful review of the terms of his guilty plea answers many more questions about the inherently coercive system of the military commissions then it does about Hicks' actual crimes or the threat he supposedly poses to the United States as an unlawful alien enemy combatant. <br /><br />We know that David Hicks was captured in Afghanistan in December of 2001. In July of 2004, some 2 1/2 years later, he was first charged with conspiracy to commit war crimes; attempted murder by an unprivileged belligerent and aiding the enemy. After the Supreme Court invalidated the President's military commissions system in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>, and after the Military Commissions Act became law in the fall of 2006, Hicks was again charged in early 2007. This time the conspiracy charge was dropped and he was charged by prosecutors with providing material support for terrorism and attempted murder in violation of the law of war. The charge of attempted murder was later dropped by the U.S. military and last month Hicks pleaded guilty to the charge of providing material support.<br /><br />While the Administration and those who favor the military commissions will tout this guilty plea as proof of the fairness of the military commissions system, those claims should be viewed with at least as much skepticism as we would view Iran's claims that the 15 British sailors and marines all freely and willingly confessed that they were in Iranian waters at the time of their capture. <br /><br />First and foremost, consider a system under which Hicks' guilty plea was obtained only after more than 5 years of detention. Consider also the prospect that this detention may have continued indefinitely even if Hicks was successful in defending against the charges brought against him. Consider a system under which the accused has no meaningful ability to contest his status as an enemy combatant. Finally, consider a system where an accused can be convicted based on evidence from unknown sources and where he is denied the most fundamental right to confront and cross examine his accusers. In such a system, pleading guilty may seem, if not the best option, certainly the only option. <br /><br />What might a guilty plea under such a system look like? The specifics of David Hicks' guilty plea provides some answers. In the agreement Hicks agreed to the following terms. He agreed that he would not communicate with the media regarding his alleged illegal conduct and the specifics of his capture or detention for one year. In the agreement Hicks was required to state that he had never been illegally treated by any person or persons while in the custody and control of the United States including his capture in Afghanistan and his detention at Guantanamo. Hicks was also required to state that his capture and entire period of detention was lawful and done pursuant to the law of armed conflict. <br /><br />In addition, Hicks expressly had to agree not to make, participate in, or support any claim and not to undertake, participate in, or support any litigation, in any form against the United States or any of its officials, whether uniformed or civilian, in their personal or official capacities with regard to his capture, treatment, detention, or prosecution. (Of course if his capture and treatment was in fact lawful, such a broad waiver would be superfluous). Hicks agreed that for the remainder of his natural life, if the United States were to determine that he engaged in any further conduct proscribed by the offenses codified in the Military Commissions Act, the United States could immediately detain and try him under the Military Commissions Act if he were outside the nation of Australia. (Under these terms, for David Hicks at least, Australia has returned to its former status as a penal colony from which he would be well advised to never leave). Finally, most incredibly and ironically, David Hicks was required to state that no person or persons have made any attempt to force or coerce him into making this offer to plead guilty and that his decision to plead guilty was made freely and voluntarily.<br /><br />Clearly, such overbearing terms were not the product of a voluntary and free choice. They were the product of an overly and unfairly coercive system and one can safely assume that these terms will be standard fare for anyone who desires to plead guilty at a military commission. This is a system which by comparison, makes Iran's recent behavior seem tame. After the public statements made by the released British sailors and marines about their capture and treatment, many Iranian officials may be looking with envy at the terms of Hicks' plea agreement, and they are probably wishing they would have extracted similar concessions before they released their captives. Not to worry, Iran and the rest of the world have the United States' example to follow, and given sufficient time and opportunity, others like Iran will certainly learn to adopt our ways. And we Americans are forced to sit silently by when other counties engage in this kind of behavior. That is what it means to lose our moral authority, and the thanks goes to the Bush Administ
ration's global war on the rule of law. <br /><br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps and currently teaches at New England School of Law</em><br />

Bush</em> and <em>Al Odah v. United States</em>, forty-five men challenged the constitutionality of the habeas corpus-stripping provision of the Military Commissions Act that Congress passed last year. <br /><br />On Monday Justices Stephen Breyer, David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg fell one vote short of the four needed to grant review of the lower court decision which went against the detainees. It was no surprise that Justices John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas voted to deny review.<br /><br />Two justices - John Paul Stevens and Anthony Kennedy - declined review on procedural grounds, saying the detainees had to exhaust their remedies before appealing to the high court. That means they must first go through the appeals process of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs). <br /><br />The CSRTs are used to determine whether a detainee is an unlawful enemy combatant. They deny basic due process protections such as the rights to counsel, to see evidence, and to confront adverse witnesses.<br /><br />The procedure for challenging a CSRT decision is found in the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA). It is limited to determining whether the decision was consistent with the CSRT&#39;s standards and procedures, and whether the use of those standards and procedures was legal and constitutional.<br /><br />There are two issues the Supreme Court would have to decide if it did review this case. First, do the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees have a constitutional right to habeas corpus? In 2004, the Court held in <em>Rasul v. Bush</em> that the habeas statute applied to those detainees because the United States maintains complete jurisdiction and control over Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo. <br /><br />Second, even if the Court applied its <em>Rasul</em> reasoning to constitutional habeas corpus, it would then need to determine whether the procedure for contesting Combatant Status Review Tribunal decisions constitutes an adequate substitute for habeas corpus.<br /><br />It should have been a no-brainer for Justices Stevens and Kennedy to vote to hear this case. The DTA&#39;s review procedures cannot cure the sub-standard standards of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals.<br /><br />Since Justice Stevens authored the Court&#39;s two prior decisions upholding rights for the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees, his vote in this case is puzzling. But if he provided the fourth vote for review, there&#39;s no guarantee he could garner the five votes needed to overturn the lower court ruling. Justices Stevens and Kennedy left open the option of future review if &quot;the government has unreasonably delayed proceedings&quot; or causes the detainees &quot;some other and ongoing injury.&quot; Justice Stevens evidently thought it prudent to side with Justice Kennedy at this point to cultivate the latter&#39;s vote on the merits down the road. <br /><br />Meanwhile, the detainees languish in confinement that could last the rest of their lives if they are denied the right to have a U.S. judge hear their habeas corpus petitions. Of the 755 men and boys held at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo in the past five years, Bush has called only 14 of them &quot;high value detainees.&quot; Just 10 - not including any of the 45 men appealing the current case - have been charged with a crime.<br /><br />Although the Supreme Court has stood up to the Bush administration in the past, it is precariously balanced and cannot be relied upon to consistently provide justice. Congress has finally shown the will to challenge the Bush agenda - on the Iraq war, and the U.S. Attorney firing scandal. The ball is in Congress&#39;s court to rescind the habeas-stripping provisions of the Military Commissions Act. <br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, president of the National Lawyers Guild, and the U.S. representative to the executive committee of the American Association of Jurists.

		<title>Carhart, Casey, and the Supreme Court&#039;s Catholics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/garnett-r">Richard Garnett</a> of the University of Chicago Law School says that alleging that the Catholic judges in the majority in the <em>Carhart</em> partial birth abortion case failed to respect a fundamental difference between religious belief and morality misses the point that for a judge to credit the legislature&#39;s conclusion that human fetuses are moral subjects whose lives have value is not to impose her &quot;religious&quot; beliefs...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/richardgarnett.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>F</strong></font>ifteen years ago, Justice Anthony Kennedy co-authored an opinion in <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em> which proclaimed that "liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt" and re-affirmed a woman's "right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages." On April 18, however, Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion for a five-Justice majority in <em>Gonzales v. Carhart</em> which rejected a "broad, facial attack" on the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. What happened?<br /><br />First, some context: In the early 1990s, politicians and the public became aware of "intact dilation and extraction" abortions. Rather than dismembering the fetus <em>in utero</em>, and then extracting the parts, doctors using this method partially deliver the living, intact fetus, leaving the head lodged in the woman's cervix. Next, the doctor punctures the fetus's skull with scissors and "evacuates the skull contents." (Sometimes, as Justice Kennedy described, the doctor crushes the fetus's skull with forceps, or simply decapitates it.)<br /><br />For as long as the American public has known about these "partial-birth abortions," large and bipartisan majorities have agreed with former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan that this gruesome practice is "not just too close to infanticide; it is infanticide, and one would be too many." We Americans disagree and are divided over many things &#8212; including abortion rights &#8212; but, nevertheless, there is widespread agreement that this practice may and should be prohibited. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 reflects this agreement. And, in <em>Carhart</em>, the Court concluded that the Act does not impose an unconstitutional "undue burden" on the abortion right that <em>Casey</em> described.<br /><br />Others have described, and many more will soon explain, in more detail the strengths and weaknesses of the majority's legal analysis. Reasonable people can, and already do, disagree about whether the federal Act can really be distinguished from the Nebraska law that a different 5-4 majority struck down seven years ago in <em>Stenberg v. Carhart</em>. (In my view, the Court would have done better simply to reverse, as wrongly decided, that decision.) For present purposes, though, it is enough to endorse the decision's bottom line: Nothing in our constitutional text, history, or traditions disables the American people from democratically affirming &#8212; albeit imperfectly &#8212; our commitment to decency and human dignity by rejecting partial-birth abortion.<br /><br />Still, the attacks on the majority's ruling are coming fast and furious. According to <em>New York Times</em>, this decision was "atrocious" and "comes at a real cost to the court's credibility, its integrity and the rule of law." In some quarters, the Court's decision not to nullify a bipartisan and popular act of Congress is seen &#8212; oddly enough &#8212; as an instance of the very "judicial activism" that conservatives purport to oppose. Still others detect in the ruling &#8212; in the words of one blogger &#8212; a "chill wind blowing from Rome."<br /><br />The five Justices in the majority, remember, are Roman Catholics.<br /><br />There were no Catholic Justices on the Court until 1836, when Roger Taney succeeded John Marshall. And it would be more than another half-century &#8212; fifty-eight years &#8212; until the elevation of the second, Edward White. Looking back, the fact that only one of our first 54 Justices was Catholic should come as no surprise. From the Puritans to the Framers and beyond, anti-"popery" was long thick the cultural air of America. Well into the twentieth century, it was regularly charged and widely believed that there is something un-American about Catholic clergy, teachings, and adherents. And so, it is not surprising that, over the years, politicians and commentators alike have demanded assurances that Catholic judicial nominees would not be "Catholic" justices. President Roosevelt, for example, was promised that Frank Murphy would "not let religion stand in his way," and Murphy himself made it clear that his faith and his judicial vocation were kept "in air-tight compartments."<br /><br />These familiar questions were raised again &#8212; if more artfully and cautiously &#8212; after the nominations of Justice Alito and Chief Justice Roberts. Indeed, the rarely reticent Christopher Hitchens challenged his colleagues in the press to "quit tiptoeing around John Roberts' faith." After all, he observed, the Catholic Church is a "foreign state" and "claims the right to legislate on morals[.]" Hitchens was hardly alone in being alarmed by the prospect of a majority-Catholic Court. Many worried that the Catholic Justices might be tempted to substitute their own personal religious convictions, or the moral teachings of their Church, for the Constitution's requirements, particularly in cases involving divisive and difficult "social issues."<br /><br />According to one of the legal academy's most distinguished constitutional law scholars, <em>Carhart</em> suggests that these worries were well founded. In a widely noted blog post, my colleague Professor Geoffrey Stone characterized and criticized the majority in Carhart as "faith-based justices" who "failed to respect the fundamental difference between religious belief and morality. To be sure," he wrote, "this can be an elusive distinction, but in a society that values the separation of church and state, it is fundamental."<br /><br />The distinction is, indeed, "elusive." And, in any event, the charge is misplaced. It is true that the majority included "moral concerns" &#8212; like the public interest in promoting "respect for life" &#8212; among the "legitimate government interests" that could justify the federal ban. It is not clear, though, why we should regard these concerns, or the view that human fetuses are moral subjects whose lives have value, as any more "religious", and therefore suspect, than our nation's fundamental commitment to the view that all human beings are moral equals, regardless of race, and should be treated as such in law. For a judge to identify such concerns as a permissible basis for legislating &#8212; given the fact that, in the Court's view, the law did not impose an "undue burden" on the abortion right &#8212; is not to attack church-state separation or to substitute revelation for the will of We the People.<br /><br />It is, of course, hardly a secret that a Catholic justice is taught by his or her Church, and should believe, that abortion is a grave moral evil. However, all judges &#8212; Catholic or not &#8212; come to the bench with views, commitments, and experiences that shape their decision-making and reasoning. We can, and should, ask of every judge that she work conscientiously in every case to identify not her own preferred or "faith-based" outcome but the answer that is given by the relevant legal texts, rules, and precedents. As it happens, the Catholic understanding of vocation, and of justice under law, extends to Catholic judges the same invitation.<br /><br /><br /><em>Richard W.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law, recently returned from his native Pakistan, shares the story of his personal involvement in some of the circumstances leading up to the March 9 suspension of Pakistan Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n March 9, 2007, I was visiting with a Pakistan Supreme Court Justice in Islamabad when the news broke that President Musharraf had in effect fired Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. The news came as a surprise to both of us, particularly to me because I had been part of the Chief Justice story for the past several days---or so it seemed in hindsight. <br /><br /><strong>Speaking about the Chief Justice</strong><br /><br />On March 5, I spoke about "Human Rights in the United States" to a gathering of law students at Pakistan College of Law in Lahore. A Supreme Court advocate who had arranged my speech at the law college, and other lawyers, had been telling me the woeful state of the judiciary in Pakistan. The judges, I was told, are corrupt from top to bottom: favoritism is rampant, incompetence is blatant, and justice is bought and sold like turnips. <br /><br />In my speech, I told the students that after the 9/11 terrorist attacks it was no fun to be a Muslim in the United States and that "our mosques are under surveillance." I however expressed hope that the American judiciary might be able to reverse the human rights impairment. Turning my speech to Pakistan, I theorized that Pakistan is not a state but a nation of families. I argued that even the Chief of the Army Staff or the Chief of the Judiciary would "kill" and ignore laws to promote his family. There, I stumbled on to the Chief Justice story and told the audience how deeply I was disappointed to learn that the Chief Justice had used his influence to have his son recruited for a federal position for which he was not qualified---a story that the Pakistani media had minced for months. I told the students, however, that we as lawyers must not blindly believe what we hear in the media. Ironically, though, I myself was blaming the Chief Justice without critically assessing the gossip I had heard. <br /><br />On March 7, I spoke to law students at the Quaid-e-Azam Law College in Lahore. There, I did mention that Pakistan is a nation of families but dropped the Chief Justice story. I thought I had no business fanning stories in a country that takes rumors seriously and acts upon them. <br /><br /><strong>Learning about the Chief Justice</strong><br /><br />The same day, I received new insights into the Chief Justice story. I had lunch with the Vice President of the Pakistan Supreme Court Bar, who greatly admires the Chief Justice and strongly believes "that the Chief is acting for the good of the country and that his judicial activism is exposing the rotten policies of the Musharraf juggernaut." The other lawyer at lunch, however, grumbled that "the Chief Justice dismisses the case by throwing the file at the lawyer arguing before him." Both agreed, however, that some high court judges receive thousands of dollars to decide cases. When a court postponed the hearing in a case, I was told, one of the litigants complained: "Why is my case not decided today? I have given a lot of money to the lawyer and to you, judge!" As a bewildered American, I fantasized bringing judicial freedom to this wretched country, but then I thought of the failed invasion to bring democracy to Iraq.<br /><br />A mysterious force appeared to be bringing me closer to the people who are or would be closely tied to the Chief Justice story. On the evening of March 7, I met with the former President of the Pakistan Supreme Court Bar (a lawyer who is now defending the Chief Justice before the Supreme Judicial Council) at his Lahore chambers. As a champion of democracy and the rule of law, the former President was adamantly opposed to the Musharraf regime. However, he had a soft corner for the Chief Justice and greatly appreciated the Chief's judicial activism, including his decision to reverse the sale of Pakistan Steel Mill to government cronies. Even in this sitting, I got the impression that judicial integrity in Pakistan has deteriorated beyond belief and that even high court judges are recruited through shady political deals. (There are no legislative hearings on the appointment of high court judges in Pakistan.) When the country's head honcho (General Musharraf) seized power lawlessly, it was the Supreme Court that legitimized the coup. In Pakistan everything is open to trading. I began to understand that the Chief Justice story is layered with corruption, incompetence, cynicism, and that judicial activism is mere frosting on a rotten cake.<br /><br /><strong>The Day the Chief Justice is Fired</strong><br /><br />On March 8, I drove to Islamabad accompanied by a friend, a cousin/driver, and a nephew. During this trip, I was hoping to meet with S. S. Pirzada, the Legal Advisor to the President/Prime Minister--an 80+ years old jurist who has been an integral part of Pakistan's constitutional history and who can change the constitution, as they say, "with the stroke of his pen." (One media story asserts that the Chief Justice had been overly polite to Pirzada when he appeared before the Supreme Court, possibly to win favors with the government.)<br /><br />On the morning of March 9, I called Pirzada's office to express my wishes to meet with him. I was told that the Legal Advisor was in a high level meeting and that it was impossible to meet with him "today." To my great surprise, I received a call on my cell phone that the Legal Advisor would like to have lunch with me at the Islamabad Club--a place where politicians, government officials, and diplomats meet, dine, chat, backbite, and weave scandals on unsubstantiated rumors.<br /><br />After the Friday prayer, I met with Pirzada for lunch. We talked for nearly two hours about a host of things except the Chief Justice. The Legal Advisor was indeed in a meeting all morning with President Musharaff--one to one. I thought it inappropriate to ask the Legal Advisor about his meeting with the President. That the Chief Justice was being fired that very hour was not even in my wildest imagination. <br /><br />I now wonder what Pirzada was thinking during our lunch conversation. Pirzada is the calmest man you can meet. Nothing seems to disturb him. He is wise, sharp, unassuming, deferential, and in good health. (He likes President George W. Bush and believes that President Bush is good for Pakistan. I kidded with him that I would like to see Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas as the next US President. Pirzada is not opposed to any Republican becoming the next President.) I cannot tell what advice, if any, Pirzada gave to President Musharraf on the firing of the Chief Justice.<br /><br />As I left the Islamabad Club, I received a phone call that my friend, the Supreme Court Justice, would like to see me at his residence. I dropped my nephew at the Supreme Court building with a lawyer I knew (to wait for me there) while my cousin/driver drove me to the Judges Enclave &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a residential block on a hill in Islamabad reserved for Justices of the Supreme Court. Within fifteen minutes of my visit with the Justice, the phone rang and someone broke the news to the Justice's family. Everybody was surprised. We turned on GEO (a TV station) to get more news. Within minutes, the security forces began to arrive to the Justices Enclave. They had already surrounded the Supreme Court building. I called my nephew who was now stranded in the Supreme Court building. He was thrilled, having become part of the now rapidly-unfolding story. He said in an excited voice: "The lawyers inside and outside the buildi
ng are forming a revolt. I wonder what is going to happen." <br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan is a professor at Washburn University School of Law in Kansas. His publications are available <a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali-pub.php">here</a>.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.faisalkutty.com">Faisal Kutty</a>, a Toronto lawyer and vice-chair and counsel to the <a href="http://www.caircan.ca/">Canadian Council on American Islamic Relations</a>, says that Canada does not need a US-style &quot;no-fly list&quot; with all its limitations and potential abuses, but rather better investigative and intelligence efforts to counter real threats to public safety...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/faisalkutty.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s the Canadian government forges ahead with its cleverly named Passenger Protect Program, the timing could not be better to seriously reconsider what is for all intents and purposes a no-fly list. <br /><br />The attention to the issue of watch lists generated by the struggles of Maher Arar (the Canadian citizen detained by Americans and shipped off to torture and interrogation in Syria) to clear his name should make us all sit back and reflect. There are many lessons to be learned from the Canadian government's recent apology and financial settlement with Arar for its role in his "extraordinary rendition."<br /><br />One of these lessons is that hasty and ill-considered national security initiatives which are essentially aimed at managing perceptions more than they are in really addressing legitimate and manageable security concerns are not harmless. In fact, they cause disproportionate harm in return for very minor gains in terms of intelligence and law enforcement. The innocent and unintended victims of such initiatives are real human beings with lives, rights and dignity. When not properly designed to address the negative impacts such initiatives can significantly disrupt and even destroy lives. <br /><br />Another lesson from the Arar saga is that religious and racial profiling, no matter how vigorously it is denied, is too often the reality for a growing number in Canada's Muslim and Arab communities at least in the national security context.  In fact, this was confirmed by none other than the Department of Justice in a report leaked a couple of years ago.<br /><br />A number of other men of Muslim/Arab heritage have made similar allegations as Arar. Three of them will get their own less comprehensive inquiries. One of the common denominators of each of their stories is the fact that they were placed on one kind of watch list or the other. <br /><br />The proliferation of government watch lists is a troubling development in the "war on terrorism." The challenges of such lists include differences of opinion on who's actually a security threat, consolidating information across agencies by making the computer systems communicate the with one another. In fact, Canada's Auditor General Sheila Fraser found in 2004 that watch-lists used to screen visa applicants, refugee claimants and travelers seeking to enter Canada were in disarray because of inaccuracies and shoddy updating.<br /><br />And now we have another list to worry about.<br /><br />As we consider the need to improve our intelligence and law enforcement systems, we must have an open and informed dialogue about what measures truly make us safer while ensuring that our fundamental values, liberties and rights are not sacrificed. The proper forum for such a debate is our legislature. Bypassing this vital and necessary debate &#8212; as was done with the Passenger Protect Program -- is irresponsible and cavalier particularly given the findings of Justice Dennis O'Connor in the Arar Inquiry, the Canadian track record with watch lists to date as well as the experience with such lists south of the border. The information sharing protocols and mechanisms which were criticized by Justice O'Connor have not been improved, yet the government continues with the no-fly initiative which mandates that we share &#8212; and even merge and consolidate -- information with foreign entities and agencies, which may have less scruples in listing and targeting innocent people on flimsy grounds. <br /><br />Making lengthy watch lists based on subjective and political criteria and then giving the power to add and remove names to agencies that have a vested interest in the national security agenda is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house. Such lists &#8212; which will inevitably fill up very quickly with "false positives", political dissidents, and those whom our friends and neighbours subjectively designate as threats &#8212; will not make us any safer or interrupt any terrorists, if the U.S. experience is any indication. To make matters worse, real terrorists may not even be placed on the list for fear of tipping them off. According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, known terrorists are not placed on the list for fear that they would know they are being watched. Even this new "made-in-Canada" list will be shaped by the U.S. and other nations' lists as they cross-fertilize pursuant to intelligence agreements, the Smart Border Declaration and the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP), both of which call for increased cooperation and information sharing.<br /><br />How can such a list provide anything more than a false sense of security while leaving it rife for blacklisting innocent people as well as racial and religious profiling? Indeed, Canadians should be asking the government how an individual can be too dangerous to fly, yet be free to roam the streets and plot terror.<br /><br />The no-fly list threatens liberty, equality and mobility rights guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Moreover, it leaves little practical recourse to get off the list.<br /><br />The experience of some individuals who are already encountering difficulties in flying within Canada without even having a list of our own does not give one much confidence. The extraterritorial application of U.S. watch lists is already impacting on Canadians  &#8212; how will Canadians fare once Transport Canada introduces its own official list and over time it becomes increasingly shaped by other nations' intelligence, criteria and practices? <br /><br />As the CATO Institute's Jim Harper pointed out, the unilateral process is alien to our legal system:<blockquote>Rather than watch-listing, people who are genuinely suspected of being criminals or terrorists should be sought, captured, charged, tried, and, if convicted, sentenced. Watch-listing allows law enforcement to be very active and intrusive without actually doing what it takes to protect against crime and terrorist acts. ... watch listing and identification checking [are] like posting a most-wanted list at a post office and then waiting for criminals to come to the post office.</blockquote>Anti-terrorist watch lists may serve a very limited useful function, such as separating individuals deserving of increased investigative attention, but they will never be complete or be totally accurate. They should not, however, be the basis for serious restrictions on liberty such as the denial of transportation or violations of privacy or other rights without the benefit of due process and the principles of fundamental justice. They may have a limited role in designating who to investigate further or watch so long as there is no deprivation of rights or privacy violations and provided that they are compiled pursuant to due process of law and without resort to subjective criteria or racial/religious profiling.<br /><br />In raising her voice against the no-fly list, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, Jennifer Stoddart, said the list "represents a serious incursion into the rights of travelers in Canada, rights of privacy and rights of freedom of movement." To this I would add, increasing likelihood of racial and religious profiling, silencing dissent and persecuting unpopular religious and political views. <br /><br />Transport Canada must not be given a carte blanc
he to deprive Canadians of our liberty, mobility, equality and privacy rights, even though aviation security has now become a legitimate national security concern. The government's appeal to national security should not exempt it from due process, principles of fundamental justice, accountability, transparency, oversight and a full Parliamentary debate. <br /><br />The system envisaged by Passenger Protect is wholly inadequate, as it will be over inclusive, with high likelihood of false positives, pose a serious potential for racial profiling, and completely lack any meaningful redress mechanism or process. <br /><br />Perhaps, what is needed is not this list, but better investigative and intelligence work to gather evidence so that those who are real threats are charged and kept off the streets, not just flights. <br /><br /><br /><em>Faisal Kutty is a Toronto lawyer and doctoral candidate at Osgoode Hall Law School of York University.

The result will almost certainly be a human rights disaster for the 200,000 Serbs living in that tormented land.   <br /><br />A few days ago at a breakfast meeting in Chicago, the speaker was asked whether independence for Kosovo was a "done deal." Ambassador Frank G. Wisner, Special Representative of the U.S. Secretary of State to the Kosovo Status Talks, replied that although Russia was not yet on board, the deal would probably go through simply because it is the least bad alternative. A worse alternative would be Serbian hegemony over Kosovo; it would precipitate a civil war that could lead to the extermination of all the Serbs.  <br /><br />The population of Kosovo consists of approximately 1.8 million Kosovars and 0.2 million Serbs. Their mutual hatred grows out of a sorry record of bilateral atrocities and ethnic cleansing. <br /><br />Enter the United States with a portfolio containing a three-part plan for rescuing Kosovo. The first part of the plan would reserve certain high governmental posts on the basis of religion or ethnicity, rather than by a democratic process. Is it any wonder that the plan resembles the regime change that the United States is now installing in Iraq? There, for example, if the president is a Shiite, the Foreign Minister must be a Sunni and the Treasurer a Kurd. In a parallel manner the Kosovo Constitution could require that the president be a Kosovar and the Foreign Minister a Serb. But if any ruling group contains a few unwanted people, the others will engage in end-runs around them. The answer of the Bush Administration, as usual, is that all you need is a plan; implementation will take care of itself.<br /> <br />The second part of the American plan is to make sure that the new Constitution safeguards the rights of minorities in Kosovo. The American planners must have an unshakeable faith that respect for constitutionalism is embedded in the minds of the Kosovars. They wouldn't think of ignoring Constitutional restraints upon their own power, would they? They wouldn't ask George W. Bush for advice on what to do when the Constitution seems to stand in the way of what the President wants, would they? <br /><br />Finally, the third part of the American plan is a hedge against the first two parts. A substantial UN peacekeeping force will be deployed in Kosovo to protect the Serbian minority. Picture two soldiers with Kalashnikov submachine guns walking beside a Serbian child on her way to and from school. How long can this continue before the home country calls its peacekeepers back on account of the high expense? And in any event, what kind of a solution is it that depends on continuous supervision by foreign armed forces?<br /><br />The sad prognosis is that a Kosovar-dominated independent government will lose no time in confiscating the property and rights of the Serbian minority. Some 200,000 Serbs in Kosovo could lose everything they own and maybe their lives. Although minority rights have been safeguarded in states where no particular group has had as much as a two-thirds majority, in Kosovo the Serb-hating majority is 90% of the population. If that majority also controls the government&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the "done deal"&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;then the Serbs may face a disastrous deprivation of their human rights by law and by police action.<br />  <br /><strong>The Right Solution: Partition</b><br /><br />What about partitioning Kosovo into a Serbian and an Albanian territory? There are four immediate problems with partition. The United Nations is opposed to it. The United States is opposed. Serbia is opposed. And the Kosovars are opposed.<br /><br />However, no one seems to be asking the potential victims what they want. Inasmuch as the United Nations is presently the trustee for Kosovo, it surely has a duty not to remit the Kosovo Serbs to the tender mercies of the majority.<br /><br />The northern part of Kosovo consists of the land south of the boundary with Serbia and north of the Ibar river. Most of the religious buildings and places associated with the Christian Orthodox Church (Serbia's historic heritage) may be found here. In total the well-demarkated area constitutes 15% of the territory of Kosovo. The simple and ideal partition plan would be to designate this territory as belonging to its Serbian population (it is currently populated almost exclusively with Serbs), and provide for Kosovar sovereignty over the remaining 85% of Kosovo.  <br /><br />One might question why the Serbs should be getting 15% of Kosovo when they only comprise 10% of the population. But under international customary law, the question would be reversed: why should the Kosovars (Albanians) get 85% of the land? When territory is in dispute, as Lea Brilmayer has shown in an important article (<em>Secession and Self-Determination: A Territorial Interpretation,</em> 16 Yale J. Int'l L. 177 (1991)), claims based on territorial rights take precedence over claims based upon demographics. When the United Nations partitioned Palestine in 1947, the Arabs received less territory than they would have received if the partition had been based on demographics.  I argued in an <a href="/world/israelborders.php">article</a> in JURIST some years ago that the Palestinian partition, all relevant factors considered, was entirely equitable.<br /><br />If we analyze the question prior to the time of the civil wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, international customary law would clearly support Serbia's claim to sovereignty over Kosovo. What has happened since then, if anything, that divested Serbia from its territorial rights in Kosovo?<br /><br />In his report to the United Nations of March 26, 2007, Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari pointed to the establishment of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in 1999.   UNMIK assumed all legislative, executive, and judicial authority in Kosovo; Serbia has been effectively ousted from having any governmental role since 1999. Hence Mr. Ahtisaari argues that too much time has passed for a return of Serbian rule; the Kosovars would be provoked into violent opposition.<br /><br />If we remove the diplomatic euphemisms from Mr. Ahtisaari's report, we find that he is essentially arguing that UNMIK has conquered Kosovo! Territory-grabbing by conquest has been illegal since the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, yet somehow the United Nations has done it, according to Mr. Ahtisaari. However, there is nothing in the UN Charter that gives the UN the power to oust an existing government by force, replace it with a United Nations mission created especially for the occasion, and then dissolve the mission and hand sovereignty over the territory to someone else. Acquisition of territory by conquest is simply illegal, whether a state does it or an international organization does it.<br /><br />This violation of customary international law is not softened by the fact that the UN has designated Kosovo as a trusteeship. It would be as if the trust department in a bank deciding after eight years' supervision of the trust assets, those assets can be removed from the trust and handed over as a free gift to one of the bank's shareholders.<br /><br />However, there is a second argument that in my opinion counts heavily against restoration of Serbian rule in Kosovo. We might call it the "human rights argument": During the Yugosl
avian civil war, Serbian President Milosevic conducted an unremitting campaign of suppression against the Kosovars, in the course of which his armies committed crimes against humanity. The brutality of the Milosevic incursions into Kosovo may be argued as disqualifying Serbia from ever again governing the Kosovars.   <br />  <br />The human rights argument disables Serbian rule over the Kosovars but says nothing about the territory of Kosovo. In particular, the human rights argument is irrelevant to northern Kosovo (the 15% area) because crimes against humanity during the Yugoslav civil war did not occur there.  Thus I would conclude that the United Nations has no right under its Charter to take that 15% of territory away from the government as designated by the local Serbs. Presumably that government would be the present government of Serbia.<br /><br />The United Nations' power to partition Kosovo into two areas of 15% and 85%, the Security Council will be acting under its Chapter VII powers to maintain or restore international peace and security.  The "trusteeship" argument is nothing but a bootstrap.  By contrast, given the magnitude of the atrocities committed against the Kosovars during the Yugoslavian civil war, the Security Council arguably has the right to permanently disable Serbia from exercising sovereignty over the territory occupied by the Kosovars. But it has no right, in my opinion, to overreach and take away land where no crimes against humanity took place. The northern 15% of Kosovo must retain its Serbian identity.<br /><br /><br /><em>Anthony D.Amato is Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University, where he teaches international law and human rights.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/damato.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='120' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Dr. <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/law/Staff/laurent_pech.html">Laurent Pech</a>, Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Union Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, says that despite the still-uncertain future of the European Constitution, the 50th anniversary of the treaty founding the European Union is an occasion to celebrate the most successful interstate venture in modern times...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/laurentpechnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n 25 March 1957, Germany, France, Italy and the Benelux states (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) agreed in Rome to create the European Economic Community, with the aim of preserving peace and enhance economic growth by means of a common market. Fifty years later, viewed in historical perspective, the success of this original venture can hardly be denied. In what is now called the European Union (EU), twenty-seven Member States are committed to deepen economic integration - thirteen countries actually share a common currency &#8212; and to define a common foreign and security policy as well as to develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice. Despite these tremendous developments and changes - or maybe for that very same reason - the current ambiance in Europe is rather gloomy. To use an analogy which is now gaining ground, the EU is said to be in something of a <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/law/news.html">mid-life crisis</a>. <br /><br />Going from one crisis to another seems, however, to be a way of life for the EU. This may explain why a good dose of pessimism has always accompanied the slow - and at times, the invisible - progress of European integration. In 1982, the President of the European Parliament, Piet Dankert, observed that the "anniversary of the European Community does not seem to be an occasion for much celebration," adding that the "infant which held so much promise 25 years ago has changed into a feeble cardiac patient". However, less than ten years later, it was agreed to adopt a single currency and to dramatically expand Europe's areas of competence. In 2007, the "feeble cardiac patient" is still alive and kicking, notwithstanding the melodrama which followed the rejection of the EU Constitution in the Netherlands and in France. <br /><br />What is really surprising about European integration is that it continues to work and deepen. The reason must certainly be that the Member States have always realised that the EC/EU represents the most effective institutionalised venue they can use to respond to the demands of their citizens. <br /><br />Without a doubt, the EC's founding fathers were animated by a high sense of idealism and genuinely believed that advancing the cause of European integration would foster peace among old enemies and eventually lead to the establishment of a federal state. One may understand, however, that the EC Treaty came into existence thanks to a Faustian pact negotiated between France and Germany: Germany acquiesced to the idea of financing a Common Agricultural Policy (which still represents 35 per cent of the EU budget from close to 70 per cent in the 1970s) and finally obtained from France the right to participate as an equal partner in a pan-European organisation. Furthermore, the EC Treaty initially offered a rather modest set of provisions which were primarily aimed at setting up a common market between its signatories. It actually took more than thirty years - and the launch of the so-called 1992 campaign for an EC without internal borders - to complete the creation of a European market in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured. <br /><br />That the membership of the EU has continued to expand ever since suggests that the EU continues to be seen as a club which guarantees peace and economic prosperity. Membership to the EU club, or the mere promise of joining the club in the future, have also proven to be spectacularly successful in consolidating democracy and the rule of law in previously authoritarian countries. Furthermore, in today's interdependent world, national governments are well aware that they must collectively confront the global economic and political challenges of our times. History has taught the most powerful European countries that unrepressed hubris ineluctably leads to tragedy. <br /><br />A particularly remarkable aspect is that the spectacular "widening" of the EU's club has (thus far) not prevented further "deepening". Indeed, from a narrow focus on economic matters, the EU has grown beyond recognition. Among the objectives it now pursues, one may mention the promotion of a balanced and sustainable development of economic activities, a high level of employment and of social protection, a high level of protection of the environment, the implementation of a common foreign and security policy, the prevention of crime, etc. And to pursue these objectives effectively, the EU has gradually gained the power to legislate in the areas of trade, monetary policy, social policy, environment, consumer protection, transport, asylum and immigration, etc. The EU may also complement Member States' action in the areas of industry, culture, tourism, education, etc. <br /><br />These developments did not come about without controversy. Many (wrongly) fear the emergence of a federal and undemocratic Leviathan. More recently, the continuous expansion of the EU, both in terms of geographical and regulatory expansion, seems to have produced a general backlash. Public opinion, in several Member States, has clearly turned against the EU. To put it succinctly, citizens of the "old Europe" have grown sceptical of its added-value and are frustrated at what they see to be an uncontrolled expansion of the club. The widespread disillusion is particularly worrying as it is taking root in a context where two major risks threatening the future of the EU future have yet to be effectively tackled: relative economic decline and institutional paralysis. The so-called Lisbon strategy is supposed to answer the first concern. The EU Constitution, signed in Rome in 2004, attempts to answer the second. <br /><br />In 2000, in Lisbon, the European Council agreed to define long-term policies to create a highly competitive and knowledge-based society in Europe. The trouble is that the EU has not been given the power to legislate in the areas of employment, social protection and education but can merely complement national policies. But Europeans are unlikely to take note of this subtle distinction and will certainly come to blame the EU rather than the Member States for the currently disappointing outcomes of the Lisbon strategy. <br /><br />As for the "constitutional" text, it is well known that it must be ratified by all the Member States. As of today, 18 Member States, representing more than 60 per cent of the EU population, have approved it and two have rejected it. To end the current impasse, several scenarios have been discussed. The most realistic solution may be to preserve the most innovative provisions of the 2004 text and drop the term "constitution" from the title of the new text to be ratified. My personal view is that regardless of the name and content of the future text, two new indispensable conditions should govern its ratification: rather than unanimity, a majority of two-thirds of the Member States should be considered sufficient and the text must clearly articulate what would happen to the Member State(s) which will be unable to ratify it. Failure to take into account these conditions is more than likely to lead to another ratification mess. <br /><br />Overall, few would deny that the EC Treaty is nothing less than a success story. It represents the most successful interstate venture in modern times. Through economic means, it has obliged old and heterogeneous natio
n-states to learn how to peacefully coexist while pursuing common goals through ongoing compromises. To paraphrase Alexander Meiklejohn, the fiftieth anniversary of the EC Treaty may be nothing less than a good occasion for dancing in the streets. <br /><br /><br /><em>Laurent Pech is Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Union Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway and the author of </em>Taking the EU Seriously: Persistent but Misguided Constitutional Controversies<em> (forthcoming, 2007) </em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Moeen Cheema, professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan, says that following the removal of Pakistan Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry concrete constitutional reforms are needed to guarantee the independence of the Pakistani judiciary ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/pakistanflaglong.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he protest movement spontaneously initiated by the overwhelming majority of lawyers in Pakistan in the wake of the suspension of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry is gathering momentum. In the aftermath of the government's attempts to gag the media and the naked aggression of the police against protest rallies, the protesters' resolve has hardened and demands are being made for constitutional reform and a return to democratic governance. This is therefore a good time to critically analyze what&#39;s behind the popular slogans of the movement and identify concrete structural reforms that may lead towards the entrenchment of constitutionalism in Pakistan.<br /><br /><strong>Tyranny of the Executive</strong><br /><br />It is a common feature of all modern systems of government that too much power tends to accumulate in the executive. In the United Kingdom's parliamentary system of government, the legislature has progressively become subservient to the will of the dominant party, the backbenchers rarely diverge from the party lines dictated by the party whips, and the scrutiny of the executive has been undermined by the inability of the select committees or the opposition to hold ministers to account. The Prime Minister's office has evolved in such a way that he/she now leads the party into elections, can claim to be at least partly responsible for the mandate given by public, and hence dominates the cabinet as well his/her party after winning the general elections.<br /><br />In the United States, the last century has been characterized by Presidential aggrandizement. The President's office has claimed greater power in each war, real or imagined, or other national crisis and has been shown considerable deference by the legislature and the courts. The Bush presidency is a prime example of this phenomenon. Although Congress is now under Democratic control, is beginning to challenge presidential action and is playing a much greater role in the scrutiny of the executive, the Presidency still enjoys unprecedented power. Lord Hailsham's characterization of the executive in the UK as an 'elective dictatorship' is an equally apt description of the US Presidency.<br /><br />In this context there is broad agreement on one point: in order to ensure the 'rule of law' (however that ideal notion is defined, distinguishable from the rule of an individual, a limited class, a group or even a coalition of dominant groups and interests) the state must possess an independent judiciary. Only an independent and impartial judiciary can offer some challenge to an executive determined to expand its sphere of powers, occasionally hold it legally accountable and thereby force the executive to take full political responsibility for some of its actions. The judiciary is, by default, the only institution capable of playing this role: the alternatives are political accountability by the opposition, the civil society and/or the media. Further, the judiciary is not prone to aggrandizement in the same way that the executive or a legislature dominated by the executive is.<br /><br /><strong>Rule by Law</strong><br /><br />For more than half of Pakistan's existence, the government has directly been in the hands of military dictators, aided and abetted by handpicked politicians enjoying minimal popular support. Even in more democratic times, the executive has remained dictatorial since the major political parties have historically been the feudal domains of individuals or families. The military establishment, the civil bureaucracy, law enforcement and national security agencies have remained impervious from accountability whether under military or civilian rule.<br /><br />The rule of law is an ideal that we may speak of, but cannot hope to attain in the near future. The least we may ask for, given our constitutional history, is that we may be ruled by law: that the actions of the executive should be in accordance with some pre-determined rule (even if such a rule is a legacy of our colonial past or has been laid down by the Ordinances and Orders of a military regime - the bulk of the law in this country can be traced to one or the other of these sources). In simple words, we only seek protection from purely arbitrary, whimsical and nakedly self-serving action by the executive.<br /><br />It is in this context that the suspension of the Chief Justice - who was rendered 'non-functional' to be precise - is so egregious. This is not the first time that a Supreme Court judge, or even a Chief Justice, has been disposed off, but on previous occasions patently legal means were resorted to, such as asking judges to take oaths of allegiance under a PCO (Provisional Constitutional Order) or reductions in retirement ages, etc. The fact that the executive did not even deem it necessary to even attempt to justify its actions in accordance with the Constitution (which has been mutilated on several occasions since 1973) is offensive: it snatched away from our eyes the last veneer of rule by law. Subsequent feeble attempts by the executive to justify this action, (i) by proffering a strained interpretation of Article 180 which provides for the appointment of an acting Chief Justice when the Chief Justice is 'absent or is unable to perform the functions of his office due to any other cause'; (ii) a resort to a 1975 statute, a remnant of the military regime that ended with the dismemberment of Pakistan in 1971, to send the Chief Justice on 'forced leave'; and (iii) pleas that the matter be left to the Supreme Judicial Council, whose decision the government now promises to abide by, have thus far failed to put us back to sleep.<br /><br /><strong>Rule of Law and the Independence of the Judiciary</strong><br /><br />If this movement continues to gather momentum and garners the support of civil society and the intelligentsia, other than the lawyers who are already on the streets, then we shall create the possibility of building constitutional rule from the ground up. It shall then not be sufficient to settle upon the nominal re-instatement of the Chief Justice. We should instead demand sufficient constitutional reform to strengthen the independence of the judiciary. Although, there shall be no guarantees that extra-constitutional measures shall not be resorted to at the pretext of a false emergency at any time in the future, such constitutional reform should seek to ensure that so long as there is rule by law the judiciary may remain sufficiently independent to keep the executive under some check. <br /><br />Such constitutional reform should focus on three aspects. First, we should seek to establish mechanisms whereby competent and politically impartial judges may be appointed to the superior judiciary. In this regard, we may look to the UK, which recently replaced its patronage-based appointments by the executive with an independent commission responsible for recommending qualified individuals for judicial appointments. The US model of vetting judicial appointments by the Senate may be even more appropriate, since approval by a three-fourths majority in the Senate would ensure that judicial appointees have the approval of all the major political parties as well as at least three of the four federating units of Pakistan. The government should also be mandated to fill all vacancies within a short period. Second, the judges should be paid adequate salaries, and be given sufficient perks and protocol, during and after the end of their t
erms of appointment, to minimize the incentives for corruption. All other means whereby the judiciary may be influenced by the executive, such as through ad hoc re-appointment of retired judges, should be prohibited. Lastly, and minimally, the executive cannot be allowed to have any role in the removal, transfer, or suspension (whether by rendering non-function or sending on forced leave) of a sitting judge. The removal of a judge may only be for cause (gross misconduct) after a judgment of his/her peers. The executive should have no say in initiating or advocating such proceedings. Ideally, such proceedings may only be initiated after impeachment by a similar majority in the Senate which would have earlier approved such an appointment.<br /><br /><br /><em>Moeen Cheema is an Assistant Professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan</em><br />

		<title>KOSOVO: Serb Property Rights</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2007/06/kosovo-serb-property-rights/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Sutton, Pitt Law &#39;09, files from <strong>Prishtina</strong>:<br /><br />When discussing independence, the property rights of Serbian internally-displaced people are an understated cause of conflict between Kosovo and Serbia. As the war raged on, many Serbians understandably fled north to escape the crossfire.  They left behind a great deal of real property, and they have had great difficulty in returning to reclaim their land since the United Nations and NATO stepped in to resolve the situation.  I talked to a member of the UN team that has worked extensively on minority issues in Kosovo. They estimate that at the onset of the 1998 conflict, Serbians owned 70-80% of the land in Kosovo.  Today, that number is estimated at 50-60%.  The number of Serbs that actually live on and utilize the land is assumed to be disproportionate to how much property they possess.<br /><br />The Serbian government has set up a <a href="http://www.srbija.sr.gov.yu/kosovo-metohija/">website</a> that provides a comprehensive view of the grievances the Kostunica regime seeks to address.  The website states,  &quot;The FRY-UNMIK Common Document of November 5, 2001 confirmed the priority to &acirc;&#8364;&#732;ensure a safe and unimpeded return of displaced persons to their homes in Kosovo&#39; (UNSCR 1244: 11k).&quot;  The ability of Serbs to return to their homes has been hampered by various processes: slow turnaround time for title claims in Kosovo courts, Albanian hostility, and the simple fact that they have made an investment of several years in Serbia that they may find hard to let go.<br /><br />Upon its arrival, the United Nations mission here set up a service that allowed displaced citizens to assert their legal claim to the property.  Many Serbs have taken advantage of this service.  For example, a case presented to the court was in regards to a deed of sale between a Serb and an Albanian.  The complaint asserted that the sale was fraudulent; the Serb that allegedly sold the property had in fact been deceased for three years.  However, even seven years after the cessation of hostilities, some claims are still hung up in the courts.  Given the ongoing media reports of corruption in the courts, and the anger that many Albanians still have toward Serbians, these claims may not be resolved for a long while hence. <br /><br />Destruction of property has also been an ongoing problem.  In May 2004, Albanians took to the streets for two days of anti-Serbian (and probably anti-minority generally) violence.  Serbian Orthodox churches were destroyed and houses were burned.  The Kosovo Forces (KFOR) did not have the mandate to intervene on internal matters, and retreated to their bases.  There has been a great deal of effort to curb reprisals against minority populations, and great efforts to include Serbians and other minorities in the new government, but it does not take long to realize that very few offices have minority staff.<br /><br />The Serbians are not blind to what is occurring.  They continue to leave rather than face what they perceive as the inevitable: second-class status.  For the same reason, Serbians are not returning.  The inability to reintegrate Kosovo will be one of the larger failures of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo.  However, right now it appears to be unstoppable.<br />

		<title>INDIA: That Pesky Right to Property</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;09, files from <strong>Mumbai</strong>:  <br /><br />When the Indian Constitution was adopted in 1949, Indians had the fundamental right to property. Since then, this right has pestered the government. It was chipped away and chipped away until it was officially downgraded from a fundamental right to merely a statutory right in 1978. Primarily the right was chipped away because the government wanted to seize property and not compensate fairly for it. When the Indian Supreme Court would tell the government it could not do this, Parliament would amend the Constitution so that it could. Which brings us to the present day, where Article 300A of the Constitution reads, &quot;no person&#39;s property shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.&quot; And that&#39;s it &#8212; a person&#39;s property can be deprived him, with little or no compensation, so long as Parliament has passed a law allowing for the deprivation.<br /><br />Yet even in this downgraded form the right to property still pesters the government. India&#39;s feisty democracy makes it difficult to just up and seize land owned by a private citizen. On television numerous times this year Indians have seen just how difficult it can be. Two weeks ago television newscasts included looped footage of riot-armed policemen chasing unarmed people across green fields in West Bengal. The people were protesting the taking of their land for a Tata Motors plant. The right to peaceably assemble, after all, is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution.<br /><br />Central to the problems now being caused by Indians&#39; pesky right to property are the new-to-India concept of Special Economic Zones (SEZ). India seeks to acquire and demarcate SEZs to encourage heavy industry. An SEZ offers tax breaks, relaxed labor rules and expedited business licenses for large industrial operations. Usually it is farmers&#39; land being taken. The agriculture sector is already struggling, and the farmers are incredulous that selling their land for a song will really give them a better life. Things climaxed in West Bengal in March with fourteen being killed while protesting a new SEZ that was to harbor a chemical plant. These plans have since been halted.<br /> <br />China&#39;s SEZs, on the other hand, had an easier course toward industrial development. There is no personal right to property in China, and China was able to swiftly create entire SEZ cities, like Shenzhen.<br /><br />Yet though Indians&#39; right to property has been degraded, people still have a right to own land. Trouble is, the government can easily seize it, and there&#39;s no constitutional guarantee this seized land will be justly compensated.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;09, files from <strong>Mumbai</strong>: <br /><br />India is a nation that takes religion seriously. Articles 25-8 of the Constitution guarantee citizens the fundamental right to religious freedom. Rickshaw drivers stick their arms up into the air when they pass by cows pulling shrines on carts down the road.  And beginning two weeks ago, Sikhs took to violent and deadly protests in Indian Punjab in retaliation for what they felt to be an insult to their religion. Newspapers had been running an advertisement showing an obscure religious sect leader dressed in a costume resembling that of a deeply revered 17th century Sikh guru.<br /><br />India takes religion so seriously that the Indian Penal Code, sec. 298, makes it illegal to wound the &quot;religious feelings&quot; of a person with deliberate intention. Sec. 295A makes it illegal to outrage the &quot;religious feelings&quot; of any class of Indian citizens with deliberate and malicious intention.<br /><br />Sikhs claim the leader of the Dera Sacha Sauda (DSS) has done just this &#8212; that he has wounded and outraged their religious feelings. Lawsuits were threatened with secs. 295A and 298 as the causes of action, but it is unclear to me whether any suits have actually gone forward. Feelings appear to be somewhat healed and tempers have somewhat cooled during the past week, especially since a statement was issued this Sunday by the DSS apologizing directly to the revered Sikh guru. One youth died during the strife.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;09, files from <strong>Mumbai</strong>: <br /><br />On Wednesday a gang of lawyers tied a 24-year old boy to a tree in front of the Court in Agra. They shaved his head and poured water on it. Then the gang took turns slapping him across his face. He was a skinny boy, and he wasn&#39;t wearing a shirt. When hit, he didn&#39;t writhe in pain, he just lowered his eyes and stared into the television camera. The tubby lawyers were not real brutal slappers. No one made any effort to shoo the television camera.<br /><br />Television newscasters speculated this whole incident occurred because the lawyers of this state, Uttar Pradesh, think they are above the law with their heavy political connections. The newscasts have also called Uttar Pradesh India&#39;s most lawless state, a claim which is of course debatable, but its <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RRJGRTP">politics are definately volatile</a>. And earlier this year lawyers from Uttar Pradesh were again caught on camera ganging up and beating down a defenseless person.<br /><br />            The boy beaten on Wednesday had been in argument earlier with one of the lawyers in the gang. The boy was a dalit, the politically correct name for untouchables, an electorate demographic swept to power in last month&#39;s elections. Even some of the politicians of last month&#39;s election were themselves lawless, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117893122368200680-search.html?KEYWORDS=uttar+pradesh+politics&COLLECTION=wsjie/6month">criminal in fact</a>.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: &quot;The Pakistan Supreme Court has asked the government lawyers to disclose the procedure under which the President has sent the reference against the Chief Justice to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).  The Court is particularly interested in determining the scope of &quot;discretion&quot; that the President may have in forming the &quot;opinion&quot; in support of the reference. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part7.ch4.html">Article 209(5)</a> of the Constitution provides that the President &quot;shall direct the SJC to inquire into the matter&quot; if the President &quot;is of the opinion&quot; on the basis of &quot;information from any source&quot; that a judge &quot;may have been guilty of misconduct.&quot;  The text seems to import that the President has little discretion but to refer the matter to the SJC if credible information has been received showing the probability of judicial misconduct.  The miscounduct information need not be bulletproof, and the President&#39;s opinion made on the basis of available information need not be unassailable. After all, the President will be directing the SJC to inquire into the matter. The SJC may disagree with the President and may view the information about the judge&#39;s alleged misconduct differently.  <br /><br />However, Article 209(5) does not confer a personal power on the President.  Nor does the Article grant a political power that the President may use to undermine the independence of the judiciary.  Article 209(5) enumerates an executive power that must be exercised within the constraints of the Office of the President.  The President has numerous constitutional powers. Prudence demands that he exercise each constitutional power in a responsible manner.   The complexity of modern government and the rule of law both require that the President solicit professional input before exercising any constitutional power.  Great damage is done to the state when the President acts upon his personal opinions without expert advice.  Removing the Chief Justice of Pakistan is no small matter.  Did the President consult his legal advisors? The Supreme Court may want to know whether the President received any written professional evaluation of the incriminating information against the Chief Justice. If the President exercised the Article 209(5) power without the written advice of any legal experts, the reference he sent to the SJC was based on a constitutionally flawed procedure of forming the required opinion.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: &quot;A revolution is brewing in Turkey.  Turkish generals do not believe that Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul is sufficiently secular to become the next President of the Turkish Republic. The un-amendable provisions of the national Constitution require that Turkey forever remain secular.  Impassioned secular crowds are chanting that Cankaya (the presidential palace) is no place for the Imam, implying that Gul is a man of the Sharia. This chant draws support from the fact that Gul&#39;s wife wears Islamic headcover (hijab) that <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1153386329523">secular laws have banned </a>in government buildings and educational institutions. The sight of the first lady wearing hijab in Cankaya annoys the armed forces; and, it offends the anti-Islamic Kemalist ideology that replaced the Ottoman Empire with secular modernism. <br /><br />In the presidential elections, Gul has failed to obtain the two-thirds majority in the Parliament, thanks to the boycott of secular parties.  But Gul refuses to withdraw his candidacy. The secular establishment is asking for new general elections to remove the pro-Islamic government of Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, who supports Gul&#39;s candidacy. The Turkish Constitutional Court has been petitioned to decide a parliamentary procedural matter at the heart of which rests the real question whether Gul&#39;s candidacy offends secular provisions of the constitution.<br /> <br /><a href="/forum/forumnew59.php">Courts can be wise or foolish</a>. It is beyond the wisdom of the Turkish Constitutional Court to decide which way the nation must tilt. The Court may decide that Gul&#39;s candidacy does not threaten the secular constitution, but that would invite the wrath of the armed forces. And if the Court rules against Gul, Turkey may enter a period of utter political instability inviting the armed forces to intervene. The Court is bound to lose either way, if it undertakes to resolve this political question. <br /><br />It appears that the nation is hopelessly fractured over the gravity of secularism. Turkey is a Muslim country and its people are not prepared to forget their Islamic history or ditch their faith in blind imitation of the secular European experience. On the other side, Westernized businesses, many intellectuals, and bureaucrats see a new Turkey made in the image of France and Germany. In this authentic and difficult struggle, the armed forces are the self-appointed guardians of secularism.<br /><br />If the Turkish armed forces were far-sighted, they would abandon political paternalism and let the political process evolve toward a natural equilibrium. They should not forget that the secular establishment was opposed even to the election of their current Prime Minister and had predicted all sorts of chaos if he were elected to be the head of the government. The nation has done well under Erdogan. The secular Republic faces no danger if Gul were elected to be the head of the state. The other road is mighty unpredictable.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm"><strong>Ben Davis</strong></a> [University of Toledo College of Law]: &quot;I recognize that we are in a moment in which we are desperately looking for (present or former) legal heroes in Justice, but while the Ashcroft hospital bed story makes great cinema - there are no great legal heroes here. <br /><br />Might I say that those who attempted to block extralegal conduct under one theory (Constitution Article II) only to allow it under another theory (Authorization to Use Military Force) are hardly heroes. It is merely a quibble between subalterns. <br /><br />It appears patently clear that the original Office of Legal Counsel basis was a Yoo opinion asserting the Article II powers of the President. Andy Card and Alberto Gonzales (in their White House roles) were trying to get the renewal of the program pursuant to that opinion.  <br /><br />When Goldsmith came to OLC in 2003 or so and reviewed the prior bases, the Article II basis appears to have been found wanting. Cormey and Goldsmith&#39;s solution? They sought to anchor the program under the broad vision of the AUMF rather than under the Article II. Thus, they were unwilling to authorize the original version and sought changes.<br /><br />As we know, last year, a federal judge in the Eastern District of Michigan rejected that version also on statutory and constitutional grounds. That decision is under appeal. I despair that either the appeals court or the Supreme Court will care enough about civil liberties to sustain the courageous federal district judge. We shall see. <br /><br />Moreover, in an effort now to put in place the so called FSIA Modernization Act - classified and unclassified versions apparently floating through Congress right now - it is likely that whatever the appeals court decision, Congress will consider and possibly adopt new language pre-election that I suspect will bow to security concerns. <br /><br />So it is good that a story has come out, but it is not as good a story as we are maybe being made to think.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.brennalaw.com/"><strong>Donald G. Rehkopf, Jr.</strong></a> [Brenna, Brenna &amp; Boyce PLLC]: &quot;Lawyers and law students, civilian and military, need to pause and seriously consider both the court-martial and verdict in the case of Navy JAG, Lieutenant Commander Matthew Diaz.  My comments are not about the moral issues or that of civil disobedience for the greater good.  Rather, the basic question - that the media has uniformly ignored - is how and why this case ever made it to court.  Aside from almost certain disbarment if his conviction is upheld, the prosecution was fundamentally flawed.<br /><br />The core allegation in Diaz, the alleged transmittal of a roster of the prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, which the government claims was &quot;classified.&quot;  The government knew that was a false allegation but relied upon the mantra of &quot;national security&quot; to keep its &quot;secret&quot; safe.  At best, the government could claim that the roster was &quot;For Official Use Only,&quot; which is <u>not</u> a classification category under federal law.<br /><br />JURIST readers may recall that the military charged former Army Chaplain, Captain James Yee and Air Force Senior Airman, Ahmad Al Halabi with similar &quot;crimes&quot; after tours at GTMO.  Yee was exonerated completely while Al Halabi had all but a couple of minor charges either dismissed or withdrawn by the government.  Indeed, the government finally agreed that the prisoner [after more than 5 years, they are not &quot;detainees&quot;] rosters were <u>not classified</u>.  I know, because I was the lead counsel in <em>U.S. v. Al Halabi</em> and with the very able assistance of my military JAG co-counsel, Majors James Key and Kim London, we established that the names of the prisoners and their ISN&#39;s could not be legally &quot;classified&quot; under U.S. law.  Captain Yee&#39;s attorneys made similar arguments, resulting in his ultimate vindication.<br /><br />The government had to know of the <em>Al Halabi</em> results, and thus the question becomes, was the fact that a similar roster in <em>Al Halabi</em> was ultimately conceded by the government not to be classified, disclosed pursuant to the prosecution&#39;s duties under <em>Brady v. Maryland</em>, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and <em>Kyles v. Whitley</em>, 514 U.S. 419 (1995), a standard adopted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, see <em>United States v. Roberts</em>, 59 M.J. 323 (2004).  The Navy &quot;knew&quot; for sure, because the government &quot;detailed&quot; (assigned) a Navy JAG as an assistant prosecutor in the <em>Al Halabi</em> case.<br /><br />Trials, especially criminal trials, are in theory about &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;justice.&quot;  After reading the many media reports, to include the fine coverage in JURIST, one has to wonder however, if either truth or justice exists in the Diaz case.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer"><strong>Jack Martin</strong></a> [Special Projects Director, <a href="http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer">Federation for American Immigration Reform</a> (FAIR)]: &quot;The White House and Congress understand that the American public is concerned about the fast-growing concentration of illegal residents in our communities, schools and worksites. But there are two very distinct approaches to dealing with the issue. One is to get tough on border and interior enforcement to deter further illegal immigration and deny those already here illegally the opportunity to profit from their violation of our immigration law. The other is to open the door wider to immigrants so that illegal immigration can be channeled into legal entry paths.<br /><br />Accommodation of the illegal population in 1986 backfired and led to increased illegal entry. From the restrictionist perspective, if an accommodationist approach is adopted again, the message sent abroad will reiterate that we are prepared to tolerate illegal entry and, because we are not prepared to entirely open our border, those who can&#39;t enter legally should continue to come illegally and await the next amnesty. <br /><br />What does not make sense is why so many people who consider themselves liberals are supporting the efforts by the White House and the Chamber of Commerce to open the immigration door wider. Economics columnist Robert Samuelson hit the nail on the head in his May 2 commentary in the <em>Washington Post</em>. He wrote, &quot;Tight labor markets raise wages. Admitting more poor, low-skilled Latino workers hurts Latinos already here by depressing their wages. It&#39;s anti-Hispanic and anti-assimilation. Almost certainly, it also hurts the wages of other low-skilled Americans. Businesses grasp this -- hence their support for guest workers -- even if some academic economists do not. Why many liberals don&#39;t is a puzzle.&quot;<br /><br /><em>See JURIST&#39;s legal news archive on immigration <a href="/currentawareness/immigration.php">here</a></em>.<br />

		<title>An Empty Chair at The Hague: Trying Charles Taylor</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=152">David Crane</a> of Syracuse University College of Law, former Chief Prosecutor for the UN Special Court for Sierra Leone, says that despite the absence of former Liberian president and indicted war criminal Charles Taylor from the opening of his trial before an SCSL panel sitting at an ICC courtroom in The Hague, the trial itself demonstrates to the people of Sierra Leone that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of the gun...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidcranenew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he video transmission from The Hague showed a courtroom in the International Criminal Court. There sat the Prosecutor and his team from Freetown, Sierra Leone, as well as the Defense team consisting of appointed counsel and a barrister from the Office of the Public Defender. The judges had yet to come in to start the trial of the first African head of state for war crimes and crimes against humanity. But his chair remained empty.<br /><br />I indicted President Charles Taylor of Liberia on March 3, 2003 at a moving signing ceremony in my office in Freetown. Taylor was indictment number one of eight that I signed that fateful afternoon. A week later six indictees would be in jail, all the various leaders of the warring factions in the brutal conflict in Sierra Leone, started by Taylor with the support of Blas&Atilde;&copy; Campore and Muammar Khadafy of Libya. The indictment of Taylor that I signed contained seventeen counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity ranging from murder, rape, pillage, enslavement, mutilation, and the unlawful recruitment of child soldiers, among others. That indictment was later amended down to eleven counts, making for a tighter, more concise instrument to hold this destroyer of two nations accountable.<br /><br />The conflict in Sierra Leone was started by criminals for their own personal criminal gain and to geo-politically take over all of West Africa. Diamonds, gold, and timber were sold for cash and guns to fuel the effort. The vast majority of the profits were pocketed by Taylor and his band of thugs in the amount of several hundred million dollars. The center point to a vast joint criminal enterprise, Taylor controlled this operation to take over Liberia and Sierra Leone for over ten years. The result of this misadventure was the murder, rape, maiming, and mutilation of over 1.2 million human beings in West Africa making him one of the mega-murderers of the 20th century behind Mao Tse-tung, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot, and Saddam Hussein. Including Taylor, this small and sordid gang of despots is responsible for the destruction of over 100 million of their own citizens.<br /><br />So what of the empty chair this past Monday, 4 June, four years to the day that I unsealed the indictment publicly humiliating him before his peers and the people of Africa in Accra, Ghana? Not much should be taken from it. Taylor and his counsel are predictably providing the histrionics that accompany the public disgrace of a bloody tyrant. Goering and Hess at Nuremberg, Milosevic in The Hague, Norman in Freetown, and Hussein in Baghdad all acted up at the beginning of their trials, in large part to no avail. Taylor's antics are no different and cannot prevent the proper and forceful march of justice in a fair and open trial.<br /><br />The tactic to deflect the power of an opening statement of the Chief Prosecutor of a high level indictee is also a test of the trial chamber to ensure that there is proper control throughout the proceedings. A hesitant and insecure bench will turn the trial into a disaster and bring discredit upon both the judiciary and the rule of law. Not so at The Hague last Monday. The presiding judge quite properly, and with great patience, managed the fumbling efforts of the defense counsel to derail the opening and shift the spotlight from the war crimes and crimes against humanity Taylor allegedly committed to Taylor's political perspectives and his contempt for the proceedings. Very much like Sir Geoffrey Lawrence, the presiding judge at Nuremberg, the presiding judge here firmly reigned in all court personnel sending the signal that the trial chamber was in control.<br /><br />And so it begins - one of the major international criminal trials of the decade - in an orderly and proper fashion, showing the people of West Africa that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of the gun. As the trial unfolds, the brave men and women of Sierra Leone will come forward, some damaged physically and emotionally, almost beyond understanding, holding up the stumps of their limbs and saying to Taylor, "you did this to me." The chair may have been empty on 4 June 2007, but the hearts of the countless victims of the atrocity perpetrated in West Africa are full with the grace and hope that no man is above the law.<br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

Myers, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned they were &quot;very dangerous people who would gnaw hydraulic lines in the back of a C-17 to bring it down.&quot; These claims were designed to justify locking up hundreds of men and boys for years in small cages like animals.<br /><br />George W. Bush lost no time establishing military commissions to try the very &quot;worst of the worst&quot; for war crimes. But four and a half years later, the Supreme Court decided in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> that those commissions violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions. So Bush dusted them off, made a few changes, and rammed his new improved military commissions through the Republican Congress last fall.<br /><br />Only three detainees have been brought before the new commissions. One would expect the people Bush &amp; Co. singled out for war crimes prosecutions would be high-level al-Qaeda leaders. But they weren&#39;t. The first was David Hicks, who was evidently not so dangerous. The U.S. military made a deal that garnered Hicks a misdemeanor sentence and sent him back to Australia. <br /><br />Salem Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni who used to be Osama bin Laden&#39;s chauffeur, was the second. Hamdan, whose case had been overturned by the Supreme Court, was finally brought before a military commission Monday for arraignment on charges of conspiracy and material support for terrorism. <br /><br />The third defendant was Omar Khadr, a Canadian citizen, who appeared for arraignment the same day as Hamdan. Khadr was 15 years old when he arrived at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo. He faced charges of conspiracy, murder, attempted murder, spying, and supporting terrorism.<br /><br />On Monday, much to Bush&#39;s dismay, two different military judges dismissed both Hamdan&#39;s and Khadr&#39;s cases on procedural grounds. <br /><br />The Military Commissions Act that Congress passed last year says the military commissions have jurisdiction to try offenses committed by alien unlawful enemy combatants. Unlawful enemy combatants are defined as (1) people who have engaged in hostilities or purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its allies; or (2) people who have been determined to be unlawful enemy combatants by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) or another competent tribunal. The Act says that a determination of unlawful enemy combatant status by a CSRT or another competent tribunal is dispositive.<br /><br />But there are no &quot;unlawful&quot; enemy combatants at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo. There are only men who have been determined to be &quot;enemy combatants&quot; by the CSRTs. The Act declares that military commissions &quot;shall not have jurisdiction over lawful enemy combatants.&quot; In its haste to launch post-Hamdan military commissions, Bush&#39;s legal eagles didn&#39;t notice this discrepancy. That is why the charges were dismissed.<br /><br />The Bush administration may try to fix the procedural problem and retry Khadr and Hamdan. But regardless of whether Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees are lawful or unlawful enemy combatants, the Bush administration&#39;s treatment of them violates the Geneva Conventions. Lawful enemy combatants are protected against inhumane treatment by the Third Geneva Convention on prisoners of war. Unlawful enemy combatants are protected against inhumane treatment by Common Article Three.<br /><br />Omar Khadr was captured in Afghanistan and brought to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo when he was 15 years old. In both places, he has been repeatedly tortured and subjected to inhumane treatment. At Bagram Air Base, Khadr was denied pain medication for his serious head and eye shrapnel wounds. At Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, his hands and feet were shackled together, he was bolted to the floor and left there for hours at a time. After he urinated on himself and on the floor, U.S. military guards mopped the floor with his skinny little body. Khadr was beaten in the head, dogs lunged at him, and he was threatened with rape and the removal of his body parts.<br /><br />Khadr cried frequently. He has nightmares, sweats and hyperventilates, and is hypervigilant, hearing sounds that he can&#39;t identify. When Khadr&#39;s lawyer saw him for the first time in 2004, he thought, &quot;He&#39;s just a little kid.&quot;<br /><br />Why was Khadr treated this way? He comes from a family allegedly active in al-Qaeda. His charges stem from an incident where the U.S. sent Afghans into a compound where Khadr and others were located. The people inside the compound killed the Afghans and began firing at the U.S. soldiers. The Americans dropped two 500-pound bombs on the compound, killing everyone inside except Khadr. After Khadr threw a hand grenade which killed an American, the soldiers shot Khadr, blinding and seriously wounding him. Khadr begged them in English to finish him off. He was then taken to Baghram and later to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.<br /><br />According to Donald Rehkopf, Jr., co-chair of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers Military Law Committee, &quot;The government has steadfastly refused to allow hearings on this alleged [unlawful enemy combatant] status because there are so many prisoners at GTMO that were not even combatants, much less &#39;unlawful&#39; ones. Khadr is in an unusual situation because he has a viable &#39;self-defense&#39; claim - we attacked the compound that he and his family were living in, and the fact that he was only 15 at the time.&quot;<br /><br />If Khadr were a U.S. citizen, he would not even be subject to trial by court-martial because of his age. When the Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that children under 18 at the time of their crimes could not be executed, it said that youths display a &quot;lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility&quot; that &quot;often results in impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions.&quot; A juvenile, the Court found, is more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and his character is not as well-formed as that of an adult. &quot;From a moral standpoint,&quot; Justice Kennedy wrote for the majority, &quot;it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for a greater possibility exists that a minor&#39;s character deficiencies will be reformed.&quot; The Bush administration&#39;s treatment of Omar Khadr flies in the face of the Court&#39;s reasoning.<br /><br />The United States may be able to retry Khadr and Hamdan. They have a few days to file an appeal. But the Court of Military Commissions Review hasn&#39;t even been established yet, so it&#39;s unclear where the appeals would be brought.<br /><br />The Military Commissions Act, which denies basic due process protections, including the right to habeas corpus, is a disgrace. But an even bigger disgrace is the concentration camp the United States maintains at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay, Cuba. The Act should be repealed and the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo prison should be shut down immediately.<br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn i

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.slaw.neu.edu/faculty/f_burnham.htm">Margaret Burnham</a> of Northeastern University School of Law says the trial of alleged Klansman James Seale, accused of kidnapping and then drowning two young men in southwest Mississippi in May 1964, highlights both Mississippi&#39;s historical role in Klan violence and the grievous shortcomings of federal law enforcement in the civil rights era...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/margaretburnham.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>F</strong></font>or the past three weeks the James O. Eastland Federal Courthouse in Jackson, MS. has been the scene of what may turn out to be one of the most significant criminal civil rights trials in decades and yet it has been a sleeper as far as the national press is concerned. A racially mixed jury, sitting before an African-American federal judge, is hearing evidence in the conspiracy trial of an alleged Klansman accused of kidnapping and then drowning two young men in southwest Mississippi in May 1964. As I listened to some of the gripping testimony earlier this month, two points seemed clear. The first is that there were five - not three - civil rights slayings immediately prior to Mississippi Freedom Summer. And the second is that the federal government's failure to fully alert the public to the nature of Klan/law enforcement collusion in Mississippi exposed African-Americans and civil rights activists to lethal harm. <br /><br />The victims in the case, Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Moore, 19 years old when they were murdered, were snatched off a road in the town of Meadville by a group of Klansmen. The youths were taken to a federal forest, beaten, and then, still alive, tied to heavy metal weights and dumped in the Mississippi River. With the discovery of their bodies by a fisherman over a month later, the FBI launched an intensive investigation. The evidence that the Bureau accumulated made clear who in the Klan committed the murders, and indeed, in November 1964, two members of the White Knights of the KKK, Charles Marcus Edwards and James Ford Seale, were arrested on warrants obtained by the Franklin County district attorney. <br /><br />But the case against the men was never brought before a state or federal grand jury. Two months after the arrests the district attorney, claiming he did not have "sufficient evidence," moved to dismiss the charges and the men were released. The current trial &#8212; 43 years after the killings &#8212; is the first public airing of the horrific crime. <br /><br />On June 5, an immunized Charles Edwards took the stand and spilled out the chilling details of the crime in the trial of James Seale, now 71 years old. Edwards' testimony, with that of other witnesses, offers fresh insight into the egregious role of federal authorities in combating anti-civil rights violence in the 1960s, and challenges the traditional picture of the nature and consequences of such violence.<br /><br />As is now well known, the Dee/Moore murders would likely have gone completely unnoticed but for the fact that on June 21, 1964, six weeks after Dee and Moore were slain, civil rights workers Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman &#8212; two of whom were white - were killed in Philadelphia, MS, and world attention was riveted on the massive FBI search for them. In fact, when the bodies of Dee and Moore were first pulled from the waters of the Mississippi on July 12, the authorities thought they might be the Philadelphia victims. The Dee/Moore case received little public attention until, in 2005, Charles Moore's brother, Thomas, launched a successful campaign to get federal prosecutors to take another look at the file. That re-examination resulted in the January 2007 kidnap indictment followed by the current trial.<br /><br />The trial testimony of the ex-Klansman strongly suggests that county law enforcement officials knew that Dee and Moore had been kidnapped on the day of the murders. One of the two men picked up, Dee, was suspected by the Klan of involvement in black self-defense activities. According to the witness, the KKK was following up on a rumor that guns were being brought into the county by black activists "to start an insurrection;" Dee fell under suspicion because, Edwards testified, he wore a black bandana, and he had recently returned from a visit with relatives in Chicago. After beating a false confession out of the youths, some of the conspirators left them under guard and went to the county courthouse to get the sheriff, whom Edwards testified was also in the Klan. This group then proceeded to search a black church where the youths said the guns were. Finding nothing at the church, the Klansmen went back and got the two victims, took them to the river and dumped them in. <br /><br />The federal government could well have pursued charges in these deaths in 1964, particularly so as the beatings took place on federal lands. Instead, as was its practice at the time, the FBI turned the results of its investigation, including the physical evidence, over to the state for further action. FBI witnesses in the current trial have testified they do not know what happened to the physical evidence when it moved from federal to state hands. But did the Bureau really expect that the sheriff and his men - who could hardly have been in the dark about the abduction since they led a search of the church at the behest of the Klan conspirators while the crime was in progress - to pursue the case in earnest?<br /><br />One particularly dire consequence of the FBI's failure to oversee the investigation to a proper conclusion was that it deprived the American public of the ability fully to connect the murders of Dee and Moore with those of the three Philadelphia victims. In 1964, the deep public revulsion at the deaths of Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman led to some measure of increased protection for civil rights activities, but the federal government was still far too slow to override state authorities, and a number of civil rights related murders occurred even after the Philadelphia killings in June 1964. What if the public had fully appreciated that there were not three, but five documented civil rights murders in Mississippi within 60 days before the commencement of the Freedom Summer campaign? Would that knowledge have led to more effective federal intervention to protect the safety of black activists and their allies? <br /><br />Until very recently, the murders of Dee and Moore have been distinguished from others of the period that more neatly fit the mold of "civil rights crime" because the victims were known activists or leaders. But there is more similarity than difference in these cases. The killers of Dee and Moore acted within weeks of the inception of the Freedom Summer, which was deeply feared by Mississippi's white establishment. Like the men who shot to death the Philadelphia three, the Dee/Moore conspirators claimed to be protecting the state from black activism. And both crimes were meant to intimidate blacks engaged in or considering resistance. At the Dee/Moore trial there was testimony that the minister of the church searched by the county sheriff was warned that whites were planning to bomb his church, and the day after Dee and Moore's bodies were discovered, shots were fired into the minister's home. The sheriff must have believed the intimidation succeeded, for in October 1964 he proudly reassured state officials that there were no civil rights "or subversive organizations" operating in his county.<br /><br />The Dee/Moore killings establish a close link between the classic civil rights slayings of, for example, King and Evers, and those like Emmett Till that appear to reflect a more unspecific if not any less lethal form of race hatred. Till was targeted as an outside threat &#8212; he was from Chicago, where Hezekiah Dee had vacationed before hi
s fateful return home to Meadville. But the Till murder, just like that of Dee, Moore, Chaney, Schwerner and Goodman &#8212; and Henry Lee, Louis Allen, Vernon Dahmer, and Medgar Evers &#8212; was an anti-civil rights crime intended to terrorize those who might resist white racism. The failure of the FBI to classify the slaying of Dee and Moore as a civil rights crime &#8212; the local newspaper dubbed the case the "torso murders" - and to investigate it as vigorously as the Philadelphia murders left the nation, and its leaders in the White House, with a woefully incomplete picture of the mortal threats facing the civil rights movement. <br />No matter what the verdict is, the evidence in this trial will help set the record straight on the State of Mississippi's participation in Klan violence as well as on the grievous shortcomings of federal law enforcement during this era. <br /><br /><br /><em>Margaret A.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist and former Australian Prime Minister <a href="http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/meetpm.asp?pmId=22">Malcolm Fraser</a> says that the trial of Australian Guantanamo detainee David Hicks before a US military commission has demonstrated the disturbing willingness of two allegedly democratic governments to abandon the rule of law for an expedient and evil purpose...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/malcolmfraser.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>P</strong></font>resident Bush established Guantanamo Bay to enable the United States to put prisoners alleged to be terrorists beyond the reach of the American legal system, beyond the reach of the Geneva Conventions and beyond the reach of any element of international law. By executive decree, he established military tribunals which the United States Supreme Court struck down on the basis that the President had exceeded his powers. Congress passed a law establishing new military commissions, a law that has not yet been tested in the Supreme Court. <br /><br />The future of the commissions probably rests on a judgment as to whether or not such laws can be passed in relation to non-citizens. Their rules of procedure are utterly inconsistent with the rules of procedure in the normal justice system of America or of Australia. The loose use of hearsay evidence and evidence obtained under harshly intrusive questioning is allowed. It is left to the President to define how far that intrusive questioning may go.<br /><br />This is the system established to try David Hicks and other people from Guantanamo Bay. In my view it was a system designed to achieve a guilty verdict on the basis of evidence that would be totally unacceptable if applied to American citizens or to an Australian citizen within Australia. The circumstances surrounding the Hicks trial, if one can call it that, and the plea bargain support that view.<br /><br />For around a year, perhaps for longer, David Hicks had been kept in solitary confinement, no access to the sky, to the outside, to other people, inadequate exercise, a lighting system controlled from without the cell and also, we are advised, temperature changes from extreme cold to heat, could be part of the regime. <br /><br />There were attacks on Major Michael Mori and his credibility and the way he was conducting Hicks&#39; defence, all undertaken by the prosecution, even at one point implying that Major Mori could be charged. At the arraignment proceedings itself, Hicks' civilian lawyers were barred from the process because they wouldn't sign a blank cheque agreeing to rules for the conduct of counsel, which the United States Department of Defence had not yet drafted. <br /><br />These processes collectively were designed to put Hicks under intense mental pressure, perhaps for a very specific reason. While the United States government, and for that matter the Australian government, seemed to want - as New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Charles indicated - a guilty verdict, the evidence they had available, even after five years imprisonment, was weak and could not have been successful for a United States citizen in a civilian or in a normal United States court martial.<br /><br />Justice Susan Crawford, head of the military tribunals, struck out the more serious charges, including the charge of murder. It was the more serious charges that were used by United States personnel, by the government of Australia, by the United States ambassador to Australia, to suggest that that Hicks was amongst the worst of the worst. Quite recently the ambassador said that Hicks would kill Australians and Americans without blinking an eye. There was only one charge remaining, that of providing material support for terrorism. The maximum sentence for that offence is reported to be seven years. This charge was corruptly imported from the United States civil system, it was retrospective in its impact and the particular law, because of retrospectivity, would not meet normal judicial standards.<br /><br />I believe it likely that the United States authorities did not want the weakness of their evidence publicly exposed, even in a fraudulent military tribunal. Even though cross-examination would have been extremely limited, it could still have exposed the secrecy by which evidence had been collected. The defence would have exposed the fact that they were not properly advised of the evidence, of the means by which it was obtained, that it was in fact a very secret process, designed to achieve one verdict. If the process had gone to open court, each hour would have demonstrated that justice was not being served, that this was not a court of law. The best alternative for governments, with some semblance of their credibility preserved, was to have Hicks under such pressure that he would accept a plea bargain. This does explain the solitary confinement of over twelve months. It does explain the other pressures placed upon him, pressures which would have included the threat of continuing jail in Guantanamo Bay for twenty years or more. What person amongst us would not have accepted a plea bargain that achieved some element of freedom at the end of nine months?<br /><br />This is made all the more evident in the final stages of the tribunal process. Ten colonels had been flown in from around the United States to determine sentence, they determined the maximum allowed for that particular offence, seven years, only to find within fifteen minutes that they had been ordered to participate in a total and absolute farce. Within fifteen minutes they learned that there had indeed been a plea bargain and the maximum sentence was nine months, less than many courts would give for a drunk-driving charge. They learned that the plea bargain had been consummated in Washington, by-passing the Prosecution, by-passing the tribunal and its judge two weeks earlier. Whatever this process reveals, no sane person can call it an exercise of justice.<br /><br />So David Hicks will be home by the end of the year, partially gagged. The gag order which was undermined by information provided to the British government and subsequently published in his application to become a British citizen and subject to the same treatment as other British citizens formerly held in Guantanamo Bay.<br /><br />And so this story comes to an end but at what a price. The main story is not David Hicks. The main story is a willingness of two allegedly democratic governments prepared to throw every legal principle out the window and establish a process that we would expect of tyrannical regimes. That our own democracies should be prepared to so abandon the rule of law for an expedient and as I believe, evil purpose should greatly disturb all of us. But how many are concerned? Too many are not concerned because they believe that such a derogation of justice can only apply to people who are different, in some indefinable way.<br /><br />Only the other day I was speaking with somebody who quite plainly believed that Hicks deserved anything that was metered out to him because he was what he was, the rule of law did not need to apply. For somebody who has done terrible things, why does he deserve justice? That denies the whole basis of our system, the necessity of a civilised society which cannot exist unless there is an open, predictable justice system that applies equally to every person.<br /><br />David Hicks at the best was clearly a very foolish young man. He was terribly misguided and may well have done some terrible things. I do not know. But if our government says he has had his day in court, he made a plea bargain, therefore he deserved what he got, it only emphasises its lack of commitment to the rule of law for all people.<br /><br />If the government believes it to be expedient, we now know that it is prepared to push the rule of law aside. That is a
 larger issue than the tragedy of David Hicks.<br /><br /><br /><em>Malcolm Fraser was prime minister of Australia from 1975-1983.</em><br />

This idea is not a new one, but in the wake of President Bush&#39;s veto of Congress&#39; war funding bill that called for a phased drawdown of U.S. troops beginning this October, it is now attracting support. <br /><br />However, what Senators Byrd and Clinton may also be doing is moving into position to provoke a test of the 1973 War Powers Resolution (WPR). Under Sec. 5c of that law, Congress can order a pullback of troops by concurrent resolution if they are in the field without a supporting declaration of war or use of force authorization (concurrent resolutions don&#39;t need to be signed by the president). Since they are in Iraq pursuant to such an authorization, that authorization would have to be removed for Congress to undertake such an action.<br /><br />Republican Senator John Warner has argued that both purposes of the Iraq Authorization have evaporated. Those purposes are found in Sec. 3a of the Authorization to Use Force:<br /><br />SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.<br /><br />(a) Authorization.--The President is authorized to use the Armed <br />Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and <br />appropriate in order to--<br />(1) defend the national security of the United States <br />against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and<br />(2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council <br />resolutions regarding Iraq.<br /><br />Logically, since the U.S. is no longer defending itself against a threat from Iraq or enforcing U.N. Security Council resolutions, both of which dealt with the possibility of WMD, repeal would be the way to go. If the authorization is repealed, then Sec. 5c of the War Powers Resolution kicks in and Congress can pull the rug out from under the president without requiring his signature. Indeed, Sec. 3c of the Authorization specifically incorporates the WPR: &quot;Nothing in this joint resolution supersedes any requirement of the War Powers Resolution.&quot; <br /><br />Consequently, this could be the beginning stage of the long awaited fight in the courts concerning the constitutionality of the WPR. Every president since Nixon has considered the WPR unconstitutional, and yet each has complied with its terms. The courts could naturally duck the issue by calling the matter a political question, but this Supreme Court could conceivably deal with it.<br /><br />Of course, the president could always veto the repeal legislation if it is offered as an act. The other avenue for Congress is to argue that the Authorization has been rendered inapplicable since its underlying justification is no longer connected to what Pres. Bush is doing in Iraq and the &quot;faithful execution of the laws&quot; provision in Article II of the Constitution prohibits the executive from misusing statutes for unintended purposes. Under that theory, Congress would argue that they could trigger a 5c concurrent resolution anyway because there is no longer functionally an underlying Authorization to use force in the Iraqi civil war. <br /><br />Ironically, they could argue that even the president acknowledged the Authorization&#39;s expiry when he declared &quot;mission accomplished&quot; four years ago this month at the end of combat operations - but to do that would be to also acknowledge that Congress waited too long to pull the plug on this military fiasco after it had the power to do so.<br /><br />Stay tuned. This could be an interesting summer if the WPR finally gets invoked.<br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J. Kelly is Professor of Law at Creighton University School of Law in Omaha, Nebraska.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/radsan.html">A. John Radsan</a>, former CIA assistant general counsel now at William Mitchell College of Law, says that Senate Intelligence Committee members questioning John Rizzo at his upcoming confirmation hearing for CIA General Counsel should resist the temptation to posture on extraordinary rendition, secret prisons, and coercive interrogations, and instead delve into deeper issues about the lawyer's role in secret agencies...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/johnradsan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>hile many lawyers have come and gone from the Justice Department, John Rizzo, a career public servant, has held a steady watch at the Central Intelligence Agency. Since 9/11, Rizzo has sometimes been called the Acting General Counsel, sometimes the senior deputy general counsel. Whatever his title, he has kept the trust of the secret soldiers who fight for our nation's security.<br /><br />On May 15, Rizzo will step from the shadows to face questions from the Senate intelligence committee in his confirmation hearing to become the official General Counsel. John's colleagues, away from the spotlights, all know about his flair, the matching ties and suspenders, but for our country's sake, the Senate should reveal more of what lies beneath the surface. While Rizzo's confirmation process should be fair, the Senate, whether in open or closed session, should not give him a free pass. <br /><br />The Senate, having given other lawyers a pass on controversial aspects of President Bush's "global war on terror," may be tempted to posture on extraordinary rendition, secret prisons, and coercive interrogations. The Senate should resist that temptation, delving into deeper issues about the lawyer's role in secret agencies. Although the lawyers in the CIA's Office of General Counsel have been involved in sensitive issues, they have done so in consultation with lawyers in the White House, the Vice President's Office, the State Department, the Defense Department, and the Justice Department. John Rizzo, whatever his role, was not the person who ultimately authorized extraordinary rendition, secret prisons, or coercive interrogations. <br /><br />So the Senate should ask some fundamental questions. Should the CIA's top lawyer be an extension of the oversight committees? That is what some people thought would happen when the number of CIA lawyers expanded after Iran-Contra. Or should the General Counsel be a sort of corporate lawyer who helps the principals close their deals? That is what some policymakers prefer. Or does the CIA's lawyer play a hybrid role between oversight and facilitation? <br /><br />The last time Rizzo spoke publicly about his role as a Company lawyer was at an event my law school held in March 2007. On the 60th anniversary of the CIA's founding, we discussed the two-way influences between the CIA and Hollywood. It was a safe setting in which John delighted us all with a story about his brush pass with Robert DeNiro, who, a few years back, had been at CIA headquarters researching <em>The Good Shepherd</em>.<br /><br />Rizzo, who started with the CIA in 1976, says it is a good thing when a career lawyer rises to the top of the ranks. The last time an insider rose to the top was Larry Houston. Houston served as chief lawyer to the Office of Strategic Services, the CIA's precursor, and later as the CIA's first general counsel until 1973. After Houston, a tradition had been established that the CIA's General Counsel should come from the outside, whether from private practice or another government agency. That outside experience, so it was believed, contributed to the General Counsel having fresh ideas and providing effective oversight.<br /><br />Putting aside questions about insiders and outsiders, I have a bias in favor of John Rizzo. Having worked under him, I like him and respect him. But his confirmation hearing, of course, should go beyond any individual and beyond any friendship. Back to true oversight, the Senate should be comprehensive in determining whether Rizzo deserves its stamp of approval.<br /><br />Not until after Iran-Contra has the CIA's top lawyer required Senate confirmation. Therefore, Rizzo would be only the third, Senate confirmed, general counsel. At the first confirmation &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; for Robert McNamara, a Clinton nominee &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the Senate bypassed a hearing and went straight to a positive vote. Next, Scott Muller, a Bush nominee in 2002, also had it short and easy. A year after 9/11, the Senate allowed Muller to rest on clich&Atilde;&copy;s: "I view the lawyer more as a navigator who will help the captains of the ship steer it as best they can so it's not to hit shoals, to tell them where the water is deep and where it is shallow. . ." Worse, a Democratic Senator told Muller that he did not share a prior general counsel's view that the CIA needed "adult supervision."<br /><br />Despite what was said at Muller's hearing, the CIA clearly needs the kind of supervision that only an adult can provide. The confirmation process is democracy's way of deciding whether John Rizzo, an adult from the inside, provides the necessary balance in giving counsel to all parts of the CIA. Let the questions begin.<br /><br /><br /><em>A. John Radsan, director of the National Security Forum at William Mitchell College of Law, was assistant general counsel at the CIA from 2002-2004.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/radsan.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/about_us/aboutus_bios.html#jonathan">Jonathan Hafetz</a>, Counsel with the <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a> at New York University School of Law, says that DOJ-proposed restrictions on lawyers representing Guantanamo detainees would chill communications between lawyers and their clients, suppress information about detentions, and inhibit detainees from meaningfully contesting the allegations against them...<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/jonathanhafetz.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will hear arguments in two Guantanamo detainee cases, <em>Bismullah v. Gates</em> and <em>Parhat v. Gates</em>.   The cases raise threshold questions about what rights, if any, Guantanamo detainees have to the assistance of counsel in light of recent legislation repealing habeas corpus.  The administration has proposed draconian restrictions that would govern all current and future Guantanamo detainee cases, significantly limiting detainees' access to attorneys and ability to challenge their detention in court.<br /><br />The Administration's proposed rules would dramatically alter the system that has governed attorney-client relations at Guantanamo since the first lawyers visited the base more than two-and-one-half years ago.  That system now governs more than two hundred pending cases filed by or on behalf of Guantanamo prisoners.<br /> <br />The proposed rules contain a number of troubling provisions.  They would, for example, restrict communications between lawyers and detainees to a narrowly defined category of "legal mail" that excludes material plainly relevant to a detainee's case.  The proposed rules would also give a government privilege review team the authority to review and censor the content of detainees' legal mail and to reveal those contents based upon the government's own assessment of the needs of national security.  In addition, the proposed rules would limit lawyers' access to classified information based upon what the government unilaterally determines lawyers "need to know," even though the lawyers have already received security clearances precisely to review such information.  Further, the proposed rules would give attorneys only one visit to obtain authorization from detainees to represent them while providing the government with <em>carte blanche</em> to terminate an attorney&#39;s access to his or her client at any time and without court review.<br /><br />Last week, the government retreated from its call to limit attorneys to three visits with their clients after the commander of Guantanamo acknowledged such a limit was unnecessary.  But government reiterated its demand to implement the other restrictions.<br /><br />The Administration's proposed rules are the latest sally in its longstanding battle against attorneys at Guantanamo.  From the time the first prisoners arrived in 2002, the Administration sought to deny detainees any access to counsel.  The Administration lost that fight after the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/03pdf/03-334.pdf">Rasul v. Bush</a> that detainees had a right to seek habeas corpus relief in federal district court.  Yet, efforts to undermine counsel access continued, as interrogators posed as attorneys and guards told detainees not to trust their lawyers.  In January, the Defense Department's Assistant Secretary for Detainee Affairs, Cully Simpson, called for a boycott against law firms that represented detainees (Simpson later resigned after the uproar his comments provoked).  Now, the Administration is trying to substantially curtail access in connection with the new review mechanism Congress established in the <a href="/gazette/2005/12/detainee-treatment-act-of-2005-white.php">Detainee Treatment Act of 2005</a> (DTA) as an alternative to habeas corpus. <br /><br />If adopted, the proposed rules would chill communications between lawyers and their clients, suppress information about detentions at Guantanamo, and inhibit detainees from meaningfully contesting the allegations against them.<br /><br />Hundreds of individuals have been imprisoned at Guantanamo for more than five years without charge or a meaningful hearing on the lawfulness of their confinement.  Many are from very different cultures and do not even speak English.  Lawyers serve as more than the detainees' advocates: they provide their only contact with an unfamiliar legal system and with the outside world from they have been almost entirely cut off.  The Administration's proposal to review and censor privileged communications will erode the trust that is essential to any attorney-client relationship and that is so important to those relationships at Guantanamo which have already had to overcome years of governmental interference and harassment.<br /><br />The Administration's proposed rules would also undermine the ability of detainees to seek relief in court by allowing the government to unilaterally deny attorneys access to classified information that is potentially material to a detainee's case.  This proposal has less to do with purported concerns about "national security" than it does with the government's continued resistance to any meaningful inquiry into the factual basis for the detainees' confinement.   The desire to shield detention decisions and interrogations from independent scrutiny is what drove the Administration's efforts to prevent lawyers from coming to Guantanamo in the first place, and it is what is largely driving its attempt to limit attorney access now.<br /><br />Further, the proposed rules would exacerbate the substantial damage Guantanamo has caused to the United States' reputation and credibility.   To date, lawyers have provided the only meaningful check on the detention and interrogation of alleged "enemy combatants."  Indeed, other than representatives of the International Committee for the Red Cross, no other non-government individuals except for attorneys have been able to see or speak to the prisoners at Guantanamo.  Blocking lawyers' from communicating with and representing detainees merely reinforces existing perceptions of Guantanamo as a lawless enclave whose principal purpose is not to detain but to mask illegality and abuse.<br /><br /> In urging the D.C. Circuit to adopt the restrictions, the Administration seeks to blame attorneys for what it describes as "unrest at Guantanamo."  Putting aside the Administration's continued refusal to recognize that the overriding cause of any such "unrest" is its failure to provide a fair and lawful process to individuals who have been held virtually incommunicado now for more than five years, there is no evidence that lawyers are responsible for any such unrest.   Indeed, no infraction of the current rules governing counsel access has been reported to the district court, and the government has not sought sanctions against any attorney.<br /><br />To be sure, Tuesday's argument is likely just the first of several coming battles over what rights detainees have under the DTA and what review the D.C. Circuit can exercise over their claims.  But how the court treats the issue of counsel access is vital to preserving existing attorney-client communications and relationships.  Moreover, it will reveal much about whether the court will accept the government's misguided arguments that the Judiciary should serve as little more than a rubber-stamp for the Executive's decision to imprison people at Guantanamo -- potentially for life -- without charge and without a meaningful hearing. <br /><br /><br /><em>Jonathan Hafetz directs litigation for the Liberty and National Security Project of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/hafetz.php" frameborder='

		<title>The Death Penalty for Child Rape: Why Texas May Help Louisiana</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Adam_Gershowitz.htm">Adam Gershowitz</a> of South Texas College of Law says the principal beneficiary of a new Texas child rape death penalty law will likely be the State of Louisiana, which may see its child rape statute transformed from an unconstitutional outlier to a constitutional model for the rest of the country...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/adamgershowitz.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>exas is on the cusp of becoming the sixth state to authorize the death penalty for child rape. Both the House and Senate have passed similar bills, and once the legislation is reconciled the Governor will surely sign it. Despite the enormous publicity, one question that remains unanswered is who will benefit from the new Texas statute.<br /><br />Defense attorneys are certainly not the beneficiaries, as they now have to contend not just with reviled clients but with the added pressure that comes with the possibility of a death sentence. And prosecutors, many of whom opposed the legislation, do not fare much better because it is possible (though disputed) that the availability of the death penalty will decrease reporting in family rape cases and will lead some perpetrators to kill their victims. Nor are the citizens of Texas the winners, because the new law makes death a possibility only for second-time offenders, with first offenders getting minimum sentences of 25 years in prison. Thus, it will likely be decades before the public sees someone sentenced to death (no less executed) for child rape in Texas.<br /><br />So who really wins from Texas&#39;s largely symbolic law (other, of course, than the politicians who enacted it)? The answer may well be the State of Louisiana. Although Texas will become the sixth state to authorize the death penalty for child rape, Louisiana (which, in 1995, became the first state to enact such a statute in modern times) is the only jurisdiction in the country that actually has sent a child rapist to death row. <br /><br />Patrick Kennedy was sentenced to death in 2003 in Louisiana for the despicable rape of his eight-year old stepdaughter. If his death sentence survives review by the Louisiana courts -- a substantial likelihood, given that the Louisiana Supreme Court indicated over a decade ago that it believes capital punishment for child rape is constitutional -- the United States Supreme Court will be forced to confront the question of whether a child rape statute is constitutional. (In 1977, the Court outlawed the death penalty for the "conventional" crime of rape, but stated fourteen separate times that its decision was limited to rape of an "adult" woman.)<br /><br />How will the Court decide whether it is constitutional for Louisiana to execute a child rapist? In determining whether capital punishment is permissible, the Court has looked to a number of factors (including international opinion and the gravity of the offense), but it has put the greatest emphasis on whether there is a "national consensus" in favor of the punishment. And it has determined the existence of a national consensus by nose-counting state legislatures and paying particular attention to whether there is a one-directional trend in legislative enactments.<br /><br />Thus, in 2002, the Court forbid the execution of the mentally retarded in large part because sixteen states that previously authorized such executions had abolished the practice over the past dozen years. In 2005, the Court forbid the execution of juveniles, in large part because of a one-directional change in which five states that had authorized juvenile executions had banned them in recent years. To be sure, the Court also relied on other factors in its mental retardation and juvenile execution cases, but its emphasis on national legislative trends was unmistakable.<br /><br />Which brings us back to the new Texas law and Louisiana&#39;s effort to execute Patrick Kennedy. The Texas law, though largely symbolic, is another notch in the national legislative trend authorizing capital punishment for child rapists. Once the Texas law is enacted, Texas will be the sixth state since 1995 to authorize capital punishment for child rape. This makes for a small, but certainly a one-directional, national trend. And indeed, the enactment of six child-rape statutes is a more pronounced change than the five-state trend that convinced the Supreme Court to ban the execution of juveniles only two years ago. <br /><br />Moreover, the trend is not likely to end with Texas. Given Texas's status as the nation's leader in capital punishment, the high-profile enactment of a child rape death-penalty statute may spur other states to change their own laws. At present, Alabama and Utah are considering similar legislation.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the new Texas law probably will not make Texas citizens any safer. It will bring no satisfaction to the vast majority of prosecutors across the state. And it may even raise the risk of homicide for child victims while decreasing the reporting of serious intra-family sex offenses. The benefit of the Texas statute, if there is one, will likely be for the State of Louisiana. Through no action of its own, Louisiana may sees its child rape statute transformed from an unconstitutional outlier to a constitutional model for the rest of the country. And while that may raise serious concerns about the soundness of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence, it should certainly require Louisiana to say thank you to Texas.<br /><br /><em>Adam Gershowitz teaches Criminal Procedure and a seminar on the death penalty at South Texas College of Law.</em><br />

		<title>A Lawyers&#039; Mutiny in Pakistan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that the suspension of Pakistan Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry has pushed the country&#39;s lawyers and top judge into an unprecedented confrontation with the executive power of President Pervez Musharraf...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhannew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font> lawyers' mutiny is making history in Pakistan.<br /><br />The sight of a "strong and honest" Chief Justice leading the nation's lawyers to oust a military ruler who seized power by removing a democratically elected government makes a fabulous story. The story is even more engaging because the national Parliament elected by the people is playing dead. And the two popular leaders (former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto) who could have led the masses in this urgency live happily in exile. <br /><br />The Parliament's failure to mediate the crisis has forced lawyers across the nation to stage a mutiny against what they call "the usurper of the ship," President Pervez Musharraf.  The lawyers are hoping that Musharraf and his crew will jump ship and float away, perhaps to bountiful America.   <br /><br /><strong>Hard Lawyering</strong> <br /><br />A senior Supreme Court advocate in Pakistan tells me that this is the first time in Pakistan's history that lawyers have dropped their conflicting political affiliations and forged an unprecedented professional unity to restore the rule of law.  More than 80,000 lawyers are acting in solidarity to challenge arbitrary powers that the President exercises on a regular basis with no constitutional authority. The suspension of the Chief Justice on March 9 was the President's most blatant act to intimidate the judiciary. The edifice of law cannot stand and the state cannot survive, says the senior advocate, when the President wearing the uniform of the Army Chief summons the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) into a military camp, grills the CJP in the presence of others including some generals, and then orders his suspension. This Presidential vaulting, I am told, is too much for the lawyers to let stand. <br /><br />In his petition to the Supreme Court challenging his suspension, the CJP paints the picture of an arrogant President who humiliated his person and his office - "crimes" tantamount to "the subversion of the Supreme Court." On summoning the CJP on March 9, the petition discloses, the President "fervently persuaded him to resign" and made a good many offers to sweeten the forced resignation. The President was "most upset" when the CJP refused to resign. A chain of punitive events followed. The CJP was first detained and prevented from leaving the office for several hours. Later, the CJP and his family were falsely imprisoned in their house. The telephone lines and television connections were cut off to isolate the CJP from the world. Even the Supreme Court brethren could not visit him. The CJP's cars were fork-lifted from his residential premises. On the order of the Supreme Judicial Council, which met the same day in "unholy haste," the CJP's entire staff was taken into custody, harassed, and interrogated. "What was the purpose," asks the CJP? <br /><br />These stories have stirred many of Pakistan&#39;s lawyers into hard action. The lawyers are protesting in the streets to mobilize a popular uprising against the President. They are making it difficult for the Parliament to grant another five years term to the President. They are petitioning the Supreme Court to force the President to leave even earlier.   <br /><br /><strong>Soft Dictatorship</strong><br /><br />Despite an engulfing wave of discontent in the legal profession, a few lawyers do support the President and argue that Musharraf is no tyrant. As a former commando, they say, Musharraf can handle tough assignments. As the President, he is a soft dictator who welcomes (manufactures) testing events to display his power and pragmatism. The Pakistani press, including television, has enjoyed more freedom under his soft authoritarianism than any other time since the creation of Pakistan. The opinion makers and newspaper editors freely trash his policies without hearing a knock at the door in the middle of the night. <br /><br />Even in the face of killings in Karachi associated with the Chief Justice's failed visit to the city, the President has refused to declare an emergency and suspend fundamental liberties, including the freedoms of speech and association - the rights that empower the lawyers to join hands and protest. The idea of soft dictatorship, perhaps the invention of his legendary legal advisor S.S. Pirzada, has worked well for eight years in lulling the people into political slumber. <br /><br />While the people and the Parliament are still unsure what to make of the crisis, the lawyers have pooled their resources to fight for a distinct legal objective -suspension annulment.<br /><br /><strong>Suspension Annulment</strong> <br /><br />Pakistan's leading lawyers are seeking the annulment of the CJP's suspension.  Soon after the suspension, there existed a small window of time in which the President himself could have undone the worst mistake of his rule. That option is no longer available. Twenty-three constitutional petitions have been filed with the Supreme Court, including the one by the CJP, challenging, among other things, the President's reference under Article 209 of the Constitution against the CJP, the formation of Supreme Judicial Council, and sending the CJP on forced leave and restricting his movements. A larger bench of 13 Justices has been established to rule on these petitions.     <br /><br />The CJP's suspension is indeed the most critical constitutional issue. Article 209 empowers the President to form an opinion on information received from any source that a Supreme Court Judge is incapable of performing the duties of his office or is guilty of misconduct. The President may direct the Supreme Judicial Council to inquire into the matter. Article 209 also provides procedures for the Supreme Judicial Council to conduct a hearing and report to the President that a Supreme Court Judge may be removed from office. Article 211 vests exclusive jurisdiction in the Supreme Judicial Council to decide the removal matters and bars "any court" from calling into question the Council's proceedings, its report to the President, or its recommendation for the removal of a Judge. These provisions seem to support the President's authority to initiate an action against a Supreme Court Judge. Nonetheless, Article 209 contains enough breathing space for the Supreme Court to find procedural loopholes and declare that the President acted without constitutional authority in suspending the CJP.<br /><br />If American realism is any guidance to court behavior, one may safely predict that the Supreme Court will annul the suspension and restore the CJP to office. This outcome is most likely because the lawyers of Pakistan will not be content with anything less. Furthermore, a Supreme Court Registrar has been murdered. The pro-government media have launched a campaign to malign some Justices of the Supreme Court in attempts to undermine the Court's credibility. In view of these facts, the Supreme Court is psychologically predisposed to act in self-defense and will annul the President's reference. <br /><br />The annulment is most likely to occur, however, because the constitutional petitions are not about the hermeneutics of Article 209 but about a colossal struggle between two primary institutions of Pakistan, the Armed Forces and the Judiciary. Since the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the Supreme Court has sided with the generals who overthrew political governments. The Supreme Court found innovative ways to legitimize military coup
s, including the one Musharraf staged in 1999. In all these constitutional cases, however, the fight has been between two governments, the military and the political. This time, the fight is between the Judiciary and the Armed Forces. This time, the Judiciary itself is under attack. It is unlikely that the Justices will subordinate themselves to the Generals. In his petition, the CJP prays the Court to annul the President's reference and raises a question that cannot be lightly ignored: &quot;If a contrary view is taken, which judge will then stand up to the executive?&quot; <br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan grew up in Pakistan and is a law graduate of Punjab University, Lahore.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.miami.edu/facadmin/faculty/svladeck.html">Stephen Vladeck</a> of the University of Miami School of Law says that for all the attention being paid to the trial of Jose Padilla, the proceeding will not address the critical legal question of whether the US government can subject one of its own citizens to indefinite military detention...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/stevevladecknew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he central problem with the federal criminal prosecution of one-time alleged "dirty bomber" Jose Padilla, now underway in Miami, is that the trial itself will not provide any resolution to the real question that the Padilla case has <em>always</em> raised: Whether the U.S. government can subject U.S. citizens arrested on U.S. soil to incommunicado military detention (and, allegedly, to mental and physical abuse while in military custody).<br /><br />The reason why the Padilla trial will provide no resolution of this fundamental question is simple enough: Federal district judge Marcia Cooke, who is presiding over the trial of Padilla and his two co-defendants, has made clear over a series of pre-trial rulings that Padilla's military detention is completely irrelevant for purposes of his criminal trial, so long as the government does not introduce any evidence obtained in conjunction with that detention. All too willing to comply, the government itself has embraced this bifurcated understanding of Padilla's confinement, going so far as to argue that the Justice Department cannot be held responsible for any unlawful actions of the Department of Defense &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; that the right hand simply can't be called to account for the actions of the left.<br /><br />Legally, Judge Cooke may well be correct. The government is not attempting to introduce evidence obtained from Padilla during his 1307-day stay in a South Carolina Navy brig, and so the question whether that detention (or any of the government's actions toward Padilla during it) was unlawful would not seem to implicate any aspect of the criminal charges Padilla now faces. In effect, then, the criminal case against Padilla has proceeded upon the theory that his "incarceration" began the day he was transferred to the custody of the Department of Justice in January 2006.<br /><br />But what about the previous three and a half years? <br /><br />The question of the legality of Padilla's military detention as an "enemy combatant" divided the four courts to consider it. In the first round of litigation, the Southern District of New York held in December 2002 that Padilla's detention was authorized, a decision reversed by the Second Circuit one year later. After the Supreme Court vacated the Second Circuit's decision on jurisdictional grounds and ordered Padilla to re-file his habeas petition in South Carolina, the South Carolina district court held that Padilla's detention was unlawful, only to be reversed by the Fourth Circuit in September 2005. And it was just before the merits of Padilla's case returned to the Supreme Court that the government indicted Padilla and sought to transfer him to civilian criminal custody, leading to the Supreme Court's divided decision to deny certiorari last April. As Justice Kennedy wrote for himself, Chief Justice Roberts, and Justice Stevens,<blockquote>In light of the previous changes in his custody status and the fact that nearly four years have passed since he first was detained, Padilla, it must be acknowledged, has a continuing concern that his status might be altered again. That concern, however, can be addressed if the necessity arises. Padilla is now being held pursuant to the control and supervision of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, pending trial of the criminal case. In the course of its supervision over Padilla's custody and trial the District Court will be obliged to afford him the protection, including the right to a speedy trial, guaranteed to all federal criminal defendants.</blockquote>In short, the Court would only consider the merits of Padilla's detention if the government sought to transfer Padilla back to military custody. Otherwise, the question was purely "hypothetical," at least according to Justice Kennedy.<br /><br />Thus far, at least, the government has given no indication of any intent to do so. Nor, I think, will it, irrespective of the verdict, for in the very next passage of his opinion concurring in the denial of certiorari, Justice Kennedy strongly hinted that any such action would be met with prompt judicial recourse, "to ensure that the office and purposes of the writ of habeas corpus are not compromised." Thus, in denying review, the Supreme Court seemed to make rather clear that the criminal trial is now the government's one shot at Jose Padilla, denying to Padilla, at the same time, a definitive answer to the legality of his military detention.<br /><br />If the courts were unwilling to resolve the legality of Padilla's detention once he was transferred to civilian criminal custody, and if the government never transfers Padilla back to military detention, the only remaining means for Padilla to obtain resolution of that question would be a damages lawsuit. But the Supreme Court has long recognized that damages suits are unavailable against federal officers when the law allegedly violated by the officer was not "clearly established." Given the split of authority on whether Padilla's detention was unlawful in the first place, it seems to follow that Padilla would have an extremely uphill battle in any future damages suit, whether he is acquitted of the present charges against him or not.<br /><br />That reality thereby renders much of what is to come in Padilla's trial anticlimactic. The outcome of the trial will not in any meaningful way shape subsequent resolution of the unresolved questions relating to Padilla's military detention. It also suggests why Padilla's case may be such a dangerous precedent whether Padilla is convicted or not. If the government can hold U.S. citizens in military detention up until the moment a court is set to rule against them&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;as most agree the Supreme Court was in the fall of 2005&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and then avoid that review by indicting the detainee, what is to stop it from employing similar tactics in future cases? <br /><br />Former Judge Luttig, who wrote the Fourth Circuit's opinion upholding Padilla's military detention in September 2005, wrote separately in December 2005 to express his concern at the message sent by the government's change in tactics:<blockquote>although the various facts [the government] has asserted are not necessarily inconsistent or without basis, its actions have left not only the impression that Padilla may have been held for these years, even if justifiably, by mistake&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;an impression we would have thought the government could ill afford to leave extant. They have left the impression that the government may even have come to the belief that the principle in reliance upon which it has detained Padilla for this time, that the President possesses the authority to detain enemy combatants who enter into this country for the purpose of attacking America and its citizens from within, can, in the end, yield to expediency with little or no cost to its conduct of the war against terror&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;an impression we would have thought the government likewise could ill afford to leave extant.</blockquote>Today, over five years after Padilla was initially arrested at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, these impressions remain. And they will still be present when Padilla's criminal trial is scheduled to conclude in August, whether he is convicted or not.<br /><br /><br /><em>Stephen Vladeck is a professor at the University of Miami School of Law; as of Fall 2007 he will

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist and former FBI Director William S. Sessions says that Governor Eliot Spitzer's recent proposal to expand the New York DNA database and an Ohio Supreme Court ruling liberalizing DNA testing for inmates should be welcomed as necessary and overdue efforts to protect public safety while pursuing meaningful justice, especially for prisoners facing the prospect of capital punishment... <br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/williamsessions.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>N</strong></font>ew York Governor Eliot Spitzer recently made headlines by announcing a plan to expand New York's DNA database to include genetic samples from those convicted of all felonies and most misdemeanors. The Governor's proposal &#8212; which would immediately increase the size of New York's database by at least twenty percent &#8212; would also require that samples be taken from all New Yorkers in prison, on probation or parole, or registered as sex offenders. A significant provision of the proposal would greatly expand the ability of inmates to obtain DNA testing that might prove their innocence. The Ohio Supreme Court addressed a similar issue this April when it struck down part of a state law that gave prosecutors control over which inmates were given DNA tests.<br /><br />Governor Spitzer's proposal and the Ohio Supreme Court's decision should both be welcomed as necessary and overdue efforts to protect public safety while pursuing meaningful justice.<br /><br />When I became Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1987, few in the criminal justice system knew much about DNA, and nobody fully understood how it would revolutionize our work. Shortly after I became Director the FBI established a DNA laboratory we hoped could be used to verify that a suspect had indeed committed a crime. During my years as a U.S. Attorney and federal judge in Texas I had seen rapists and murderers walk free for lack of biological evidence; these were the cases I had in mind when we established the laboratory in Washington, D.C.<br /><br />One such case, half a country away from my Texas office, haunted even the most hardened prosecutors. In the summer of 1973 Kathleen Ham was brutally raped at knifepoint in her Manhattan apartment. When a jury failed to convict her alleged attacker, her life was put on hold and her sense of justice forever diluted. At the FBI we hoped that DNA matching technology would allow us to solve cases like Ms. Ham's and bring some justice to victims whose attackers were tried but never convicted.<br /><br />By October 1988 the FBI's DNA lab had completed an analysis of biological evidence in 100 active cases. My colleagues and I anticipated that this federal initiative would enable local prosecutors to address questions that had previously been left unanswered. We were right, but not entirely in the manner we expected.<br /><br />The results of those first 100 tests astonished me. In thirty percent of cases the DNA gathered during the investigation did not match the DNA of the suspect. In three out of ten cases not only did we have the wrong person, but the guilty person was still at large. In capital cases the stakes were unnervingly high: the prospect of executing an innocent person was only slightly more appalling than the prospect of murderers and rapists walking free, unidentified and dangerous.<br /><br />The statistics today are roughly the same as they were 19 years ago. In approximately 25 percent of cases the genetic evidence recovered during an investigation does not match the DNA of the suspect. Oftentimes this discrepancy is discovered before irreparable harm is done to either the investigation or the suspect; however, too often we learn of our mistake only after time, money, and sometimes lives have been wasted on empty pursuits.<br /><br />DNA evidence has supported more than 30,000 prosecutions and has led to more than 200 exonerations, including those of fifteen death row inmates. This last group, Americans sentenced to die for crimes they did not commit, stands to gain the most from greater access to DNA evidence. Though most prosecutors are dedicated to the pursuit of justice, for years too many have hidden existing DNA evidence or denied reasonable requests for genetic testing. Granting death row inmates access to DNA testing should be only one of many steps taken to confirm the guilt of suspects of capital crimes; the finality of the death penalty demands that our dedication to honest justice be absolute.<br /><br />Governor Spitzer's plan and the Ohio Supreme Court's decision, both of which will allow more suspects and prisoners to obtain these genetic comparisons, should be welcomed by supporters and opponents of the death penalty alike. When more juries are able to consider genetic evidence that a suspect committed a crime, our neighborhoods will be safer places to live. When the wrongfully convicted are given every opportunity to exonerate themselves, our neighborhoods will be better and safer places to live.<br /><br />Some have objected to Governor Spitzer's plan and ones like it on the grounds that the storage and management of sensitive genetic information is too cumbersome a task to ensure the protection of an individual's personal information. Others have rightly taken issue with Governor Spitzer's proposed one-year limitation on challenges to convictions, except those based on newly-discovered evidence such as DNA.<br /><br />These concerns should not be used to arrest real progress. They should, however, be addressed as states continue to improve public safety and allow the wrongly convicted to exonerate themselves. To enable the pursuit of justice, we must work to craft legislation that will protect sensitive genetic information and give all prisoners' the right to challenge their convictions.<br /><br />I applaud both the New York proposal and the Ohio Supreme Court decision regarding DNA testing. However, much remains to be done to improve our country's criminal justice system, especially in capital cases. Reviews of state capital punishment systems have been ordered from the bench and governors' mansions around the country, and with good reason. I encourage state legislators considering systemic reforms to consider the recommendations of the Constitution Project's Death Penalty Committee, a bipartisan coalition of policy experts, legal scholars, and former government officials. The Committee includes opponents and supporters of capital punishment, and I have joined them in calling for substantive reform of how America tries and sentences suspects in capital cases. The delivery of justice also requires competent, well-trained, well-resourced lawyers for defendants in death penalty cases while simultaneously reserving capital punishment for only the most heinous of crimes.<br /><br />It took more than thirty years for justice to be done in Kathleen Ham's case. The same man the jury had failed to convict in 1973 was identified &#8212; in 2005 &#8212; by a persistent New York prosecutor who matched genetic material gathered during the original investigation to a sample in the FBI's national database. But for every story like Kathleen Ham's there is a story like Clarence Elkins'. Last year, Elkins, who served six years in an Ohio prison, was exonerated after DNA analysis &#8212; testing he was denied in 2002 &#8212; revealed another man had committed the murder for which he was convicted.<br /><br />These stories and other like them should serve as potent reminders that justice and safety are mutually reinforcing. Only by pursuing justice to all ends will justice ultimately be served.<br /><br /><br /><em>William S. Sessions is a partner at the Washington law firm of Holland &amp; Knight LLP and a member of the Constitution Project's Death Penalty Committee. Sessions previously served as the United States Attorney for the Western District
of Texas and as Chief Judge of the United States District Court for that district. He later served as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation under Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;09, files from <strong>Mumbai</strong>:<br /><br />One year ago today, July 11, 2006, a day Indians call 7/11 (or 11/7), seven coordinated blasts within fifteen minutes tore through rail cars on Mumbai&#39;s suburban railway <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5169332.stm">killing 187 people</a>. Nineteen suspects are to stand trial for the blasts at the end of this month.<br /><br />Today there were small, solemn memorials at train stations on which people laid thousands of red flowers. There was extra gun-wielding security in the stations. There were no anniversary explosions. Rather, the trains appeared crowded as ever, and life on the suburban railroad continued normal.<br /><br />Not that the suburban railway could ever be &quot;normal&quot; for an American lawyer. Even the Indian lawyers at my company refuse to ride the trains. When we go to court we take taxis that take an hour and a half through the grind of Mumbai traffic. A train would take only a half hour, but riding the train means having to struggle through the mean crush of people. It was never enjoyable, but I have ridden the train tens of times &#8212; each time without an Indian lawyer.<br /><br />Mumbai&#39;s suburban railroad is the most densely packed train network in the world, and it requires a certain willingness to trample people in order to get into or out of the cars where people are literally packed tighter than sardines. To avoid this crushing crowd, people hang out the doors, stand in window sills, and sit on the roofs dangerously close to the wires of the overhead power supply.<br /><br />Within days of last year&#39;s blasts, over three hundred suspects were <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/india-detains-hundreds-in-mumbai.php">rounded up</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/thirty-charged-in-mumbai-train.php">30 were charged</a>. Nineteen are to be <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/india-to-use-special-courts-for-mumbai.php">tried</a>.<br /><br />Justice moves slowly in India, and there is a huge backlog of court cases. Twenty-four million civil cases in the backlog is one estimate I&#39;ve heard. So the bombing suspects&#39; cases have been <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/india-to-use-special-courts-for-mumbai.php">put into special fast-track courts</a>. JURIST originally reported the trials would start last November, but even fast-track courts get delayed in India. The new estimate is that the trials will begin by the end of this month. The Mumbai police believe the bombings were orchestrated by a Pakistani militant group, Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT).<br /><br />-- Christine Chen, Singapore Management University &#39;08, contributed to this report<br />

		<title>INDIA: The Emergence and Acceptance of India&#039;s Famous PILs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;09, files from <strong>Mumbai</strong>:<br /><br />The directives and writs of PILs and the hearings of PILs in court are regular news in India today. The PIL movement was begun by the Supreme Court in 1978. The &#39;70s were a troubled time in the history of India, but the judiciary emerged from this period with new strength and legitimacy. PILs were a contributing factor. The public and the politicians began holding the courts in higher regard and even today continue to hold them so.<br /><br />The back and forth bickering between the government and the Court that defined the Court&#39;s early existence (see &quot;India: Judicially Independent&quot; entry below) effectively came to an end once it was clear that the Kesavanand Bharati basic structure doctrine, handed down by the Court in 1973, would not be overturned.<br /><br />The Prime Minister at the time, Indira Gandhi, placed the government under emergency rule two different times, and during the second emergency &#8212; now known as the Emergency &#8212; civil rights were trampled. Indira Gandhi&#39;s government emerged from the Emergency very unpopular.<br /><br />The government was never able to muster the strength to pass legislation to erase the basic structure doctrine. The Supreme Court with its new strength and legitimacy even upheld a lower court&#39;s ruling setting aside Ms. Gandhi&#39;s election during the Emergency.<br /><br />Perhaps surprising, especially when considering the fights that formerly took place between the government and the Court, India&#39;s activist judiciary currently receives little criticism or complaint about the legislative powers it exercises through PILs. Early this summer, the Indian Supreme Court issued a directive outlawing the hazing &#8212; called &quot;ragging&quot; in India &#8212; that senior students inflict upon junior students in Indian universities. Nothing more than murmurs uttered in hidden corners of editorial pages were heard about this legislative action.<br /><br />At least one commentator, S.P. Sathe, 6 <em>Wash. U. J.L. &amp; Pol&#39;y</em> 29, claims that the Indian people and even state and central governments and other governmental bodies believe that the courts are better arbiters between competing interests than are politicians. In a country infected by political corruption all the way from the central government down to village councils, this sounds like a fair claim. All in all, PILs are highly regarded and well accepted as part of Indian life, even if PILs provide the ways and means for the judiciary to usurp power from the legislature and even the executive.<br />

		<title>INDIA: Courts Definitely Activist</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Linge, Pitt law &#39;09, files from <strong>Mumbai</strong>:<br /><br />The Indian Supreme Court has made itself into possibly the most powerful apex court in the world. As addressed in &quot;India: Judicially Independent,&quot; below on this page, the Indian Supreme Court held in Kesavanand Bharati v. Kerala that the Court can strike down any constitutional amendment that alters the basic structure of the Constitution. Neither the House of Lords in England, nor the highest courts in Canada and Australia, nor the Supreme Court of the United States have this power.<br /><br />And with its huge competence, the Indian Supreme Court often legislates, directing society the way it sees fit through the so-called public interest litigations, or PILs. The Constitution makes the Supreme Court the guarantor of the fundamental rights of the people of India. However, the majority of Indians could be called ignorant and poor, and this majority population tends to not know their rights or even how to bring suits in court. PILs developed as a means for this majority population to also have access to the judiciary to receive redress for the violations of their rights.<br /><br />The key to the PILs is the relaxation of standing requirements. Nearly anyone can bring a PIL, even if the person bringing the suit wasn&#39;t personally wronged. In 1982 the Court declared that the judiciary does not exist to serve only the rich, and with PILs &quot;The portals of the Court are being thrown open to the poor and downtrodden.&quot; P.U.D.R. v. India. Social action groups such as Peoples Union for Civil Liberties and Peoples Union for Democratic Rights bring suits on behalf of underprivileged portions of society. Lawyers have initiated suits upon merely reading about incidents in the newspaper.<br /><br />Another key is that all formal pleading requirements are waived for PILs. The court famously began initiating suits upon receiving letters detailing abuses of rights. And the court has even allowed suits that complain of violations of basic human rights, in addition to the fundamental rights that are positively listed in the Constitution.<br /><br />With PILs the scope of mandamus was broadened. In one PIL mandamus was issued ordering the State to educate the children of prostitutes. In another PIL mandamus banned judges from taking post-retirement jobs in government agencies.<br /><br />The Court also issues directives in the course of PILs for appointing committees or requesting the government to carry out schemes. For instance, the Court directed a national bank to grant loans to rickshaw pullers and even created a whole scheme for the repayment of these loans. Directions issued in another case detailed how blood should be collected, stored, given for transfusion, and how blood transfusions could be made safe.<br /><br />Writs of mandamus and directives don&#39;t necessarily have to be legislative, but they often are. The legislation appears in court dicta, and the Court has held that the government and lower courts are bound by dicta.<br />

		<title>PHILIPPINES: The Migration Problem</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Wood, Pitt Law &#39;08, files from <strong>Manila</strong>:<br /><br />The Philippines is a fascinating place to spend the summer. The country is confronted with a constant and complex problem of migration, an issue that the government is struggling to solve. Well-educated Filipinos are flocking out of the country to seek better wages than they can find at home, with around 10% of the nation&#39;s population living and working abroad. People find more lucrative work in Dubai, Singapore, Taiwan, and a number of other countries (which, in turn, adds fuel to the fire of human trafficking...but that&#39;s a different story). But if asked their destination of choice, most would pick the USA if they could obtain a visa. The lines to get to the U.S. Embassy don&#39;t file down the street, as I am told they used to...but only because a change of policy now requires making an appointment in advance. The trend of migration for temporary work is nothing new in the Philippines; during the Marcos era the Philippines sent large numbers of workers to the middle east amidst the oil boom in the 1970s. The post-Marcos era saw high unemployment rates continue, and the government worked to both facilitate overseas work contracts that were safe for its citizens while at the same time trying to address the unemployment problems at home. No easy task, by any means. <br /><br />The impact of migration/labor export in the Philippines, however, is not just economic. It seems like every family you talk to has someone living abroad. The advantage for them is of course that those individuals almost always send money home. But this type of system, when it occurs on such a large scale, also can breed dependence, and a sense of hopelessness prevails with relation to the future and any effort to improve one&#39;s own country. Resentment, frustration, and despair are surprisingly evident, especially concerning a nation known for its happy, relaxed people. This is not to say that people aren&#39;t happy in the Philippines; rather, it is just to note that the effect of migration is a double edged sword. <br /><br />So what to do to improve the effects of migration? Like the issue of immigration in the U.S., there are no easy answers. The national government has made the migration issue a priority, and organizations abound that attempt to empower the locals to live, work, and prosper in their native country. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives play a huge role in corporations instituting micro-finance and other development programs. For example, I recently met a 30-something-year-old woman and recipient of a CSR micro-finance loan which allowed her to start a small restaurant (food stall) business where she earns a significantly higher salary than when she worked as a maid in Singapore. Plus, she is happier because she is able to be home and raise her children. In a country where only a handful of families own an overwhelming majority of the country, this type of program is promising. Still, a long road lies ahead to address the issue of migration on a large scale.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;09, files from <strong>Mumbai</strong>:<br /><br />While Pakistani Prime Minister Musharraf sacks Chief Justices who disagree with him, and while Bangladesh continues under emergency military rule, India&#39;s judiciary remains steadfastly independent. So steadfastly, in fact, the Indian Supreme Court has a history of making the Indian government very mad. Through India&#39;s 60 year history, the government has often found its agenda frustrated by the court&#39;s decisions, and almost just as often Parliament has amended the Constitution to overturn these decisions. There is no separation of powers doctrine in India.<br /><br />The fundamental right to property was unsurprisingly the impetus for much of the back and forth. The Indian Constitution as originally implemented in 1949 guaranteed Indians the fundamental right to own and dispose of property, and the Constitution is vested with original jurisdiction to enforce the fundamental rights. In 1950 the government sought to abolish a type of landlord system accidentally implemented by the British in 1793. As payment to these landlords, the government promised deferred compensation out of future profits. The landlords argued this wasn&#39;t just compensation. The high courts in multiple states agreed, and they ruled the government was infringing the landlords&#39; right to property. The government responded by adding a list, called the Ninth Schedule, to the Constitution containing certain land reform laws that would not be reviewable by the courts. The Supreme Court, in turn, held that Parliament could amend the Constitution like this, so long as it had a two-thirds majority.<br /><br />Parliament continued adding amendments with provisions forbidding judicial review, and the Supreme Court interpreted them narrowly. Other battles between the courts and government similarly ensued regarding affirmative action and nationalization projects. The landlords were back in 1967, arguing, inter alia, that it was unconstitutional for Parliament to create amendments that were beyond judicial review. The Court held, in Golak Nath v. State of Punjab, that from here on out no amendments could render fundamental rights unenforceable. This means no more could Parliament put land reform acts into schedules beyond judicial review. That is, until Parliament overruled the Golak Nath doctrine with a new amendment.<br /><br />Finally in 1973 today&#39;s prevailing doctrine was created. In <em>Kesavananda Barathi v. State of Kerala</em>, the Court held that Parliament had passed laws contravening the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the Constitution by seeking to remove the judiciary as the guardian of fundamental rights. Structural changes to the Constitution would from henceforth require a new constitutional assembly. Parliament responded by virtually writing the judiciary out of the Constitution with the 42nd Amendment. A new Parliament passed the 44th Amendment, which repealed the 42nd.<br /><br />The Basic Structure Doctrine prevails today because Parliament has been unable to amend it. It also helps, I&#39;m sure, that the 44th Amendment demoted the fundamental right to property to an ordinary right, meaning the Supreme Court no longer has original jurisdiction in cases where the right is infringed.<br />

		<title>INDIA: An Affirmative Action Micro-War</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;09, files from <strong>Mumbai</strong>:<br /><br />Outbursts of communal violence are common in India. There are Maoist insurgents in the jungles. There are 23 different separatist militias in the eastern hill states. And as I reported in prior weeks, agitated Sikhs have been violently protesting in the northwest and rural dwellers in West Bengal have been beaten by police. And most recently, demonstrations left 23 dead in the northwest as mobs encroached the suburbs of the capital Delhi. Demonstrating are the Gujjars, and what they want is better access to affirmative action.<br /><br />            Angry people fighting violently is such regular news here in India it barely warrants discussion by the water cooler at work. This fighting in the Delhi suburbs, which has since ceased, was the exception. The mob stopped trains, vandalized trains, cars and busses, and blocked major highways. Armed police sought to hold them off. More than the violence, what warranted the water cooler discussion was that the highways and railways from Mumbai to Delhi were closed.<br /><br />The Gujjars are a traditional class of shepards in the north and west of the country. They wish to be listed as an officially recognized tribal people, which would give them better access to affirmative action benefits. A rival tribe called the Meena is fiercely opposed to the Gujjars&#39; demands, and complicating this mini-war, the Meenas were fighting the Gujjars, even as police fought to keep the violence from Delhi. The protests chilled &#8212; and faded even further from water cooler discussion &#8212; after the national government in Delhi agreed to formally look into the Gujjars&#39; demands.<br /><br />            Among the fundamental rights listed in the Indian Constitution are prohibitions against discrimination that read a lot like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the United States. To paraphrase, the State shall not discriminate against any citizen, and no citizen shall be denied access to public places. There shall be equal opportunity for employment, public and private. However, nothing in these constitutional articles (Articles 15 and 16) shall prevent the State from taking measures to benefit traditionally underprivileged groups. In other words, affirmative action is written into the Constitution of India.<br /><br />            There are three different classifications for groups that have traditionally been deficient educationally and economically. Each of these three classes is allotted a certain quota in government employment, at state-funded schools and colleges, and in state and central legislatures. There are the Scheduled Castes (SCs), who are essentially the Dalits, formerly known as the Untouchables. There are the Scheduled Tribes (STs), who are physically isolated indigenous people living in forests and hills. And then there are the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) &#8212; usually people in the middle of the Hindu caste hierarchy who are not necessarily isolated but are educationally and economically backward.<br /><br />            The Gujjars are currently listed as an OBC but would prefer to be listed as an ST. There would be more reservations in the quota system for Gujjars if they were listed as an ST instead of an OBC. The rival Meenas currently occupy most of the ST quota reservations for the northwestern state of Rajasthan. The Meenas have been successful during their 53 years listed as an ST, and the Gujjars hope to achieve comparable success. Of course the Meenas are against the Gujjars being listed as an ST because then the Gujjars would be taking reservations away from the Meenas.<br /><br />            Getting listed in a schedule or switching from one list to another is not a transparent process, and the power lies in the central government. In theory it would be possible for the Gujjars to switch lists, but this being India, the Meenas have vowed to protest if this happens. Nevertheless, the central government says it will report back to the Gujjars in three months.<br /><br />            In the meantime, the tribal leader of the Gujjars has been charged with the murder of a police officer during the demonstrations.<br />

		<title>INDIA: A Lawyer&#039;s Life in Bombay</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;09, files from <strong>Mumbai</strong>:<br /><br />Settling in Mumbai after having spent my first quarter century in the U.S., I have quickly developed a new personal pricing index. What I mean is, a $4 lunch is now a rather expensive lunch. A one hour ride in an auto rickshaw for $3 &#8212; wow, that&#39;s a lot. And now that India&#39;s cheap prices have made me so stingy, the price of a Western lawyer&#39;s favorite drinks can really sting. A bottle of beer can easily double the cost of an average meal.<br /><br />Import tariffs for alcoholic beverages range from 150% to 550%, on top of local taxes. A bottle of domestic Scotch here goes for $5 but the real whisky (not whiskey) from Scotland starts at around $40. The U.S. and E.U. feel the pain of their expats, and have filed complaints in the W.T.O., asking for a legal review of India&#39;s spirit tariffs. Tariffs are not per se illegal under the W.T.O. agreements, but the W.T.O. Dispute Settlement Body could rule that India&#39;s spirit tariffs are illegally excessive.<br /><br />So maybe us snooty expat lawyers in India should go native and drink domestic? Drinking domestic is cheaper but still expensive by my Indian personal pricing index. The taxes levied on domestically produced beverages are around 100%. Kingfisher far and away dominates the domestic beer market, and a price of about $2.75 is usual at an average restaurant. Imported beers at the same restaurant will be nearly double this. One time I paid $7 for a Kingfisher at a nightclub. Because there is a brewery in India, Foster&#39;s &#8212; as in, &quot;Australian for beer&quot; &#8212; is not subject to the import duties and is always the same price as Kingfisher. Foster&#39;s is the second most-likely beer to be found a drink menu after Kingfisher.<br /><br />Still, by U.S. standards, $7 for a beer at a nightclub is not that bad, and neither is $2.75 at a restaurant. When I&#39;m saving so much money on food, I can&#39;t complain. Plus, it&#39;s so hot in my apartment, it&#39;s like getting a free sauna every night. And speaking of hot, unless you know the right shop or restaurant, your heavily-taxed red wine will be served at Mumbai room temperature, which is usually 90def F. Warm red wine, however, tastes better than I thought it would.<br />

		<title>KOSOVO: The Law Against Discrimination</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ryan Olden, Pitt Law &#39;10, files from <strong>Prishtina</strong>:<br /><br />The former Yugoslavia was a federal country comprised of many different ethnicities - Slovenes, Bosnians, Serbs, and Albanians and others. After the death of strongman Josip Tito in 1980, the federation began to break down as new leader Slobodan Milosevic tried to assert Serbian dominance. The inevitable result was the rampant civil war that rocked the rapidly-disintegrating country throughout the 1990s.<br /><br />During this tumultuous time, the region of Kosovo was stripped of its autonomy and the rights of the ethic-Albanian majority several curtailed. Albanian nationalism and corresponding resistance was met with a Serbian effort to drive Kosovar-Albanians from the region entirely in 1999. Lead by the United States, the West responded with a bombing campaign to force Serbian withdrawal and the creation of a United Nations protectorate in Kosovo, known as the UN Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK).<br /><br />Having learned first-hand how quickly discrimination can dissolve into bloodshed and chaos, the Assembly of Kosovo passed one of Europe&#39;s most progressive anti-discrimination laws in February of 2004. It precludes both private and public actors from discriminating on the basis of everything from race to political affiliation to sexual orientation. It also protects those with both physical and mental disabilities. The law applies not only to direct, but to indirect discrimination, segregation, and various forms of harassment. <br /><br />Among other groups, the law was designed to protect the region&#39;s ethnic minorities. Kosovo is roughly 92% ethnic Albanian. The rest is comprised of ethnic Serbs, Turks, Roma, and other groups such as the Ashkali and Gorani. Kosovar-Serbs continue to suffer reprisals not only from the 1999 conflict but also from centuries of mistrust between Albanians and Serbs throughout the Balkans. With the exception of the Turks, most other minorities in Kosovo have also suffered historical discrimination in Kosovo regardless of whether ethnic Albanians or Serbs have been in control.<br /><br />A few months ago, the Kosovar Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/kosovo-parliament-votes-for-un.php">voted 100-1 in favor of independence</a>. The vote does not carry international authority without approval of the UN Security Council, but, at the very least, some form of autonomy seems inevitable in the very near future as <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/western-powers-push-draft-resolution-to.php">Western powers continue to press for an independent Kosovo</a>. Additionally, the UN Interim Administration in Kosovo is starting to demobilize and dismantle, sending officers and staff home or to missions in other areas. UNMIK is also ceding consistently more of its authority and responsibilities to the native Kosovar government and European Union offices in the region. <br /><br />Because of the relative newness of the Law Against Discrimination, the local legal community is still familiarizing itself with the law&#39;s application procedures and many potential complaints remain unaware of their rights or that the law even exists. Due to the host of new tasks and challenges that independence would present, the Kosovar government and its UNMIK partners hope to move forward on this law as much as possible before greater autonomy becomes a reality.<br />

		<title>INDIA: The Indianization of Hollywood</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;09, files from <strong>Mumbai</strong>:<br /><br />            If you&#39;ve seen <em>Mission Impossible 2</em> you remember Tom Cruise hanging from the cliff by one arm. Chances are you&#39;ve never seen the Telugu-language version of the same film, where a fat, middle-age hero, Balayya, finds himself in the same predicament. Climbing the sheer mountain was going fine for Balayya until he risked his life to save a bunny stuck on the rock face. Slipping while saving the bunny, he ended up holding the bunny in one arm and hanging from the cliff by the other.<br /><br />            Copyright infringement of U.S. films seems to be rife in Indian cinema, but a successful prosecution has never been made. The bunny could make all the difference. Balayya&#39;s scene is obviously a direct rip-off of Tom Cruise&#39;s, but Tom Cruise, as I remember, did not save any bunnies. The addition of the bunny could keep the film from being a copyright infringer. <br /><br />            Much more famous than the Telugu-language films of &quot;Tollywood&quot; are the Hindi-language films of &quot;Bollywood&quot; (a forced conjunction of Hollywood with Bombay,  now Mumbai, where I am), and copyright infringement would seem to be just as flagrant in them. &quot;Indianized&quot; versions of Hollywood hits are a common occurrence in Bollywood. A director starts with a U.S. film script, pays low wages to a writer to scatter singing and dancing numbers throughout the movie, and an Indianized film is born. <em>My Best Friend&#39;s Wedding</em>, <em>Some Like it Hot</em>, and <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> have all been Indianized like this. It has been reported that eight of ten Bollywood scripts are &quot;inspired by&quot; Hollywood scripts.<br /><br />While Indian cinema is more star-driven and less script-driven, U.S. cinema is converse to this. Indian directors say they&#39;d rather use a proven a script and add the stars than to spend money to create a script from scratch that audiences might dislike.<br /><br />            India&#39;s Copyright Act of 1957, as amended in 1994, is thoroughly modern and in complete compliance with the TRIPS agreement, the part of the WTO protecting copyright. Yet there have been no successful prosecutions in Indian courts so far, and it is unlikely that future prosecutions would be either. Indian courts have held in the past that a work &quot;inspired by&quot; a copyrighted work is not necessarily an infringement. Adding bunnies and songs and dances could likely be enough to make the Indian film an original work of art in the eyes of the Indian courts.<br />The alternative to the Indian courts would be dispute resolution through the WTO. Through this mechanism the U.S. could impose punitive sanctions on India, but only if the U.S. can prove infringement has been allowed to take place.<br />

		<title>Sending Pakistan&#039;s Chief Justice on forced leave: an unconstitutional interim measure</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: &quot;In defending the suspension of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, Pakistan government lawyers must argue that President Pervez Musharraf has properly exercised his executive power under Article 209(5).  Assuming the President is authorized to refer the matter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), the question remains whether the Executive order to send the Chief Justice on forced leave (suspension) was an appropriate interim measure.  Article 209(5) is silent on interim measures that the President or the SJC may take while the latter investigates and hears the case. <br /><br />On this issue, the practices of the State of California Commission on Judicial Performance provide some guidance.  (California was the first state in the United States to set up a permanent body to oversee judicial misconduct. Now, all fifty states have comparable bodies.) The California Commission is authorized to receive complaints against California state judges from any one, including lawyers and litigants.  Each complaint, alleging an on-bench or off-bench abuse of authority, is &quot;carefully and thoroughly reviewed and investigated.&quot; <br /> <br />Before or during the investigation, the California Commission uses no interim measures to suspend a judge from office, seal his office, fire his staff, or send the judge on forced leave.  <br /><br />Only after the completion of the investigation <a href="http://cjp.ca.gov/2001cases.htm">may the Commission exercise none or one of the many available disciplinary options</a>.  It may close the case if allegations are found to be untrue or unprovable.  If the alleged misconduct is found to be true, removal is not the only option available to the Commission. The Commission may write a confidential advisory letter to the judge, expressing disapproval of the judge&#39;s conduct.  If the misconduct is serious, the Commission may still keep its findings confidential but issue a private admonishment, warning the judge that the conduct must not be repeated. This confidentiality is essential for maintaining the dignity of the judiciary in cases of minor breaches of proper judicial conduct. In more serious breaches, however, the Commission may go public and disclose its findings to the press and the general public.  The Commission may use either a public admonishment or a public censure to discipline the judge, depending on the nature and impact of the improper conduct.   Finally, in cases of persistent and pervasive misconduct, the Commission - following a hearing - may remove the judge from office. <br /><br />The Pakistan President&#39;s order to go public and suspend the Chief Justice - before any investigation by the SJC - falls under the definition of an interim measure.  The Constitution grants the President no such power.  The Constitution is also silent on the punitive options available to the SJC.  Article 209 seems to endorse an all or nothing approach.  After inquiring into the matter, the only punitive measure that the SJC may recommend to the President is the judge&#39;s removal from office.  It is hard to believe that the Constitution has preempted all lesser punitive options.  And it is hard to believe that the SJC must recommend removal even if the judicial misconduct is minor.<br /><br />Suppose - following a SJC hearing - the Chief Justice is found to have breached judicial conduct. Is it possible that the breach is not serious enough to require removal?  A lesser punitive option, such as confidential admonition or even public censure, might be a more befitting disciplinary measure.  Before a hearing, allegations of misconduct are no more than allegations.  And before a hearing, it is mere speculation to say that the alleged misconduct is so serious that the Chief Justice must be sent on forced leave and his office sealed.  In suspending the Chief Justice, the President has employed a constitutionally unavailable extreme interim measure.  In the words of Pakistan&#39;s gifted poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz: <em>Muqam Faiz rah main koi jucha hi nahin/ jo koyee yar se naiklee tu suay dar challe.</em> (O Faiz, at no place on the way did they even consider to stop or drop us /we were plucked from the beloved&#39;s bosom and sent straight to the gallows.)&quot;<br />

		<title>Independence for Kosovo?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/fulltime/damato/damato.html"><strong>Anthony D&#39;Amato</strong></a> [Northwestern University School of Law]: &quot;Russia is the only Western power that champions Serbia&#39;s territorial claim over Kosovo. All other nations want independence for the former Serbian province. As I argued in a <a href="/forumy/2007/03/kosovo-un-plans-human-rights-disaster.php">previous editorial</a> for JURIST on this subject, I see no basis whatsoever in law for the UN Security Council&#39;s assertion of power to dispose of Kosovo. Thus whatever Russia&#39;s real motives might be, I think that objectively it is taking a principled position. The Security Council simply must not be allowed to ignore the constraints imposed on its jurisdictional competence by the UN Charter.<br /><br /> International lawyers are familiar with many ways in which nations have acquired territory: discovery, prescription, abandonment, accretion, acquiescence, cession, effective occupation, estoppel, reversion, etc. The Security Council has come up with a new one: fly-by bombardment. <br /><br /> This gets us to today&#39;s offer. Apparently the UN is willing to extend its own deadline for independence for Kosovo by 120 days, to give more time for talks over Kosovo between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. However the US envoy Frank Wisner made it clear that independence for Kosovo is the only outcome that will be permitted.<br /><br /> So the critical question for everyone interested in the twists and turns of Balkan politics is: what will the Serbs and Albanians talk about? The one subject about which there is no point in discussing is the future of Kosovo. For the Albanians would have no incentive to discuss that particular subject inasmuch as they will get 100% of Kosovo at the end of the 120 days of talks. Maybe the delegations from Serbia and Kosovo can talk about the weather. Or cabbages and kings.<br /><br /> The 120-day talkathon seems born out of desperation. So long as the Western powers insist on a unitary Kosovo, the problem will not be solved. The only solution lies in a fair partition of Kosovo. My own view is that, at present, Kosovo belongs to Serbia. (None of the above-listed ways of land-grabbing can take away Serbia&#39;s title to Kosovo.) But Serbia&#39;s human-rights violations in Kosovo, led by President Milosevic, require compensation to be given to the ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo. As I argued in an essay about Bosnia, swapping land for human rights violations seems to fit in with the reprisals system of customary international law. Ironically, this solution gets us back to the 120-day talkfest &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; which might work without the Wisner codicil.&quot;<br />

		<title>Might President Musharraf do what Mahathir did?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: &quot;Pakistan&#39;s Supreme Court is most likely to declare that the Executive order to suspend Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry violates <a href="/hotline/#7485484370672888395">Articles 175(3) and 209(5) of the Constitution</a>.  If the Chief Justice is reinstated, the question remains whether President Musharraf will obey the Supreme Court.<br /><br />If Musharraf opts to follow the footsteps of the former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Muhammad, all bets are off.  In 1980s, Mahathir began to collide with the Malaysian Supreme Court, calling the judges &quot;black sheep who want to be fiercely independent.&quot;  Mahathir was frustrated over the Court&#39;s exercise of judicial review (as has been Musharraf over the suo moto activism of the Pakistan Supreme Court). The Lord President (Chief Justice) of the Malaysian Supreme Court, Tun Salleh Abbas , wrote a confidential letter to the Malaysian King on behalf of all the 20 judges of the Supreme and High Courts, expressing disappointment over Mahathir&#39;s rhetoric against the Judiciary.  In response, Mahathir suspended the Lord President and sent the reference to a judicial tribunal, chaired by a member of the Supreme Court.  The Lord President moved the Supreme Court to grant an injunction against the tribunal, which the Court did.  Mahathir fired the entire panel of five Justices who granted the injunction. Mahathir&#39;s supporters accused the Justices of spending public funds for buying luxury items.  The tribunal removed the Lord President, and the head of the tribunal assumed the office of the new Lord President. Although the Bar Council of Malaysia refused to recognize the new Lord President, the crisis dealt a severe blow to the independence of the Malaysian Judiciary. <br /><br />The facts surrounding the suspension of the two Chief Justices are intriguingly similar. It appears as if Mahathir has been whispering in Musharraf&#39;s ear. It seems unlikely, though, that Musharraf will suspend the 13 Justices of the Supreme Court.  Furthermore, the <a href="/forumy/2007/05/lawyers-mutiny-in-pakistan.php">lawyers&#39; protests </a>in Pakistan are much more forceful than the protests of the Malaysian Bar Council. And Chief Justice Chaudhry appears to have mustered much more public support than did Lord President Abbas. Most important, Mahathir was a popular Prime Minister and Malaysia was doing economically well under his leadership. Musharraf may also be counting on an improving economy for the final act of the play. After the Supreme Court verdict, the judicial crisis will fully ripen.  Musharraf will measure his popularity among the people.  If the polls show that a respectable majority of Pakistanis continue to support the government, Musharraf might ignore the Supreme Court&#39;s order to reinstate the Chief Justice.  In that case the President will win a battle to the detriment of larger national interests.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: &quot;President Musharraf is no King James I and Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry is no Chief Justice Edward Coke, but since Pakistan has been part of the British Empire and the common law traditions continue to inform the Pakistani legal system, a brief narrative of the tensions between James I and Chief Justice Coke might illuminate <a href="/forumy/2007/05/lawyers-mutiny-in-pakistan.php">the current executive-judiciary conflict in Pakistan</a>.<br /> <br />Soon after assuming the British throne in 1603, James I summoned the common law judges, led by Edward Coke, to instruct them not to interfere with the King&#39;s Will &amp; Authority.  James I strongly believed that the King ruled by divine right and was accountable to no man. Lord Coke mustered the courage to say: &quot;The King should not be under man, but under God and the Law.&quot; But for James I, a pagan at heart and divine on the throne, Coke&#39;s admonition did nothing to spoil the belief: &quot;That which pleases the king has the force of law.&quot;  At another occasion, when James I expressed a desire about hearing cases himself, Coke is reported to have suggested that the King, though highly gifted, had no legal training to decide questions of law. <a href="/hotline/#3900098700356694639"> (Does President Musharraf have the requisite legal training to exercise Article 209(5) Executive powers without expert advice?)</a><br /><br />James I&#39;s rule was filled with terrorism.  Many plots were hatched to kill the King. In the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, Guy Fawkes, a Protestant soldier (al Qaeda operator), was caught planting explosives in the House of Lords to kill the King, his family, and the ruling aristocracy.  In the 17th century Britain, it was treason even to imagine that the King had died.  As a zealous prosecutor, Coke sent Fawkes and co-conspirators to the gallows. In 1615, however, Justice Coke expressed doubts about the prosecution of a Puritan preacher for wishful treason. The preacher had expressed a theological wish in an undelivered sermon that God could strike the King with sudden death.<br /><br />In 1616, James 1 fired Chief Justice Coke for refusing to obey the King. <br /> <br />After his dismissal, Coke refused to fade away. He became politically active. In 1620, Coke was elected to the House of Commons where he continued to denounce the law that punished the people for dreaming that the king had died. In 1628, Coke authored the Petition of Right. The Petition demanded that the King refrain from arbitrary arrests and imposing martial law.  However, the Petition was addressed to King Charles 1 and not to James 1 who had died in 1625 from natural causes (dysentery).  Coke&#39;s commitment to the rule of law and the peoples&#39; rights inspired many founders of the American Revolution. And his Petition of Right was the forerunner of the U. S. Bill of Rights.  It is for the unfolding of such events that Shakespeare (Coke&#39;s contemporary) had said: <a href="/hotline/#7485484370672888395">&quot;There&#39;s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.&quot;</a><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: &quot;The suspension of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry provides a historic constitutional opportunity for the Pakistan Supreme Court to assert judicial independence. The preamble to the Constitution conceives Pakistan&#39;s legal order as a &quot;sacred trust . . . wherein the independence of the judiciary shall be fully secured.&quot; Despite this elegant language, the Constitution saddled the independence of the judiciary with a waiting period. <br /><br />Accordingly, <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part7.ch1.html">Article 175 </a>of the Constitution states: &quot;<em>The Judiciary shall be separated progressively from the Executive within fourteen years from the commencing day</em>.&quot; The original Article 175 allowed only five years for the proposed separation. General Zia ul Haq, who overthrew the political government in July 1977, amended Article 175 to extend the waiting period to fourteen years. Now, almost 34 years have passed since the commencing day of the Constitution, August 14, 1973.  The Supreme Court may take judicial notice of the fact whether the Executive order to suspend the Chief Justice is also, among other things, a violation of Article 175.<br /><br />Article 175 does not annul the President&#39;s constitutional power to direct an inquiry against a Supreme Court Justice&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;a power that the <a href="/hotline/2007/06/pakistan-presidents-flawed-opinion.php">President may judiciously exercise under Article 209. </a>The expiration of the fourteen years waiting period, however, has progressively weakened, if not exterminated, the Executive powers to control the Judiciary. During the waiting period, Article 209 could have been construed in favor of the Presidential power. After the expiration of the waiting period, however, the Presidential power to direct an inquiry against judges must be construed in favor of the independence of the Judiciary.  If the Supreme Court has doubts about the President&#39;s intentions, or if the Article 209 inquiry against the Chief Justice appears to weaken the independence of the Judiciary, the Executive order must fall. The nation-wide <a href="/forumy/2007/05/lawyers-mutiny-in-pakistan.php">lawyers&#39; protests</a> demonstrate that the Executive order to suspend the Chief Justice is broadly viewed as an assault on the independence of the Judiciary.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Glenn Sulmasy, a professor of law at the US Coast Guard Academy who made the <a href="/forumy/2006/05/national-security-court-natural.php">case for a US national security court</a> on JURIST a year before a recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/11/opinion/11katyal.html?ex=1341806400&en=05af7338d0f0eb92&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">op-ed</a> backing the proposal ran in the <em>New York Times</em>, says that implementing a new court system will provide new opportunities for success in the war on terrorism...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/glennsulmasy.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s Congress and the current administration struggle over how to proceed with the detention and adjudication of alleged jihadists imprisoned at Guantanamo, increased attention is being paid to the creation of a hybrid court to best meet the needs of policy makers, the Department of Defense, U. S. citizens, our allies and the detainees themselves.  Resolution of these concerns is increasingly important as the United States continues its war against al Qaeda.<br /><br />               Recently, both sides of the debate have become entrenched in two paradigms regarding the future of GTMO:  1) Factions in Congress want to gut the Military Commissions Act (MCA) and use the U.S. federal criminal system to try the alleged international terrorists and 2) Some in the administration and many conservatives want to preserve the original military commission process or the MCA and not change the existing structure.  The reality is that both sides are right; yet both sides are wrong.  As I have <a href="/forumy/2006/05/national-security-court-natural.php">previously written</a> in JURIST and elsewhere, the real answer, and most viable long term solution, is the creation of a national terrorist court system &#8212; similar to the FISA court.  <br /><br />This new national terrorist court could be created as part of an update to the FISA and its system.  FISA is outdated and antiquated as it was written in 1978 to address the conventional threat of the Soviet Union during the Cold War and can not confront the realities of the wars of the 21st century which mix law enforcement and warfare.  This type of war against international terrorism we are engaging in is new &#8212; and so is the ability for non-state actors to engage in sustained warfare against nation-states (with the capability to inflict massive damage including the use of WMD).  We must break away from three-decade-old paradigms and move forward to meet the new challenges of 21st century warfare.  Updating FISA and implementing a new court system will provide new opportunities for success.<br /><br />Guantanamo and the military commissions, historically effective and arguably lawful and in line with 20th Century Supreme Court precedent, have now become the focus of mounting criticism.  Although much of this criticism is often unfounded and without merit, it has de facto hampered our ability to be a leader in human rights issues worldwide.  The negative international reaction has hindered the exertion of our leadership in so many other areas where the world expects, and needs, U. S. assistance, resources and moral influence.  Since the war we are fighting is itself a hybrid, it is critical for policy makers to create a compromise out of the existing positions and consider a new court system as part of the debate.  A National Security Court (or Homeland Security Court) offers a system that will be permanent, balances the requirements of law and the successful prosecution of war, addresses human rights concerns, and permits the United States to focus on winning the war against al Qaeda.  Like the enemy and this "new" war, it would be a blend, taking the most relevant aspects of both our federal criminal system and the military commissions.  Briefly, the proposed court would include standing federal judges learned in intelligence law and the law of armed conflict, ensure the detention and trials for citizens and non-citizens could be conducted at military bases within the United States, provide military judge advocates as detainee defense counsel, and have the program run by the Department of Justice to ensure civilian oversight.<br /><br />It is important to note that others are now agreeing that this new, proposed system is worthy of consideration for policy makers struggling with what to do with these "warriors" or jihadists.  Andy McCarthy, senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies has written (in the <em>National Review</em> and elsewhere) and spoken extensively on the need for this new type of court.  Columnist Stuart Taylor, Jr. of the <em>National Journal</em> has written at least two pieces calling for these new courts, and recently, Professors Jack Goldsmith and Neal Katyal have written a <em>New York Times</em> op-ed declaring some form of a national security court is the best means to move the nation forward.  <br /><br />However, the creation of a National Security Court is not a course change or repudiation of what has been legally done for the past six years.  Additionally, these new courts should not be perceived as a victory for al Qaeda propaganda.  Rather, the new national security courts would be an evolution of the existing processes used for trying illegal combatants in times of war.  Warfare has changed, the enemy is different from those in the past, the means and methods to conduct warfare has changed radically, and now our system for detaining and trying these illegal belligerents needs to adapt to these new realities.  The enemy is unique in that they represent no nation-state or flag, but are instead warriors of an ideology.  The situation demands consideration must be given to morph the military commissions into "hybrid" national security courts.  Washington policy makers need to inject fresh ideas such as this new court system into their deliberations as the nation continues to fight al Qaeda around the world.<br /><br /><br /><em>Glenn Sulmasy is an associate professor of law at the U. S. Coast Guard Academy.  The views expressed herein are his own.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says it is a sad day for America when respected legal scholars writing in the <em>New York Times</em> are advocating a separate US judicial regime - what they call a &quot;national security court&quot; - to govern preventative detentions...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavis.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>fter reading an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/11/opinion/11katyal.html?ex=1341806400&en=05af7338d0f0eb92&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">op-ed</a> in the <em>New York Times</em> in which Jack Goldsmith and Neal Katyal propose as a bipartisan measure the creation by Congress of a &quot;Terrorists&#39; Court,&quot; I am compelled to comment. Goldsmith and Katyal say they are maling the proposal because, "Nearly six years after 9/11, the government's system for detaining terrorists without charge or trial has harmed the reputation of the United States, disrupted alliances, hurt us in the war of ideas with the Islamic world and been viewed skeptically by our own courts. " They go on to say that "The two of us have been on opposite sides of detention policy debates, but we believe that a bipartisan solution that reflects American values is possible. A sensible first step is for Congress to establish a comprehensive system of preventive detention that is overseen by a national security court composed of federal judges with life tenure."<br /><br />What a sad day! I am amazed! Law professors who are preventive detention advocates! A National Security Court! Have things gone this far in this country that people are really mulling seriously the merits of a preventive detention regime? Is the hysteria this crazy? <br /><br />I would ask all people of goodwill to take a quick look through the various cases that the federal courts have dismissed on state secret, federal officer immunity, political question etc. doctrines where people held in detention have complained of &quot;horrendous&quot; treatment and the courts have shown absolutely no interest in exploring those claims. I would ask you to look at the recent "standing" decision of the Court of Appeals in the <em>ACLU vs. NSA</em> case and recognize that, once an issue is presented in this environment in a national security context, if one complains the courts does not want to hear you as those fearful of having lost rights are not considered sufficiently harmed. All of those decisions have been made by eminent federal judges and the necklace of decisions from the perspective of vindication of basic rules of international law or constitutional law (as the lower court did in the case of <em>ACLU vs. NSA</em> but the Appeals Court did not) is terribly troubling. And with the decisions that appear to be shifting against the "little guy" in this term of the Supreme Court I as one am terribly concerned that ultimate appellate review will not be better.<br /><br />Might I suggest that this is a further iteration from the Presidential Military Order, through the CSRTs and MCAs, through centralizing in the DC Court of Appeal, now into a fourth mutation to keep moving the ball on what we are doing. It is like an intoxication with improvisation.<br /><br />Might I suggest that this idea be dismissed immediately. Might I suggest we do the hard work of getting back on track first. First, might I suggest that we hold the detainees that we have in accordance with our constitutional and international law obligations as traditionally understood for at least the past 60 years. Second, might I suggest that we close the black sites - permanently. Third, might I suggest that we end the extraordinary renditions for torture - permanently. Fourth, might I suggest that we close Guantanamo and place detainees in places similar to what we did stateside during World War II. Fifth, might I suggest that we not place people in black holes &#8212; ever and wherever. Sixth, might I suggest we comply with Geneva Conventions and other international law when we interrogate people. Seventh, might I suggest that to show the world we mean business we criminally prosecute in U.S. domestic courts our high-level civilians and generals who put in place this improvised horrendous system that is both unlawful and causing us this much damage.<br /><br />If we did those first seven things, I think we would go a long way towards rehabilitating America's reputation in the world which is the most serious obstacle to our being able to confront what is a dangerous enemy. Of course, people who went along to get along with these practices in and out of government will be made to look bad by such an effort &#8212; but we might focus more on what is good for America than the personal reputations of those who have led us down this primrose path to perdition.<br /><br />Beyond that, might I suggest that we scrap the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and related legislation that in my estimation reflects a thinly veiled attempt at amnesty of those who put in place the horrendous system. Might I suggest we step away from the effort to reinterpret international law obligations in domestic law to create a separate regime that does not really comply with international obligations. I hope you remember the testimony in Congress in favor of the Military Commission Act of 2006 where it was suggested that terms such as "outrages against personal dignity" in Common Article 3 were considered too vague. Might I suggest we turn away from these types of discussions and recognize the true intent was to receive permission to treat people we do not like in a horrendous manner. Might I suggest that we reject those who push that type of argument through playing on our fear &#8212; permanently.<br /><br />Might I suggest that we have a reasonable review of the status of persons of concern to determine whether they are POWs, security detainees, or civilians. Rather than a special court, if we do not trust the discretion of our leaders, might I suggest that Congress frame clearer language as to when people are to be released in the event that the "cessation of hostilities" type standard is considered too difficult to apply in a "War on Terrorism" of indeterminate scope and duration. <br /><br />Might I suggest that a national security court is really another phrase for what is called in French <em>un tribunal d'exception</em> a term that is heavy with connotations of Star Chamber justice. One of the great things about state courts of general jurisdiction or federal courts of limited jurisdiction is that they are open to everyone and have to operate in the light of day. Adjustments have to be made and can be made for given cases. We might spend more money on more courts to allow us to have the sufficient number of judges around to do the hard work of their role &#8212; but I would hesitate to create such an exceptional court, with exceptional rules, and exceptional powers, that will overtime not be the exception. <br /><br />Given the rarity of refusals of warrants in our experience with the FISA court that we have had over the past 6 year period, I am deeply concerned that a similar experience would happen with such a national security court. <br /><br />Maybe Jack Goldsmith and Neal Katyal are just too young to remember the kind of horrendous domestic activities of the CIA and others pre-1973 as described only partially in the recent "Family Jewels" release. But I and many Americans are not. I can remember persons denied even the most basic right to travel through the denial of a passport to Richard Wright for the most spurious of reasons. Who would be a security risk? Would Rosa Parks? How about Ramsey Clark? How about Martin Luther King? How about Stokely Carmichael? How about Malcolm X? How about any person whoever stood u
p and protested the security state? I think it is incredibly na&Atilde;&macr;ve to think that such a national security court could be kept in a limited role.<br /><br />I am not at all warmed by the appeal to American values, for we all know that is a dual edged sword. We have seen under the guise of American values efforts to maintain enshrine and enhance what could only be called domestic state terrorism against blacks in the South for so much of our history. We have seen a Senate that would not take up an anti-lynching law for so many years while people were lynched. We have seen waits of 40 years for persons to receive criminal prosecution of people who killed their brothers for expressing themselves during the civil rights movement, due to the unwillingness of state or federal prosecutors to do anything. In my lifetime, I have seen enough of the ebb and flow of American values on the issue of integration of blacks into society to understand that those values are not so stabilized and protective as such appeals would like to make us think.<br /><br />So please kill this idea immediately. Do the hard work of fixing the security state in the ways it has run off the rails. That hard work will earn the respect and credibility. Not another improvisation or cosmetic window dressing &#8212; I and many Americans I suspect are fatigued by these legal games. And let the chips fall where they may.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

Bush rejected congressional subpoenas for documents about the forced resignations of nine U.S. Attorneys who served in his administration. White House rejection of those subpoenas could spark a constitutional standoff between it and lawmakers. If Congress and the White House are to avoid a constitutional battle, they must work carefully together in finding common ground. <br /><br />On June 13, lawmakers served subpoenas on ex-White House Counsel Harriet Miers and former political director Sara Taylor for testimony and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten for documents related to the firings. The subpoenas' issuance ended three months of efforts by legislators and the White House to reach an agreement about the material sought.<br /><br />On March 20, the White House offered to have the staff privately interviewed without an "oath, transcript, subsequent testimony," or subpoenas' subsequent issuance. A few members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees would jointly perform the interviews that would be restricted to communications between the White House and individuals outside it, particularly legislators, regarding the nine dismissals. <br /><br />That day and over the ensuing three months, the chief executive and his aides have incessantly spoken of a "reasonable offer" and executive privilege, asserting that the president and those who succeed him need candor from high-ranking assistants. Mr. Bush and his spokespeople have pledged to resist Congress, in lawsuits if they must, over subpoenas and urged legislators to not politicize the controversy.<br /><br />From March 20 until today, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Representative John Conyers (D-Mich.), who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, have vociferously rejected the offer, contending that testimony must be under oath and with transcripts for real accountability. By March 22, the Senate and House Judiciary Committees had voted to authorize the issuance of subpoenas.<br /><br />The chairs have attempted numerous times to work with the White House on the testimony and documents requested. They have sent Mr. Bush multiple letters and participated in meetings to resolve disagreement. Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), the ranking GOP member, has also instituted several efforts to forge an accord. On June 13, after three months of endeavor to reach accommodation over the testimony and documents, the Judiciary panels voted to issue subpoenas.<br /><br />The June 28 White House response essentially threw down the gauntlet and racheted up the rhetoric. The White House Counsel asserted that issuing subpoenas and attempting to compel information's disclosure, rather than taking Mr. Bush's reasonable offer, have fomented confrontation. Press Secretary Tony Snow castigated lawmakers for apparently pursuing a strategy of "destruction." Senator Leahy criticized the White House for "Nixonian stonewalling," which evidenced further disdain for Congress. Representative Conyers correspondingly described executive privilege&#39;s assertion as &quot;unprecedented in its breadth and scope [and] reckless; it&#39;s a form of governmental lawlessness that is really astounding.&quot; If the White House fails to change course, this might force a constitutional confrontation, as legislators may attempt to enforce the subpoenas against White House officers.<br /><br />Both lawmakers and the White House should retreat from the constitutional edge and craft some agreement. For instance, legislators might take the private interview offer and ascertain whether the sessions yield enough, as Senator Specter recently proposed. For its part, the White House may think about witness testimony with transcripts but not oaths and keeping this material sealed for a prolonged time. If Congress and the White House creatively negotiate in good faith, they should be able to resolve the controversy. <br /><br />Not reaching agreement could be politically damaging to both sides. For example, attempting to have the federal judiciary hold White House officials in contempt of Congress will consume much time. Senator Specter admonished that failure to secure the information pursued will slow an already delayed investigation. The White House might concomitantly seem as if it is hiding material, should the administration continue resisting lawmakers' actions.<br /><br />Congress and the White House must promptly defuse the constitutional confrontation that is now brewing for the good of the government and the nation. Legislators and the president should reach an accord which permits him to foster White House interests and lawmakers to protect their valid concerns respecting U.S. Attorney hiring and firing. <br /><br /><br /><em>Carl Tobias is the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/tobias.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

The case of Prosecutor versus Alex Tamba Brima, Brima Bazzy Kamara, and Santige Borbor Kanu was about to start. For over two years we had been perfecting a solid case against them, the leadership of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council. I recall signing the indictment against each of them in 2003, my investigators arresting one as he staggered drunk down a road in Pujehun.<br /><br />On that day, the judges of the trial chamber entered the court room and after a few preliminary matters the presiding judge at the time said, "Mr. Prosecutor, your opening statement, please". I stood up, walking to the podium and began my accounting of the crimes for the trial chamber of what these seemingly ordinary men had done to Sierra Leone in a brief and horrific year, crimes that are not describable in any language. I carefully laid out the general allegations and the individual criminal responsibility of each. This was the third of three joint trials against the leadership of all the combatants in the bloody ten year conflict that destroyed not only Sierra Leone, but, with President Charles Taylor of Liberia, added and abetted by Muammar Khadafy of Libya and Blaise Campore of Burkina Faso, Liberia and portions of the Ivory Coast as well. With this trial the last of a 25 year joint criminal enterprise came to an end.<br /><br />A little over two years later, on June 20, 2007, that very trial chamber rendered their verdicts on the 14 counts of the joint indictment. Each was found guilty for 11 of those counts: Count 1 (acts of terrorism); Count 2 (collective punishment); Count 3 (extermination); Count 4 (murder, a crime against humanity); Count 5 (murder, a war crime); Count 6 (rape); Count 9 (outrages against personal dignity); Count 10 (physical violence, a war crime); Count 12 (conscripting or enlisting children under the age of 15 years into armed forces or groups, or using them to participate actively in hostilities); Count 13 (enslavement); and Count 14 (pillage).<br /><br />Behind each of these counts is a pain and suffering that can not be imagined. In Freetown they came out of the hills to the north and east sweeping the civilian populace before them in a two week orgy of rape, pillaging, murder, and mutilation. January 1999 will forever be etched in the memories of all West Africans as the month when the devil, in the guise of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council and their allies, the Revolutionary United Front, destroyed Freetown. Child soldiers roamed the streets dragging bloody burlap bags filled with severed hands, arms, and other body parts back to their commanders as directed. The "chop hand" units were busy during those monstrous three weeks.<br /><br />As I worked my way through the opening statement on that warm March day in 2005, I glanced over at these men, and I looked into their eyes. What I saw will haunt me for the rest of my life. Actually it's what I didn't see that will haunt me as I saw nothing, no soul, no humanity, nothing. When I turned over the remaining part of the opening statement to Boi Tai Stevens, a Sierra Leonean trial counsel in my office, I felt a chill, a chill that gripped my very soul. These weren't ordinary men, but something else.<br /><br />And so they have been tried, convicted, and await sentencing later this summer. It is anticipated that they will never see the light of a free day again. They represent all that is bad in mankind and for that they have been brought to justice. Justice for the rape victims, the amputees, the murdered, and the destroyed lives of thousands upon thousands of children, in some ways the greatest atrocity of all. <br /><br />They came out of the hills above Freetown, lawless, without mercy, bent on destruction. They will leave Freetown humbled before the law. Justice is never perfect, efficient, nor at times swift; but it surely can bring hope, some reconciliation for the victims, and the possibility of a sustainable peace. It is my fervent prayer that their trial will help bring that peace to the people of Sierra Leone. <br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

With the blessing of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the <a href="http://www.nlg.org/">National Lawyers Guild</a> was founded as a multi-racial alternative to the ABA. The Guild&#39;s founding members included the US attorney general, several judges, some congressmen, and the head of the National Labor Relations Board.<br /><br />Three years after the creation of the National Lawyers Guild, the FBI began to conduct secret surveillance of the Guild. From 1940 to 1975, the FBI wiretapped Guild phones, burglarized Guild offices, and sent informers into Guild meetings. The June 25 2007 <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/25/nyregion/25archives.html?ex=1340510400&en=cb7c9e52282b48ee&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">report</a> on the FBI&#39;s program of spying on the Guild omits FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover&#39;s primary rationale in undertaking this surveillance: &quot;to blunt the Guild&#39;s criticism of the FBI and, if possible, to destroy the organization,&quot; in the words of Michael Krinsky, one of the lawyers who filed the 1977 lawsuit against the FBI.<br /><br />The Guild, which provided legal support for the people, was a thorn in Hoover&#39;s side. In 1950, the Guild was about to release a big expos&Atilde;&copy; on the FBI, prepared by Yale law professor and ex-Guild president Thomas Emerson. No other organization was undertaking such a comprehensive criticism of the FBI. Through illegal wiretaps and informants the FBI learned of the Guild&#39;s impending report. In advance of the report&#39;s release, the FBI leveled a pre-emptive strike at the Guild by causing people in the press and the Senate to denounce the report. &quot;So the story became the Lawyers Guild, not the FBI,&quot; Krinsky said.<br /><br />The FBI asked Richard M. Nixon, a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), to call for an investigation of the Guild, on the eve of the release of the Guild report. The investigation led to the 1950 HUAC report titled, &quot;National Lawyers Guild: Legal Bulwark of the Communist Party.&quot; It concluded with a call to the attorney general to designate the National Lawyers Guild a &quot;subversive organization.&quot; The AG complied in 1953, but when no evidence to support the designation was forthcoming, he dropped it in 1958.<br /><br />From the 1950s through the early 1970s, the FBI continued to focus on the National Lawyers Guild. The FBI had a list called The Security Index, which identified people, including Guild leaders, to be rounded up in the event of a national emergency. <br /><br />Hoover&#39;s COINTELPRO (Counter-Intelligence Program) engaged in illegal surveillance of other organizations and individuals as well as the Guild. For example, in a program called Racial Matters, the FBI wiretapped Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#39;s hotel rooms and tried to drive him to divorce and suicide. Dr. King&#39;s voter registration campaign and especially his vocal opposition to the Vietnam War incurred the wrath of J. Edgar Hoover, who went after Dr. King with a vengeance. Groups such as the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES) were also on Hoover&#39;s surveillance list.<br /><br />The revelation of President Richard Nixon&#39;s illegal surveillance of groups opposed to his policies as well as hearings by a select Senate committee chaired by Senator Frank Church led to the enactment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and other curbs on the power of the FBI and the CIA. Today we are faced with President George W. Bush&#39;s secret domestic spying program, which, as I explain in my book, <em>Cowboy Republic: Six Ways the Bush Gang Has Defied the Law</em>, violates not only FISA, but the Fourth Amendment as well. <br /><br />Bush&#39;s predecessors illegally targeted those who criticized their policies, under the guise of fighting communism. Bush&#39;s rationale for bending the Constitution is fighting terrorism, but his attacks are leveled at dissenters.<br /><br />The HUAC report and the AG&#39;s designation of the Guild not only violated the Constitution; they nearly succeeded in destroying the organization. Membership in the Guild fell to about 300 members. But the Guild survived and today it boasts nearly 6,000 members.<br /><br />Members of the National Lawyers Guild continue to work beside those who struggle for economic, racial and sexual equality, and against imperial wars and occupations. I&#39;m proud to have been a Guild member for more than half of its 70-year life.<br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and president of the National Lawyers Guild. Her new book, </em>Cowboy Republic: Six Ways the Bush Gang Has Defied the Law<em>, will be published in July. Her articles are archived at <a href="http://www.marjoriecohn.com">http://www.marjoriecohn.com/</a></em><br />

General Taguba was ordered to conduct an investigation into the abuse by the then commander in Iraq, Lieutenant General Sanchez, after General Sanchez became aware of the allegations of widespread detainee abuse at the prison.  In the interview, General Taguba makes a number of very serious and troubling claims about the limits of the investigation and about the failure of any investigation to date to fully examine the role of the senior military and civilian leadership's knowledge of and involvement in creating the conditions that led to the detainee abuse.<br /><br />Particularly troubling is General Taguba's revelations that he was given very specific limits as to what he was authorized to investigate, and that he was specifically prevented from investigating the conduct and involvement of higher military and civilian authorities outside of the Military Police Brigade responsible for security at the prison. General Taguba suspected that the military intelligence interrogators at the prison were in some instances operating outside of the established chain of command in Iraq and were in fact being guided on the conduct of aggressive interrogations from other sources, perhaps from within Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's office.<br /><br />General Taguba's investigation was not the only official investigation into the causes of the detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib and other locations, and other investigations have looked beyond the conduct of the soldiers in the Military Police Brigade at Abu Ghraib.  Nevertheless, General Taguba's revelations raise some very troubling issues that, if they are not resolved, mean that the military and civilian leadership have learned nothing from the Abu Ghraib scandal.<br /><br />First and foremost, General Taguba's statements show that it is not too late in the day for Congress to order and conduct an independent investigation into the causes of the detainee abuse.  All of the investigations to date have been conducted under the authority of the Department of Defense. When allegations are raised that the policies and directives of the Secretary of Defense and other senior civilian and military officials within the Department may have contributed to the detainee abuse, an outside investigation is the only way to ensure a complete and accurate assessment.  <br /><br />General Taguba's revelations also point to the inability of the military, and in this case the Army, to apply any standard of command responsibility to senior leaders.  To date, only the lower ranking enlisted soldiers have faced courts-martial proceedings for their conduct at Abu Ghraib.  While the Abu Ghraib scandal has quietly ended the careers of a number of senior military officers, ironically including General Taguba's for his truthful reporting, there has yet to be a full accounting.  As General Taguba points out, even today there are senior civilian and military leaders that bear some responsibility and who should be held accountable.  One primary reason for the failure to hold the military leadership accountable is that the Uniform Code of Military Justice provides no legal standard of command responsibility by which the conduct of senior military commanders can be accurately and fairly evaluated.  It is long past time to adopt such a standard.   <br /><br />Importantly, the events surrounding the abuses at Abu Ghraib reflect more than a failure of military command responsibility&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;they also reflect a failure of Congress to exercise its constitutional authority to prevent such incidents.  The evidence seems clear that the civilian leaders at Defense knew more about the abuses than they were willing to admit, and Congress refused to press the matter.  But it should not have got to that point to begin with.  While the President has undeniable authority to exercise authority in making battlefield decisions, as a constitutional matter, Congress controls the President&#39;s ability to commit the nation to war and controls the means by which wars are fought through regulation of the armed forces and the appropriations power.  <br /><br />Indeed, the Constitution expressly authorizes the Congress, among other things, to "provide for the common Defense," U.S. Const., Art. I, &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 1; to raise and support armies, see id. &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 12, and to "make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces," see id. &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 14. The President, on the other hand, has the authority to see "that the Laws [are] faithfully executed," Art. II, &Acirc;&#167; 3, and to serve as the Commander-in-Chief, see id. &Acirc;&#167; 2, cl. 2. These textual commitments of authority and responsibility demonstrate that the President does not have exclusive authority over matters related to foreign affairs and national security, particularly not regulation of the country's armed forces and the direction of such forces when they are not engaged in traditional military operations. <br /><br />Regardless of the deference Congress has shown Presidents in times of war, it would not be unconstitutional for Congress to condition military spending with the requirement that the President regularly report to Congress on the military's intelligence-gathering techniques and efforts. The President has elected to use the military for intelligence-gathering off the battlefield, but that does not mean those activities can or should escape Congressional oversight.  This form of accountability would not impede the President&#39;s ability to defend the nation in times of crisis, and it would ensure that the civilian leaders who control our armed forces comply with the laws of war and whatever domestic regulations Congress deems appropriate, like a prohibition on the use of torture.  <br /><br />In respect to Abu Ghraib, the failure of command responsibility did not end with the members of the military who made questionable choices when it came to intelligence-gathering tactics.  Rather, that failure extended all the way to the President who, through his executive officers, allowed such tactics to be used, and the Congress that refused to exercise its power to ensure that the United States, in fighting the war on terror and the war in Iraq, would do so effectively.  As we have seen the respect for the nation's efforts in the war on terror diminish in correlation with the revelations of Abu Ghraib, for the United States to be effective, Congress must ensure that the military operates as consistently as possible, in the words of General Taguba, with the laws of war, the Geneva conventions, the core of military values, and the system of accountability established by the Constitution.  Congress, in short, must ensure that the United States no less than those it holds in contempt respects the rule of law.<br /><br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps and currently teaches courses in criminal law at New England School of La

		<title>PHILIPPINES: Enforcing Environmental Laws</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Wood, Pitt Law &#39;08, files from <strong>Manila</strong>:<br /><br />The Philippines has a number of laws on the books that are geared towards protecting the environment, but effective enforcement of those laws is another story. This fact is evident in the aquarium fishing industry. The Philippines is one of the world&#39;s leading exporters of ornamental fish. Destructive fishing and over-fishing, including the use of cyanide in collecting aquarium fishes poses a significant threat to the marine environment, which is extremely diverse in the Philippines. <br /><br />For example, the Verde Passage Marine Corridor, located about 2 hours south of Manila, was recently found to contain the richest biodiversity of marine shorefish in the world. The Indo-Malaya-Philippines Archipelago (IMPA) has long been considered the area of highest marine biodiversity in the world. There is a higher concentration of marine species per unit area in the Verde Passage in the Philippines than anywhere else in the IMPA. Hence, the Verde Passage Marine Corridor, home to over 1700 marine species, has recently been dubbed the &quot;center of marine shore fish biodiversity in the world&quot; by a world renowned scientist and expert on marine fishes. <br /><br />Still, the use of destructive fishing methods such as the use of cyanide and other toxic substances continues and threatens the marine environment. The toxins are spread among the corals, stunning the fish for easy collection. In the process, corals &#8212; living organisms in and of themselves &#8212; are damaged and killed. The problems posed by cyanide use are widely known, and laws exist that are intended to regulate the situation. For example, Section 88 of the Philippine Fisheries Code addresses cyanide and other noxious chemicals in the same manner as dynamite fishing. The most significant problem, however, is the lack of enforcement of the law.<br /><br />An ineffective enforcement scheme exists on paper that requires fishermen to stop at a Cyanide Detection Test Center before they sell their fish to an exporter. Enforcement within this scheme requires better equipment as well as an enforcement strategy that continues a multifaceted approach but needs to emphasize regulation at the exporter level if enforcement is to succeed. Improved equipment, which the national government&#39;s Cyanide Detection Test Center has proposed they need, would enable cyanide testing in the laboratory to be significantly more effective. Even with adequate equipment, however, fishermen often bypass the legally required stop at the CDT center and go straight to the exporters. While enforcement is encouraged at all levels, the most effective way to remedy and manage these violations is at the exporter level because there are far fewer exporters than there are fishermen. The exporters are required to obtain a cyanide-free certification for every batch of fish they purchase, and if this requirement is enforced at the exporter level the fishermen will necessarily have to follow suit. <br /><br />In addition to the emphasis placed on enforcement at the exporter level, a multifaceted approach should be continued and the best current model is that provided by the Marine Aquarium Council (MAC), an international NGO with a strong presence in the Philippines and the Verde Island Passage. An approach that integrates the various concerned stakeholders is necessary to achieve a successful legal framework. Identifying the problem &#8212; the destruction caused by cyanide &#8212; and raising awareness among the stakeholders including the fishermen who use cyanide is a start, but it is not enough. As noted before, most fishermen are aware of the problem. If the law is to act as a deterrent, an effective enforcement strategy is necessary.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>INDIA: Can Legal Jobs Be Outsourced?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;09, files from <strong>Mumbai</strong>:<br /><br />Currently I am a law student. In the future I want to be a lawyer &#8212; that is, employed as a lawyer. There are a lot of voices, however, including my school&#39;s career services department, telling me the difficulty in this. Too many want to be lawyers, and there just aren&#39;t enough jobs (students: for a depressing read, check <a href="http://barelylegalblog.blogspot.com">this site</a>).<br /> <br />Now could it also be true that these supposedly scarce lawyer jobs are being outsourced to India? Well, yes, kind of. However, the risk India poses seems, in my Indian legal experience, more apocryphal than truly dire. Most outsourced jobs are of the paralegal and secretarial variety.<br /> <br />There&#39;s no doubt politicians play up outsourcing&#39;s threat to American jobs. John Kerry said business executives who outsourced work were &quot;Benedict Arnold C.E.O.s&quot; And there&#39;s no doubt that some U.S. legal work is being done in India. An appellate brief prepared in India by a legal processing outsourcing (LPC) company was submitted to the Supreme Court in 2005. The issue of the case was whether an I.R.S. provision violated the Fifth Amendment&#39;s Due Process Clause.<br /> <br />After all, outsourcing often does makes economic sense. Labor in India tends to be cheaper, and India offers tax breaks to foreign companies who outsource to her soil. The outsourcing of legal work began over ten years ago when law firms began establishing subsidiaries to scan and index documents in India. In 2001 General Electric established an in-house legal office in India where Indian lawyers handled issues with G.E.&#39;s plastics and consumer finance divisions. There now exist even third-party vendors who can provide Indians to perform general legal office work. Some of these vendors even employ Indian lawyers, some even trained in the U.S.<br /> <br />Silicon Valley law firms have been hiring Indian companies to write and review patent applications. Complicated, high-tech patent applications can cost between $8,000 and $10,000 to file in the Midwest and up to $12,000 in Silicon Valley. The same job can be done in India for $5000 to $6000. Scientists and engineers, two fields where India is particularly skilled, do much of the work. Even in the U.S. this work is often contracted (or outsourced, if you will) to on-shore scientists and engineers.<br /> <br />A pitfall of this outsourcing model is how much training an Indian needs in order to perform American legal work. Even highly educated Indians need expensive training, even for relatively un-complex legal work. Professionals in the field have reported that elitely-educated Indian lawyers can take as long to train as non-lawyers from modest backgrounds.<br /> <br />Despite this one major pitfall, outsourcing to India sounds, on paper at least, enticing. Indian legal education is done in English. India&#39;s constitution and legal system are based on English common law, as is the U.S. The rule of law draws largely on U.S. constitutional principles with American case law often cited in court opinions. With the technology outsourcing boom already underway in India, India is a fairly wired country. Plus, Indian schools are generally producing more well-educated graduates than India can provide jobs.<br /> <br />And yet despite these enticements, there is just little evidence that the outsourcing of lawyer jobs to India is contributing to the legal job crunch that law school career services says exists. One study says there is <a href="http://www.llrx.com/features/legaloutsourcing.htm">&quot;more smoke than fire,&quot;</a>, and proof of this is the rate that the previously mentioned third party outsourcing firms are going out of business. Also there is no consolidation in this industry, which typically accompanies fast growth industries.<br /> <br />From my own experience, India&#39;s corporate sector is growing so fast, as are its needs for in house and out of house counsel, it is difficult for me to believe that this corporate growth would have any difficulty in swallowing (and paying well) the Indian law professionals who would otherwise be available to work as outsourced labor.<br />

		<title>INDIA: Troubles with Pharmaceuticals and IPRs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;09, files from <strong>Mumbai</strong>:<br /><br />The cruel irony is that the most pressing diseases are the ones that don&#39;t make money. Multinational pharmaceutical corporations from the United States and Europe can rake in the profits selling drugs that treat rich world diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and, if it can actually be called a disease, erectile dysfunction. Even middle class Indians are now buying drugs for these diseases.<br /> <br />The drafters of independent India&#39;s patent laws have always had the poor in mind when drafting, yet even after sea changes in India&#39;s patent laws, getting drugs to the poor remains a challenge. Nearly every day a Mumbai lawyer confronts on his way to and from work someone crippled by what I usually guess was polio. The most painful to behold would probably be the men pushing themselves by their knuckles on ground-hugging carts along the pavement, their lifeless and skinny legs twisted over their shoulders. Luckier beggars can at least stand with the help of crutches.<br /> <br />Until the early 1990s India was famously protectionist, and an industry she jealously guarded was her generic drug industry. While pharmaceutical product patents had previously not been forbidden, the India Patents Act, 1970, made it so that the patenting of &quot;substances intended for use, or capable of being used, as food or as medicine or drug&quot; would receive no patent protection. Among the results of this patent law was the success of India&#39;s generic pharmaceutical industry &#8212; where Indian companies copy drugs invented in the West &#8212; and the lowering of drug prices in India.<br /> <br />It was expected that this generics industry would facilitate much-needed drugs reaching the poor Indian masses. An unintended result was that the brightest Indians did not stay in India to develop new drugs. They emigrated to the U.S. and Europe where their inventions were protected by enforceable patent laws. Indian pharmaceutical manufacturers ended up earning profits by selling their generic drugs to nations with lax IP enforcement like Yemen and Sudan. They also sold (and continue to sell today) their generics in Western nations, taking their chances with these legal systems, a high risk, high reward game. Another cruel irony is that the poor Indian masses were just apparently not profitable enough markets.<br /> <br />But fact was, as long as the drugs were consumed in India, sold to countries that did not recognize foreign pharmaceutical patents, or banned from importation into Western countries by their courts, India was not a pirate nation. She was living legally, and her scientists &#8212; those whose brains hadn&#39;t drained west &#8212; were becoming experts in reverse engineering and not in inventing original drug molecules.<br /> <br />The playing field for India&#39;s pharmaceutical industry is much altered today. India joined the WTO on January 1, 1995, and was thus obliged to amend her IPR laws to be in accordance with the TRIPS agreement by the end of a ten-year transition period. This meant pharmaceutical products would need to be patentable subject matter, and India amended the Patents Act accordingly in 2005.<br /> <br />There does not appear to be evidence that drug prices have skyrocketed or even risen since the patent law amendments. India&#39;s government has promised price controls so that prices of certain essential drugs do not rise too high anyway. It also doesn&#39;t appear that a wave of life saving drugs is sweeping the Indian countryside. It does appear that Western multinational drug companies are now more comfortable collaborating with Indian drug firms and more comfortable performing research and development in India. Furthermore, India&#39;s generic drug industry continues to function, manufacturing generics of drugs whose patents have expired, or by manufacturing generics and taking chances in foreign legal environments.<br /> <br />And amongst all the talk about new patent laws, India&#39;s poor have not been entirely forgotten. In hopeful sounding developments, non-profit groups underwritten by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Doctors Without Borders, and others, are working to develop drugs to fight the neglected diseases of the poor world. One of these groups, the Institute for OneWorld Health, has actually developed to fruition a drug called paromomycin that has proven to be an effective cure for black fever, the world&#39;s second largest parasitic killer after malaria. Paromomycin has been approved in India and could potentially eradicate the disease.<br />

		<title>PHILIPPINES: Anti-terrorism Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Wood, Pitt Law &#39;08, files from <strong>Manila</strong>:<br /><br />As governments around the world work hard to implement legislation to aid in fighting terrorism, some common effects of such legislation are predictable and even inevitable; it is the nature of any anti-terrorism measure to both empower the executive branch and detract from civil rights.  People are often willing to sacrifice some of their freedoms if they believe that it is necessary to achieve peace.  But for many Filipinos, the Human Security Act of 2007 shares a concern common to much of the country&#39;s legislation: the threat of abuse by the executive power.  The Catholic Bishops&#39; Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and civil rights groups have called for the government to revisit the legislation, and address potential areas of abuse.  <br /><br />The Philippine government has responded to the criticism by preparing to launch public campaigns supporting the anti-terrorism measure to raise awareness of the benefits it will yield.  The Arroyo administration has chosen to forego the calls of civil rights groups, and is urging people to accept the potential flaws of the Act and just trust them.  As Secretary Ignacio Bunye said in an official statement, &quot;Rather than criticizing government for lapses in a law that has yet to be implemented, let us join hands in fighting terror.&quot;  But isn&#39;t this the point of legislative debate in a democracy? To be sure that enacted legislation will best serve the people?<br /><br />It would be hard to argue that some form of anti-terrorism legislation is not needed in the Philippines.  Terrorism is very real here; the presence of extremist groups such as the Abu Sayyaf is the prime example.  Daily updates in the newspapers follow developments in the recent kidnapping of an Italian Priest in the south of the country.  Most recently 14 Filipino marines who attempted to rescue him were <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/11/asia/AS-GEN-Philippines-Muslim-Rebels.php ">killed</a>. Also recently, last month the US ambassador paid $10 million USD to four members of the Abu Sayyaf who provided information leading to the <a href="http://philippinecommentary.blogspot.com/2005/10/debating-anti-terrorism-bill.html ">death of two terrorist leaders</a>. <br /><br />Opponents of the anti-terrorism law do not deny that terrorism exists and should be combated, but they suggest that the scope of the law should be limited so that references to ethnic and political minorities are eliminated.  For example, the Communist Party of the Philippines and its guerilla wing, the New Peoples&#39; Army, would be at high risk of being added to the terror list, and depending on who you talk to, this is arguably a good thing.  But what about the individuals that are merely suspected of being affiliated with such groups?  And what about political opponents that fear the law will be misused to persecute them for voicing dissenting political views?  In a country where many feel helpless and lack faith and trust in their President, the civil rights implications are huge.  As a local human rights lawyer recently told me when comparing the US to the Philippines, &quot;Even if one disagrees with the Bush administration, I would trust Bush a hundred times more than Arroyo or any other developing country&#39;s leader when it comes to enforcement of the law and the potential abuse of power.&quot;  With the Act set to be implemented this Sunday, the near future should be very telling for human rights and the rule of law in the Philippines.<br />

		<title>KOSOVO: The Push for Independence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mary E. Gibson, Pitt Law &#39;08, files from <strong>Prishtina</strong>:<br /><br />Independence for Kosovo is nothing new &#8212; independence fervor did not begin in 1998 when conflicts escalated from Slobodan Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225;&#39;s ethnic cleansing of Albanians. Rather, it&#39;s been fermenting since before the Ottoman Empire&#39;s victory at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Kosovar-Albanians believed independence could have been achieved this summer but those hopes sank after the latest G8 Summit, a UN Security Council meeting, George W. Bush&#39;s visit to Albania, and Vladimir Putin&#39;s visit to Washington.  It now seems that despite a <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/russia-rejects-latest-un-independence.php">new UN draft on Kosovo&#39;s status</a>, which eliminated definite plans for independence, Russia, a veto-carrying member of the UN Security Council, still may not be satisfied with the situation.<br /><br />In the meantime, Kosovo - a Serbian province comprised of over 90% Albanians - will continue to be <a href="http://www.unmikonline.org/constframework.htm">administered by the United Nations</a>.  But how long can this arrangement be sustained?  In terms of local grassroots politics, there are groups representing both sides of the independence issue and at the end of June, both sides were heard through their public demonstrations.  June 28th, the anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo &#8212; a battle celebrated by the Serbians and an anniversary date used by leaders, such as Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; in 1989, to rally people in favor of a greater Serbia, provided a backdrop for the anti-independence movement.  The ancient battlefield was papered with posters stating that Kosovo is a part of Serbia and Kosovo will return to Serbia.  Two days later, the <a href="http://vetevendosje.org">Vetevendosje</a>, a group advocating self determination for Kosovo, countered the June 28th anniversary with a protest of their own through the streets of Pristina, Kosovo&#39;s capital city.  The group performed skits that critiqued the status talks and presented symbolic acts, such as raising the Albanian flag that confirmed their ethnic heritage. <br /><br />While independence for Kosovo is a contentious issue within the region and the world, Kosovo&#39;s provisional self-government continues to look toward independence, as evident by their vote of <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/kosovo-parliament-votes-for-un.php">100-1</a> in support of an independent Kosovar state.  Members of the <a href="http://www.assembly-kosova.org/?krye=home&lang=en">Assembly of Kosovo</a> are hard at work laying legal foundations through laws ranging from the economy to social welfare.  Despite the preparation and some initial implementation, people and businesses hesitate to rely on the Assembly&#39;s progress because of Kosovo&#39;s uncertain status.  If the international community could agreed to a definite plan for Kosovo&#39;s future, people in the region would be encouraged to further build their economy.  <br /><br />For almost all Albanians, Kosovo rejoining Serbia is no longer an option.  Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225;&#39;s endorsement of ethnic cleansing in the 1990s and the <a href="http://www.srs.org.yu">Serbian Radical Party&#39;s</a> current support for suppressing the Albanians in Kosovo would not provide an environment where democracy would flourish.  Even though there have been pockets of Albanian retaliation against the Serbians after the 1999 conflict, none of those actions were government sponsored.  While actions by a group of angry people are not excusable, the provisional self-government has been working to end the violence through government sponsored programs and <a href="/dateline/2007/06/kosovo-law-against-discrimination.php">anti-discrimination acts</a>.   <br /><br />Other countries were carved from the former Yugoslavia, and Kosovo could be seen as following in that pre-established path to independence.  However, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina were all considered republics under Yugoslavia, while Kosovo was only considered a province.  Kosovo&#39;s province status did provide for greater powers, which included a seat at the Federal Presidency, and that autonomy could be seen as a stepping stone for an independent state.<br /><br />Today, many Albanians in Kosovo try to focus on the future and not on the past, despite the recent atrocities.  Time may heal all wounds, but without news from the international community concerning Kosovo&#39;s status, the general population and the provisional self-government may press harder for answers.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: In his latest 9/11 (2007) video message, Osama bin Laden has supposedly said: &quot;O&#39; Americans, Muslims will continue to kill you unless you embrace Islam.&quot; Even if this message is authentic, which I doubt, Islam allows no such notion of jihad. This is the worst possible way to invite non-Muslims to Islam, contrary to the Quran&#39;s commandment: <em>Sura an-Nahl </em>(The Bee) 16:125.<br /><br />Islam rejects all conceptions of holy war. Muslims are not allowed to engage in any aggressive war to spread Islam or to impose its faith or laws on others. Muslims do not believe that God is at war with Satan, nor that He needs human help to win this battle. Any such belief is contrary to God&#39;s Unity and Sovereignty. God is above all human conflicts, and He has no conflict with Satan or any other force in the universe. God is Supreme and in complete control of all things that exist or belong to the world of the unknown. Wars occur when human beings shun the path of peaceful spirituality and pursue their inclinations for warfare. Muslims are permitted to enter the battlefield to fight oppression and occupation. While a religion of peace and spiritual submission, Islam is also a pragmatic religion that recognizes the existence of nations with corrupt ideologies of <em>shahawaat</em> and predation. Against such nations, Muslims are utmost vigilant. But coercive or coerced faith is no part of Islam. Americans are free to live according to their own values.<br /><br />For a fuller discussion, <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=952797">read </a><br />

		<title>Al Majid trial a farce, Iraqi criminal justice system inadequate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/"><strong>Giovanni Di Stefano</strong></a> [lawyer for Ali Hassan Al Majid, dubbed &quot;Chemical Ali&quot;, <a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com">Studio Legale Internazionale</a>, Rome]: &quot;The case of Al Majid can be summarized by the following phrase that he uttered in my presence to the Iraqi High Tribunal Judge when <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/saddam-deputy-al-majid-sentenced-to.php">sentenced to death</a>: &#39;thank God now I can have you judges out of my hair&#39;. The Anfal Trial was and remains a trial contrary to natural justice and like the Saddam Hussein trial criticised by all and sundry. The Trial Judge refused a number of applications to admit probative evidence of an exculpatory nature and the outcome was already pre-designated. We were told two months prior to the conclusion of the proceedings (I was told March 8th 2007 in Baghdad) that three would be executed, one acquitted and one jailed for life. If counsel is notified prior to the conclusion of a trial the outcome it becomes an absurdity proceeding and a farce. <br /><br />No doubt Al Majid will be executed shortly and no doubt all and sundry will indeed petition the Iraqi Government to stay the execution. Iraq is not ready to assume the responsibility of its criminal justice system. Its venue is not safe and thus any decision by the judiciary unsafe and subject to scrutiny. I have pleaded that trials be presided by International Judges but to date those pleas have fallen on barren ground. So long as the status continues any outcome from any trial will remain unsafe if not unfair. Al Majid though remains in high spirits and has not allowed the decision to change his daily agenda retaining his dignity. In the meantime Tariq Aziz and Humad Humadi remain in custody without charge in excess of four years. Fortunately ex-air force commander Hashim Rija Shlah was recently released after four years without charge and without an apology. He will make no application for compensation for wrongful arrest. No such procedure exists in Iraq.&quot;<br />

The President of Pakistan), a unanimous Supreme Court of 13 Justices has declared that the President&#39;s Order to suspend the Chief Justice is <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/sub_links/pr-1/Chief%20Justice%20Press%20Release.htm">&quot;ultra vires of the Constitution . . . and passed without lawful authority.&quot;</a>   Three Justices have held that the President has the constitutional authority to file a reference.  However, the Court unanimously set aside both the orders of the President and the Supreme Judicial Council to restrain the Chief Justice from acting as a judge of the Supreme Court. <br /><br />This is a bold decision, one in which Pakistan&#39;s entire legal community can take pride.  The lawyers&#39; support was indispensable for this decision. Pakistan&#39;s legal system has taken a giant step toward integrity, self-respect, and credibility. The Supreme Court can now hold its head high in judicial communities of the world, showing the way to judiciaries in the Muslim world that a right decision can be made through peaceful advocacy in a court of law.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a> of New England School of Law says that the recent acquittal of Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Jordan of Abu Ghraib abuse charges reflects a structural failure to adequately incorporate the principle of command responsibility into the US Uniform Code of Military Justice...<br /><hr size=1><br /><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></b></font>he acquittal of Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Jordan on charges relating to the abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison is being roundly criticized as a failure by the military to hold senior officials accountable in the detainee abuse scandal. Much of this criticism focuses on a perceived lack of will to hold senior military and civilian officials accountable for their role in the detainee abuse. There is little doubt that the Bush Administration is not keen to affix responsibility on military and civilian leaders within the Department of Defense for carrying out aggressive interrogation techniques which the Administration itself developed. <br /><br />There is, however, another reason why the case against Lieutenant Colonel Jordan ultimately failed and why the military has been unable to hold more senior military leaders accountable. The reason is quite simply that under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) there is no adequate mechanism to hold commanders and supervisors criminally accountable for the law of war violations committed by forces under their command. To be sure, if a commander ordered, directed, participated in, or otherwise facilitated the detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib, there are adequate provisions under the UCMJ to affix criminal liability. The fact is, however, that there is simply not sufficient evidence to show that commanders and senior officers engaged in this kind of criminal conduct, hence, the acquittal of Lieutenant Colonel Jordan on these charges.<br /><br />The more important question is what type of criminal responsibility attaches to a commander who has a duty to control the forces under his command and fails in that duty? What of the Commander for example who does not know, but under the circumstances should have known about detainee abuse? The criminal law concepts of accomplice liability, conspiracy, and the like do not get at these cases, because there is no evidence of shared intent between the commander and the offending forces. <br /><br />At least since the end of WWII, the law has recognized that gap and filled the breach by creating the doctrine of command responsibility. Under this doctrine, liability can be imposed on a commander for the law of war violations committed by his forces, if the commander failed in his duty to prevent, suppress or punish war crimes. The United States was one of the strongest proponents of this doctrine in international law and the doctrine was used successfully in a number of war crimes prosecutions at the conclusion of WWII. Since that time, the doctrine has gained the status of customary international law and has been codified in a number of international treaties and statutes. Interestingly, the doctrine was also codified by the United States in the recently passed Military Commissions Act.<br /><br />Inexplicably, the doctrine has escaped codification under the UCMJ. The consequences of the failure to incorporate this doctrine could not be more obvious. For all intents and purposes, the military prosecutions arising out of Abu Ghraib are over. The only people successfully court-martialed for their role in the abuse were eleven enlisted soldiers. Lieutenant Colonel Jordan was the only officer to face court-martial charges for his involvement in abuse and he was acquitted. This acquittal came not because a panel of senior officers was unwilling to hold a fellow officer accountable for his conduct. The acquittal came because the military lacks the legal tools necessary to bring someone in Lieutenant Colonel Jordan's situation to account for his failings. <br /><br />It is long past time for Congress to amend the UCMJ and fully incorporate the doctrine of command responsibility. Incorporation of this doctrine will serve a number of important ends. It will create a clear standard by which to evaluate the conduct of military commanders, as well as give strong legal incentives to commanders to ensure that their forces are obeying the law of war, particularly when those forces are involved in high risk activities, like detainee operations. The doctrine will also create equity in the criminal justice system so that enlisted solders are not the only ones called to account for their failings. And most importantly, it will recognize that the authority of command carries with it an equally important responsibility. Many times it is the military commander alone who can prevent forces under his command from committing war crimes. <br /><br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps and currently teaches at New England School of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that the Pakistan government&#39;s deportation of ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif in the wake of his attempted return from exile raises important legal and constitutional question and reflects the Bush administration&#39;s disinterest in defending democracy in the Muslim world...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n August 10, Pakistan&#39;s former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who had come from London to campaign for the restoration of democracy, was rudely deported to Saudi Arabia within hours of his arrival at the Islamabad airport.  The deportation decision came from General Pervez Musharraf, who had ousted the Sharif government in a successful 1999 military coup.  At the time of the coup, Sharif was unpopular for a variety of reasons, including his distaste for any checks on powers of the parliament and his exuberance for unregulated markets.  Sharif was charged with crimes of corruption.  After spending months in prison, Sharif allegedly plea bargained his way out of the criminal cases. He entered into an exile agreement, promising not to return to Pakistan for a period of 10 years.  Saudi Arabia, which brokered the deal, offered asylum to the ousted prime minister.   <br /><br />The exile agreement and Sharif&#39;s deportation raise serious plea bargaining and constitutional questions. These questions also put in doubt the US commitment to democracy in the Muslim world. <br /><br /><strong>Plea Bargain Questions</strong><br /> <br />In defending Sharif&#39;s deportation, the Musharraf government argues that Sharif has breached the terms of his contractual exile and &quot;that, from now onwards, no friendly state or individual would ever believe any verbal or written agreement of Nawaz Sharif.&quot; A day before Sharif&#39;s arrival in Pakistan, the Saudi intelligence chief met with Musharraf for more than two hours.  The intelligence chief later announced in an open press conference that Sharif was bound under the exile agreement not to return to Pakistan before 2010. <br /><br />The contractual arguments made to defend Sharif&#39;s deportation are part secular and part Islamic. The secular argument emphasizes the logic of plea bargain -- a type of contract that the defendant makes with the government to avoid prosecution of criminal charges.  Instead of spending years in prison upon conviction, the argument goes, Sharif bargained to be exiled to Jeddah, where the Sharif family operates extensive business and maintains a lavish mansion known as Sharif Palace.  This secular argument draws support from Islamic norms under which Muslims are obligated to faithfully perform agreements.  &quot;And (truly pious are) they who keep their promises whenever they promise,&quot; says the <em>Quran</em> (2: 177).  In criticizing Sharif for his premature return to Pakistan, Musharraf makes the secular argument whereas the Saudis make the Islamic argument.<br /><br />Upon scrutiny, however, these contract-based arguments are far from persuasive.  Unlike the United States, where plea bargaining is the primary method for the disposal of criminal cases, Pakistan does not subscribe to plea bargaining as a lawful method for determining guilt and meting out punishments.  Sharif&#39;s plea bargaining was contrary to the laws of Pakistan and its enforcement is tantamount to punishing unproven guilt procured under pressure.  Furthermore, Sharif&#39;s plea bargaining was conducted without legal safeguards and judicial supervision considered indispensable in plea bargain cases. A plea bargain negotiated in a prison cell has no validity under any rule of law.  <br /><br />The Islamic argument for the enforcement of the exile agreement is even more problematic. The Quran does mandate the performance of contracts; and, exiling is a lawful punishment.  Under Islamic law, however, agreements must be voluntary and transparent.  Agreements obtained through coercion are invalid. A marriage contract, for example, is invalid if spousal consent is not freely given. Even a commercial bargain is set aside if made under confusing and less than transparent circumstances. <br /><br /> Sharif&#39;s exile agreement was neither voluntary nor transparent.  General Musharraf coerced Sharif to leave the country so that his military rule would face no popular resistance.  It is unclear whether the exile agreement was ever reduced to writing. There is no evidence that Sharif signed the exile agreement. The circumstances surrounding the agreement are muddled, not transparent.  Under Islamic law, therefore, the exile agreement will be considered dubious and unenforceable.    <br /><br /><strong>Constitutional Questions</strong> <br /><br />Notwithstanding the exile agreement, the Pakistan Supreme Court in a constitutional petition decided that Sharif has the constitutional right to return to Pakistan. In its concise order, the Supreme Court relied on Article 15 of the Constitution to declare that Sharif as a citizen of Pakistan has &quot;an inalienable right to enter and remain in country&quot; and that his constitutional right to return &quot;shall not be restrained, hampered, or obstructed by the Federal or Provincial government agencies, in any manner.&quot;  Rightfully assuming that the Court has overridden the exile agreement, Sharif returned to Pakistan. <br /><br />The Musharraf government has complied with only one part of the Supreme Court Order. It let Sharif enter the country but refused to let him stay. The Supreme Court Order recognizes two distinct rights protected under Article 15 of the Constitution. The first right empowers the citizen to return to Pakistan.  The second right confers on the citizen the option to remain in Pakistan.  Under Article 15, the citizen&#39;s freedom of movement may be restricted by law in the public interest. However, the Article imposes no restrictions whatever on the right to remain in Pakistan.  Hence Sharif enjoys an unqualified right to remain in Pakistan, even though the government may restrict his movements for a credible public interest reason.  Ignoring the Constitution and the Supreme Court Order, the deportation subverts Sharif's fundamental right to remain in the country.  The deportation also denies the people of Pakistan the opportunity to find out whether Sharif committed any crimes while in power.  <br /><br /><strong>American Response</strong><br /> <br />For most Pakistanis, the US response to Sharif&#39;s deportation is disappointing.  Unlike the European Union, which has asked Musharraf to respect the Supreme Court Order, the Bush administration has dodged the issue.  The Bush administration argues that the Sharif deportation is Pakistan's internal matter. This non-interventionist argument, in addition to sounding hypocritical, lends approval to deportation.  The Bush administration's alliance with Musharraf is contrary to American interests and values. It is not even smart because Musharraf has reached the end of his rope. The alliance with a military dictator offers one more proof that the Bush administration has no serious interest in defending democracy in the Muslim world. <br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan grew up in Pakistan and is a law graduate of Punjab University, Lahore.

		<title>9/11 and the Road Not Taken</title>

Foley</a> of Drexel University College of Law says that on the sixth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, we should remember that the US government has steadfastly refused to allow investigations that might locate individual blame for this massive security failure...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/brianfoleyleft.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>fter major tragedies there are two investigative roads to take in trying to prevent a repeat: determining whether people or policies are to blame. Blaming people entails asking whether the disaster resulted from people failing to design or execute a proper preventive policy ("human error"). Blaming policy entails asking whether the policy failed either because the risk was not foreseeable, or because the harm simply cannot be prevented ("act of God"). Both roads should be taken. <br /><br />After 9/11, however, the nation raced headlong into blaming policy alone. The prevailing view was stated by then-National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice in May, 2002: "I don&#39;t think anybody could have predicted that these people would &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; try to use an airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile." But such danger had been imagined, years earlier. For example, in 1994, terrorists hijacked a French airliner seeking to crash it into the Eiffel Tower. Tom Clancy's best-selling novel <em>Debt of Honor</em> (1994) ends with a Japanese airline pilot crashing his 747 into the U.S. Capitol (pp. 985-86). President Clinton and his staff also understood that an airplane could be used as a missile after a suicidal man piloted a Cessna into the White House lawn, just below the president's bedroom, in the early hours of September 12, 1994.<br /><br />That policy, not people, was blamed was also suggested by how, after 9/11, no one appears to have been fired or disciplined, and no one resigned in disgrace. Indeed, some of those most closely responsible for our defense were actually promoted or rewarded. Dr. Rice became Secretary of State. General Ralph Eberhart, the head of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which appears to have breached its duty to intercept hijacked aircraft on 9/11, kept his job and was later named head of the new Northern Command as well as NORAD. After having resigned as CIA Director, George Tenet received a Presidential Medal of Freedom in December, 2004.<br /><br />The prevailing give-our-leaders-a-pass feeling was summed up by Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA), who said on CNN's CROSSFIRE on December 10, 2001, when asked whether President Clinton shared blame for the attacks, "I think the blame game is a waste of time. This crowd was in power for nine months before 9/11. But I would prefer to say there were good people with inadequate tools. We are fixing the tools now, and we&#39;ll fix the problem." That the people were "good," of course, begged what should have been a major question after 9/11.<br /><br />Blaming policy alone prompted President Bush and Vice President Cheney, the following month, to personally ask then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle to limit Congressional investigation into the attacks. They said that a wide inquiry would divert resources from the war on terror. The House and Senate Intelligence Committees did conduct a combined investigation, but the resulting report, Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, was limited to "review the actions of the Intelligence Community, and was limited to approximately one year's duration." <em>Joint Inquiry Report</em>, Part I, p. 1. The Joint Inquiry's 20 recommendations dealt with policy matters concerning only the Intelligence Community. But how credible are recommendations that come from a committee wearing blinders?<br /><br />Similarly, the decision to blame policy alone was evident in the preface to the 9/11 Commission's report: "Our aim has not been to assign individual blame." <em>The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States</em> xvi (2004). Indeed, the president and vice president initially refused to speak to the 9/11 Commission, as if to suggest there was no need to investigate any officials' actions. They ultimately did meet with the Commission but insisted on being interviewed together, not under oath, and without having their testimony recorded or transcribed. Former President Clinton and Vice President Gore also spoke to the Commission without taking oaths but testified separately, and their testimony was recorded. These conditions might have compromised the Commission's fact-finding. <br /><br />It's therefore no surprise that the U.S. response to 9/11 was new policies &#8212; overall, more power to the president and less oversight from Congress, courts, and citizens. The argument for our yielding such power to the president was based in large part on the premise that 9/11 could not have been prevented using existing powers. The policies, however, do not appear to have been well thought out:<ol><li>Unrestricted, secret surveillance of U.S. citizens. Even if increasing government surveillance power is necessary to prevent future attacks, unchecked surveillance by the Executive, revealed in late 2005, is most likely unnecessary, and dangerous to democracy. The risk of blackmail and abuse that arises when the government can rummage through sensitive personal information of political enemies was revealed in the era of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and President Richard Nixon.<br /><br /><li>Guantanamo, which has relegated the U.S. to the category of nations that abuse human rights. The U.S. detention program and its special judicial system make it almost impossible for a person mistakenly accused of terrorism to counter those charges. By making it easy for the government to win its cases, officials can avoid the painstaking investigations necessary to catch real terrorists, which over the long haul can weaken our investigative eyes, ears, and brains. <br /><br /><li>The needless takeover of Iraq, which represents a policy of the president's waging preemptive war without approval from the United Nations. Congress, major news outlets, and most citizens failed to question rigorously the president's case for war, which has since been disproved.</ol>The Executive branch has been largely left to itself, not only to carry out existing policies but to create new ones &#8212; and to wrap them in secrecy. There has been remarkably little debate about these polices in Congress, and little opposition or demand for involvement or oversight. For example, Congress dismantled habeas corpus rights, which permit testing the Executive's case for imprisoning people, in the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (rejecting the Supreme Court's statute-based decision in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>, 126 S. Ct. 2749 (2006)). This summer Congress legalized unchecked electronic eavesdropping power for the Executive of communications between people in the U.S. and overseas callers, in the Protect America Act of 2007. Congress has abandoned its Article I war powers, which require it to decide (and presumably discuss and debate) whether the nation should enter a war. Congress barely debated whether to invade Iraq and allowed itself to be rushed into granting the president ultimate authority. Remarkably, last March, Democrats removed from a bill funding the Iraq occupation a provision that would have required the president to seek Congressional approval before bombing or invading Iran; the House voted down (288-136) a similar requirement in May. <br /><br />Input from the Supreme Court has been too little, too late. For example, the 2004 enemy combatant cases were unnecessarily deferential to the Executive Branch. In <em>Hamdi v. R
umsfeld</em>, 542 U.S. 507, the plurality opinion by Justice O'Connor stated that in a challenge by a U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan as an enemy combatant, there could be a rebuttable "presumption in favor of the government's evidence" that the prisoner is an enemy combatant. 542 U.S. at 534. Other procedural protections, Justice O'Connor wrote, could be relaxed in favor of the Executive, too. Id. at 533-36. That this opinion was poorly reasoned is revealed in what it spawned: the Combatant Status Review Tribunal at Guantanamo, which is nothing more than a kangaroo court, capable only of concluding that the Executive was correct in any given case. <br /><br />Giving the president free rein does not appear to have made us safer. Many sources report that the danger of terrorism has actually increased since 9/11. In addition to the dangerous policies mentioned above, our leaders reportedly have failed to protect seaports, air cargo, and chemical plants from the risk of terrorist attacks. <br /><br />Not investigating whether U.S. officials might have failed on 9/11, and rushing to the conclusion that the best way to prevent future attacks was to give them more power, is poor thinking and poor problem-solving. A wide-ranging investigation into the possible causes of the government's failure to provide security on that day could have helped the nation plug the holes in its defenses. A true fix might have entailed replacing people who failed, not policies. Six years later, the nation can still go down this road, and it should. Indeed, last month, the executive summary of a classified CIA internal report from 2005 was released; the summary suggests that the CIA could have prevented the 9/11 attacks and appears to blame former agency director George Tenet and others. This report might be a good place to start. <br /><br />Otherwise, our legacy will be that in seeking to prevent a second 9/11, Americans unquestioningly trusted the competence of people whose incompetence may have allowed the first tragedy.<br /><br /><br /><em>Brian J.

Is he subject to civil suit for such alleged violations of international law? With respect to foreign plaintiffs who were harmed as a result of his abetments &#8212; especially during his chairing of inner circle meetings where decisions were made as part of a common plan to deny Geneva law rights and protections and to authorize secret and "coercive interrogation" of detainees that might include anything short of "torture" &#8212; civil suits can be brought in a federal district court under the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA or ATS), 28 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 1350, for a "tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States." As several federal cases (including Justice Breyer's important concurring opinion in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-339.ZS.html">Sosa</a> [542 U.S. 692, 762 (2004)] affirm, war crimes and crimes against humanity are well within the ambit of the ATCA.<br /><br />Is there any legislation that will operate to deny such suits under the ATCA? As noted in a recent law review article [2007 <em>Utah L. Rev.</em> at 416-18], there was an attempt in the 2006 Military Commissions Act to deny certain alien persons here or abroad, at any time, and under any circumstances, "any ... action against the United States or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement" of such persons. As noted in the article, such an attempt to deny fundamental rights of access to courts and to an effective remedy "is a flagrant 'denial of justice' under customary international law and an outrageous denial of peremptory rights of access to courts, rights to a remedy, and/or equality of treatment under numerous multilateral and bilateral treaties of the United States and customary international law. Such a sweeping denial of treaty-based requirements is also a violation of the separation of powers, since it attempts to control judicial decision and to deny the judiciary its time-honored and essential role of applying fundamental and peremptory rights and requirements contained in treaty law of the United States. More generally, it is an attempt to deny the rule of law."<br /><br />Importantly, the attempted denials in the Military Commissions Act should not prevail as a matter of law. Under well-recognized and traditional Supreme Court approaches to potential conflicts between international law and federal statutes, an act of Congress will not prevail against rights and prohibitions under international law unless there has been an expression by Congress of a clear and unequivocal intent to override such international law. There was no clear and unequivocal<br /> expression of such an intent in this instance and, in fact, there were several informing expressions of an intent to conform to any requirements of Geneva law. Moreover, even if such an expression of Congress had occurred, Supreme Court cases under the last-in-time rule (which might allow a latter in time statute to prevail in some instances) recognize both (1) a "rights under" treaties exception, and (2) a law of war exception to the last-in-time rule that assure the primacy of international law. Each exception would surely operate in this instance even if the last-in-time rule were applicable, since claims predictably would be made with respect to several "rights under" treaties and the law of war. For these reasons, suits under the Alien Tort Claims Act against Alberto Gonzales should be able to proceed in the federal courts. In a country committed to the rule of law, justice and human dignity, it should not be otherwise.<br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

Tens of thousands were killed in the uprising which the U.S. urged but failed to support. Iraqi High Tribunal Prosecutor Jaafar al-Moussawi announced that the trial would begin on August 21. Formal charges range from crimes against humanity to genocide. Al-Majid, Saddam Hussein&#39;s cousin and frequent military commander of choice, was instrumental in brutally repressing post-Gulf War uprisings. There is just one snag in this process. Al-Majid may be dead within weeks of entering his plea in this trial.<br /><br />On June 24, 2007, al-Majid was convicted on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity as a key ringleader in the military reprisals known as the &quot;Anfal Campaigns&quot; that claimed the lives of up to 180,000 Iraqi Kurds during the waning years of the Iran-Iraq War. Al-Majid often supplemented his attacks against civilian targets and villages with chemical weapons - hence the sobriquet &quot;Chemical Ali.&quot; He drew the death sentence in that trial and, per Iraqi law, his case was immediately forwarded to an appellate chamber for automatic review. If confirmed by the appellate court, also per Iraqi law, his execution must be carried out within 30 days.<br /><br />This same procedure played out in December, 2006, when Saddam&#39;s death sentence in the Dujail trial for the massacre of 182 Shi&#39;a was hurriedly and amateurishly carried out after confirmation by the appellate court. At the time of his execution, Saddam was half-way through the Anfal trial. Many observers, including myself, argued strenuously for Saddam&#39;s execution to be postponed until all seven trials could be completed, or at least the Anfal trial itself; or, in the alternative, have the trial continue posthumously against him so that the record of his involvement and guilt could be established. Instead, not only was Saddam executed, but the Iraqi High Tribunal declined to continue the trial posthumously against him. Moreover, all charges against Saddam in the Anfal genocide were dropped. <br /><br />Thus, Saddam got away with murder. His role in the Anfal Campaigns was not officially established through a court process, flawed as that process is. The storytelling function of a criminal trial is vitally important for the victims involved. In the case of Saddam&#39;s legally required but premature execution, Iraq&#39;s Kurds were denied that function. And although the Shi&#39;a of Dujail got their day in court against Saddam, the Kurds did not. Similarly, the Shi&#39;a of southern Iraq will not get their day in court against al-Majid in the 1991 Shi&#39;ite Uprising trial that the Kurds got in the Anfal trial.<br /><br />The best institutions learn from their mistakes. The IHT and the Iraqi government should learn from the mishandling of the Saddam proceedings. My advice to the Iraqi government and the IHT on the matter of al-Majid remains the same as it was with Saddam. Postpone al-Majid&#39;s execution so that his role in the suppression of the Shi&#39;ites can be fully explored with his active defense. Do not rescind it, or commute it, just postpone it. Failing that, at least let the trial against him continue posthumously. And at the very least avoid dropping the charges against him. To drop the charges is not only an insult to the survivors, but to the memory of the victims as well.<br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that the International Committee of the Red Cross report on US interrogations of prisoners held at secret so-called CIA &quot;black sites&quot; should be released to the American public...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavis.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n a just-published <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/08/13/070813fa_fact_mayer">article</a> in the <em>New Yorker</em> magazine entitled &quot;The Black Sites: A Rare Look Inside the CIA&#39;s Secret Interrogation Program,&quot; Jane Mayer documents what only those in hopeless denial can avoid knowing: the United States has tortured people in the so-called CIA &quot;black sites&quot;. In the course of describing the horrendous violations of international and domestic law that have been committed, the author also mentions that the International Committee of the Red Cross has submitted to the United States a report on its investigation of the CIA black sites and the interrogation techniques used there. It appears from comments in the article by those who have been permitted to see the report that it is a devastating critique that calls those techniques tantamount to torture.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know about other Americans, but for the past five years I have heard members of the Executive and Legislative of both parties, academics, and lawyers in private practice defend various interrogation programs by saying that they are &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; or that &quot;we do not condone torture&quot; or that &quot;this has been vetted by the lawyers&quot; or &quot;there were only a few bad apples at low levels involved at Abu Ghraib&quot; or &quot;this is humane treatment consistent with military necessity&quot; and on and on. I have heard presidential candidates almost to a man (and woman) say that they support the &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques.&quot; <br /><br />I hereby urge all people of good will to DEMAND of the Executive and the Legislative that one of them release to the American people the full unexpurgated unredacted un-whatevered version of the ICRC report on the CIA black sites. I further urge that the earlier reports on U.S. detention also be released.<br /><br />The ICRC cannot release these reports. The ICRC&#39;s vital role is to trade access to prisoners in exchange for confidentiality. Its role is crucial in protecting human dignity in the worst of times when armed conflict is initiated. Its power to shed light to change behavior is demonstrated most recently in the fact that the President&#39;s recent Executive Order of July 20, 2007 fears the ICRC by not enshrining its access to detainees. Absence of ICRC access in the Executive Order was a most damning oversight that haunts me.<br /><br />As we foresaw at the American Society of International Law annual meeting last March there are people who have seen the ICRC report within a country (in this case the United States) who might wish information to come out about that report because they find the information so disturbing, so inconsistent with the public statements of our high-level civilians and generals over the past years, and so inconsistent with American values and our international and domestic legal obligations. Rather than those noble Americans running the risk of being prosecuted for taking such a heroic step, I urge that our government simply release the report. The report should be released so that we can see the distance between what our government has said to us and what it has done under the shadow of secrecy in our name. We elected them, they owe it to us. Git &#39;er done.<br /><br />Some will say that release of the report will help our enemies by telling them what we do. The problem is that what we do is - from the reports we have heard - against the law. The people to whom this conduct has been done know what happened to them. Those who are released, as pointed out in Jane Mayer&#39;s article, are consistent in how they describe what happened to them. And no matter what gag order - a la David Hicks - is imposed, people will talk about what happened to them. Interrogators are talking about what they have done - to friends and no doubt in confession. People are buying insurance and have to reveal to the insurance company to some extent the types of risks that they are seeking to cover. In US courts, allegations of horrendous treatment have been made in suits by former detainees that one can pick up on the Internet. And, of course, those who are involved or who are providing Congressional oversight know what is happening. The only people in the dark in this shell game are the detainees held at such sites and the American people. Bring the light.<br /><br />Some will say that information about collaboration of leaders of other democratic states in these black sites will ruin our international relations. I say let the people of those democratic states read the truth of what their leaders have done in their names and hold them in judgment too.<br /><br />Let us denounce Orwellian euphemism and call a spade a spade. Let those presidential candidates that go for easy almost lynchmob applause &quot;waving the bloody flag&quot; of &quot;toughness&quot; on the campaign trail be made to confront the fact that what they are saying means that their party stands for torture. <br /><br />Is that what the Republicans stand for? Is that what the Democrats stand for? Is that what I am getting if I cast my vote for this candidate or that candidate?<br /><br />And let us with that knowledge go after those U.S. high-level civilians and generals and criminally prosecute them in U.S. domestic courts for what they have done that besmirches the good name of the United States. If we learn nothing from the expiatory language in the &quot;Family Jewels&quot; release it is how much fear there was of criminal prosecution in those craven high-level civilians (who did all those awful things at the behest of this or that President) if the true story came out. Let us make that fear palpable for those who do not come clean with the American people today. <br /><br />Release the ICRC report.<br /><br />We look back to our greatest generation and we can see that they did not seek to operate like we are operating now. They sought to protect human dignity not destroy it. Justice Stevens, the sole exemplar of that time still on the court, wrote as much in his <em>Hamdan</em> opinion.<br /><br />I can handle the truth. The American people can handle the truth. The question is whether our leaders can handle the truth and level with Americans on the torture they have done in our names. Let&#39;s make them, by demanding that we be let in on the unvarnished truth. For truth, in the words of the old spiritual, will set us free. It will help us see the background for the <a href="http://www.tni.org/detail_page.phtml?page=archives_tblick_g8">&quot;policy laundering&quot;</a> through the G8 that is being done to try to reduce all of our liberty in America and Europe, and by extension the world. We should never fear the truth. Like an updated Diogenes of Synope - with a lamp I seek a leader of courage who will tell us the truth and officially release this report to Americans now. We deserve it, as do all those who have sacrificed for America. Stop the games.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/faculty_m_cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law says that new Congressionally-approved revisions to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act give the Bush administration wide discretion to illegally spy on American citizens...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/cohncolor.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>R</strong></font>esponding to fear-mongering by the Bush administration, the Democrat-led Congress has put its stamp of approval on the unconstitutional wiretapping of Americans. <br /><br />George W. Bush has perfected the art of ramming ill-considered legislation through Congress by hyping emergencies that don&#39;t exist. He did it with the USA Patriot Act, the authorization for the Iraq war, the Military Commissions Act, and now the &quot;Protect America Act of 2007&quot; which amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).<br /><br />FISA was enacted in 1978 in reaction to excesses of Richard Nixon and the FBI, who covertly spied on critics of administration policies. FISA set up a conservative system with judges who meet in secret and issue nearly every wiretapping order the administration requests.<br /><br />But that wasn&#39;t good enough for Bush. In 2001, he secretly established his &quot;Terrorist Surveillance Program,&quot; with which the National Security Agency has illegally spied on Americans. Instead of holding hearings and holding the executive accountable for his law-breaking, Congress capitulated once again to the White House&#39;s strong-arm tactics. As Congress was about to adjourn for its summer recess, Bush officials threatened to label anyone who opposed their new legislation as soft on terror. True to form, Congress - including 16 Senate and 41 House Democrats - caved.<br /><br />The new law takes the power to authorize electronic surveillance out of the hands of a judge and places it in the hands of the attorney general (AG) and the director of national intelligence (DNI). FISA had required the government to convince a judge there was probable cause to believe the target of the surveillance was a foreign power or the agent of a foreign power. The law didn&#39;t apply to wiretaps of foreign nationals abroad. Its restrictions were triggered only when the surveillance targeted a U.S. citizen or permanent resident or when the surveillance was obtained from a wiretap physically located in the United States. The attorney general was required to certify that the communications to be monitored would be exclusively between foreign powers and there was no substantial likelihood a U.S. person would be overheard.<br /><br />Under the new law, the attorney general and the director of national intelligence can authorize &quot;surveillance directed at a person reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States.&quot; The surveillance could take place inside the U.S., and there is no requirement of any connection with al-Qaeda, terrorism or criminal behavior. The requirement that the AG certify there is no substantial likelihood a U.S. person will be overheard has been eliminated.<br /><br />By its terms, the new law will sunset in 180 days. But this is a specious limitation. The AG and DNI can authorize surveillance for up to one year. So just before the statute is set to expire around February 1, 2008, they could approve surveillance that will last until after Bush leaves office.<br /><br />There is provision for judicial review of the procedures the AG and DNI establish to make sure they are reasonably designed to ensure communications of U.S. persons are not overheard. But that requirement is also specious. They must submit their procedures to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court 120 days after the effective date of the act. The court doesn&#39;t have to respond to their submission until 180 days after the effective date of the act, and the standard of review is appallingly low. It&#39;s limited to whether the government&#39;s determination is &quot;clearly erroneous.&quot; Even if the court were to find the proffer clearly erroneous, the AG and DNI have another 30 days to fix it. That takes the entire review process beyond the 6 month sunset period. Meanwhile, the surveillance can continue.<br /><br />The Supreme Court held in the 1967 case of <em>Katz v. United States</em> that government wiretapping must be supported by a search warrant based on probable cause and issued by a judge. In 1972, the Court, in U.S. v. U.S. District Court (Keith), struck down warrantless domestic surveillance. The Court has recognized the &quot;special needs&quot; exception to the warrant requirement. The special need must be narrowly tailored to the problem. However, the new law is much too broad to come under this exception. Congress eliminated any need that the person surveilled be a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. The government need only show it is seeking &quot;foreign intelligence information.&quot; There is no requirement of any connection with terrorism. The special needs exception also requires an absence of discretion in the implementing authority. There is unlimited discretion now as long as the target is reasonably believed to be outside the United States. <br /><br />The AG is required under the new law to report to Congress semi-annually, but only on incidents of non-compliance. Can we really trust Alberto Gonzales to be forthcoming about compliance with this law? Senator Christopher Dodd told Glenn Greenwald at the YearlyKos convention last week that neither he nor the other senators have any idea of how the Bush administration has been using its secret program to spy on Americans.<br /><br />Finally, the new law requires telephone companies to collect data and turn it over to the federal government. It also grants immunity against lawsuits to these companies, many of which are currently defendants in civil cases.<br /><br />Indeed, the mad rush to push this legislation through last week was likely a preemptive strike by Bush to head off adverse rulings in lawsuits challenging the legality of his Terrorist Surveillance Program. On August 9, a federal district court in San Francisco will hear oral arguments by lawyers from the Center for Constitutional Rights and the National Lawyers Guild in <em>CCR v. Bush</em>. And on August 15, Guild lawyers and others will argue <em>Al-Haramain v. Bush</em> in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.<br /><br />In six months, when the &quot;Protect America Act of 2007&quot; is set to expire, there will be even more political pressure on Congress to appear tough on terror in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election. We cannot expect a Congress that so easily caved in to the fears hyped by the Bush administration to stand firm in support of the Constitution.<br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and president of the National Lawyers Guild.

That scenario is unlikely.<br /><br />The President will not be able to get a Gonzales clone confirmed as Attorney General with the Senate under Democratic control. The Judiciary Committee will insist on a level of openness and cooperation that the Administration has so far been unwilling to provide.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/gonzales.php">Alberto Gonzales</a> | Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/doj.php">US Justice Department</a> | News: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/08/gonzales-resigns-as-us-attorney-general.php">Gonzales resigns as US attorney general</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />The President could fill the post through a recess appointee, but only at some serious political cost. Congress will not give a recess appointee either the informal deference or the formal legal authority that the White House would want. Especially with a permanent rewrite of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act under discussion, a recess appointee would seriously weaken the Justice Department&#39;s position.<br /><br />As for Gonzales himself, it seem unlikely that his resignation will either increase or decrease his legal vulnerability to congressional subpoenas or his legal capacity to assert executive privilege on particular matters. If possible, however, he now finds himself in an even weaker political position, which could affect the public positions he is able to advocate with any force.<br /><br />Perhaps the best development for Gonzales is that his resignation likely makes his impeachment a political non-starter. He is not technically immune from impeachment. The only other cabinet official ever impeached, Secretary of War William Belknap, was tried after he had resigned. Because a potential penalty for impeachment is disqualification from federal office, in addition to removal, such a proceeding would not be legally meaningless. Yet, it surely will not happen.<br /><br />Alberto Gonzales is likely to be remembered for his double-barreled disservice to the law. First, his lack of awareness, concern, or both with respect to the politicization of the Justice Department, combined with his inability to provide a candid, cogent, and consistent explanation for the Department&#39;s behavior has demoralized the career lawyers and line prosecutors who are the Department&#39;s heart and soul. It will take years to repair the damage.<br /><br />Second, as White House Counsel and, then, as Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales was a central figure in advancing the most audacious and unjustified claims in American history on behalf of inherent presidential authority. When the two words most likely associated in the public mind with your government service are &quot;torture memo,&quot; your legacy is not a good one.<br /><br /><br /><em>Peter M.

		<title>The Morality of Race Factoring in Public School Assignment</title>

In essence, the plurality found an immoral equivalence between using race to include and using race to exclude. This equivalence is not only incongruent but also immoral.<br /><br />Writing for the plurality, Chief Justice John Roberts declared the school assignment plans unconstitutional because they focused on illegitimate racial balancing. Roberts proclaimed that the "the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."<br /><br />Roberts equated the school assignment plans designed to achieve racial diversity to the separate-but-equal regime that existed prior to the <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> decision. Roberts said that<blockquote>Before <em>Brown</em>, school children were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin. The school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once again&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;even for very different reasons.</blockquote>In a concurring opinion siding with the Chief Justice, Justice Clarence Thomas compared dissenting Justice Stephen Breyer's opinion, which would have upheld the race-conscious school assignment plans, to the arguments of segregationists in the pre-<em>Brown</em> era.<br /><br />The plurality's misguided sense of immorality is out of sync with the precepts of many mainstream religions, which favor the use of race to foster racial inclusion and diversity in order to avoid racial isolation. For example, Catholic Social Thought teaches that "equality does not mean uniformity." Equality of treatment recognizes differences. In 1979, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a Pastoral Letter on Racism that condemned the subtly racist structures of U.S. society. The Bishops noted that these structures reflect the values which society upholds and are "geared to the success of the majority and the failure of the minority."<br /><br />The Bishops presciently questioned the motives of those in the antidiversity movement. They wrote:<blockquote>[R]acism is sometimes apparent in the growing sentiment that too much is being given to racial minorities by way of affirmative action programs or allocations to redress long-standing imbalances in minority representation and government-funded programs for the disadvantaged. At times, protestations claiming that all persons should be treated equally reflect the desire to maintain a status quo that favors one race and social group at the expense of the poor and the nonwhite.</blockquote>Finally, the Bishops recognized that racism obscures the evils of the past, denies the burdens that history has placed upon minorities, and fails to acknowledge the need for restitution and restorative and redistributive justice.<br /><br />Moreover, the Court's plurality fails to take into account the historic reality that segregation played (and still plays) in our society. The plurality fails to recognize that many people of color still have little geographical choice in the location of the family home or the K-12 school assignment of their children. The choices of people of color are often limited by the immoral and discriminatory acts of builders, real estate agents, bankers, insurance companies, and local zoning boards. <br /><br />The plurality would make it virtually impossible to rectify major educational inequities in society. Urban students of color are most likely to go to inadequately-funded, segregated schools. In fact, nationwide, seventy percent of African American children attend public schools with primarily minority populations. Uncertified and inexperienced teachers are disproportionately assigned to public schools with the most at-risk students making these students' educations also at risk. As a consequence, in many parts of the country, only sixty percent of high school students receive a diploma within four-to-six years<br /><br />Gary Orfield's book, <em>Dismantling Desegregation: the Quiet Reversal of Brown v. Board of Education</em> notes that wealthy public schools offer three times more high ability courses than low ability classes. In contrast, schools with high concentrations of poverty offer equal proportion of high ability and low ability courses. So a high performing black student at a high poverty school will not have the opportunity to take as many high-ability classes. More importantly, this student will not receive the depth of the coverage that a similarly situated white counterpart receives at the more affluent suburban school. <br /><br />The failure to address these educational inequities is immoral. Fortunately, in his concurring opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy implicitly acknowledged that the plurality opinion was immoral. Kennedy specifically stated: "this Nation has a moral and ethical obligation to fulfill its historic commitment to creating an integrated society that ensures equal opportunity for all of its children." <br /><br />Although Justice Kennedy supplied the key fifth vote overturning the school assignment programs for failure to satisfactorily explain the reasons for the assignment programs, he joined the dissenting justices in permitting the use of race in school assignment cases. Kennedy explained his disagreement with Roberts:<blockquote>The plurality opinion is open to the interpretation that the Constitution requires school districts to ignore the problem of de facto resegregation in schooling. I cannot endorse that conclusion. To the extent that the plurality opinion suggests the Constitution mandates that state and local authorities must accept the status quo of racial isolation in schools, it is, in my view profoundly mistaken.</blockquote>By finding a false moral equivalence between the use of race for segregation and the use of race for diversity, the plurality opinion would leave us paralyzed to address the discrimination that caused the school systems to be segregated in the first place and the still present societal discrimination that causes them to remain segregated. In my opinion, the plurality opinion is immoral. <br /><br /><br /><em>Leonard M. Baynes is Professor of Law and Director of the Ronald H.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that the President's recent Executive Order interpreting Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions for US interrogations practice is an invalid and illegal act ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavis.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n July 20, 2007, President Bush signed Executive Order 13440 - Interpretation of the Geneva Conventions Common Article 3 as Applied to a Program of Detention and Interrogation Operated by the Central Intelligence Agency. This Executive Order is a result of an inter-agency process undertaken pursuant to the Military Commission Act of 2006. For the reasons explained below, the President's order is an invalid and illegal act that guts the Geneva Conventions. These are policy preferences that are criminal.<br /><br />First, the Executive Order reaffirms the President&#39;s determination of February 7, 2002 that, for the United States, members of al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces are unlawful enemy combatants who are not entitled to the protections that the Third Geneva Convention provides to prisoners of war. This determination concluded that the Taliban had waived their right to Third Geneva Convention POW status because they did not comply with the four prong test that forms one of the definitions of who is a POW in an international conflict. The analysis underlying that determination was flawed at the time as was pointed out by the then Legal Advisor of the Department of State. Moreover, the analysis simply did not take into account several other categories of persons that are entitled to Third Geneva Convention POW status. As to Al-Qaeda, the Supreme Court in <em>Hamdan</em> stated that at a minimum they were entitled to the protections of Common Article 3 &#8212; it did not reach their status as POW's. Traditionally, we would give them POW status as we did with the Viet-Cong in Vietnam. The President was wrong in 2002 and is wrong again in 2007, with devastating consequences for the United States. <br /><br />Second, the President maintains the designation of &quot;unlawful enemy combatant&quot; which does not track with the categories foreseen in the Third or Fourth Geneva Conventions. Under the Executive Order, persons who are entitled to POW status as a matter of the Geneva Conventions will be provided Common Article 3 protections only. And those Common Article 3 will be only "ersatz" Common Article 3 protections of the limited kind stated in the Executive Order. This approach is another effort to decouple these persons from the Geneva Conventions through a U.S. internal law approach that does not track with the Geneva Convention definitions.<br /><br />Third, the "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment" definition is a definition of US internal constitutional law and is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Geneva Conventions and other treaties that use that language This definition does not prevent the argument to be made again that cruel inhuman and degrading treatment is permitted outside the United States (except to the extent stated by this act as opposed to the Constitutional standard) because the Constitution does not apply outside the United States. If the constitutional standard of "shocks the conscience" is said to apply, that standard is not that foreseen in the Geneva Conventions. The constitutional standard is a questionable local rule in this context as what "shocks the conscience" of any US court in this armed conflict is up to anyone's guess. US courts have shown a propensity to not be willing to entertain the claims about their treatment in the various cases brought by present or former detainees on the grounds of state secrets, political question, or federal officer immunity type doctrines.<br /><br />Fourth, the President, with Congressional acquiescence, is asserting what he does is the authoritative interpretation of the Common Article 3 treaty requirements. The use of the terms "international obligations" raises a concern whether the Executive Order is attempting to make a definition that also would cover other human rights instruments such as the Convention Against Torture and other forms of Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as any customary international law rules (drawing from <em>Paquete Habana</em> type analysis). No doubt the President's hope in this approach is to make sure the greatest deference is shown by courts to his determinations, erroneous as they are. Again, this is subtracting persons from the protections of the Geneva Conventions and other international law.<br /><br />Fifth, the language detailing what is prohibited under Common Article 3 is written in the negative stating that as long as the confinement and interrogation practices do not include the various points described below then the practices will be in compliance with Common Article 3. Through a series of artful (but ultimately transparent) phrases with references back to U.S. domestic law (as amended by recent law), the President proceeds to place markers on what is prohibited that I am certain provide a space to allow in several practices that would be suspect under the Geneva Conventions. Some have already asked about why "sleep" is not included in the laundry list. Others have asked about ICRC access to these prisoners not being included (thus permitting secret incommunicado detention which is illegal). It is as much what one does not see as what is listed that is important in reading this list. Readers should keep in mind that this kind of laundry list approach was rejected in the drafting of the Geneva Conventions precisely because the drafters (no doubt remembering the inventiveness of the German high command lawyers with the 1929 Geneva Conventions) were worried that artful persons would try to define and interpret the terms in a manner that would leave space for the kinds of acts the Geneva Conventions were intended to prevent from happening. For example, the "outrages against personal dignity" language of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is now construed narrowly. Section E prohibits willful and outrageous acts of personal abuse done for the purpose of humiliating or degrading the individual in a manner so serious that any reasonable person, considering the circumstances, would deem the acts to be beyond the bounds of human decency, such as sexual or sexually indecent acts undertaken for the purpose of humiliation, forcing the individual to perform sexual acts or to pose sexually, threatening the individual with sexual mutilation, or using the individual as a human shield (emphasis added); The "willful and outrageous acts", "done for the purpose", "reasonable person" and "considering the circumstances" language provide along with the focus on sexual simulation "wiggle room" that seriously waters down the meaning of Common Article 3. <br /><br />Sixth, the act is written in a manner to prevent again any private right of action. I am also uncertain how a criminal prosecution for violation of the Executive Order might be permitted to go forward since rights under the act inure to the CIA's benefit alone and not to the government as a whole.<br /><br />Seventh, the treatment here diverges from the obligations under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and Army Field Manuals to which our soldiers are trained. This divergence maintains the kind of space between the legal regimes for uniformed soldiers and CIA persons that led to the problems at Abu Ghraib. Uniformed soldiers were court-martialed for doing things that they said intelligence persons were asking them to do. One can easily imagine down the road CIA types (and high level civilians in Defense for that matter)
 encouraging soldiers to do things that violate their obligations under the Uniform Code of Military Justice but do not violate this order. Lynndie Englund and Charles Graner? Move over and make space for your other uniformed colleagues.<br /><br />In sum, the Executive Order reaffirms the elimination of Geneva Convention protections and narrows the definition of the protections that are said to be under Common Article 3 and other international obligations. Through this artful effort in internal U.S. foreign relations law the U.S. can try to have its cake and eat it to. It can say to the rest of the world that it has not changed the Geneva Conventions and as a matter of internal law it can maintain all kinds of latitude for how it treats these people.<br /><br />The bet being made by of all those involved in approving the Military Commissions Act and this Executive Order is that the United States can enshrine illegality but will be able to achieve legitimacy for its actions. First, legitimacy is procured by having the Congressional action of passing the Military Commissions Act giving great deference to the Presidential determinations and creating this separate Military Commission space. Second, the Presidential Executive Order seeks to further provide legitimacy to this illegality. The hope is that review by the courts, if any, will only be through the Military Commission process and only for narrow bases with great deference to the President further providing legitimacy. Third, in case no one has noticed, a very aggressive charm offensive is going on by the United States to encourage other states to allow the United States to have its way. Thus, the German complaint on detainee treatment was withdrawn early this summer. The Legal Adviser at the Department of State was dispatched along with others around the world to explain the U.S. position. It appears that during the G-8, ideas like a National Security Court for each nation were "bruited". All of these acts are part of getting other states to go along with how the United States intends to act and possibly to encourage them to act similarly to the United States. Go along to get along, so to speak.<br /><br />Many wonder why the United States government persists in refusing to return to its traditional standards. The answer would appear obvious to anyone who has read the February 7, 2002 Presidential determination and saw the reaction to the Hamdan decision in 2006. During the intervening years 2002-2006 (if not before and afterward), the type of treatment of detainees that we saw at Abu Ghraib was not an isolated incident. It was systematic. The high level civilians and generals who put in place that system and allowed it to go forward know they committed war crimes and are doing all they can to protect themselves from criminal liability. They are relying on these types of interpretations in the hope that they will have some cover. Let us not acquiesce in giving them that cover.<br /><br />This Executive Order does not protect our troops. As we saw in the first Gulf War, when the Iraqi troops had a choice between surrendering and fighting to the death, the fact that they would be well treated encourages surrender &#8212; reducing our risks of casualties at the same time. If a person knows that they will be tortured if captured, the calculus is completely different. In addition, we must always keep in mind the powerful idea of reciprocity. In future conflicts, our adversaries will point to our efforts in this setting to gut the Geneva Convention protections to rationalize their barbarity towards our captured soldiers. I fear that the damage done so far is already so significant that we are in a situation where the only way to show the world we truly reject this route is to criminally prosecute in our domestic courts our high level civilians (including the lawyers) and generals who put in place this effort to gut the Geneva Convention.<br /><br />Those doing this work are no doubt hoping that their interpretations that are illegal, followed by acquiescence by other states, will lead to legitimacy on the international plane for the radical position they have taken. However, resistance by other states to this denuding of the Geneva Conventions can help maintain the illegitimacy of this five year long effort to create a black hole for certain human beings. Resistance can take the form externally of states who have detainees in the system insisting that detainees are given full protections as a matter of international law obligations of the United States. This Executive Order is merely internal U.S. law and it is a basic rule of international law that no state can extract itself from its international obligations through its internal law (enshrined in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties but also in customary international law). As the Geneva Conventions have been signed by all 192 states, all states may object to the U.S. Executive Order as an illegal and invalid act and insist on compliance by the United States with the higher standards of the Geneva Convention as a matter of treaty enforcement. <br /><br />Resistance can also be internal through Americans &#8212; yes, Americans! &#8212; insisting that their government not play legalistic games and return to the standards applied for nearly 60 years in myriad conflicts (See the eloquent statement of P.X. Kelley and Robert F. Turner in their Washington Post Op-Ed &#8212; War Crimes and the United States). An American sitting even here in exotic Toledo, Ohio can see the use of internal law being made here and compare it with the international law obligations that the United States owes to itself and to the rest of the world. An American can insist that the government meet those international obligations. The ability to do that I call second vision or "dedoublement analytique" in a forthcoming article. It moves away from discussions of monism and dualism to focus on a more citizen oriented vision of international law. <br /><br />There is the risk that the efforts to blind Americans to international obligations and make us proud of that blindness will succeed. We should not allow leaders to continue to try to make a virtue of their or the electorate's ignorance to our detriment. In any event, I submit that it is not so hard to see what is going on. In fact, I have had two high school student interns working with me on the Military Commissions Act. I gave them the Executive Order and they saw right away what was going on. So I think that if 17-year olds can figure it out, than the rest of us ought to be able to figure it out too.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that Pakistan&#39;s Supreme Court should resolve the legal dispute between suspended Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry and President Pervez Musharraf by delivering a bold ruling in favor of judicial independence...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhannew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>P</strong></font>rofessional consensus, Islamic traditions, and the Constitution all favor a bold decision by the Pakistan Supreme Court in the case of <em>The Chief Justice v. The President of Pakistan</em> to end the military onslaught on the independence of the judiciary - just as the US Supreme Court ended racial apartheid in America with a bold stroke in <em>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</em>. The Pakistan Supreme Court understands that any waffling, hair-splitting, or technical hedging in the opinion will only encourage this and future Presidents to sponsor a judicial culture of timidity and subservience. An unequivocal annulment of the President's Reference against the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) is needed to restore the dignity of the judiciary. Splitting the baby between the President and the Chief Justice will resolve nothing but complicate matters even further. <br /><br /><strong>Professional Consensus</strong><br /><br />Pakistan's legal community demands that the Supreme Court pioneer a vigorous defense of the judiciary. The open and hostile suspension of the CJP shocked the lawyers of Pakistan. On March 9, 2007, the President, dressed in a military uniform, summoned the CJP to a small coterie of generals and others. Unproven charges based on questionable and unlawfully obtained evidence were read to the CJP. The CJP was both sweet-talked and threatened to resign. When the CJP refused, the men in the military camp shared the nods and the CJP was suspended on the spot. Armed with self-righteous power, the President and his men detained the CJP while the news of his suspension was released to the world. This show of force by a President who overthrew a democratically elected government, usurped power, and who refuses to shed his uniform even after eight years of unconstitutional dictatorship carried a mal fide purpose. The maltreatment of the CJP was purposefully staged to intimidate the entire Supreme Court. The move, however, backfired, earning the lawyers' stern and severe opposition. <br /><br />For the first time in the history of the country the lawyers of Pakistan have pooled their resources -- from Karachi to Khyber -- to overturn a Presidential order that they believe is blatantly unlawful. The lawyers' street protests, periodic but orderly suspension of court appearances, and bar room resolutions cannot be ignored. Of course, the courts must do the right thing without fear of public protests. But the lawyers' professional outcry is no mere protest. It involves both protest and professional judgment that an unacceptable wrong has been committed. The Supreme Court will take into account the lawyers' overwhelming belief that the President is forging a subservient Supreme Court that must rule in the President's favor. A bold annulment of the President's Reference against the CJP would nip this forging evil in the bud, and assure judicial independence. <br /><br /><strong>Islamic Traditions</strong><br /><br />Judicial independence is no religious fundamentalism. If anything, judicial independence is part of "enlightened moderation," a phrase that the President has launched to fight religious extremism. Several Supreme Court Justices are devoutly religious. Some are scholars of Islamic law. They will judge the case in the light of Islamic traditions. The Constitution itself recognizes that Islam is the state religion of Pakistan. Article 31 of the Constitution protects the Islamic way of life and promotes Islamic moral standards. Article 227 mandates that all laws shall be brought in conformity with the Injunctions of the Quran and the Sunnah, and that no law shall be enacted which is repugnant to these injunctions. It is therefore natural for Supreme Court Justices to search for an Islamic perspective, as they have, on the President's Reference against the CJP. <br /><br />Rejecting the ruler's intimidation is a core Islamic value found in the Quran and the Prophet's Sunnah. "Fear them not, but fear me" is God's injunction to all believers (Quran 3:175), including judges who must neither swerve to wrong nor depart from justice (Quran 5:8). The CJP's refusal to resign despite pressure from General Musharraf and his men is a fine example of fearlessness. The lawyers of Pakistan have embraced the cause of the CJP, for they admire his personal courage to stand up to men in uniform. Throughout Muslim history, God-fearing jurists and judges have refused to bow down to rulers out of fear or otherwise. The Prophet is reported to have said: "The best striving in the path of God is (to speak) a word of justice to an oppressive ruler. " (Abu Dawd 37:4330). <br /><br />Holding these injunctions, it is unlikely that Supreme Court Justices will bend and buckle, out of fear, to whitewash the President's humiliation of the Chief Justice. The Court's summary rejection of the scandalous file that the government presented as evidence against the CJP indicates that the Justices are in no mood to sacrifice their Chief to please a President who clothes his authority with military paraphernalia. A bold decision -- without ifs and buts -- to annul the President's Reference will advance the Islamic tradition of rejecting the ruler's intimidation, particularly because the Constitution demands that the judiciary remain independent. <br /><br /><strong>Constitutional Points</strong> <br /><br />The Supreme Court will face no difficulty in finding that the President lacks the constitutional authority to suspend the Chief Justice. Even if the President has the authority to direct the Supreme Judicial Council to inquire into the CJP's alleged misconduct, neither the Constitution nor any statutes empower the President to send a referred judge on forced leave, seal his office, fire his staff, take away his privileges, reduce his salary, or detain him. No such measures are available to the President. Hence, the President's order to suspend the CJP has no basis in law.<br /><br />Furthermore, the President prejudiced the neutrality of the Supreme Judicial Council. Until the inquiry is complete and the Supreme Judicial Council has conducted a full hearing, the dignity of the judiciary requires that no public disclosure of the inquiry be made. Public disclosure of an inquiry hurts the reputation of a referred judge &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; an injury that cannot be reversed if allegations of misconduct are found to be false. If a judge has committed a crime, a criminal complaint should be filed against him. The Supreme Judicial Council is not a criminal court. It is a tribunal of judicial ethics. Public disclosure of its proceedings is neither automatic nor mandatory. In openly and publicly suspending the CJP before the hearing, the President unlawfully interfered with the proceedings of the Council. The President acted as if the CJP had committed serious crimes against the state and suspension was the only way to prevent him from further damaging the state. <br /><br />It appears that the President received no expert advice in forming his opinion to send the Reference to the Supreme Judicial Council. The President was obligated to seek experts' help to sift through the evidence that charges the CJP with judicial misconduct. Modern state practice, the complexity of government, and the rule of law, all require that the President receive expert advice in conducting the myriad affairs of the state. Suspending the Chief Justice of Pakistan is no small matter. Relying on
a scandalous dossier that the Supreme Court refused to admit into record, the President formed the constitutionally required opinion in a manner that law cannot uphold. Hence, the very initiation of the President's Reference is constitutionally unsustainable.<br /><br />A bold decision must reinstate the Chief Justice of Pakistan with no delay or condition. Once the Chief Justice is restored to office, a properly constituted Supreme Judicial Council may inquire into the allegations against him. The public disclosure of this new inquiry will be made only after the inquiry is complete and the Council is of the opinion that the CJP has been guilty of misconduct and that he should be removed from office. Otherwise, the inquiry will remain a state secret. This is the procedure that many nations of the world use to hold judges accountable and simultaneously protect the dignity and independence of the judiciary. <br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan grew up in Pakistan and is a law graduate of Punjab University, Lahore.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/researchpost.php?postid=427">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that the much-discussed ideological divide between Shi&#39;is and Sunnis in Iraq is actually more subtle and complex than is usually depicted...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hamoudi.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>here has been a great deal of focus in the news recently on what the difference is between a Shi&#39;i and a Sunni. The subject has been grist for the mill of nightly comedy shows, with Stephen Colbert wanting to make peace between the two sides by learning how to say, in Arabic, "get over it" and Jay Leno finding remarkable ignorance in the streets of Los Angeles regarding the sectarian divide. In a more serious vein, US officials and political leaders are asked if they know the difference between Shi&#39;is and Sunnis, or which group controls which extremist organization, and often they do not. Among the more noteworthy recent occurrences of this sort, Senator Trent Lott was chastised for saying something that every Muslim recognizes as self-evident, if woefully beside the point; namely, that adherents to the two sects cannot be distinguished on the basis of their physical appearance.<br /><br />Surprisingly, however, the most misleading of all media appearances are by those who claim to know and understand the differences between the two sects. Invariably these supposed cognoscenti explain rather simplistically that the sects diverged over the question of the successor to the Prophet Muhammad nearly 1400 hundred years ago and have been fighting each other since then over this question. It is not uncommon for this to be followed by a conclusion that the region is fundamentally irrational and incomprehensible, as indeed any region would be whose adherents were fighting over a succession of political leadership that took place 1400 (as opposed to eight) years ago.<br /><br />However, the current dispute is not incomprehensible to a Western audience because at its most fundamental level, it does not involve wrangling over successorship to Muhammad. By large majorities, Iraq's Sunnis do not seek to reinstate the caliphate they once revered and that existed after Muhammad's death. As for Iraq's Shi'a, their current, designated successor to Muhammad, a lineal descendant known as the Mahdi, disappeared from the earth nearly a millennium ago, and, according to Shi'i theology, has remained in hiding since then. Proceeding on the delicate assumption that the Mahdi's reappearance is not imminent, the Shi'a have no designated successor to the Prophet to whom to turn either.<br /><br />The ideological divide between the two sects is actually more subtle and complex than this, and much more difficult to reconcile in a modern nation state. Not only does it have nothing to do with Muhammad's successor, it does not even relate to differences in the substantive Islamic rules developed by each community, which in point of fact are remarkably similar to each other. Rather, it has to do with the way in which religious authority is wielded within each community, and the manner in which the religious authority then affects the law of the state.<br /><br />In the Sunni world, the Islamic rules and norms known as the shari'a developed in the classical era primarily through four juristic "schools of thought" that, as the late George Makdisi notes, functioned like guilds in many respects. That is, they were associations of jurists with internal hierarchies and licensing procedures that functioned independently of state control. In the contemporary era, however, these guilds have disappeared. By and large, in light of the dissolution of the guilds, Sunni Islamists, leaving aside extremists from Al Qaeda and the like, have purported to preserve the shari'a through the codification of select classical era Islamic rules within individual Muslim states. <br /><br />There are a series of very serious problems with attempting to take centuries-old rulings from four different guilds with contradictory conclusions and picking among them to try to make a modern code. It is less the recreation of historical than its entire reinvention, but this is a matter that is, unfortunately, far too complex to discuss here. It suffices to say that without the guilds, codification of classical shari'a rules remains the standard to which mainstream Sunni Islamists purport to adhere, with one important consequence&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;their acquiescence to the form of the modern nation-state. That is, in seeking to "Islamicize" any particular nation state through the codification of the shari'a, mainstream Sunni Islamists accept necessarily the state's final authority over law. The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, for example, seeks to increase the role of shari'a by influencing legislation and initiating test cases before a judiciary, thereby accepting the modern, Western nation-state model and attempting to Islamicize that state. <br /><br />However, this dominant contemporary Sunni paradigm is rejected in Shi'i circles. Shi'i Islam traditionally places the determination of shari'a in clerics known as mujtahids within an informal and entirely extralegal hierarchy known as the marja'iyya. Grand Ayatollah Sistani is one such mujtahid (there are currently three others in Najaf), and Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr, Moqtada al-Sadr's father, was another.<br /><br />The membership of the marja'iyya shifts informally over time as elders die and younger members rise up through the hierarchy. Any Shi'i is free to follow any single living mujtahid, though he is supposed to continue follow the one mujtahid he has selected until the death of the mujtahid, with a change before then permitted, but only in unusual circumstances. <br /><br />Similar to the traditional Sunni guild system, the means by which the shari'a is developed by the marja'iyya does not lend itself easily to the process of lawmaking and enforcement in a modern nation state. The rules of the shari'a are not uniform but pluralistic, depending on the mujtahid who any given Shi'i selects relatively freely. Given this reality, most Shi'i Iraqi jurists (in contradistinction to those of Iran) seem to have taken the implicit theological position that the marja'iyya is not intended to be an institution of political rule and that it operates entirely separately from the state. The state is then viewed by the jurists as inherently secular, a distasteful if necessary institution in the absence of the Mahdi. Political rulers are as a consequence suspicious characters of which one should be wary. They are more consumed with self-interest and material gain than with following God's path, which the presumably selfless and modest marja'iyya has laid out.<br /><br />Given the extra legal nature of the marja'iyya, and given the deep respect most Iraqi Shi'a afford to their juristic leaders, deference to nonlegal forms of authority, at least in some realms, is inevitable. To a religious Shi'i who reveres the jurists, the state may be necessary in foreign affairs or international finance in today's profane world, but in other areas, such as family law or local commerce, this is not necessarily the case. As a result, Islamist Shi'i politicians have sought a relative withdrawal of state authority in certain areas of law. They have in the past proposed, for example, a repeal of state laws concerning marriage, divorce and inheritance and putting in their place nothing other than "the implementation of the rules of the shari'a . . . in accordance with the sect" of the persons affected, with the expectation that the marja'iyya will fill in the blanks and assume entire lawmaking control in this area, at least as it might affect the Shi'a population.<br /><br />It would be remiss to omit the fact that there are not an inc
onsiderable number of secular Sunnis and Shi'is who do not take shari'a very seriously, or view it as an arcane and antiquated legal system best left in history's dustbin. For them, very little of this is applicable. For the majority of Sunnis and Shi'is in Iraq who are seeking to Islamicize the state, however, the divergent perspectives create a very serious and difficult problem. To the Shi'a, the rules of Islam are understood to be defined and enunciated by a religious authority viewed with a great deal of respect, and state incursion onto the rights of that authority in outlining religious rules is impossible to contemplate in certain realms. To the mainstream Sunni Islamic forces, the state is the only repository of authority in the contemporary era and must itself be Islamicized. So long as Islam is expected to remain an important part of the legal order, and so long as one sect seeks to project Islam through the state while the other entrusts it to a non-state religious authority, tension is likely to continue.<br /><br /><br /><em>Haider Ala Hamoudi is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/rona_g.htm"><strong>Gabor Rona</strong></a> [International Legal Director, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.asp">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;The U.S. Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR) has issued a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/CMCR%20ruling%209-24-07.pdf">decision</a> overturning the dismissal of <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/pentagon-to-move-ahead-on-khadr-trial.php">prosecution against Omar Khadr</a> by a military commission. The case was dismissed because although Khadr was found by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal to be an &quot;enemy combatant,&quot; there was no finding, as is required for military commission jurisdiction, that he was an &quot;unlawful enemy combatant.&quot; The CMCR decided that 1) the distinction between &quot;enemy combatant&quot; and &quot;unlawful enemy combatant&quot; is significant for purposes of establishing military commission jurisdiction under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), and 2) the military commission, itself, has the power to determine that someone is an &quot;unlawful enemy combatant.&quot; But these conclusions are insignificant in comparison to the consequence of assumptions made by the Court about the concept of &quot;unlawful combatant.&quot;<br /><br />The Decision begins by addressing the distinction between what it calls &quot;lawful&quot; and &quot;unlawful&quot; combatants, terms that do not exist in the laws of war. What the Court is, in fact, addressing is the distinction between privileged and unprivileged belligerents. There&#39;s a big difference between these concepts. The Court correctly notes that unprivileged belligerents are denied prisoner of war (PoW) status in international armed conflict. The Court is on less solid ground when it says that acts of unprivileged belligerency are violations of the laws of war. The Decision wrongly asserts that the Third Geneva Convention &quot;sought carefully to define &#39;lawful combatant&#39; for all signatory nations.&quot; The Third and Fourth Conventions merely establish that privileged belligerents are entitled to PoW status and treatment, whereas others (such as unprivileged belligerents and civilians who take no part in hostilities) are not. Nowhere in the Geneva Conventions is there mention of the illegality, let alone criminality, of unprivileged belligerency.<br /><br />This does not mean that unprivileged belligerents can never be prosecuted for acts which render their belligerency unprivileged. It does mean that the crime of unprivileged belligerency must first be established in the domestic law. To hold otherwise is to violate the principle of legality (i.e., that people should only be prosecuted for conduct that is established as prohibited by law). <br /><br />In the case of Omar Khadr, a charge of &quot;murder in violation of the law of war&quot; would, of course, require proof that the killing was in violation of the law of war. Thus, while unprivileged belligerents (known in &#39;MCA-speak&#39; as unlawful enemy combatants) may fall within the jurisdiction of a military commission, they are not, ipso facto, criminally liable there under for acts of unprivileged belligerency, unless those acts also constitute violations of the laws of war enumerated as crimes in the MCA. Killing of a combatant by an unprivileged belligerent is not a listed crime in the MCA and is not &quot;murder in violation of the law of war.&quot; <br /><br />Even assuming that the MCA establishes that killing by an unprivileged belligerent is murder in violation of the law of war (which it does not), it is a violation of the prohibition against ex post facto prosecution to try Omar Khadr on such a charge, since the MCA post-dates his acts that are alleged to be criminal under the MCA.<br /><br />Those who hold opposing views will bring up the <em>Quirin</em> case (as did the CMCR) for the proposition that &quot;unlawful combatants . . . are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals for acts which render their belligerency unlawful.&quot; 317 U.S. 1, 31. But <em>Quirin</em> does not involve &quot;mere&quot; acts of unprivileged belligerency. It involves acts of belligerency that were unlawful not because the accused were unprivileged &#8212; in fact they were members of the opposing armed forces in an international armed conflict. You can&#39;t get more privileged than that. The very next sentence after the one cited above is this: &quot;The spy who secretly and without uniform passes the military lines of a belligerent in time of war, seeking to gather military information and communicate it to the enemy, or an enemy combatant who without uniform comes secretly through the lines for the purpose of waging war by destruction of life or property, are familiar examples of belligerents who are generally deemed not to be entitled to the status of prisoners of war, but to be offenders against the law of war subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals.&quot; (Citations omitted) 317 U.S. 1, 31. The propriety of criminal charges in Quirin, unlike in Khadr, is based on the nature of the act, not on the status of the accused. In other respects, the <em>Quirin</em> case was not about the criminality of the accused&#39;s conduct. Rather, it was about the scope of executive authority to establish military commissions.<br /><br />News reports rightly proclaim a victory for the government. But there may be a long way to go before Khadr&#39;s and other MC cases are final, even if this CMCR decision is not appealable to the D.C. Circuit (as provided by the MCA for convictions by military commissions) and even if the Supreme Court does buy the government&#39;s argument that it should not take cognizance of claims involving military commissions in the context of habeas claims, at least until after a trial and conviction.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com"><strong>Giovanni Di Stefano</strong></a> [lawyer for Ali Hassan al-Majid, dubbed &quot;Chemical Ali&quot;, <a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com">Studio Legale Internazionale</a>, Rome]: &quot;On the 4th of September, 2007 the Iraqi High Tribunal Appeal Section refused the appeal of Al Majid et al, effectively condemning the indictees to death. On the 9th of September, 2007 I duly filed applications with President Talabani to commute the sentences of Ali Hassan al-Majid, Sultan Hashim Ahmed Hussein and Rashid al-Tikriti.<br /><br />In order to ensure that President Talabani was properly served and on a timely basis I requested the Italian Government to deliver the application to the Iraqi Ambassador in Rome. Service was thus deemed effective on the 10th of September 2007.<br /><br />Under Iraqi Law no executions can take place during the period of Ramadan. Under Iraqi Law, notwithstanding the contestations on the per se interpretation of Iraqi Jurisprudence, executions &#39;must&#39; take place &#39;within 30 days of the Appeal Court decision if rejected.&#39;<br /><br />It is inconceivable that executions take place during Ramadan. Ramadan commenced on Friday, September 13th, 2007 and will end on the 12th of October, 2007. The period of 30 days upon which Ali Hassan al-Majid, Sultan Hashim Ahmed and Hussein Rashid al-Tikriti lawfully expected execution concludes on the 3rd October 2007. Ramadan ending on the 12th of October, 2007, the statutory period upon which Ali Hassan al-Majid, Sultan Hashim Ahmed and Hussein Rashid al-Tikriti could be executed is caught during Ramadan where Iraqi Law precludes if not mandates a stay on executions. Since the time period has by passage of time expired and no executions can lawfully occur it follows that de facto if not de jure the death sentences imposed upon Ali Hassan al-Majid, Sultan Hashim Ahmed and Hussein Rashid al-Tikriti are automatically converted to life imprisonment without any intervention from President Talabani.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/"><strong>Giovanni Di Stefano</strong></a> [lawyer for Ali Hassan al-Majid, dubbed &quot;Chemical Ali&quot;, <a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/">Studio Legale Internazionale</a>, Rome]: &quot;Al-Majid and 14 other former Saddam Hussein-era officials are on trial for their role in the government&#39;s violent response to the uprising, during which tens of thousands of civilians were killed. They are charged with crimes against humanity and will face the death penalty. The sentence of death passed upon Mr Al Majid for the conviction in what is known as the &#39;Anfal&#39; trial cannot be implimented because of the time restraints during Ramadan.<br /> <br />The strategy of the Iraqi Government is thus to continue with the ongoing trial at the Iraqi High Tribunal, commute the death sentence to one of life imprisonment for the &#39;Anfal&#39; conviction and to thus use the current trial to impose the sentence of death that could not be carried out owing to Ramadan.<br /> <br />The current trial is carried out without the defendants having appropriate lawyers of choice. The US Military has decided that Iraqi Lawyers will no longer be able to avail themselves of the security from the US Military/US Marshalls on arrival at Baghdad International Airport leaving the security arrangements with the Iraqi Ministry of Interior. Frankly, that is like allowing Charles Manson to babysit your teenage girl. Already many Iraqi Lawyers have endured murder, assaults, attacks, insults, threats, intimidation and without the necessary protection from the US Military the ongoing trials are yet continuing examples of a farce. The Iraqi Prosecutor has become a Persecutor and those facing trial are facing nothing short of a &#39;star chamber&#39; without rights and with a hanging judge worse than Judge Jeffreys.<br /> <br />This causes me considerable concern for the clients, the trials, and for justice per se.<br /> <br />I am calling upon the American Bar Association and the International Bar to levy pressure upon the US State and Defence Department to restore security to my colleagues without which their attendance at trial and in fact their presence in Baghdad make them living targets and unable to uphold the oath they took for the cause of justice.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="www.robertamsterdam.com"><strong>Robert R. Amsterdam</strong></a> [international defense counsel to Mikhail Khodorkovsky]: &quot;In <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/moscow-court-rules-new-khodorkovsky.php">the ongoing case</a> of the Russian government&#39;s persecution of my client Mikhail Khodorkovsky, two historical precedents have recently been set: one in Switzerland, and one in the Russian Federation. In the case of Khodorkovsky vs. the Swiss Federal Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office, the Federal Tribunal in August <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/swiss-high-court-rejects-handover-of.php">issued a decision</a> which, for the first time in that nation&#39;s history apart from extradition requests, determined that Switzerland was not going to render mutual legal assistance to another state because of human rights violations and the &quot;discriminatory and political nature&quot; of proceedings against a defendant. The defense takes the view that this landmark decision underscores the illegality of the continuing incarceration and persecution of Khodorkovsky, Platon Lebedev, and other Yukos-related defendants.<br /><br />The Swiss decision also specifically cited the ongoing incarceration of Khodorkovsky in far away Siberia as a key inference with respect to the politically motivated conduct of the Russian Federation. It was exceptionally clear it was unlawful and that there was no justification for the Russian authorities to place these defendants in virtual exile. The decision stated: &quot;This choice of a detention location, without any objective justification, cannot be understood otherwise than as a means of isolation.&quot; <br /><br />We would further underscore that Switzerland was in full possession of the fabricated new charges when it rendered this decision, and reasoned its refusal to cooperate in the investigation partly due to Russia&#39;s &quot;scattered and evasive&quot; responses to questions. <br /><br />In discussions this evening with my colleague on the defense team, Yuri Schmidt, concerning the latest proceedings in Russia, he asked that I alert American readers to the fact that since last April, the government has been obligated under Russian law to move Mikhail Khodorkovsky to Moscow. This legal responsibility has so far not been carried out by Russian authorities. Mr. Schmidt, one of Russia&#39;s most respected and senior counsels, stated that in his view, this conduct by the prosecutors was unprecedented in both Soviet and Russian history. He stated bluntly that &quot;the procuracy is placing itself higher than the courts.&quot;<br /><br />These developments in both Switzerland and in Russia continue to call attention to the necessity of urgent political action concerning the fate of Yukos-related defendants.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: Lee C. Bollinger is what you may call cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me.  His credentials as a law professor, a legal scholar of the First Amendment, the former dean of the University of Michigan Law School, and now the President of Columbia University have been incredible.  With these many feathers in his cap, one would bet Bollinger has mastered the art of dignified advocacy.  His indecorous manners in <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/07/09/lcbopeningremarks.html">challenging the Iranian President</a> at his Monday appearance at Columbia, however, caught many by surprise.<br /> <br />Ignoring the calls that Ahmadinejad, whose views on the holocaust are hurtful, should not be invited to a prestigious American university, Bollinger invoked the First Amendment to defend the invitation.  But once the Iranian President was captive on campus at Columbia, Bollinger turned on the guest.  With well-prepared ill-will and rehearsed abusive language, Bollinger squirted a barrage of curses, calling the Iranian President &quot;a petty and cruel dictator&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; a dishonorable man...stunningly uneducated &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; fanatical&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;ridiculous, and more.&quot;<br /><br />I wonder if Bollinger ever learned in the law school that curses do not make effective arguments. Imagine Bollinger with his abusive rhetoric in a court of law addressing a highly sophisticated jury. Imagine Bollinger with his abusive tongue combating with the opposing counsel in a hotly contested case.  Imagine Bollinger with his abusive words unleashing the Socratic dialogue on a student whose views Bollinger considers are extreme.  <br /><br />Judges repeatedly complain that too many lawyers fall for bad manners in advocating cases.  Most bad manners are bad speech manners, including inappropriate and insulting words.  The New York Lawyer&#39;s Code of Professional Responsibility demands that a lawyer be temperate and dignified.  Bollinger had the ability to be a much more effective advocate of the legitimate points he was making. Courteous language carries tremendous power to disarm a foe, including a professor from Tehran.  The disagreeable language allowed under the First Amendment is not critical for effective advocacy or a meaningful dialogue.  It now appears that the First Amendment Bollinger was invoking to defend the invitation was indeed for his own speech. See <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1016381">Advocacy under Islam and Common Law</a><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: President Pervez Musharraf is determined to reclaim the Pakistan Presidency for another term of five years.  Under Pakistan&#39;s Constitution, the President is elected by the members of an electoral college consisting of (a) the members of both Houses of the National Parliament; and (b) the members of the Provincial Assemblies.   The Presidential election is scheduled to take place on October 6, during the holy month of Ramadhan.  Numerous opposition leaders, who oppose the Presidential election, have been house arrested under preventive detention laws.<br /><br />The <u>timing</u> of the Presidential election is the critical issue that divides the public and political elites.  The President wishes to be re-elected by an electoral college that itself is up for elections in early 2008. The opposition argues that, consistent with democratic principles, the President must be elected by the incoming electoral college that will begin to function after the 2008 General Elections for both national and provincial assemblies.  The opposition further argues that the outgoing electoral college lacks the democratic mandate to choose a President for the next term.<br /><br />The Pakistan Supreme Court has been petitioned to scrap the constitutionally-suspect Presidential election on October 6. President Musharraf - who continues to simultaneously hold two offices, one military (he is still Army Chief) and the other civilian - has lost public confidence. His decisions to <a href="/forumy/2007/07/pakistan-needs-bold-decision-on.php">suspend</a> the Supreme Court Chief Justice and <a href="/forumy/2007/09/sharifs-lawless-deportation-from.php">deport</a> a legitimate political opponent, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, have tainted his good intentions for democracy. President Musharraf seems uncomfortable with credible political competition that constitutes the heart of authentic democracy.  <br /><br />The election for the highest office of the country must reflect the <u>current will of the people</u> expressed through their freely elected representatives.  When the general election for a new electoral college is only months away, obtaining a new Presidential term from the outgoing electoral college comes across as manipulation of the political process. The Supreme Court may conclude that such a move is subversion of democracy and the Constitution.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/"><strong>Giovanni Di Stefano</strong></a> [lawyer for Ali Hassan al-Majid, dubbed &quot;Chemical Ali&quot;, <a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/">Studio Legale Internazionale</a>, Rome]: &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2007/10/iraq-delaying-chemical-ali-execution.php">The &#39;delay&#39; on the execution</a> of Al majid et al is de facto a stay. <a href="/hotline/2007/09/al-majid-aka-chemical-ali-cannot-be.php">As I had stated</a> in my parere pro veritate, the Iraqi Government are precluded by religious law to execute anyone during Ramadan. Iraqi law supposedly requires executions to take place &#39;within 30 days from final sentence&#39; namely, any appeal court decision. In the case of Al Majid de jure he and his two co-defendants sentenced to death simply cannot be executed. <br /><br />However, the strategy of the Iraqi government is to permit him to proceed with the current trial upon which he is one of 14 indicted and sentence him to death for those offences. It is irrelevant whether or not he is guilty or innocent since the Iraqi High tribunal is not a fact finding court. It is a court that simply upholds the wishes of the Iraqi Government, the very offence upon which Saddam Hussein and Awwad Al bander (Chief Judge of the Revolutionary Court and both my clients) were convicted and executed! Mr Al Majid et al is not guilty of even 5% of the accusations involving use of chemicals. He is the victim of a media campaign that insisted on allocating &#39;nicknames&#39; that would identify indictees with certain offences. One wonders if &#39;Comical Ali&#39; had been indicted (he would have were he not of the Shia Religion) what his charges would have been? All in all the current trial process sees 14 Defendants without lawyers of their choice wholly contrary to the Statute of the Iraqi High Tribunal (Art.20). It can thus not qualify in any shape or form as a &#39;trial&#39; per se but a theatre of absurdities and farce.&quot;<br />

		<title>Justice for All: Automatically Restoring the Rights of Ex-Felons</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.missouri.edu/faculty/mitchelld.html">S. David Mitchell</a> of the University of Missouri-Columbia School of Law says that in light of the disproportionate and disparate effects of felon exclusion laws on individuals and their communities, ex-felons should have their rights restored automatically when they have completed their sentences...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidmitchell.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>&quot;W</strong></font>hat will Roger Goodell do?&quot; National pundits recently pondered this question, debating the fate of Michael Vick&#39;s career as a quarterback in the National Football League. The appropriate question should have been, &quot;As a convicted felon, will Vick lose any fundamental rights? And, &quot;What is the process required to get those rights restored?&quot; <br /><br />In Virginia, Vick will lose the right to vote; serve on a jury; or possess a firearm, to name a few. After he is unconditionally discharged, he will wait an additional five years before submitting a restoration of rights application to the Governor, who has the sole discretion to grant or deny his application. <br /><br />Vick&#39;s crimes were heinous, but the loss of fundamental rights is disproportionate to the offense. Ex-felons should have their civil rights restored automatically following their unconditional discharge from the criminal justice system. The statutory denial of rights to ex-felons after the completion of their sentence infringes upon their citizenship and the collective citizenship of the communities to which they eventually return. <br /><br />Following a felony conviction, an offender is subject not only to the criminal penalty associated with their offense but also &quot;civil disabilities&quot; that vary by jurisdiction. These disabilities, or felon exclusion laws, deprive ex-felons of a host of rights, most notably the right to vote. Other rights that ex-felons may lose are the right to serve on a jury, to hold public office, or to own a firearm. Some jurisdictions deny ex-felons the opportunity to apply for social welfare benefits; and, others allow a felony conviction to be used as a basis to deny either certain occupational licenses or employment in the public or private sector. A deprivation of any one of these substantive rights denies the ex-felon from becoming a full citizen, especially when viewed through the lens of T.H. Marshall&#39;s tripartite structure of citizenship.<br /><br />According to Marshall, citizenship consists of three interdependent parts &#8212; the political, the legal, and the social. The withholding of a right associated with any one these parts, such as the right to vote, deprives the ex-felon of full citizenship. No conviction should carry such a price, for &quot;[c]itizenship is not a license that expires upon misbehavior.&quot; Trop v. Dulles Secretary of State, et al., 356 U.S. 86, 92 (1957). Ex-felons are relegated to second-class citizenship because of the impact that felon exclusion laws have on them and their lives.<br /><br />The impact of the deprivations associated with felon exclusion laws is clear. When ex-felons are denied the right to vote, they are effectively silenced at the ballot box and are unable to choose political representation. When a felony conviction is used as a determining factor to deny employment, ex-felons face economic challenges. Felon exclusion laws focus on the status of the individual and not the offense committed. Thus, all persons convicted of a felony will lose the same set of rights predetermined by a given jurisdiction. Moreover, if an ex-felon moves, other jurisdictions often will not restore rights to an ex-felon unless the rights have been previously restored in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred. Consequently, the legal badge of dishonor that ex-felons wear as a result of their conviction follows them. More importantly, ex-felons are legally marginalized. While the laws have a direct impact on the lives of individual ex-felons, the laws collaterally impact the communities of which ex-felons are members.<br /><br />With the majority of ex-felons coming from low socio-economic communities or communities of color, these communities bear the disproportionate impact of felon exclusion laws. Felon exclusion laws deny the individual convicted felons rights and privileges and the aggregation of those affected individuals in specific communities directly impacts the political power, economic viability, and social stability of the larger communities to which they belong. When ex-felons are denied the right to vote, communities lose their voting power. Thus, the exclusion of these individuals is an additional deprivation that these communities must bear. Laws that prohibit ex-felons from exercising rights afforded others make them a dependent or &quot;invisible&quot; population; individuals released into the community who are denied the status of full citizens become &quot;invisible&quot; men, and increasingly &quot;invisible&quot; women. <br /><br />Felon exclusion laws disqualify from jury service a disproportionate number of individuals from lower socio-economic groups and from racial minorities. Consequently, members of those groups who are on trial are often denied the possibility of being tried by a jury of their peers. While the United States Supreme Court has stated that proportional representation is not necessary to create a fair jury, the lack of peers in a potential pool of jurors creates an unfair bias against a defendant; moreover, no quantity of protection during the voir dire process can alleviate that inequality. Ex-felons should not have a right to sit on a jury simply because they are ex-felons but because they have paid their debt to society and should be reinstated as full citizens. Communities with a large number of convicted felons are at a significant disadvantage because many of their members are excluded from political, civil, and social participation. <br /><br />While a legitimate argument may exist for withholding the rights of convicted felons who remain under the control of the criminal justice system, there is no legitimate purpose for denying the automatic restoration of rights to unconditionally discharged ex-felons, save one - retribution. To require an ex-felon to wait an additional period of time after having completed their sentence to regain rights is contrary to the fundamental tenet of criminal justice &#8212; paying one&#39;s debt to society. To deny the re-acquisition of these rights not only denies the individual membership but also impacts the collective membership of their communities. Membership in the United States as expressed through the possession of the right to vote has been jealously guarded since the nation&#39;s founding, requiring constitutional amendments in conjunction with legislative acts for all formerly excluded groups to be granted the right to vote, and be recognized as full citizens. Obstacles to full citizenship, such as poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, and whites-only primaries operated to exclude not only African-Americans but other underrepresented groups from full citizenship. While other forms of disenfranchisement and exclusionary practices have been eradicated, felon exclusion laws still persist. <br /><br />The time has come to for ex-felons to have their rights restored automatically when they have completed their sentences, thus contributing to the political, civil and social viability of disproportionately impacted communities. <br /><br /><br /><em>S. David Mitchell is a professor of law at the University of Missouri-Columbia</em>.<br />

Author of a leading treatise on constitutional law, he has written four books and more than 100 law review articles. In 2005, he was named by <em>Legal Affairs</em> as one of &quot;the top 20 legal thinkers in America.&quot; <br /><br />This is the latest chapter in the post September 11 attack on academic freedom under the guise of protecting security. Two weeks after 9/11, former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer cautioned Americans &quot;they need to watch what they say, watch what they do.&quot; The American Council of Trustees and Alumni, a group founded by Lynne Cheney and Senator Joe Lieberman, accused universities of being the weak link in the war on terror; it included the names of 117 &quot;un-American&quot; professors, students and staff members. A few months later, a blacklisting Internet cite called Campus Watch was launched. It publishes dossiers on scholars who criticize U.S. Middle East policy and Israel&#39;s treatment of the Palestinians. Earlier this year, the Bruin Alumni Association at UCLA offered students $100 to tape left-wing professors.<br /><br />In 2003, the American Association of University Professors recalled the &quot;still-vivid memories of the McCarthy era&quot; and warned of the perils of sacrificing academic freedom in the war on terror. The premise of their report was that &quot;freedom of inquiry and the open exchange of ideas are crucial to the nation&#39;s security, and that the nation&#39;s security and, ultimately, its well-being are damaged by practices that discourage or impair freedom.&quot; <br /><br />At a 2004 conference on academic freedom at UC Berkeley, Professor Beshara Doumani observed, &quot;Academic freedom in the United States is facing its most important threat since the McCarthy era of the 1950s. In the aftermath of 11 September 2001, government agencies and private organizations have been subjecting universities to an increasingly sophisticated infrastructure of surveillance, intervention, and control. In the name of the war against terrorism, civil liberties have been seriously eroded, open debate limited, and dissent stifled.&quot;<br /><br />Art. 9, &Acirc;&#167; 9 of the California Constitution, which sets forth the powers and duties of the Regents of the University of California, provides, &quot;The university shall be entirely independent of all political or sectarian influence and kept free therefrom in the appointment of its regents and in the administration of its affairs.&quot;<br /><br />Drake denied he was influenced by pressure from donors, politicians or the UC California Board of Regents. Yet psychology professor Elizabeth Loftus, a member of the search committee, told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> that Drake told the committee he was compelled to make the decision by outside forces whom he did not identify. Her account was confirmed by a second member of the committee, who talked to the Times on condition of anonymity. <br /><br />Chemerinsky has handled several cases in the appellate courts and the U.S. Supreme Court, and has testified many times before congressional and state legislative committees, including before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the Samuel Alito confirmation hearings. Chemerinsky has represented Valerie Plame Wilson, the CIA agent whose identity was revealed by members of the Bush administration; a Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainee asserting his right to habeas corpus; a man sentenced to 50 years-to-life under California&#39;s three strikes law; and a person challenging the Texas Ten Commandments monument.<br /><br />UCI&#39;s November 16, 2006 press release announcing the inauguration of the new law school said, &quot;UCI law graduates will be particularly encouraged to pursue careers in public service, including non-governmental organizations and philanthropic agencies. As part of their training, UCI law students will provide legal services to people who are unable to afford counsel. They also will be encouraged to pursue public interest law through programs focusing on underserved communities.&quot; Chemerinsky is devoted to public service as well as legal scholarship and education. He was elected by voters to be a Commissioner and chaired the Los Angeles Elected Charter Reform Commission; the new Charter was adopted by voters in 1999. He also spearheaded the Los Angeles Independent Analysis of the Board of Inquiry Report on the Rampart Police Scandal, Prepared at the Request of the Police Protective League, September 2000.<br /><br />Untold numbers of law students have been helped through law school and the bar exam by Chemerinsky, including National Lawyers Guild Student Vice President Teague Briscoe, who said, &quot;Chermerinsky on Constitutional Law saved my life in law school and I loved him doing the Professional Responsibility lectures but, most of all, I really dug that he was a progressive law prof who defends an unpopular client.&quot;<br /><br />David Dow, Adjunct lecturer at the Annenberg School of Journalism and former veteran CBS correspondent who frequently interviewed Chemerinksy on legal issues, said, &quot;I can&#39;t imagine any considerations that would outweigh the prospect of launching a law school with an internationally-known, highly-respected, fair-minded expert at the helm. Apart from his legal and professional credentials, Erwin has demonstrated an ability to get along well with colleagues and the community wherever he&#39;s been.&quot; Dow&#39;s words were echoed by Stanford Law School Dean Larry Kramer, who called Chemerinsky &quot;the nicest person in legal education.&quot; Conservative law professor Douglas Kmiec wrote of Chemerinsky, &quot;there is no person I would sooner trust to be a guardian of my constitutional liberty. Nor is there anyone I would sooner turn to for a candid, intellectually honest appraisal of an academic proposal.&quot;<br /><br />One of the &quot;controversial&quot; matters Drake cited to Chemerinsky was an August op-ed the professor wrote in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> criticizing a proposed regulation by then-Atty. Gen. Alberto Gonzales to shorten the time death row inmates have to file habeas corpus petitions. In an op-ed in the Sep. 14 <em>Times</em>, Chemerinsky explained, &quot;There are more than 275 individuals on death row in California without lawyers for their post-convictions proceedings. The effect of the new rule would be that many individuals, including innocent ones, would not get the chance to have their cases reviewed in federal court.&quot; <br /><br />Drake&#39;s action, which sends a clear message to academics that they must avoid speaking out or writing about controversial issues, is a threat to academic freedom. As Chemerinsky wrote, &quot;Without academic freedom, the reality is that many faculty members would be chilled and timid in expressing their views, and the discussion that is essential for the advancement of thought would be lost.&quot;<br /><br />Hundreds of faculty
, students and staff at UC Irvine are urging reinstatement of Chemerinsky. In an open letter to Drake, they wrote, &quot;We are disturbed because of the deep violation both of the integrity of the university and of the intrusion of outrageously one-sided politics and unacceptable ideological considerations into a hiring process that should be driven by academic excellence, administrative experience, leadership capacity, and personal integrity.&quot;<br /><br />Chancellor Michael Drake should immediately reinstate Professor Erwin Chemerinsky as dean of the UC Irvine Law School.<br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and president of the National Lawyers Guild.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.fordham.edu/ihtml/dir-2bioPP.ihtml?id=658&bid=1187">Alison Nathan</a> of Fordham University School of Law says that in the wake of the US Supreme Court&#39;s grant of <em>certiorari</em> in the <em>Baze v. Rees</em> Kentucky lethal injection case, the pending executions of inmates who have brought similar challenges should be put on hold...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alisonnathan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he U.S. Supreme Court made headlines on Tuesday when it announced that it would consider whether the 3-drug lethal injection protocol used to carry out executions in Kentucky is constitutional. Most reaction to the Court's grant of certiorari &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; some commentators have already called the case the highest profile this Term and the biggest death penalty case in decades &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; has focused on the significance of the case in light of the fact that most active death penalty states and the federal government employ a similar 3-drug protocol in their lethal injection procedures, suggesting that the Court's ruling on Kentucky's procedure could have widespread implications for the ability of states to continue carrying out lethal injection executions in the event the Court finds Kentucky's procedures unconstitutional. Here I argue that some of this initial reaction to <em>Baze</em> is overblown and I focus instead on two aspects of the case that have not received attention &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; one substantive and one procedural. First, I argue that the most significant issue in the case is that the Court will clarify by what <u>standard</u> challenges to methods of execution should be judged. Second, I contend that because our legal system values deliberate, even-handed justice and the rule of law, death row inmates with imminent execution dates who have brought challenges to the lethal injection protocols they face should have their cases stayed pending the outcome in the Kentucky case.<br /><br /><strong>The Key Issue In Baze</strong><br /><br />Tuesday morning the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it will consider directly for the first time in over 100 years a substantive Eighth Amendment challenge to a particular method of execution. The last time the Court took up such a challenge was in 1879 in the case of <em>Wilkerson v. Utah</em>, in which the Court considered and permitted an execution by firing squad in Utah. Tuesday, the Court agreed to hear the case of <em>Baze v. Rees</em>, a case brought by two Kentucky death row inmates who argue that Kentucky's three-drug lethal injection protocol violates the Eighth Amendment ban on "cruel and unusual" punishment. The death row inmates in <em>Baze</em> argue that Kentucky's methods and procedures for carrying out execution by lethal injection is likely to lead to excruciating pain prior to death and is, therefore, a cruel and unusual form of punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.<br /><br />In the time between the <em>Wilkerson</em> decision in 1879 and the Court's action Tuesday agreeing to hear the Baze case, the Supreme Court has weighed in only indirectly on issues pertaining to the constitutionality of methods of execution. For example, in the 1890 case <em>In re Kemmler</em>, the Supreme Court allowed New York to carry out a capital sentence by electrocution&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;at the time a brand new and seemingly technologically advanced method of execution&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;after concluding that the Eighth Amendment did not apply to the states (a conclusion that the Court has subsequently reversed in a 1962 case) and then deferring to the New York state legislature's determination that the method was humane. And in <em>Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber</em>, decided in 1947, the Supreme Court concluded that <em>Louisiana</em> could go forward with a second attempt to electrocute defendant Willie Francis, even though the state's first attempt had failed to bring about his death. Because the Eighth Amendment issue was only indirectly implicated in these cases, they do not provide a clear and consistent articulation of what standard governs the evaluation of such a claim.<br /><br />Similarly, although recent years have seen a dramatic increase in state and lower federal court challenges to lethal injection as a method of execution, the Supreme Court's involvement in this issue has been confined to procedural questions. In 2004 and 2006 in the cases of <em>Nelson v. Campbell</em> and <em>Hill v. McDonough</em>, the Supreme Court issued procedural rulings allowing challenges to lethal injection to go forward in the lower courts. This is precisely what has occurred. In the wake of <em>Nelson and Hill</em>, litigation in several states has progressed at a responsible pace: many litigants have brought challenges at early stages and often without an imminent execution date looming, courts have granted evidentiary hearings to allow discovery and the taking of testimony from relevant witnesses and experts, and some states have taken initiative in examining and improving their own executions procedures. This state by state consideration of the issue and development of humane procedures is consistent with federalism and the Court's approach to other death penalty issues. The Court's determination in <em>Baze</em> should not undermine this on-going process. Moreover, the Supreme Court's evaluation of the Kentucky procedures in <em>Baze</em> can have only limited applicability to the evolving reform efforts already well underway in the other states.<br /><br />What is notably lacking from the state by state evaluation and reform process, however, is a uniform substantive standard by which lower courts can engage in the analysis. For example, some cases suggest that the standard is whether the procedures produce an "unnecessary risk" of pain, while others suggest that execution procedures should be evaluated by a standard that gauges whether there is "a substantial risk of the wanton infliction of pain." There are two very different standards that could lead to disparate results. It is for this reason, that of the questions in the <em>Baze</em> petition for <em>certiorari</em> that the Supreme Court granted on Tuesday, the most crucial one is the first, which asks: "Does the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibit means for carrying out a method of execution that create an unnecessary risk of pain and suffering as opposed to only a substantial risk of the wanton infliction of pain?" In other words, what standard should courts use to evaluate execution procedures and protocols in a particular state? Although identical execution procedures need not be imposed on states, a uniform federal standard under the Eighth Amendment is plainly required.<br /><br /><strong>Executions Scheduled Before the Decision in Baze</strong><br /><br />Another issue that is just beginning to emerge in the wake of the Court's Tuesday grant in <em>Baze</em>, involves the procedural question of what should happen to other death row inmates who have unsuccessfully challenged lethal injection and who face execution between now and the time the Supreme Court issues a ruling in <em>Baze</em>, which will most likely be in the spring of 2008. Given an average national execution rate of approximately one person per week, it is reasonable to presume that about one to two dozen people in various states around the country will be in this position. What should happen to them?<br /><br />These executions should be put on hold until the Court decides the Baze case. Executing a death row inmate while the Supreme Court is deliberating on the appropriate standard by which to assess the constitutionality of a method of execution and while a lethal injection protocol is being squarely considered by the U.S. Supreme Court offends basic n
otions of fairness and even-handed justice and serves only an unwarranted rush to execution. Once the Supreme Court issues a decision in <em>Baze</em>, states will have the opportunity to evaluate the execution procedures that are emerging from the state by state reform effort and executions can then go forward.<br /><br /><strong>Stays of Execution</strong><br /><br />The issue of pending lethal injection executions that are scheduled to take place between now and when the Supreme Court issues a decision in Baze can come up in one of three ways. First, a defendant facing imminent execution may be able to file a motion in state court seeking a stay of execution pending a decision in <em>Baze</em>. State courts should grant such a stay since the resolution of the issue in <em>Baze</em> will most likely impact the standard by which other lethal injection procedures are evaluated. If the highest court in a state does grant or affirm such a stay in the meantime, that stay must remain in place until <em>Baze</em> is decided. The U.S. Supreme Court has jurisdiction to intervene in state cases that raise federal constitutional issues only once a state court has issued a "final judgment." If a state court enters an interlocutory order staying an execution, it is not a final judgment and the U.S. Supreme Court cannot vacate such a stay. Indeed, I can find no instance in which the Supreme Court has vacated an interlocutory stay of execution entered by a state court.<br /><br />The second possibility involves the federal courts. If a state court has no avenues open for staying an execution pending a decision in <em>Baze</em>, a death row inmate may seek a stay of execution from a federal court. Once again, a federal court should issue such a stay since the outcome of <em>Baze</em> will likely impact other lethal injection challenges. If such a stay is granted and affirmed on appeal by a federal appellate court, then the Supreme Court again should deny any effort by a state prosecutor or attorney general to seek to have that stay "vacated." Although the Supreme Court has in the past occasionally vacated stays of execution issued by lower federal courts, its jurisdictional authority to do so is questionable. In the past, the Court has seemingly relied on 28 U.S.C.&Acirc;&#167; 1651, otherwise known as the "All Writs Act," to vacate federal court granted stays of execution. But the All Writs Act exists in order for the Supreme Court to take steps necessary to preserve its jurisdiction, not eliminate any future possibility of such jurisdiction. By allowing a lethal injection execution to go forward before the <em>Baze</em> decision is issued, there will be no possibility of future jurisdiction for the simple and significant reason that the execution of that death row inmate prior to the <em>Baze</em> decision will moot the issue.<br /><br />Finally, failing state court or lower federal court intervention, death row inmates facing imminent execution dates may seek a stay of execution from the U.S. Supreme Court itself. For the same reasons discussed above, the Supreme Court should grant such a stay request and hold in abeyance any such cases pending the outcome in <em>Baze</em>. Especially where the death penalty is concerned, our justice system must appear to value and genuinely value deliberateness and even-handedness over speed and finality. If past practice is a guide, there will likely be at least four votes on the Supreme Court to issue such a stay (pursuant to the "Rule of Four," four votes were all that was necessary for the Court to grant review in the <em>Baze</em> case). Although technically five votes are necessary to grant a stay, as other commentators have long noted, having an execution go forward and moot itself out despite a sufficient number of votes available to hear the case, is unseemly and unfair.<br /><br />However the Supreme Court rules in <em>Baze</em> this coming Spring, our enviable and careful system of criminal justice requires pausing until that time executions of inmates who have brought similar challenges.<br /><br /><br /><em>Alison J.

In the conflict that has since ensued between the Iraqi oil minister and the KRG regarding the legality of the contract is a lesson in the limits of law in nearly stateless societies and the consequent difficulties that would attend any legally sanctioned partition of Iraq. The dispute calls into question the growing call for a form of loose federalism for Iraq, often on the basis of the success of the Kurdish region. It turns out, from the Hunt Oil example, that the matter of separation is not so easy, in the absence of strong, central, national institutions of law that almost presuppose communities working together rather than apart. Let&#39;s begin with the constitution, which will frame the legal debate in the Hunt Oil case, which will in turn demonstrate the entire fallacy of the loose federalism position.<br /><br />The advocates and detractors of loose Iraqi federalism sometimes fail to mention that the current Constitution of Iraq already provides for the possibility of the state envisioned by the loose federalists. Article 110 of the Constitution restricts the exclusive power of the national government to a very limited set of issues dealing with foreign exchange, coinage, national defense, a mail system, citizenship and related matters. Article 114 then mentions broader shared powers between the national government and substate entities known as regions (&#39;aqaleem), and Article 115 makes clear that regional laws have priority over national laws, ultimately meaning that the national government only has effective control over the very narrow list of matters contained in Article 110. The real issue, then, is whether the Shi&#39;i and Sunni populations outside of Baghdad (which is the one province that cannot form an autonomous region under Article 124), currently divided into &quot;provinces&quot; (muhafadhat), will seek to have their own regions as per the Kurdish example, as is contemplated by Article 119. If the provinces were to elect to do this, then a model of loose federalism would be achieved. It would be a rather destructive form of loose federalism, however, one that would extend well beyond what proponents in the United States desire and an almost sure catalyst for future conflict.<br /><br />The reason for this is, unsurprisingly, oil. Even the loose federalists realize the necessity of sharing natural resources on a national basis, or the resource poor Sunni regions would almost be sure to object to the federal divisions. The latest convert to the loose federalism cause, <em>New York Times</em> columnist Thomas Friedman, therefore refers to Baghdad as the &quot;cash register&quot; that would dispense money to the regions.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Friedman and his loose federalism allies, however, the constitution, by Kurdish demand, calls for something considerably less than this. Articles 111 and 112 are the compromise drawn between the Kurds and the Shi&#39;a, the primary drafters of Iraq&#39;s constitution, on the issue of natural resources. First of all, not all natural resources are covered by Articles 111 and 112, but only oil and gas. Phosphates, which have been described as a potentially profitable by some, lie beyond the purview of these Articles and therefore are under regional control. More importantly, while Article 111 indicates that oil and gas are the property of the entire Iraqi people, Article 112 indicates that management of &quot;existing fields&quot; (al-huqul al-haliya) of oil and gas is under the control of the national government (along with the governments of the regions in question) and that the oil from these fields be shared on a per capita basis, with certain limited exceptions in favor of areas particularly devastated by the actions of the Saddam regime. This presumably leaves new oil fields to be managed as the regions would like. How distribution of revenues might work for new oil fields seems more difficult to determine, given that Article 111 declares oil and gas to be the property of all of the Iraqi people and Article 112 only mentions equitable distribution of oil and gas from existing fields. In any event, some form of consultation with the national government seems necessary, because, among other things, Article 112 also provides that the national government together with the regions and provinces that have national resources are supposed to set oil and gas policy.<br /><br />Thus, under the Constitution, the KRG seems to have the better legal argument respecting its deal with Hunt Oil, which was signed, it should be noted, after the KRG passed its own oil and gas law. Baghdad appears to have no exclusive sovereignty over the exploration of new fields. Moreover, the question of appropriate revenue distribution under the Constitution is not at issue because the KRG&#39;s oil and gas law requires national distribution of any revenues received, and the KRG has pledged to adhere to this in connection with the Hunt Oil deal. <br /><br />Yet while the oil minister hardly seems to be in a very strong legal position to block the deal, surely the KRG&#39;s response to his claims, which are that the minister should tend to his own affairs and deal with the substantial problems inherent in the oil industry outside of Kurdistan, is hardly legally defensible as well. If these resources are truly the property of the Iraqi people, and oil policy is decided in connection with the national government, then surely some form of oversight, monitoring or at least extensive detailed consultation with the national government is necessary. How else is the national government to know what oil is part of the &quot;existing fields&quot;, whether the figures respecting barrels sold are accurate, along which pipelines the oil is sent, and so forth. Even the terms of the deal have not been disclosed publicly, information that would be vital to setting oil policy. <br /><br />To date, the parties have not engaged in meaningful dialogue of any kind on these matters, at least in public. This writing so far as I know is the only one that even begins to touch on the legal issues in any depth. The oil minister and the KRG have made clear their differing views on the legality of the deal, without providing the basis for their positions. And the dispute has not yet involved the Sunni Arabs who are neither in government nor in the Kurdish region in large numbers and who are therefore likely to be even more opposed to the oil deal, let alone any future oil deal signed by a potential Shi&#39;i region. This is hardly an encouraging start to the development of the industry.<br /><br />One can imagine myriad ways in which disputes of this sort could be resolved. The parties could meet and seek to reach some sort of agreement respecting the level of control Baghdad should have over new oil fields. They could define by legislation what is and is not an existing field. They could organize a program of oil exploration and industry development with input from both national and regional sources to the satisfaction of all parties. Alternatively, they could rely on national courts, or create alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, to address thei
r differences. <br /><br />The paradox, being, of course, that this requires the very spirit of trust and mutual cooperation whose absence in Iraq is the very appeal of the loose federalist vision. If the trust were to somehow emerge, loose federalism would be irrelevant. In the absence of trust, as the Hunt Oil dispute shows, loose federalism is impossible. In considering the legal difficulties that lie ahead for revenue sharing, as represented in microcosm by the Hunt Oil case, and the odd expectation of loose federalists that these matters can be overcome while Iraq&#39;s communities will continue to be at odds with one another, I am reminded of the economist who found himself on a desert island with only a single, unopened can of food. His solution, much like that of the loose federalists, was seductively appealing in its simplicity, elegance and logic. &quot;I&#39;ll just assume a can opener,&quot; he said.<br /><br /><br /><em>Haider Ala Hamoudi is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that constitutional questions remaining after the Pakistan Supreme Court&#39;s recent ruling that President Pervez Musharraf may contest the upcoming Pakistan presidential election as the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces are sufficiently significant to warrant a Supreme Court stay of the scheduled October 6 vote...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n September 28, the Pakistan Supreme Court ruled that President Pervez Musharraf may contest the Presidential election as the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. This ruling, though constitutionally discomforting and democratically disappointing, does not resolve a more serious constitutional question: whether an outgoing Pakistani electoral college may lawfully elect a President for the next five-year term. <br /><br />The opposition parties represented in the national Parliament and provincial assemblies are threatening to boycott the poll to undermine legitimacy of the Presidential election. They are also weighing to dissolve the provincial assembly of the Northern Province to further delegitimize the election. All these developments will raise novel constitutional questions. Even if these events do not occur, lawyers will hopefully petition the Supreme Court for temporary injunction against the Presidential election scheduled to be held on October 6. <br /><br /><strong>The Northern Province</strong> <br /><br />If the Northern Province Assembly is dissolved, the Supreme Court must step in to protect the integrity of the electoral college by staying the Presidential election. The Pakistan Constitution furnishes an electoral college that elects the President. The electoral college consists of members of both houses of the national Parliament and members of the four provincial assemblies (Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, and the Northern Province). <br /><br />Provincial assemblies play an important role in the Presidential election. The votes that Presidential candidates obtain in provincial assemblies are not counted but calculated. These votes are calculated according to a mathematical formula to prevent highly populated provinces, such as Punjab and Sindh, with larger assemblies from having a disproportionate share in the election outcome. According to a mathematical formula, a vote in a smaller assembly carries more weight than a vote in a larger assembly. The weight assignment neutralizes the size of the assembly. Thus, each provincial assembly ends up having an equal stake in the presidential election.<br /><br />If the Northern Province Assembly is dissolved, one fourth of the provincial part of the electoral college will cease to exist, undermining the constitutional architecture under which each province, regardless of its population, must have an equal say in electing the President. Of course, no province may claim a veto to undo the Presidential election. And a provincial assembly&#39;s dissolution should be no automatic basis to stay the Presidential election. The argument involving the Northern Province, however, is much more complex than a simple non-participation of its assembly.<br /><br />Under the circumstances prevailing in Pakistan, the Northern Province is most critical to the peace and security of Pakistan. The Province houses conservative religious forces that for pragmatic reasons must not be alienated. Furthermore, due to its ethnic, linguistic, and geographical proximity with Afghanistan, the Northern Province must be politically engaged, not estranged, to stem violence. The exclusion of the Northern Province from the Presidential election will strengthen the hands of foreign forces, including the Taliban. <br /><br /><strong>The Democratic Argument</strong><br /><br />Even if the Northern Province Assembly is not dissolved - which will be a politically mature thing to do - the existing electoral college lacks political legitimacy to elect a President for the next five-year term. The election boycott by opposition parties will simply add to the legitimacy conundrum. The existing electoral college will soon complete its full term and stand dissolved in about three months. The general elections for both the national Parliament and provincial assemblies are scheduled to be held in January, 2008. <br /><br />A Presidential election must represent the current will of the people. A President elected by an outgoing electoral college will have little legitimacy and respect among the newly elected representatives of the people. This lack of legitimacy may weaken the President&#39;s efficacy to discharge constitutional duties. A President with doubtful legitimacy at the beginning of a new election cycle is an odd state practice that must not be allowed to happen.<br /><br />Furthermore, a Presidential election by an outgoing electoral college disrupts the constitutional role of provinces in choosing the President. Although the President elected by an outgoing electoral college may be removed after the general elections, the removal procedures do not require provincial participation. A President may be removed by two-thirds of the total membership of both houses of the national Parliament. The provinces play no constitutional role in removing the President. <br /><br />The October 6 election will deprive the new provincial assemblies from having any say in the choice of the President. They will have played no role in electing the President because the previous assemblies have already elected a President for them. If the national parliament after the general elections chooses to remove the President, the provincial assemblies will be unable to add their voices in removing or retaining the President because, as stated above, the Constitution assigns them no role in the removal procedure. This complete disabling of the new provincial assemblies from the Presidential election is a serious subversion of the Constitution.<br /><br />It appears that the lawyers of Pakistan have a constitutional obligation to bring these facts to the notice of the Supreme Court through a procedurally sound constitutional petition. The Supreme Court is under a constitutional obligation to consider these complex matters with due process in a full hearing. Meanwhile, the Court may issue a temporary injunction to stay the Presidential election. This injunction will allow President Musharraf to continue to discharge his duties under the Constitution until a new electoral college comes into being through free and fair elections. <br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan grew up in Pakistan and is a law graduate of Punjab University, Lahore.

<span style="font-size: medium"><b>T</b></span>he UN General Assembly's adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples on September 13, 2007 marked the end of a long journey, a milestone in the long and arduous march of what have come to be known as "indigenous peoples" through the major institution of organized intergovernmental society: the United Nations. It was a day of celebration for indigenous leaders and their rank and file scattered around the globe, united in a common fate of conquest, dispossession, marginalization and neglect, but also in the joy of rising again.

When the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations was established in 1982, one of its key missions was the establishment of a declaration of rights of indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples from around the world trekked to the Palais des Nations in Geneva each summer afterwards to articulate their claims to the members of the Working Group and state delegations. In 1993, under the inspirational leadership of long-time Chairperson Mrs. Erica-Irene Daes, agreement was reached by the Working Group on a "Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples." This draft became the basis for discussion within the UN Commission on Human Rights, which was replaced in 2006 by the Human Rights Council. In its first substantive decision, the Council on June 29, 2006, by a vote of 30 in favor, 2 against and 12 abstentions, adopted a revised text of the Declaration, and passed it on to the General Assembly for its final approval.

Beyond recognition of the right to self-determination, the Council's text formulated an array of tailor-made collective rights, such as the right to maintain and develop their distinct political, economic, social and cultural identities and characteristics as well as their legal systems and to participate fully, "if they so choose," in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the State. They were guaranteed the right not to be subjected to genocide or ethnocide, i.e., action aimed at or affecting their integrity as distinct peoples, their cultural values and identities, including the dispossession of land, forced relocation, assimilation or integration, the imposition of foreign lifestyles and propaganda. The stated rights guaranteed to indigenous peoples as groups, not only as individual persons, include the right to observe, teach and practice tribal spiritual and religious traditions; the right to maintain and protect manifestations of their cultures, archaeological-historical sites and artifacts; the right to restitution of spiritual property taken without their free and informed consent, including the right to repatriate Indian human remains; and the right to protection of sacred places and burial sites. Further listed are the rights to maintain and use tribal languages, to transmit their oral histories and traditions, to education in their language and to control over their own educational systems. They are afforded the right to maintain and develop their political, economic and social systems, and to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their right to development. Their treaties with States should be recognized, observed and enforced. Last, but not least, the Declaration supports the right of indigenous people to own, develop, control, and use the lands and territories which they have traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used, including the right to restitution of lands confiscated, occupied or otherwise taken without their free and informed consent, with the option of providing just and fair compensation wherever such return is not possible. The document, in particular, goes beyond ILO Convention No. 169 in its statements on self-determination, land and resource rights, as well as political autonomy.

With very few changes to this content — amendments that essentially emphasized already existing constraints on the right to self-determination and recognized the diversity of contexts - the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/indigenous/declaration.htm">Declaration</a> was adopted last month by a landslide affirmative vote of 144 states in the United Nations General Assembly. Only four countries - the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - voted against it, while Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burundi, Colombia, Georgia, Kenya, Nigeria, Russia, Samoa and Ukraine abstained.

The political significance of this remarkable success of the indigenous peoples' movement cannot be understated. The United Nations can be justly proud of this day. What, however, is the legal effect of this instrument?

For one, a formal analysis of the Declaration dictates that it does not have legally binding effect <em>per se</em>. That is true for any, non-budget related resolution of the General Assembly. Yet, the name "Declaration" appears to give it a more solemn ring, takes it closer to most important policy statements of the organized world community — into the vicinity of instruments such as the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While these documents are clearly not binding as treaties, individual component prescriptions of them might have become binding if they can be categorized as reflective or generative of customary international law.

States voting against this document, including the U.S., have rejected "any possibility that this document is or can become customary international law." They stated that it does not constitute "evidence of customary international law," as lacking support in state practice, and that it cannot provide "a proper basis for legal actions, complaints, or other claims in any international, domestic, or other proceedings."

This statement is true as it pertains to the non-binding nature of the Declaration itself. As far as it proclaims the absence of state practice in support of the content of the Declaration, the individual rights pronounced, it needs to be independently assessed -- just like any other claim to the customary international law character <em>vel non</em> of any new rule. In the case of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the negative vote by four governments, even though they have a significant number of indigenous peoples living in their midst, does not necessarily invalidate the claims to the customary international law character of individual key parts of the instrument or of principles embedded in it. This distinct body of customary international law concerning indigenous peoples, not necessarily coextensive with the full reach of the present Declaration, had formed long before this vote occurred. The starting-point for any such analysis is the ICJ's definition of the requirements needed to establish new customary international law, as stated in the North Sea Continental Shelf Case, i.e. there needs to be a very widespread and representative state practice in support of the purported new rule, including the s
pecially affected states, as well as a feeling to be obligated (<em>opinio juris</em>).

In analyzing the individual parts of the Declaration, we see that all new rules of customary international law, as found in our respective surveys of state and international practice of <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss12/index.shtml">1999</a>, <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss14/williams.shtml">2001</a>, and 2004, still remain part of the global consensus. As stated in 1999, "indigenous peoples are entitled to maintain and develop their distinct cultural identity, their spirituality, their language, and their traditional ways of life." Most of the provisions of the Declaration go to the preservation of culture, language, religion, and identity; and state practice in the states with indigenous peoples largely conforms to these legal tenets. Due to the strength of the indigenous renascence throughout the world, the original goal of assimilation of indigenous cultures into the maelstrom of the modern world has largely been abandoned in favor of preservation and reinvigoration of indigenous cultures, languages and religions. The legal guarantees of these claims are, however, not the real bones of contention.

One of the issues in contention remains the definition and extent of the right to self-determination. Due to the insistence of the African governments, this right was expressly conditioned by the principles favoring the territorial integrity and political unity of states, principles that are not absolute and that already conditioned the right of self-determination under international law. Now, very few, if any, indigenous peoples actually had asked for anything approaching a threat to the territorial integrity or political unity of existing states. The goal of "indigenous sovereignty," in particular, was mostly defined in the sense of cultural and spiritual reaffirmation much more than in the Western sense of independent political power. Looking at state practice, very widespread agreement persists, as stated in 1999, that indigenous peoples "hold the right to political, economic and social self-determination, including a wide range of autonomy and the maintenance and strengthening of their own system of justice." Even the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, in the <a href="http://www.diplomacymonitor.com/stu/dm.nsf/dn/dn9694A1E7EC293A8585257355006729CE">explanation of its negative vote</a>, pointed out that the "U.S. government recognizes Indian tribes as political entities with inherent powers of self-government as first peoples. In our legal system, the federal government has a government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes. In this domestic context, this means promoting tribal self-government over a broad range of internal and local affairs, including determination of membership, culture, language, religion, education, information, social welfare, maintenance of community safety, family relations, Economic [sic] activities, land and resources management, environment and entry by non-members, as well as ways and means for financing these autonomous functions." This means at least the recognition of indigenous peoples' control over their people within their lands. Canada, now an opponent, but under its previous government a longtime and fervent proponent of the Declaration, has guaranteed widespread autonomy via the concept of aboriginal and treaty rights in its 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, in exchange for the Crown's sovereignty over New Zealand, the Maori retained what they called rangatiratanga, i.e. their chiefs' authority, which included their power to own, use and manage Maori lands and other resources according to Maori ways. Colombia, a state abstaining from the Declaration, has accorded indigenous peoples in their various resguardos far-reaching rights of internal autonomy. Its 1991 Constitution guarantees respect for their institutions of self-government, including indigenous courts applying traditional customary standards.

The same is true for our finding according to which indigenous peoples have a right under customary international law to "demarcation, ownership, development, control and use of the lands they have traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used." This customary norm, found partly as the result of our global surveys of state practice, was cited by the Inter-American Commission in its referral of the Awas Tingni community's complaint against Nicaragua to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The norm underlies the Inter-American Court's interpretation of the right to property under Article 21 of the American Convention on Human Rights in its landmark decision in the <em>Awas Tingni Case</em> of August 31, 2001. Once a rule has attained the status of customary international law, it can only be abrogated by a new norm of customary law. This year, the African states dropped their initial lack of comfort with the land rights provisions of the Declaration.

The domestic practice of the four states opposing the Declaration likewise is not opposed to the principle of recognizing indigenous peoples' right to lands. Australia's courts had invigorated the international indigenous peoples' movement with their decisions in <em>Mabo</em> and <em>Wik</em>, which preceded the Native Title Act and land settlements with Aboriginal peoples. The Canadian government had proceeded with land settlement claims and treaties; and the U.S., in its Observations on the Declaration, only objected to what it perceived to be the "overly broad and inconsistent" language of the provisions on land and resources. It maintained that the "intent of the States in the Working Group was to encourage the establishment of mechanisms at the national level for the full legal recognition and protection of the lands, territories and resources indigenous peoples possess by reason of traditional ownership, occupation, or use, as well [as] those which they have otherwise acquired. Furthermore, it was intended that such recognition should take into account the customs, traditions, and land tenure systems of the indigenous peoples concerned." Thus, any potential disagreement with the Declaration is a matter of a possibly limiting interpretation, not a denial of the right itself.

Furthermore, no state opposed the provision of the Declaration that mandates the observance of treaties between States and indigenous peoples. That is in line with our finding according to which "governments are to honor and faithfully observe their treaty commitments to indigenous nations."

The U.S. has also stated that the declaration's "failure to define the phrase "indigenous peoples" is "debilitating to the effective application and implementation of the declaration." "This obvious shortcoming will subject application of the declaration to endless debate, especially if entities not properly entitled to such status seek to enjoy the special benefits and rights contained in the declaration." One of us had made this argument years ago and suggested an appropriate definition, while the other favors the flexibility retained in the Declaration as passed. The most interesting aspect of the U.S. argument is, however, the at least implicit recognition that indigenous peoples do have a "status," that they enjoy "special benefits and rights contained in the declaration." Somehow, that does not sit well with the other U.S. argument that it be solely an "aspirational declaration with political and moral, rather than legal, force." The language of "rights" and "status" is the language of law. By participating in this process and the concern shown over the years for special rights and status of indigenous peoples on the international plane, the four opposing states have demonstrated an <em>opinio juris</em>, a willingness to be bound if the provisions as finally formulated were in line with their detailed policy preferences.

In any event, only a <em>jus cogens</em> norm requires virtual unanimity of all member
s of the world community. The internal practice of the four opposing states, as well as their consent to accord a special status and rights to indigenous peoples in principle, makes them part of the world consensus on customary international law as formulated above. At most, they can be considered persistent objectors to certain contents of the Declaration. This status appears to be very much in doubt, however, at least for Canada, as it counted itself through many years amongst the staunchest supporters of the Declaration and indigenous peoples' rights — until its government changed in February 2006.

The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the customary law character <em>vel non</em> of the various rights it proclaims will be analyzed in further detail by a new International Law Association Committee on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. As Chair and Member of this body, we look forward to your comments and suggestions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Geoffrey_Corn.htm">Geoffrey S. Corn</a>, Lt. Col. US Army (Ret.) and former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters, now a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that effectively controlling the exponential increase in US reliance on civilian contractors in foreign military operations requires greater clarity regarding the legal limits of what functions these civilians may perform...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/geoffreycornnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>R</strong></font>ecent events in Iraq involving the conduct of Blackwater contractors providing security for U.S. diplomats in Iraq have once again shone the light of controversy on the role and legal status of civilian contractors. Although these particular contractors were working for the Department of State and not the military, they and the organization they work for have come to symbolize the historically unprecedented role civilians are playing in support of U.S. military operations. These civilians have become an indispensable ingredient in the projection of U.S. military power and the execution of U.S. military operations. A numerical comparison between the first Gulf War and the ongoing Iraq conflict illustrates this point: during the Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm), the ratio of military to civilian contractor was 60:1; today, there are actually more civilian contractors employed by the U.S. in Iraq than uniformed personnel.<br /><br />Contrary to the perception created by the focus on Blackwater, the vast majority of these civilians are not performing what most observers would classify as "combatant" functions. Instead, they provide a vast array of support services, ranging from transportation to food preparation. However, a proverbial triangulation of three factors are unquestionably pushing civilians ever closer to performing functions traditionally reserved for members of the armed forces. These three factors include the seemingly endless demands on military commanders to do "more with less"; the limited numbers of uniformed forces available to commanders to accomplish this goal; and the relatively unlimited availability of civilians and the dollars to hire them to augment the functions of the uniformed forces. This use of contractors to fill the vacuum produced by the downsizing of the armed forces can be summed up in what military commanders would refer to as increasing the "tooth to tail" ratio &#8212; maximizing the availability of military personnel to perform combatant functions by relying on civilians to perform support functions. Unfortunately, as the operational demands on our forces continue unabated, the line between the "tooth" and the "tail" is invariably stressed.<br /><br />The Secretary of Defense is, according to news reports, unhappy with his Department&#39;s oversight of contractors in Iraq. As the fact-finding team he dispatches to Iraq begins to wade into these murky waters, they will discover not only that it is obviously easier to "hire" civilians to work for the military in Iraq than it is to expand the armed forces, but also that there is very little clarity on the legal limits of what functions these civilians may perform.<br /><br />It would seem axiomatic that the law that regulates the conduct of military operations &#8212; the law of war &#8212; would clearly prohibit the use of civilian support personnel for anything close to a "combatant" function. This, however, is not the case. Instead, for decades the prohibition on using civilians to perform such functions has been inferred from a provision of the law of war that is focused on permissible targets, and not permissible civilian functions. Known as the "direct participation in hostilities" rule, and derived from Article 51 of Additional Protocol I to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, this "rule" posits that civilians are prohibited from taking a direct part in hostilities. However, Article 51 contains no such prohibition. Instead, this provision of the law of war simply establishes the pragmatic rule that the immunity from direct attack provided to any civilian is forfeited if and when the civilian takes a direct part in hostilities. Accordingly, Article 51 is a rule of consequence, and not a rule of prohibition.<br /><br />If the meaning of "direct part in hostilities" was universally understood, this "prohibition by inference" would prove sufficient to establish a meaningful line of demarcation between permissible and impermissible civilian support functions. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Instead, there is no accepted definition of this term. In fact, the International Committee of the Red Cross working in conjunction with some of the most distinguished law of war experts in the world has been attempting for several years &#8212; unsuccessfully &#8212; to develop such an accepted definition. As a result, the meaning of "direct participation", and the accordant limit on the permissible role for civilian contractors, has been left to case by case determination. Such an approach would probably still be effective if military commanders could call upon sufficient numbers of uniformed personnel to meet operational requirements. Indeed, most commanders would probably prefer a force composed entirely of military personnel in order to ensure maximum command, control, and discipline. However, when the numbers of available military forces is as limited as it is today, the pressure to achieve operational goals creates a real risk of using this malleable direct participation test to push civilians ever closer to traditional combatant functions, particularly for an armed force as dependant on technological sophistication as ours.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that there is no universal agreement on the meaning of "direct participation in hostilities", there is virtually no dispute that such a line must be drawn somewhere. Practitioners and scholars do universally agree that the law of war prohibits the wholesale civilianization of the battlefield. From the perspective of the U.S. armed forces, this principle is reflected not only in the continuing effort to make the direct participation rule work, but also in federal acquisition regulations prohibiting the use of contractors to perform "inherently governmental functions" &#8212; another concept that although ill-defined is based on the assumption that certain battlefield functions are legally reserved to members of the armed forces. <br /><br />What is therefore needed to begin to effectively control the exponential reliance on civilian contractors is a more effective and predictable "test". As I have proposed in a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=895525">forthcoming article</a>, this test must acknowledge the underlying logic of the direct participation standard. However, it is essential to also recognize that because this standard is based on a rule of consequence, and not an express prohibition against using civilians to perform "direct participation" functions, its application is potentially under-inclusive and subject to manipulation (for example, how does the "consequence" rule apply when the civilian contractor is advised of, and accepts the risk of being targeted by an opponent. Does this justify the use of a civilian to perform a direct participation function?).<br /><br />The alternate test I have proposed is called the functional discretion test. The focus of this test is compliance with the laws and customs of war. In application, each proposed civilian function would be assessed to determine whether abuse of discretion in execution of the function would likely result in a violation of the law of war. To illustrate, consider an interrogation facility, with a proposal to contract civilians to act as both translators and interrogators. The
 scope of discretion related to translation involves the meaning of words and phrases. Abuse of this discretion might result in inaccurate information, but is unlikely to result in a war crime. However, the scope of discretion related to interrogation involves the methods used to obtain information. It is clear that abuse of that discretion creates a very high risk of committing a war crime. Accordingly, the translator function may be civilianized, but the interrogator function should be reserved to a member of the armed forces.<br /><br />There are other benefits to this alternate test, one of which is that it is better aligned with the core competencies of military lawyers called upon to advise commanders on civilianization decisions than assessing what is and what is not direct participation in hostilities. While it is not a talisman, if used as a method of "coding" military functions, it would provide a foundation for a top-down delineation of permissible and impermissible civilian functions; a delineation focused on compliance with the law of war as opposed to the consequence of non-compliance. Until such a top-down approach is implemented by the Department of Defense, the case by case approach that has created the apparent frustration at the highest levels of the Department will persist, and the "black waters" will remain murky and dangerous. <br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist and British human and medical rights activist <a href="http://medweb.bham.ac.uk/http/depts/clin_neuro/djn.html">Dr. David Nicholl</a>, a neurologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, says that the ethical dilemma posed by the continuing involvement of the medical profession in state executions should be resolved by changing the law and eliminating the death penalty once and for all...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidnicholl.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>D</strong></font>octors have been central participants in the death penalty since the time of Dr. Joseph Guillotin and the French Revolution. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Ignace_Guillotin">Dr. Guillotin</a> (the &quot;e&quot; was added in error later by others) was against the death penalty but proposed the use of a mechanical decapitation machine in 1789. In his view, this would enable a more private humane execution that itself would be an interim step to banning the death penalty completely. In 1890, with the development of the electric chair, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_P._Southwick">Dr. Alfred Southwick</a>, the head of the commission which recommended its use, was reported as saying "we live in a higher civilization from this day". The electric chair itself fell out of favor after evidence that the electrical flow frequently arced, cooking flesh and sometimes igniting prisoners.<br /><br />Over 200 years later, a new <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=17472">report</a> from Amnesty International clearly shows how the death penalty is still reliant on the involvement of the medical profession, in breach of clear ethical guidelines to the contrary. A founding principle of medicine has always been "first do no harm". <br /><br />The guillotine may no longer be in use, but doctors were crucial in the most recent method of execution, lethal injection. In 1977, <a href="http://student.bmj.com/issues/07/07/education/268.php">Dr. Stanley Deutsch</a>, a professor of anaesthetics, responded to the State of Oklahoma's request and suggested the method of lethal injection which is now used in all 38 death penalty states in the US and is rapidly increasing in use elsewhere, such as China. Lethal injection consists of a cocktail of drugs, essentially a fast-acting anaesthetic, a muscle-paralysing agent and a cardiotoxin and this is now the method of choice in virtually all US executions. There is no clear medical reason for the use of the muscle-paralysing agent, Pancuronium, as there is the very real possibility of a prisoner who is paralysed but only partially anaesthetized will experience intense pain with the cardiotoxin, Potassium Chloride. However, for death penalty proponents, clearly it would be disturbing to see a prisoner writhing in pain, so the use of Pancuronium would be a politically astute move. It is interesting to note how even the US veterinary association regard the use of Pancuronium unacceptable in the euthanasia of domestic pets. Today's report clearly shows a number of cases where executions have been botched with prolonged deaths, skins burns and convulsions. <br /><br />Why do doctors involve themselves in the death penalty, when every medical association that has studied the matter, has so conclusively opposed the involvement of healthcare workers in the death penalty? Often there is ignorance of ethical guidelines amongst members of the medical community. In 2001, a survey of 413 American Medical Association members revealed that 41% were willing to undertake at least one of the activities prohibited by AMA guidelines, and only 3% knew of any guidelines covering their involvement in executions. Even in countries which do not have the death penalty such as Denmark, there are medical death penalty proponents. In a survey of 591 Danish doctors in 1989, although 80% opposed capital punishment, 13% considered it acceptable and 3% would be prepared to directly assist with executions themselves. Last year, the <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/12/1221">New England Journal of Medicine</a> interviewed 4 doctors and a nurse who had participated in executions. Some believed that what was being carried out reflected the law, and others that prisoners had a right to competent treatment even as their life was being brought to an end. One of the doctors who had been involved in executions stated "A lot of society thinks these people should not get any care at all", but "thirteen jurors, citizens of the state, have made a decision. And if I live in that state and that's the law, then I would see it as being an obligation to be available". Another doctor involved, Dr. Carlo Musso, who had participated in 6 executions in Georgia spoke openly. Like Dr. Guillotin before him, Dr. Musso stated he was against the death penalty but felt that it just seemed "wrong for us to walk away to abdicate our responsibility to our patients&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;. The way I saw it, this is an end-of-life issue, just as with any other terminal disease". Therein lies the dilemma: it is clearly ethically wrong to torture inmates to death with unskilled execution personnel, but also ethically wrong to bring skilled personnel into the execution process. The <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> concluded that "Medicine is being made an instrument of punishment. The hand of comfort that more gently places the IV, more carefully times the bolus of potassium, is also the hand of death. We cannot escape this truth". <br /><br />Yet no health professional has been disciplined with respect to ethical abuses in relation to the death penalty - although in part this is due to the secretive nature of the executions, actively supported by the State which invariably protects their identity.<br /><br />Just as medics have been instrumental in the implementation of the death penalty, they have been crucial in its recent demise - with direct legal challenges in California, North Carolina, Tennessee and the US Supreme Court largely centering around medical ethical concerns and also whether lethal injection is unconstitutional as a "cruel and unusual punishment". Last year, a court in California specifically stipulated that an anaesthetist should personally supervise the execution by lethal injection of the murderer Michael Morales. Despite widespread protestations from the medical establishment, two willing anaesthetists were found within 2 days, yet neither was prepared, even under anonymity, to submit to the courts stipulation that they personally perform the injection. These ongoing ethical concerns have <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/02/21/state/n032819S06.DTL&hw=morales&sn=003&sc=544">brought the death penalty to a standstill</a> in California since February 2006.<br /><br />Perhaps when law and ethics collide, it is the law which should change. It is time to fulfill Dr. Guillotin and Dr. Musso's wishes by resolving this ethical dilemma, and ending the death penalty once and for all.<br /><br /><br /><em>Dr David Nicholl, MBChB FRCP PhD is a consultant neurologist and honorary senior lecturer at City Hospital Hospital &amp; Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham and the University of Birmingham, England.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.unlv.edu/faculty_nancyRapoport.html">Nancy Rapoport</a> of the William S. Boyd School of Law, University of Nevada Las Vegas, says that the apparent willingness of US Department of Justice officials - all the way up to and including former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales - to authorize harsh interrogation techniques in support of government policy raises the question of whether we are training generations of law students to parse legal language so carefully that they lose sight of the effect of their interpretations on human lives....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/nancyrapoportnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he recent <em>New York Times</em> revelation that the Justice Department authorized the CIA to interrogate suspects by waterboarding them or keeping them in 50-degree rooms has shown us just how far we're willing to go in "interpreting" the law. In one corner, we have the very real threat of terrorism, committed by those who don't hesitate to murder innocents in brutal ways; in the other corner, we have some lawyers (including the former Attorney General) secretly approving the types of activities that do "shock the conscience" of most people. <br /><br />What concerns me is how far we're willing to bend what is "legal" so that we can perform acts that likely fit outside the normal definition of "legal." Are we training generations of law students to parse language so carefully that they lose sight of the effect of their linguistic cavils? <br /><br />Law school teaches students that words matter, and that the smartest lawyers win by using words more creatively than do their opponents. The smartest lawyers come up with the most original types of deals in business; they pick apart the drafts of other, less-smart lawyers looking for loopholes in legislation, contracts, and pleadings; and they use their wordsmithing to eke out their clients' best positions. In much the same way that scientists use their brains to invent new uses for nuclear power or space exploration, lawyers use their brains to invent new ways of interpreting language that often isn't very clear. <br /><br />Scientists discover things because they can &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; they have an innate need to take the discovered world and built upon it. Lawyers parse words because they can &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; we've trained them to split hairs, to distinguish between two cases that can look almost identical on the surface. What policymakers choose to do with new scientific discoveries takes those discoveries into the realm of good or evil (and I use those words deliberately). What policymakers do with legal prestidigitation also can be used for good or for evil.<br /><br />What we don't train law students to do is to understand that there are people behind these laws. Every time we insist on dispassionate answers in class, we chip away at the students' vague understanding that people enter into contracts, people are the subjects of lawsuits, and people are governed by laws. We spend so much time teaching students how to deduce rules of law that we reduce people's lives to words on a page. <br /><br />What would have happened if the Attorney General had asked himself how he would have reacted to the "non-torture" of physical persuasion that fell just short of organ failure? Would he still have believed that authorizing such activities made the United States more secure? I have known an officer who survived torture in Vietnam, and I have watched Return With Honor, the story of the U.S. captives there (including his story). Their goal under torture was to provide useless information, knowing that their physical and mental pain would cause them to confess something. <br /><br />We also don't train law students to understand the pressure that they'll get from their social settings &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the need to please their bosses and their clients, and the cognitive dissonance that they'll face when they're asked to do something that would normally go against their normal code of ethics. We don't warn them that it's far too easy to justify bad conduct by inching so slowly over the line of what is right that they don't see themselves on the wrong side until it's too late. What's worse is that we don't teach them that they must say no to some of the things that clients may want to do. We say that they "may" say no, under the rules of ethics, when the client wants to do something that the lawyer finds abhorrent. We say that they must say "no" when the client wants to do something clearly illegal. We don't teach them that they will find ways to justify illegal behavior without realizing they're doing it&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and that we're giving them the very tools that they'll need to justify that behavior.<br /><br />There has to be a middle ground between teaching students pure law, which eliminates the need to think of the humans that it affects, and paralyzing them with the knowledge that everything they do has the risk of making someone's life into a living hell. That middle ground has to start with an understanding that the theory that they learn in school doesn't stay pure theory in real life, once they become lawyers. The words that they parse can make the difference between saving lives and destroying them.<br />  <br /><br /><em>Nancy B. Rapoport is the Gordon &amp; Silver, Ltd.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that instead of fighting over whether or not to release newly-reported US Department of Justice memos supposedly endorsing torture, the Bush administration should simply release the Red Cross&#39;s report on actual US interrogations of prisoners held at secret so-called CIA &quot;black sites&quot;...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavis.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>nce again, secret memos that sanction torture are revealed - and once again the President denies that the United States tortures. The heads of several committees in Congress seek memos giving the impression that they did not know. Ranking Minority Members and the President say they did. What seems missing from this discussion is the facts. So it is time that Americans call the bluff.<br /><br />In an August 16, 2007 <a href="/forumy/2007/08/citizens-demand-of-his-government.php">op-ed</a> on JURIST, I demanded as a citizen that the government release the recent International Committee of the Red Cross report to the United States on the CIA &quot;black sites.&quot; From Jane Mayer's article in the <em>New Yorker</em> a few weeks ago, it is clear that the President's staff and members of Congress have seen that report. From their comments in that article it is clear that the ICRC report recites the fact that torture was (and may still be) done at the CIA black sites.<br /><br />An earlier report of the International Committee of the Red Cross on Iraq is available from Human Rights Watch and that report discussed some cases that were "tantamount to torture." <br /><br />The International Committee of the Red Cross is the relevant neutral entity in the world whose job is to visit persons detained and report back to the detaining country about the conditions. They are key to the system of the Geneva Conventions to help ensure compliance. Unlike our leaders and their lawyers, they know precisely what is torture and call it like they see it.<br /><br />We know that torture was done by the United States in Iraq from their earlier reports. We know that waterboarding has been done by the United States to detainees at the CIA black sites. Waterboarding has been torture for at least 500 years. All of us know that torture is going on.<br /><br />It is convenient for the President and others to deny there is torture. The reason is simple. Then one can accuse the people below of crimes (malfeasance) and those close to you of making mistakes interpreting your instructions (misfeasance) without suffering any criminal liability. It is an old game played in Washington for decades. The problem is that we know the President has approved all that is happening. The buck truly stops with him.<br /><br />Once the ICRC report is out, a federal prosecutor should empanel a grand jury to prosecute the high-level civilians and military generals who have violated federal law. The President may be considered an unindicted co-conspirator or material witness as regards the torture. All the lower level people who have sought guidance as to what to do should be invited to testify in exchange for immunity. We should end prosecuting low-level people for doing things that higher level people organized. We should go after the higher-ups that put this criminal policy in place.<br /><br />Those in Congress who went along with this can also be considered unindicted co-conspirators or material witnesses &#8212; unless the evidence leads to a conclusion that they were principals or accessories.<br /><br />Let's call the President's bluff and the Intelligence Committees Chair and ranking members' bluff on this rather than go through another round of back and forth with Congress trying to get memos released. <br /><br />Just release the ICRC report and let us be done with the denials, obfuscation and lies. And then let us prosecute the high-level persons who put this criminal policy in place and those who planned the policy. <br /><br />In the military they talk about different spanks for different ranks. It is time for the spanks to be much more severe at the higher level than they have been in the past. Or in Latin, <em>refluat stercus</em>.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=152">David Crane</a> of Syracuse University College of Law, former Chief Prosecutor for the UN Special Court for Sierra Leone, says that the recent meeting at Chautauqua of nine of the twelve living international prosecutors, spanning the Nuremberg Trials to the International Criminal Court, produced a landmark call for governments to back the international criminal courts with the political will and support necessary for them to uphold the rule of law....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidcranenew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he delightful weather and the pristine setting belied the importance of the moment. At the century-old Chautauqua Institution in upstate New York, nine of the 12 living international prosecutors, from Nuremberg to the International Criminal Court, met several weeks ago to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Hague Rules of 1907, the cornerstone to the laws of armed conflict that ensure that the law is followed, even in combat.<br /><br />The first annual <a href="http://www.asil.org/chautauqua/">International Humanitarian Law Dialogs</a> considered the impact of those rules of war in this age of international terror, as well as discuss their relevance in the 21st century. At the end of this historic day, the prosecutors publicly signed the <a href="http://www.asil.org/chaudec/index_files/frame.htm">First Chautauqua Declaration</a> [PP slides], calling upon the international community to stop dithering over the relevance and significance of enforcing the mandate of various international tribunals, courts, and chambers and to acknowledge that they must conform their conduct to the law. The prosecutors demanded that those indicted by these internationally created justice mechanisms be handed over for a fair trial. State responsibility remains one of the keys to success for modern international criminal law.<br /><br />These prosecutors - myself from the Special Court for Sierra Leone; Whitney Harris and Henry King of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg; Sir Desmond DeSilva and Stephen Rapp also of the Special Court for Sierra Leone; Hassan Jallow of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda; David Tolbert of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia; Luis Moreno-Occampo of the International Criminal Court; and Robert Petit of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia - called for the handing over of Radovan Karadic, Ratko Miladic, Joseph Kony, Ahmad Harun, and Felician Kabuga; and all others sought by the tribunals, so that justice can be had for the victims of the many atrocities committed throughout the world totaling the destruction of over 12 million human beings in the past 60 years.<br /><br />That day, August 29, 2007, was significant, historic, and moving as the prosecutors openly discussed the challenges that we met daily in facing down the beast of impunity. Whitney Harris, 95 years old, invoked the spirit of Justice Robert H. Jackson, the American Chief of Counsel at Nuremberg, as did his colleague Henry King who also pounded the table calling for a renewal of the spirit of the Nuremberg Principles. Sir Desmond DeSilva eloquently stated: "Let the word go out to warlords and leaders all over the world. However powerful, however mighty, however feared you may be the law is above you. The law will bring you down." I stated simply that the law is fair, that no one is above the law, and the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of the gun.<br /><br />In a time of fear, uncertainty, and even ill-will, this new cold war, is an ideological struggle that will most likely last for decades. It will be the rule of law that will allow civilized peoples around the world to triumph over tyranny, as the forces of freedom did in the insane struggle with the former Soviet Union and world communism.<br /><br />It must be stressed that those who struggle against this new type of fascism hold the ultimate ace of spades in this strange poker game that mankind finds itself dealt into - that ace is freedom. Yet freedom can only flourish under the rule of law. If we give up the rule of law, we will let go of that all important card, which if dealt away may never be returned.<br /><br />All peoples want to be free from fear, free from want, free to express themselves, and free to worship as they feel appropriate. These four freedoms invoked by President Franklin D. Roosevelt beat the Soviets in the last Cold War. This universal desire for freedom under law can also face down the Islamo-fascists in this current struggle. International terrorists cannot defeat this desire for freedom and they know it, just as the Soviets realized in the mid to late 1980s.<br /><br />The Chautauqua Declaration called upon the world to remember the stirring words of Justice Robert Jackson: "We are able to do away with domestic tyranny and violence and aggression by those in power against the rights of their own people only when we make all men answerable to the law." These stirring words are as relevant and important today as they were over 60 years ago. The prosecutors and the tribunals they work in are only as effective as the political will and support the world community gives to them. In law, half measures only soften the important input that truth and justice can achieve in bringing a sustainable piece in a post conflict setting.<br /><br />The 20th century - the world's bloodiest century, where over 115 million human beings died at the hands of their own governments - cannot be repeated in this new century. Mankind is better than this because of the rule of law and the slow, but steady advancement of international criminal law as it faces down atrocity, aggression, and inhumanity.<br /><br />As Henry King of Nuremberg forcefully stated: "What is needed now is a revival of the spirit of Nuremberg. A better more peaceful world based on justice is within our grasp. So, let idealism and vision be the order of the day. We can indeed achieve a better world, if we will it to be our future."<br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

George W. Bush declared, "I shared a deep disgust that those prisoners were treated the way they were treated." Yet less than a year later, his Justice Department issued a secret opinion endorsing the harshest techniques the CIA has ever used, according to a report in the <em>New York Times</em>. These include head slapping, frigid temperatures, and water boarding, in which the subject is made to feel he is drowning. Water boarding is widely considered a torture technique. Once again, Bush is compelled to issue a denial. "This government does not torture people," he insisted.<br /><br />This was not the first time the Bush administration had officially endorsed torture, however. John Yoo, writing for the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, penned an August 2002 memorandum that rewrote the legal definition of torture to require the equivalent of organ failure. This memo violated the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, a treaty the United States ratified, and therefore part of U.S. law under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.<br /><br />In December 2002, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved interrogation methods that included the use of dogs, hooding, stress positions, isolation for up to 30 days, 20-hour interrogations, deprivation of light and sound, and water boarding. U.S. Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora told William Haynes, the Pentagon's general counsel, that Rumsfeld's "authorized interrogation techniques could rise to the level of torture." As a result, Rumsfeld rescinded some methods but reserved the right to approve others, including water boarding, on a case-by-case basis.<br /><br />When Bush maintained last week that his government doesn't torture prisoners, he stressed the necessity of interrogation to "protect the American people." Notwithstanding the myth perpetuated by shows like "24," however, torture doesn't work. Experts agree that people who are tortured will say anything to make the torture stop. <br /><br />One of the first victims of the Bush administration's 2002 torture policy was Abu Zubaydah, whom they called "chief of operations" for al Qaeda and bin Laden's "number three man." He was repeatedly tortured at the secret CIA "black sites." They water boarded him, withheld his medication, threatened him with impending death, and bombarded him with continuous deafening noise and harsh lights. <br /><br />But Zubaydah wasn't a top al Qaeda leader. Dan Coleman, one of the FBI&#39;s leading experts on al Qaeda, said of Zubaydah, &quot;He knew very little about real operations, or strategy &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; He was expendable, you know, the greeter . . . Joe Louis in the lobby of Caeser&#39;s Palace, shaking hands.&quot; Moreover, Zubaydah was schizophrenic; according to Coleman, "This guy is insane, certifiable split personality." Coleman&#39;s views were echoed at the top levels of the CIA and were communicated to Bush and Cheney. But Bush scolded CIA director George Tenet, saying, &quot;I said [Zubaydah] was important. You&#39;re not going to let me lose face on this, are you?&quot; Zubaydah&#39;s minor role in al Qaeda and his apparent insanity were kept secret. <br /><br />In response to the torture, Zubaydah told his interrogators about myriad terrorist targets al Qaeda had in its sights: the Brooklyn Bridge, the Statute of Liberty, shopping malls, banks, supermarkets, water systems, nuclear plants, and apartment buildings. Al Qaeda was close to building a crude nuclear bomb, Zubaydah reported. None of this was corroborated but the Bush gang reacted to each report zealously.<br /><br />Moreover, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, considered the mastermind of the September 11 attacks, was tortured so severely &#8212; including by water boarding &#8212; that the information he provided is virtually worthless. A potentially rich source of intelligence was lost as a result of the torture. <br /><br />Bush's insistence that his administration doesn&#39;t torture rings hollow. He lied about weapons of mass destruction and a Saddam-al Qaeda connection in Iraq. He lied when he assured us his officials would not wiretap without warrants. As evidence of secret memos detailing harsh interrogation policies continues to emerge, we can&#39;t believe Bush&#39;s denials about torture.<br /><br />Democrats in Congress have demanded they be allowed to see the memos, but Bush said the interrogation methods have been &quot;fully disclosed to appropriate members of Congress.&quot; Senator John D. Rockefeller IV was unmoved. &quot;I&#39;m tired of these games,&quot; he said. &quot;They can&#39;t say that Congress has been fully briefed while refusing to turn over key documents used to justify the legality of the program.&quot;<br /><br />It is incumbent upon the Senate Judiciary Committee to vigorously interrogate Michael Mukasey during his attorney general confirmation hearing. As AG, Mukasey would oversee the department that writes interrogation policy. Mukasey should know that the Convention Against Torture prohibits torture in all circumstances, even in times of war.<br /><br />Torture is a war crime. Those who commit or order torture can be convicted under the U.S. War Crimes Statute. Techniques that don&#39;t rise to the level of torture but constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment also violate U.S. law. Congress should provide for the appointment of a special independent counsel to fully investigate and prosecute all who are complicit in the torture of prisoners in U.S. custody.<br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and president of the National Lawyers Guild.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that US legislation now on the books would allow Blackwater personnel reasonably accused of the unlawful killing of persons in Iraq to be prosecuted in US federal or military courts...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/paustbig.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>D</strong></font>oes the United States have extraterritorial legislation that would currently allow prosecution of Blackwater personnel who are reasonably accused of the unlawful killing of persons in Iraq? If so, would prosecution be possible in a federal district court or certain military tribunals? The general answer to both these questions is &quot;yes.&quot;<br /><br />There are several possible statutory bases for prosecution. One that is more problematic would involve use of the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 3261. The statute applies extraterritorially to "whoever engages in conduct outside the United States" that would be conduct criminally proscribed had the conduct been engaged "within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States," but the conduct of those who are not members of the armed forces of the United States would have to have been engaged in by a person who was (1) "employed by" U.S. armed forces, which is not typically the case with Blackwater personnel who operate under the auspices of the Department of State, or (2) "accompanying" U.S. armed forces outside the United States. The primary issue might be whether or not Blackwater personnel are "accompanying" the armed forces because of the widespread use of Blackwater personnel in an active theater of war to perform security functions that serve or supplement the overall mission of the military and the United States more generally during the war in Iraq. Where the U.S. is an occupying power, this type of accompaniment may be more readily understood. On the other hand, would they "accompany" the armed forces only where a specific mission was coordinated with U.S. military efforts?<br /><br />Far easier would be prosecution under two sets of federal legislation that allow prosecution of relevant war crimes in federal district courts. The first is the War Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 2441. This statute allows prosecution, for example, of those who are U.S. nationals who commit a relevant war crime outside the United States. Listed war crimes include some violations of the 1907 Hague Convention No. IV, including killing or wounding "treacherously," killing or wounding those who have no means of defense who have "surrendered," and use of weapons or bullets of a nature to cause unnecessary suffering. More clearly at stake is the statutory listing of violations of common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which expressly covers "violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds" of "persons taking no active part in the hostilities." Today, customary international law reflected in common Article 3 provides a set of minimum duties, rights, and competencies in any armed conflict, although it was originally designed to apply to cases of insurgency. The Supreme Court's opinion in <em>Hamdan</em> and the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy generally affirm this point about Geneva law.<br /><br />The reach of common Article 3 (and the customary international law of war reflected therein) to any person who engages in proscribed conduct against any person who is not taking a direct part in armed hostilities is one reason why it is appropriate to prosecute members of al Qaeda who violate the laws of war in Afghanistan or Iraq, thus demonstrating a certain irony perhaps with respect to the reach of federal law to both Blackwater and al Qaeda personnel "if the facts fit." Nonetheless, every violation of common Article 3 (and any other law of war) is a war crime over which there is universal jurisdiction and a universal duty to initiate prosecution or extradite. It is also of interest that since members of Blackwater and members of al Qaeda are not members of the regular armed forces of a party to an armed conflict, they are not "combatants" [see, e.g., Geoffrey S. Corn, <a href="/forumy/2007/10/murky-blackwater-and-direct.php">Murky "Blackwater' and the Direct Participation Dilemma</a>, previously in JURIST], they are not entitled to combatant immunity with respect to the killing of persons who are lawful military targets (such as those who are taking an active part in hostilities), and they are unprivileged fighters who are subject to prosecution for murder, manslaughter, and other crimes under relevant domestic law (e.g., Iraqi or U.S. laws, except for any immunity that might pertain with respect to Iraqi law). Contrary to the views of this Administration, however, merely fighting as an unprivileged fighter is not a war crime.<br /><br />Another set of federal laws allows prosecution of any violation of the laws of war as offenses against the laws of the United States in the federal district courts. As recognized by the Supreme Court in cases such as <em>Ex parte Quirin</em> and <em>In re Yamashita</em>, the precursor to 10 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 818 incorporates the laws of war by references as offenses against the laws of the United States. Under 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 3231, all offenses against the laws of the United States can be prosecuted within the federal district courts, whether or not there is concurrent jurisdiction in any military tribunal. These points have been documented in 50 <em>Tex. L. Rev.</em> 6 (1971) and elsewhere. It would also be possible to prosecute civilians in a properly constituted military commission in a war-related occupied territory and, possibly, in a general courts-martial in a theater of war in time of war if such a prosecution can survive a Fifth Amendment challenge under the Supreme Court's decision in 1957 in <em>Reid v. Covet</em> (which seemed to emphasize that that case addressed the impropriety of military tribunal jurisdiction over U.S. civilians in time of peace).<br /><br />As documented in my recent book <a href="www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521711203">Beyond the Law</a>, however, "for more than five years the Bush administration has furthered a general policy of impunity by refusing to prosecute any person of any nationality under the War Crimes Act or alternative legislation, the torture statute, genocide legislation, and legislation permitting prosecution of certain civilians employed by or accompanying U.S. military forces abroad." For example, the Administration refuses to prosecute memo-writers who have abetted what President Bush admitted in September 2006 is his "program" of (1) secret detention (or forced disappearance and the per se war crime and "grave breach" of Geneva law involving the transfer of persons out of occupied territory), and (2) "tough" interrogation tactics (which are violative of several treaties of the United States and customary international laws, as documented most recently in "Beyond the Law"), and those who authorized such criminal activity during what a former insider has described as a "common, unifying" plan devised by the "inner circle" to engage in "coercive interrogation." Only a few of the direct perpetrators of the common plan have been prosecuted in military fora.<br /><br />Finally, each time a Blackwater convoy roars through Iraqi streets, ignoring Iraqi traffic laws, bumping into cars, and at times shooting people, the conduct symbolizes the lack of law and order and safety from violence that is generally extant in Iraq &#8212; a symbol of the failure of the Administration's policies in Iraq.<br /><br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

<br /><br />&quot;When the President of the United States of America violates the Constitution, at that moment the President becomes constitutionally illegitimate and subject to impeachment. It is not only the war against Iraq that has violated the Constitution of the United States, but more so the  &#39;war on terror&#39; with all its consequences. Since the definition of war has its legal consequences and procedures the so called war on terror has failed its legal objectives. No formal declaration of war with its formal diplomatic protocols (note verbale) has been drafted, issued or delivered since &quot;terror&quot; is not a member state of the United Nations. It follows that by the actions of President Bush making a formal declaration of war against an unknown entity his actions must be deemed unconstitutional. Since the consequences of his actions and end result have burdoned an already overburdoned taxpayer and continue so to do without end, by virtue of his deeds and continued actions make him subject to impeachment. President Clinton faced impeachment proceeedings for far less. President Bush has violated, and continues so to do, the very heart of the United States of America: its Constitution. It follows that as a result of a declaration of war on an unknown entity, without beginning, middle or end and which is utilizing public funds from its citizens, those citizens are entitled to request his removal from office as well as facing both civil and criminal consequences.&quot;]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/"><strong>Giovanni Di Stefano</strong></a> [lawyer for Ali Hassan al-Majid, dubbed &quot;Chemical Ali&quot;, <a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/">Studio Legale Internazionale</a>, Rome]: &quot;I have been asked on countless occasions by students at universities, fellow lawyers, colleagues, journalists my simple view on the current situation in Iraq.<br /><br />It is without doubt the consequences of all that is occurring in Iraq is strictly owing to the unprovoked and unlawful attack on Iraq by the US/UK. They chose to do so not in the classical sense as a formal declaration of war but as a general declaration of war against &#39;terrorism&#39; and rushed to judgement listing Iraq as a sponsor of terrorism thus justifying the unlawful actions.<br /><br />The US Constitution was drafted in order to maintain proper controls and balances on a potentially oppressive government abusing its position. The whole concept of the Founding Fathers was solely to permit men and women to live a free life based upon justice and to allow the citizen to achieve any ambitions. The Constitution was NOT drafted to allow the United States of America to build or create or occupy empires or even to augment the powers of government.<br /><br />September 11th in my view - and without doubt - did not place the US in a state of war. Constitutionally and as a matter of jurisprudence, war requires some form of physical invasion, a real threat to government, a valid challenge by force to a nation&#39;s sovereignty or against a country&#39;s security interests. That danger must pass through the second stage and it must emanate from a real nation with powers to raise military personnel and advance to war. This has never occurred in reality to the USA since the time of George III. Even in World War II it could never be said that Germany was a real threat to the US. Hypothetically Japan may have caused inconveniences, but in the classical sense no conquering army from Europe or Japan was ever likely to land on US sovereign soil.<br /><br />September 11th proved to be a war against an ideal or concept rather than a country (like Germany and Japan in 1942) and that was troublesome. It is inconceivable that at some stage there will not be a single person who does not wish to harm a US citizen. Utopia is an ideal that will never be achieved. This is the problem with the Bush Administration view on terrorism. They wish to eradicate all and any citizens of the world who seek to kill a US citizen. It may be valiant and may even be prudent to attack countries to eliminate the possibilities of killing US citizens but it is not lawful and contrary to the US Constitution. This war on &#39;terrorism&#39;, purely because it is not a war against a named country for a specific reason, remains open ended. When will it end? Who will sign an armistice? Who can bind lawfully the &#39;cessation of terrorism&#39;? Maybe the US can find someone for Iraq, but can they find someone for each and every country in the world?<br /><br />The old USSR had - and still has - weapons of mass destruction, including at one time over 5,000,000 members of the military ready to march against Europe and with nuclear capacity. Al-Qaida at the most may have 1000? Supposedly led by two men? Yes, Al Qaida may have an evil intent but what relations did Mr Bin Laden have with Saddam Hussein? None! Nil! That is what has emerged from the three trials that I have attended in Iraq and the scores of documents discovered. We did find Mr. Bin Laden in the 1980&#39;s certainly did have good relations with the USA and on their behalf indeed went to Yugoslavia to acquire arms to fight against the Russians in Afghanistan. The only link that can be found with Mr Bin Laden is not with Iraq but with the US!<br /><br />The byproducts of this perpetual war on &#39;terrorism&#39; is the loss of human rights by those detained by the US. That is not what the US Constitution had in mind and the Founding Fathers would certainly be turning in their graves at the thought of simply arresting suspects in third countries and taking those suspects to Cuba, denying them even the basics of human assistance stripping them of their identity and dignity as well as their legal rights. Even Saddam Hussein did not go that far.<br /><br />The abuse of human rights has damaged the US. It has caused many previously cooperative governments to stand aside and not assist the US; secondly and more important, the precedent created by President Bush in stripping detainees of their legal rights and representations may well be copied by other nations, thus causing a domino effect.<br /><br />I am no politician but a simple lawyer. But I have witnessed a degradation of values and vanishing legal principles in favour of a supposed war on a notion rather than against an errant nation. That cannot be good for mankind.&quot;<br />

		<title>Pennsylvania death penalty system likely to change after ABA study</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.aclupa.org"><strong>Larry Frankel</strong></a> [Legislative Director, <a href="http://www.aclupa.org">ACLU of Pennsylvania</a>]: &quot;[A new] ABA study [has] found that Pennsylvania fails to comply with over 93% of the ABA&#39;s 92 recommendations designed to improve the fairness and accuracy of the death penalty. The <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/aba-panel-criticizes-flawed.php "><strong>ABA recommends</strong></a> some very specific changes to the laws in Pennsylvania to minimize the risk of executing the innocent, eliminate shocking racial and geographic disparities, increase the reliability of eyewitness identification, and improve the quality of representation provided to poor defendants.<br /><br />What are the legal implications of this report? It is entirely conceivable that if the Pennsylvania General Assembly refuses to take any action to respond to the ABA&#39;s criticisms, then the state and federal courts will have no alternative but to impose reforms. These same courts are familiar with the problems plaguing Pennsylvania&#39;s death penalty system. In the modern era, more than 200 defendants on death row in Pennsylvania have received relief from federal and state courts. One has to think that the judicial system will take some action, if the ABA report does not generate a legislative response.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.aclu.org/"><strong>Jameel Jaffer</strong></a> [Director of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">ACLU&#39;s National Security Project</a> and author, with Amrit Singh, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Administration-Torture-Documentary-Record-Washington/dp/0231140525/ref=pd_rhf_p_t_2/002-9301333-1330451">Administration of Torture</a>]: &quot;Recent media reports reveal that the Justice Department issued two legal memoranda in 2005 that authorized the CIA to use a slew of inhumane interrogation methods, including &quot;head slapping,&quot; &quot;waterboarding,&quot; and extreme temperatures &#8212; according to the New York Times &quot;the harshest interrogation techniques&quot; ever used by the agency. The first of the two memoranda was issued by the Justice Department only months after the Bush administration published (and publicly trumpeted) another legal memorandum declaring that &quot;torture is abhorrent to American laws and values&quot; and, probably not coincidentally, only weeks after Alberto Gonzales took office as Attorney General. <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/bush-defends-interrogation-tactics.php">President Bush has responded</a> to the latest disclosure in the same way he has responded to each of the other similar disclosures over the last four years: by assuring the American public, and the world, that the United States does not use torture.<br /><br />At this point only the most credulous would take the President&#39;s assurances seriously. There is abundant evidence that Bush administration attorneys constructed a legal framework designed to make torture permissible, empowered interrogators to use a long list of unlawful and barbaric interrogation methods, and repeatedly encouraged interrogators to push the limits of their authority. When the President wanted to evade laws prohibiting torture, his attorneys redefined that term so that interrogators&#39; conduct would not come within its reach. The recent revelations show that when the President wanted to evade laws prohibiting cruel treatment, his attorneys took the same approach.<br /><br />When the President declares that he has never authorized torture, he is speaking a language of his own invention. The pressing question now is not whether the Bush administration endorsed torture -- plainly it did -- but what the country and the world should do about it. Over the last three years, the senior officials who ought to have been held responsible for the maltreatment of prisoners have been let off the hook or even nominated to higher posts. A serious effort to hold these officials accountable is long overdue.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/"><strong>Giovanni Di Stefano</strong></a> [lawyer for Ali Hassan al-Majid, <a href="http://www.studiolegaleinternazionale.com/">Studio Legale Internazionale</a>, Rome]: &quot;The situation in Iraq is complicated and difficult. Death is common and murder ripe. I am of the view that in the investigation of any criminal matter in Iraq at the moment cannot be investigated by applying the normal standards. There is no question of adopting &#39;beyond reasonable doubt&#39; or even the lower threshold of &#39;on the balance of probabilities&#39;. The Iraqi Judicial system does not recognise such maxims. They apply the test of whether a Judge is &#39;satisfied&#39; of the facts. <br /><br />Blackwater security officers face a difficult task. They cannot ask questions first and then shoot if attacked. They must respond immediately. This is a position that has been forced upon them by virtue of the US/UK unlawful attack on Iraq and the resentment the people of Iraq generally hold for all foreigners. I am satisfied that whilst murder and death is deplorable, the <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/iraq-government-probe-concludes.php">criticisms of Blackwater</a> cannot be justified under the climate and conditions upon which they are forced to operate. Whilst the Iraqi Government and the FBI are holding enquires into the alleged deaths of 17 citizens, it is to be noted that when 4 Blackwater Security Officers were killed no enquires were held. The FBI have no experience of day to day life in Iraq and as such applying US standards investigating events in an unknown country currently by the name of Iraq where law and order is non-existent makes any investigation of Blackwater wholly unfair and unjust, and I am of the view has only been ordered for the purposes of political appeasement.<br /><br />I make the said statement because I and my colleagues have personal experience with Blackwater and other security companies. Under difficult and on one occasion at the airport dangerous situations, the Blackwater Security Officers behaved in a manner that &#39;saved&#39; lives rather than risk life.&quot;<br />

Representations have been made to the US Military who have the responsibility of maintaining the physical custody of all detainees to ensure that Mr Al Majid et al will not be surrendered to the Iraqi Government until such time as the application filed by ourselves (a) with President Talabani and (b) with the Iraqi High Court have received the appropriate responses. In the case of the application filed with the Iraqi High Court, that requires full oral argument and is not to be dispensed with summarily. Any member of the Iraqi Government travelling to the United Kingdom or Italy and in most of the Member States within the EU will risk potential arrest for violations of the Geneva Convention Act 1957, S.1 and the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 Sched. 3 Art.130 as follows:<br /><br />&quot;Grave breaches to which the preceding Article relates shall be those involving any of the following acts, if committed against persons or property protected by the Convention: wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, compelling a prisoner of war to serve in the forces of the hostile Power, or wilfully depriving a prisoner of war of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed in this Convention.&quot;<br /><br />I remind those errant members of the Iraqi Government who are denying just cause to those indicted that Judge Rahman (Rauf Abdel) had to hastily depart the United Kingdom as I had sought leave of the Attorney General to prosecute him.<br /><br />I have sent a preliminary note to the European Union and the Council of Europe forewarning that in the event Mr Al Majid et al are executed without the benefit of a proper oral hearing of our application I will be seeking of each EU Prosecutor arrest warrants for certain named officials.<br /><br />Mr Al Majid et al by Iraqi Law cannot be executed past the 30 day period designated by Iraqi Law upon which executions &#39;must be held&#39; after final judgement. That period having lapsed and with two applications pending, any execution of Mr Al Majid et al amounts to acts of premeditated murder which in any democratic society cannot be sustained.<br /><br />Judge Rahman has not travelled outside the jurisdiction of Kurdistan again since my application to Lord Goldsmith and I shall take similar action against any person that is involved in any execution of Mr Al Majid et all until the proper completion of due process.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.anca.org/"><strong>Aram Suren Hamparian</strong></a> [Executive Director,<br /><a href="http://www.anca.org/">Armenian National Committee of America</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/turkish-official-urges-us-house-not-to.php">adoption of the Armenian genocide resolution</a> would represent a meaningful step toward reclaiming our right - as Americans - to speak openly and honestly about the first genocide of the 20th Century, free from the gag-rule that Turkey has, for far too long, imposed on the discussion of this human rights issue by our elected officials.<br /><br />Turkey has outlawed mention of the Armenian genocide, prosecuting its own citizens under Article 301 of its newly revised Turkish Penal Code for speaking openly on this topic. Among those taken to court have been Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk and noted Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, who was assassinated this January outside the offices of his newspaper in downtown Istanbul.<br /><br />Turkey, apparently not satisfied with stifling debate in its own country, is seeking - using threats, blackmail, and intimidation - to export it efforts to silence discussion of the Armenian genocide to the United States. As Americans, we should never outsource our nation&#39;s foreign policy - or our morality - to Turkey or any other nation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/Friedman/friedman.htm"><strong>Howard M. Friedman</strong></a> [Distinguished University Professor of Law Emeritus, University of Toledo College of Law]: &quot;In a world full of bad news, we can sometimes find optimism in strange places. Maryland federal district Judge John Bennett&#39;s careful ruling in a <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/federal-judge-approves-limited-lawsuit.php">lawsuit against the unsavory members of Topeka&#39;s Westboro Baptist Church</a> is one of those places. The ruling gives me pride and continuing confidence in the legal profession. It demonstrates that the rule of law still prevails, even when emotionally and politically charged cases come before our courts.<br /><br />Westboro Baptist Church, led by Rev. Fred Phelps and his family, is among the most homophobic of organizations around. It has mastered the art of the outrageous in order to gain media attention. Its members travel around the country picketing funerals of our young heroes who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. The picketers&#39; message is that U.S. soldiers are dying because our country tolerates homosexuality. Revulsion at these picketers&#39; tactics has led 32 states as well as the federal government to enact laws protecting the privacy of funeral ceremonies from demonstrators. Those laws have generated their own series of Constitutional issues. Are they narrowly enough drawn to protect First Amendment speech concerns?<br /><br />Judge Bennett&#39;s decision came in a lawsuit brought by the father of Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder who died 19 months ago in a non-combat related vehicle accident in Al Anbar Province in Iraq. Judge Bennett, first of all, apparently made a careful distinction between language that appeared on Westboro&#39;s website and that which appeared on picketers&#39; signs outside Snyder&#39;s funeral ceremony. The website addressed Matthew&#39;s parents with offensive statements such as, &quot;You had a duty to prepare that child to serve the Lord his God&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;period. You did just the opposite&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;you raised him for the Devil.&quot; The website&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;with the URL &quot;www.godhatesfags.com&quot;&acirc;&#8364;&#8221; also proclaimed that Matthew&#39;s parents taught him to divorce and commit adultery. It continued with a tirade against the Catholic Church.<br /><br />Judge Bennett found the website language does not amount to defamation because no reasonable person would think that it was intended to be a statement of fact. Nor did the website language invade the family&#39;s privacy since the declarations were merely a statement of the Church members&#39; general religious beliefs. When it came to signs carried outside of the funeral ceremony at St. John&#39;s Roman Catholic Church, however, Judge Bennett struck the balance differently. He ordered to case to go to trial on claims that this intrusion amounted to tortuous invasion of the family&#39;s expectation of privacy and constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress on the family.<br /><br />This case also points out a civil liberties battle that is rapidly emerging in the U.S. and in Europe as well. Conservative Christians who feel compelled to denounce homosexual behavior are raising louder and louder objections to attempts to treat gay and lesbian members of society as equals. The White House is threatening to veto the Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act which has passed both houses of Congress and awaits reconciliation in a single bill. Despite the President&#39;s shifting rationales to support his veto threat, the political force behind the objections are conservative ministers who fear that their fire-and-brimstone preaching against gays and lesbians will need to be tempered. Strong language in the bill protecting First Amendment rights has been insufficient to stem the tide of objections. Apparently the opponents&#39; fear is that some of that preaching&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;like language used by Westboro Baptist Church&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;may actually incite physical violence against the GLBT community, and that this, in turn, could lead to &quot;hate crime&quot; charges against clergy. The ultimate fate of this legislation may tell us much about whether America is prepared to tolerate bigotry in the guise of religious doctrine.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/hicks_n.htm"><strong>Neil Hicks</strong></a> [Director, Human Rights Defenders Program, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;The brief <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/russian-police-detain-foreign-activists.php">detention of five foreign human rights</a> activists who were attending a planned international meeting commemorating the work of Anna Politkovskaya in the provincial city of Nizhny Novgorod on October 6, 2007 should be seen as an escalation in official harassment and interference in the work of the independent human rights organization, the Nizhny Novgorod Foundation to Promote Tolerance (NNFPT). I will summarize below the events that I witnessed during my stay in Nizhny Novgorod from October 4 &#8212; October 6, but they should be seen in the context of a series of official attacks against the organization dating back to at least 2005 that resulted in the conviction of its director, Stanislav Dmitrievsky of having violated the law against extremism in January 2006 and to the court ordered closure of the Russian Chechen Friendship Society (RCFS), the precursor to the NNFPT, upheld by the Federal Supreme Court in January 2007. More recently, the Russian authorities have sought to exclude the RCFS from participation in meetings at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe open to NGOs.<br /><br />On October 4, 2007 I arrived in Nizhny Novgorod to discover that my reservation at the Central Hotel had been canceled. Staff members of the host organization contacted several hotels in Nizhny Novgorod seeking reservations for me and other foreign visitors. At one hotel they were told that the rooms reserved for foreign guests had developed a leak, and were not habitable. Finally, I was allowed to check in to the Nizhegorodskaya Hotel for one night. When I asked at the reception desk if I could extend my stay for a second night they said that I would have to vacate my room by 4 pm. In traveling to various hotels seeking reservations for foreign guests we observed an unusually heavy police presence in hotel lobbies. Police surveillance was also apparent outside the NNFPT office.<br /><br />Immediately prior to our arrival in Nizhny Novgorod, the organizers had been informed by their bank that they would not be permitted to access the funds in their account that they had been planning to use to cover the expenses of the meeting.<br /><br />On October 5, 2007 the organizers learned at 11.00 am that the conference room they had reserved in a hotel for a press conference scheduled to be held at 1.00pm was no longer available. They were told that it had been let for another conference. Also, that morning, traffic police towed away the small minibus, belonging to a staff member of the organization, which the organizers had been using to transport participants, claiming that it had been stolen, even though the owner was present with his registration documents.<br /><br />Participants traveled by public transport to the hotel where the press conference had been scheduled. They met up with journalists, standing outside the hotel and traveled in their cars to the offices of another human rights organization, where an impromptu press conference was held.<br /><br />After lunch, while searching for a place to spend the night, we observed that we were being followed by an unmarked vehicle. We lost the tail and I was driven to an unoccupied private apartment in the city, where I spent the night.<br /><br />The next morning, October 6, 2007, would be participants in the now canceled events met at the offices of the NNFPT. An unmarked vehicle in which there was someone shooting video footage, visible by a red dot pointing through tinted windows, was parked outside the building. At about 11.00 am group of police officers arrived at the office, identifying themselves as being from the immigration department. They took the passports and registration documents of the foreign guests present in the office. A few minutes later, another group of policemen arrived and took away one of the organization&#39;s leaders, Stanislav Dmitrievsky for questioning into an ongoing investigation into the alleged use of counterfeit software by the organization. At about 11.30 am a group of five foreign guests were taken to the immigration department in a police mini bus. <br /><br />At the immigration department we were held in a public waiting area and taken into offices one by one to be questioned and for our statements to be recorded. After about one hour, an armed guard was posted in the room, carrying a machine gun. He was joined by a second uniformed police officer who sat opposite to us. We were well treated throughout and no threats were made against any of us.<br /><br />I was the last person in the group to be questioned because they had to wait for the arrival of a translator to assist me. I was informed that I was guilty of an administrative violation on two counts: because I had stayed in a private apartment and not a hotel, and because my tourist visa does not permit me to meet with private individuals and organizations in Russia. It was explained to me that as a tourist I should travel with a tour guide and visit tourist sites. I objected that the terms of my visa application required only that I register my arrival in Russia within three days of my arrival, which I did during my stay at the hotel. I also questioned whether it was the case that no one who comes to Russia on a tourist visa meets with private individuals. I was told that many people may do this, but in my case I had committed a violation.<br /><br />I was given an opportunity to write my objections in English on the statement form, which I did. At the end of the questioning, I was taken to the Head of Department for her decision. She explained that I could be fined up to 5,000 Roubles ($200) but because I had tried to stay in a hotel, and because I had not been informed by my travel agency about the restrictions attached to my visa status she would only impose a fine of 3,000 Roubles. It was explained to me that if I paid the fine it would mean that I accepted the punishment, but I did have the right to appeal within ten days through the British consulate. I informed the head of department that I would appeal against the penalty.<br /><br />After about four and half hours we were released from the immigration department. All five of us had been served with fines, which we had all declined to pay. When we returned to the office of the NNFPT we found a police search in progress. A group of six men, including police officers and witnesses selected by the police were conducting a search for counterfeit software. They seized CDs found in the office. They locked the door and held the Foundations&#39; Director, Oksana Chelysheva in the room alone while they conducted the search.<br /><br />Stanislav Dmitrievsky was released after almost three hours of questioning.<br /><br />That evening, we left Nizhny Novgorod on the overnight train to Moscow. Our departure was monitored by uniformed police officers who were stationed at the railway station.<br /><br />These events, while relatively minor and nonthreatening in themselves, constitute an escalation in the level of harassment directed towards international human rights activists in Russia. The foreign guests had a variety of immigrations statuses. One of us was a student, resident in Moscow, another a resident researcher for Amnesty International. Nevertheless, we were all issued with violations and fines. <br /><br />From the perspective of the host organizations in Nizhny Novgorod these incidents were anything but nonthreatening. They represent a flagrant breach of their rights to assemble peacefully and particularly to meet and communicate with international activists of varying kinds. Such actions are a violation of OSCE Human Dimension Commitments, the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights Defenders and of basic rights upheld in international human rights law.&quot;<br />

		<title>Settlement of contraception prescription lawsuit reasonable for Illinois women</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/"><strong>Brigid Leahy</strong></a> [Vice President of Public Action, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/">Illinois Planned Parenthood Council</a>]: &quot;We are pleased with the outcome of the <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/settlement-proposed-in-illinois.php">settlement</a> in Menges, et al v. Blagojevich. Our concern has always been for the woman who needs her prescription for contraception filled. The settlement ensures that women in Illinois will continue to have their prescriptions filled without hassle or delay. As long as pharmacies guarantee that prescriptions will be filled, we are not concerned with what happens behind the scenes.<br /><br />Several years ago we started to hear complaints from some Planned Parenthood patients that they were being refused when they went to the pharmacy to pick up their prescriptions. Sometimes the pharmacist even lectured the patient. Some of our patients were embarrassed in front of other customers. A few were told things like &quot;If you take this, you&#39;ll kill your baby.&quot; Several were delayed in getting their medication for several days, putting them at risk of unintended pregnancy. Causing an unnecessary delay in obtaining time sensitive medication is medically irresponsible. Moreover, giving false information while humiliating and demeaning a patient is simply unprofessional.<br /><br />Our experience told us that the overwhelming majority of pharmacists and pharmacies perform their duties professionally. We have a great working relationship with most pharmacists and pharmacies in the communities we serve. But, we were still having problems with a few. We brought our concerns to the Illinois Department of Professional regulation and the Blagojevich Administration which enacted the pharmacy rule requiring pharmacies that stock contraceptives to fill those prescriptions without delay. We knew the rule would have little effect on the day to day operations of most pharmacies because most pharmacies were already serving women well. Now this settlement addresses those few cases in which a pharmacist chooses to invoke his personal religious beliefs over the medical needs of a patient. In those cases, the refusing pharmacist will step away and the pharmacy will implement a system so that the patient&#39;s needs will be addressed without her having to go somewhere else or ever knowing that an individual pharmacist disagrees with her right to medical care. This is a reasonable result for the women of Illinois.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.btselem.org/"><strong>Jessica Montell</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.btselem.org/">B&#39;Tselem</a>: The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories]: &quot;Much of <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/un-must-better-address-rights-situation.php">Professor Dugard&#39;s report</a> simply reiterates what B&#39;Tselem has documented extensively over the past several years: in many spheres the human rights situation for Palestinians in the Occupied Territories has deteriorated. This is patently clear in the Gaza Strip, where 1.5 million people are trapped in a virtual prison, in crushing poverty and no possibility of development, given the siege imposed by Israel. It is also clear in the West Bank, where Palestinian movement has also become a privilege rather than a basic right, and two parallel and discriminatory legal systems govern Palestinians and settlers living side by side.<br /><br />In this context, it is appropriate that Professor Dugard pose serious questions about the UN &#8212; a body which has recently reaffirmed human rights as a central pillar &#8212; and its role in the Quartet, the body spearheading the political response of the international community to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /><br />The dilemma is not only how the UN and the Quartet should respond to Israel&#39;s violations of human rights and international law. These questions are exacerbated because the UN and the Quartet are not merely bystanders but active participants in the Israeli-Palestinian context and their actions themselves can constitute violations of the law. Thus, for example, the international community&#39;s boycott of the Hamas government in Gaza has clear implications for the ability of the Gaza population to realize their rights. <br /><br />Both diplomacy and humanitarian assistance must respect international law. It is not only Israel that must respect international law. Individually and collectively, the members of the Quartet have legal obligations that cannot be ignored.&quot;<br />

		<title>Supreme Court el-Masri rejection undermines accountability for renditions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/staff.asp"><strong>Aziz Huq</strong></a> [Director, Liberty and National Security Project at the <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/index.html">Brennan Center for Justice</a> at the NYU School of Law]: &quot;This Monday, the Supreme Court denied the petition for certiorari review filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in the case of Khaled El-Masri, a German citizen who had been subject to the U.S. practice of &quot;extraordinary rendition.&quot; The <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/supreme-court-rejects-el-masri.php "><strong>denial</strong></a>,which was made without comment by the Justices (the usual practice), means that no four Justices on the Court believed that Mr. El-Masri&#39;s case merited review. It also means that Mr. El-Masri now has no judicial remedy in the United States. And it means that almost every formal channel for accountability for the practice of &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot;&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and accountability for the errors it can involve&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;has been blocked. <br /><br />Even the undisputed details of the El-Masri case provide scant room for moral ambiguity. At the end of 2003, Mr. El-Masri was seized while on holiday in Macedonia, and transported to a prison where he was held incommunicado and questioned with coercive means about his alleged involvement in terrorism. In May 2004, he was abruptly released without explanation or apology. He was, in short, an innocent man &quot;disappeared&quot; for five months and given neither an iota of explanation, nor a jot of compensation. <br /><br />Thanks to the diligence of the <em>Washington Post</em> and El-Masri&#39;s counsel in the United States and Germany, more details have emerged. According to these accounts (summarized in Chapter 5 of my book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unchecked-Unbalanced-Presidential-Power-Terror/dp/1595581170"><strong>Unchecked and Unbalanced: Presidential Power in a Time of Terror</strong></a>), El-Masri was taken to a U.S. facility in Afghanistan, an abandoned brick factory north of Kabul. His detention there has been confirmed via chemical analysis of his hair, which still contained traces of the soil and particulate matter of the area, and also through the testimony of another detainee, who met and talked to El-Masri. It appears that the CIA learned that Mr. El-Masri was wholly innocent of any connection to terrorism no more than three months after his initial detention; but they still held him for two further months as they debated what to do with him.<br /><br />Represented by the ACLU, Mr. El-Masri filed suit in federal court, seeking restitution and an apology. His case, always a long-shot, was rejected even before Mr. El-Masri was properly in the courthouse door. Both the district court and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected Mr. El-Masri&#39;s tort claims on the ground that any litigation of the case would implicate &quot;state secrets&quot; (a doctrine discussed at greater length <a href="/forumy/2007/03/dangerous-discretion-state-secrets-and.php"><strong>here</strong></a>).<br /><br />The denial of certiorari review may be explicable by the simple strategic logic of the Justices&#39; conference. At least four Justices, who favor broad conceptions of executive power and are little concerned with the availability of individual remedies when rights are violated, likely thought the case correctly decided. Perhaps four others, while troubled by the case, might have thought that pushing for a grant of certiorari would be unwise because of the risk of an adverse judgment. Call it a &quot;defensive denial.&quot; They might have thought that the Court should confront the &quot;state secrets&quot; doctrine in a less fraught context, e.g., in commercial and employment cases, where it occasionally arises. <br /><br />But whatever the narrow strategic reasons for the denial, this week&#39;s decision has broader consequences: It means not only that Mr. El-Masri is denied a remedy for a fragrant and wholly unjustified wrong. It also means that one of the best devices for securing accountability is lost. <br /><br />The denial of judicial remedies must be viewed against the larger failure of congressional oversight of extraterritorial detention operations in general and &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; in particular. Both chambers of Congress have held a series of hearings on detention policies. But the public hearings have largely been heated rehearsals of the debating points from both sides of the aisle. And the indications are that the closed, classified briefings have not been any more illuminating. A <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/leahy-specter-pressing-administration.php">briefing</a> earlier this year on extraordinary rendition left Senators, including Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Arlen Specter (R-PA) scratching their heads in bafflement. It seems fair to guess that the executive has effectively shut Congress out of any careful investigation of specific cases. <br /><br />And now it has done the same in the courts. <br /><br />This means that the heart of the problem goes unaddressed: The government&#39;s decision to seize people and hold them based on evidence that would not and could not permit criminal prosecution. This core policy leads inexorably to wrongful detention. It also sets into motion troubling incentives for government employees. Having seized a person, and made them &quot;disappear&quot; from human society, a government official is under powerful moral, psychological, and bureaucratic pressure to justify her action. The obvious recourse once someone is detained is the person themselves. Hence the slippery slope of abuse, and then torture. And since extraordinary renditions are conducted in the absence of any meaningful external scrutiny (or even, as far as we know, ex post audit), there is every reason to belief this slope becomes steep and extraordinarily slippery. <br /><br />The absence of scrutiny is all the more troubling due to what is known of the process whereby extraordinary renditions are authorized. In El-Masri&#39;s case, for example, it has been reported that the chief of operations in Skopje, Macedonia, who initially authorized the rendition &quot;really wanted a scalp&quot; and that the director of the al Qaeda unit at CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, who signed off on the operation moved forward despite the fact the evidence was slip from the beginning. It was, in short, more Jack Bauer than John Le Carr&eacute;. <br /><br />Further, the evidence suggests that senior political leaders abdicated their proper responsibility for careful oversight. According to the former director of CIA European operations Tyler Drumheller, what political oversight there was proved self-interested, preoccupied by the risk of negative publicity, and callously unconcerned with the possibility that a wholly innocent person might be swept up. <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,462782,00.html"><strong>Drumheller added</strong></a>, &quot;This was no way to run a covert policy. If the White House wants to take extraordinary measures to win, it can&#39;t just let things go through without any discussion about their value and morality.&quot; <br /><br />Available evidence, in short, strongly suggests that the processes that the executive branch has in place to forestall error are feeble. Absent new accountability measures, the net consequence will be obvious: more erroneous renditions (although in the future the Agency may be more careful about leaving evidence behind), and increasing worldwide skepticism about the morality of the United States&#39; position. <br /><br />Accountability is not impossible. After the rendition of a Canadian-Syrian citizen, for example, Canada established a national commission headed by former Supreme Court Justice Dennis O&#39;Connor. The O&#39;Connor inquiry looked not only at the particular case of rendition, but also synoptically at the oversight mechanisms for the Canadian intelligence agencies: It thus wisely used a moment of public attention and outrage as a lever for a more through analysis of systemic failures. One consequence was an award of millions of dollars to the rendition victim&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;a proper and just remediation of a terrible wrong. Perhaps an equally important consequence was the careful <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/feb2007/arar-f06.shtml"><strong>reflection</strong></a> on how the same wrong could be stopped from happening once more. <br /><br />The Supreme Court&#39;s decision not to take the El-Masri case should not be the end of the story: There is a continuing need, animated both by human rights and by security concerns, for accountability over rendition operations. Until such measures are in place, it is impossible to say that these abusive policies have even a jot of security benefit. <br /><br /><em>Disclosure: The author acted as counsel for the Association of the Bar of the City of New York in an amicus brief filed in support of the El-Masri petition for certiorari</em>.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/about/staff"><strong>Anne Weismann</strong></a> [Chief Counsel, <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a>, CREW]: &quot;The White House&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/advocacy-group-seeks-court-order.php">recent refusal</a> to provide assurances that it is preserving back-up copies of the millions of missing emails is clearly part of a larger, more concerted effort to hide information from the public. Other examples include the knowing use of RNC non-governmental email accounts by top White House officials to avoid having their emails captured by the White House&#39;s electronic record-keeping system and the Bush White House&#39;s failure to restore millions of email records deleted from White House servers. Almost from the outset the Bush presidency erected a wall of secrecy around the White House, fighting efforts to open up to public scrutiny the process the vice president used to formulate energy policy, taking a very aggressive stance on the reach of executive privilege and declaring wholesale categories of records off-limits under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Most recently, the White House went a step further when it declared that the Office of Administration (OA), a component of the Executive Office of the President, is no longer an agency subject to the FOIA, thereby reversing the course it had followed since the OA&#39;s inception. <br /><br />It is against this backdrop that CREW, contemporaneously with the filing of its lawsuit against the White House for violations of the record-keeping laws, sought assurances that all back-up copies of the millions of deleted White House email records were being preserved. After all, it was the White House&#39;s own OA that had proposed using these back-up tapes to restore the deleted records, a recommendation that the White House ignored. The White House&#39;s duty to preserve the only remaining copies of an important body of historical documents for future public access is clear under the law. Nevertheless, the White House has decried this obligation, arguing in response to CREW&#39;s request that it need only save those back-up tapes in its possession as of the date that CREW filed its lawsuit, September 25, 2007, and that this obligation stems from its discovery obligations under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<br /><br />The White House has effectively renounced the Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act, laws that obligate the White House to have an effective electronic record-keeping system in place and to restore the millions of deleted emails. As a nation of laws, we should be offended by the cavalier disregard shown by the White House toward its record-keeping obligations.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mayerslaw.com/"><strong>Gary Mayerson</strong></a> [Director of the <a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/index.php">Autism Speaks</a> Federal Legal Appeals Project (FLAP), a national pro bono initiative]: &quot;While <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/supreme-court-affirms-reimbursement-for.php">the 4-4 decision of the Supreme Court</a> in <u>Tom. F.</u> creates no precedent except to continue the Second Circuit&#39;s underlying decision, it was clear from the arguments that one faction of the court was moved primarily if not solely by the obvious wealth of the plaintiff, and this dynamic was unfortunate, as it clouded the court&#39;s consideration of what would be the impact if it ever were to reverse the <u>Tom F.</u> decision.<br /><br />Much of the argument focused on whether or not the Court should adopt a &quot;presumption of competence&quot; to protect school districts. This was puzzling as the High Court already had adopted this presumption when it rendered its decision in <u>Schaffer v. Weast</u>, placing the burden of persuasion on parents to prove that the school district&#39;s offered program was inappropriate. The <u>Schaffer v. Weast</u> presumption of competence is a rebuttable presumption. Had the Supreme Court ruled as New York City had requested, the court would have created an irrebuttable presumption. At least four justices concluded that Congress never intended to create an irrebuttable presumption that could never be overcome, no matter how demonstrably inappropriate the IEP was.<br /><br />The legal impact of a 4-4 decision is a relief for families living within the Second Circuit, since the underlying decision in Tom F. stands. Interestingly enough, just this week, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in <u>Frank G.</u>, which was considered a companion case to <u>Tom F.</u> Once again, Justice Kennedy recused himself. <br /><br />In my view, the legal impact of the 4-4 decision is that the Circuit courts will now have to address and wrestle with the practical implications of ever adopting a rigid rule requiring parents to &quot;try out&quot; a demonstrably inappropriate IEP as the price of admission to the courthouse door. In New York City, many parents are forced to sue for relief because they don&#39;t even get an IEP from the school system--even after attending an IEP meeting. What, if anything, is there to &quot;try&quot; when nothing is offered? In other instances, a child diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder will receive an IEP recommending a grossly inappropriate placement in a school for the emotionally disturbed. Or, a child who is succeeding with support in an inclusion or mainstream classroom with typically developing children will receive an IEP recommending placement in a far more restrictive, <em>self-contained</em> classroom. Does a parent have to agree to violate the &quot;least restrictive environment&quot; sections of IDEIA to ostensibly comply with other, less than clear procedural requirements in the same statute?<br /><br />The 4-4 decision undoubtedly will spark additional discussion and debate. There are other &quot;Tom F.&quot; type situations waiting in the wings, albeit involving families without the financial wherewithal of Tom Freston. Ultimately, I am hopeful that when the other circuits and the high court next consider the issue, the discussion will shift from the purely theoretical to the practical i.e. what really happens in the IEP process. <br /><br />It is hard to accept the fact that loving and caring school districts acting in complete good faith can still sometimes make horrendous mistakes. But unfortunately, especially in urban areas like New York City, potentially disastrous IEP situations happen on a daily basis. With the rebuttable presumption of competence already provided by the high court&#39;s decision in <u>Schaffer</u>, there already is a fair balancing of interests that protects the school district while at the same time allowing the aggrieved parent to try to meet his or her burden to prove that the local educational agency has not done its job. If the parent fails to meet that burden, the parent will not prevail, and the case will be dismissed. Where there is a deprivation of FAPE, there must be continued access to the court system to ensure the provision of due process. That is, in essence, what the holding in <u>Tom F.</u> is all about--receiving one&#39;s day in court. It is hard to believe that parents were only one vote shy of having that right taken away.&quot;<br />

		<title>US military counsel violating Guantanamo client&#039;s rights: Canadian Khadr lawyer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dennis Edney [Canadian defence counsel for Canadian Guantanamo detainee Omar Khadr]: &quot;You may not be aware that <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-military-judge-says-khadr-terror.php">Omar Khadr</a> has, verbally and in writing, asserted his right to be represented by his Canadian counsel and not to be represented by any U.S. military counsel. <br /><br />The Military Commission rules provide for a military lawyer to represent Omar Khadr. Mr. Khadr can choose not to be assisted by the military appointed lawyer and represent himself. In that situation, the military lawyer remains in a &quot;stand down&quot; mode. By purporting to speak on behalf of Omar Khadr to the media and participating in the legal process absent authority to do so, a legal fiction is being created that military counsel [Lt. Commander William Kuebler] is authorized to represent Omar Khadr. In doing so, military counsel is denying Omar Khadr&#39;s fundamental right to counsel of choice. He is also interfering in the sacrosanct solicitor/ client relationship between Canadian counsel and client.<br /><br />As the U.S. Supreme Court said in recognizing this right, &quot;In the long history of British criminal jurisprudence, there was only one tribunal that ever adopted a practice of forcing a counsel upon an unwilling defendant in a criminal proceeding. The tribunal was the Star Chamber&quot;.<br /><br />The very fact the military lawyer is appointed by the same authority that is adverse in interest to Omar Khadr creates obvious conflict difficulties. Conflict takes many forms. How can the military officer purport to be independent when he swears and oath of loyalty to the military authority, its rules and regulations which deny his fundamental rights, the rule of law while at the same time swearing a loyalty to uphold the rights of the client. The duty of loyalty extends beyond the use and abuse of confidential information and includes a duty to avoid conflicts of interest. <br /><br />Further, Omar Khadr is facing criminal/ terrorist related charges. He is entitled to competent and effective legal representation. Commander Kuebler cannot be said to be acting in Omar Khadr&#39;s best interest when he has no legal or trial experience in the area of law in which Omar faces life imprisonment. His legal background is in the area of tax law.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Dr. <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/law/Staff/laurent_pech.html">Laurent Pech</a>, Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Union Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, says that the experience of France - and some principled reflections - should make the US House of Representatives think twice before adopting any resolution labelling the early twentieth-century killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire (now Turkey) as &quot;genocide&quot;...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/laurentpechnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>o quote Justice Stewart, the "camel's nose is in the tent." Indeed, the 110th US Congress appears willing to follow in the footsteps of the French Parliament by attempting to legislate on past historical events. The numerous advocates of <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.RES.106:">House Resolution 106</a>, the so-called "Affirmation of the United States Record on the Armenian Genocide Resolution", want the US President to acknowledge that the mass killings of Armenians committed in Turkey between 1915 and 1923 constitute, this is the controversial aspect, a "genocide", i.e. the intentional destruction, in whole or in part, of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. <br /><br />This attempt to use the force of the law to promote a particular historical interpretation is reminiscent of the 2001 French law which acknowledges the existence of the Armenian genocide in 1915. One may hope, however, that Resolution 106 will not have the votes to pass on the House floor and that history will be left to historians. Principled and pragmatic reasons may be offered to justify this view.<br /><br />One should note, in passing, that I do not intend to debate here whether the term "genocide" &#8212; a <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/p_genoci.htm">crime under international law since 1948</a> &#8212; is the accurate term to <em>a posteriori</em> characterize the 1915-1923 massacres. My general position is that no Parliament should legislate to promote or worse, enforce particular historical truths.<br /><br />In France, the statutory characterization of the mass slaughter of Ottoman Armenians as a genocide led to the introduction in 2006 of several bills (yet to be adopted) whose purpose was to punish with criminal sentences those who "dispute" this characterization. Such content-based prohibition on free speech is certainly and thankfully unthinkable in the US, since the First Amendment precludes the government from prohibiting "the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable" (<a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/491/397/case.html">Texas v. Johnson</a>, 491 US 397, at 414). Yet, the "mere" statutory recognition of the Armenian genocide may encourage diverse groups to lobby the US Congress to have their historical narratives enshrined in the law. <br /><br />Generally speaking, it is important to be wary about the <em>slippery slope effect</em> of such laws. And indeed, the French Parliament, since it first acknowledged the existence of the Armenian genocide, seems to have found a new raison d'&Atilde;&ordf;tre in legislating with the view of promoting and eventually compelling people to accept state-sponsored historical interpretations. For instance, another law passed in 2001 obliges people to describe the slave trade as "a crime against humanity" and a provision of a 2005 law &#8212; later struck down by the French constitutional court &#8212; also required school history teachers to stress the "positive aspects" of French colonialism. <br /><br />The American congressional resolution may also be opposed on the grounds that no individual country has the moral authority to sanction particular historical truths regarding events in which it is not, directly or indirectly, involved. On the contrary, what I would call "historical imperialism", the action of legislating to sanctify a particular interpretation of a past event which took place in another country, appears to be counterproductive. First of all, historical imperialism may lead to a vicious circle where each country tries to expose each other's past crimes and hypocrisy. For instance, Turkey may be tempted to push for the adoption of bill aimed at punishing anyone who does not characterize as genocide the killings of Algerians under French colonial rule or the mass slaughter of American Indians by European settlers. Secondly, the passing of time and the promotion of free speech values is more likely to help the Turks to "arrive at the truth on their own" as a <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9910136">former chief of Armenia's National Security Council</a> put it. The French Republic, known for its persistent refusal until 1995 to recognize the responsibility of the French State in the deportations of French Jews to Nazi Germany under the Vichy regime (1940-44), would have been well-advised to show more self-restraint. The atrocities committed against the Armenians in Turkey took place before Ataturk proclaimed the Turkish Republic. If the French Republic could distance itself from the actions of the Vichy regime, the Turkish Republic should also be entitled to distance itself from the actions of the so-called Committee of Union and Progress at the time of the Ottoman Empire.<br /><br />If the causes of historical truth and the prevention of future genocides are the genuine concerns of those in favor of adopting Resolution 106, strict adherence to human rights standards at home and the non-selective defense of those standards abroad would certainly constitute a wiser policy than legislating on other countries' historical misdeeds.<br /><br /><br /><em>Laurent Pech is Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Union Public Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway and the author of a comparative study (in French) on the right to free speech in the US and in Europe: <a href="http://www.droit.u-clermont1.fr/?id=948">La libert&Atilde;&copy; d'expression et sa limitation</a> (PU Clermont-Ferrand/LGDJ, Paris, 2003).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=152">David Crane</a> of Syracuse University College of Law, former Chief Prosecutor for the UN Special Court for Sierra Leone, announces the launch of Impunity Watch, a new online monitor of human rights abuses worldwide ....<br /><br />This op-ed was written with Cheryl G. Murphy, a 3L attending Syracuse University College of Law and a special features reporter for Impunity Watch.<br /><hr size=1><br /><img src="/forumy/impunitywatch1.jpg"/><p><font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>magine if Anne Frank had had access to the internet &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; if others had been informed of her situation, help might have been sent her way before the Nazis had the chance to discover her hideout leading to her untimely death in a concentration camp. People in situations of oppression, whose fundamental human rights are being violated, might be able to tell others of their horrific situation and receive help if only given an outlet to do so. Impunity Watch, an interactive website which operates as a law review, message board, and blog has been created with the objective of giving a voice to people who are silenced &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; people like Anne Frank [1]. <br /><br />After observing firsthand the effects of the pillaging, mutilation and mass murder of civilians that occurred during Sierra Leone's Civil War, the idea of developing the concept of Impunity Watch began to take shape. Impunity Watch informs people of human rights violations that are committed across the globe. It is hoped by reporting on and monitoring of various human rights abuses and impunity-related issues will create a global consciousness of these atrocities is critically needed [2]. Those who know of oppressive situations or who are oppressed themselves also will have the opportunity to voice these abuses on the website, leading to a greater awareness. <br /><br />My biggest challenge in West Africa was indifference brought upon by an over- committed and war crimes weary international community looking elsewhere. West Africa is a forgotten "dark corner" of the world, ignored, and in some ways still forgotten. The past ten years have turned the region into a quagmire of pain and suffering beyond description. <br /><br />It is that indifference that was faced there, and elsewhere, that must be addressed through awareness and understanding. In this day and age of the world-wide-web the ability to link atrocity, neglect, and despair directly into the daily lives of more privileged peoples and nations who have a capacity to do something, to care may be a catalyst for action. With this understanding and rising level of care, the indifference international tribunals, courts, and chambers encounter on the periphery of civilization may begin to wane. It is time that we use these technical tools so that we don't hear right-minded citizens of the world muttering &quot;had I only known.&quot;<br /><br />As I traveled up-country in Sierra Leone, and elsewhere, I was always amazed that even in places that have no electricity and other basic services, small little internet caf&Atilde;&copy;s had sprung up in shacks. People stood patiently in line to sit down to link them to a different world. It is here where I thought how important it would be if these people had the ability to link to a site on the internet to warn, to talk about, to report an atrocity, war crime, a crime against humanity, even the beginning of a genocide. Impunity Watch began in my mind then. It is now a reality.<br /><br />Impunity Watch's mission is to monitor and address horrific human rights abuses and possible situations of impunity. Whether the atrocities committed are acts of discrimination, acts of human trafficking such as the forced labor or sexual exploitation of individuals, the denial of access to food and water, acts of genocide, or other violations of fundamental human rights, those who commit these inhumane acts should be held accountable and brought to justice and Impunity Watch will be in the forefront creating awareness of these tragedies [3]. <br /><br />Two years after my return from West Africa, on Thursday, October 11th, Impunity Watch will officially launch its website during a ceremony at Syracuse University College of Law where my friend and colleague, Dr. Henry T. King, Jr. will dedicate this new tool in the fight against impunity and indifference [4]. It is hoped that those of us associated with Impunity Watch will know it has made a difference when that first life is affected &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; when that person can have his or her thoughts and situation discovered by the world long before the world finds them scrawled into a diary. The spirit of Anne Frank will be with us that day.<br /><br />Please visit Impunity Watch at: <a href="http://www.impunitywatch.net">http://www.impunitywatch.net</a><br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'><br />Notes<br /><br />1. Impunity Watch is completely run by students at Syracuse University College of Law.  Approximately 40 students act as editors, researchers and reporters, devoting their time and effort toward informing others of human rights abuses being committed and ensuring worldwide awareness of those who receive impunity for their inhumane actions.  Since Impunity Watch will be entirely paperless, all of the reporting and updates can be done at anytime of the day from anywhere in the world.  This flexibility ensures that breaking news is continuously posted 24/7, keeping people up to date on the most current atrocities being committed. <br /><br />2. Articles written by scholars, professionals, and students are also published on the website, bringing a more in-depth perspective to the abuses and instances of impunity that occur.  <br /><br />3. What does "impunity" mean?  In a report presented to the Commission on Human Rights, impunity has been defined as the impossibility of bringing human rights violators to account arising from, among other things, a failure of States to meet their obligations to investigate, prosecute, and punish violators or from a failure of States to take necessary steps to prevent recurrence of violations.<br />   <br />4. Dr. Henry T. King, Jr., a prosecutor at the Nuremburg Trials, was assigned to prosecute the German General Staff and High Command at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, 1945.<br /></font><br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that despite recent remarkable rulings the Supreme Court of Pakistan should avoid venturing further into the treacherous waters of judicial activism and should not disturb the new political deal between President Pervez Musharraf and Benazir Bhutto under which the military leader pardoned the alleged crimes of the former prime minister ahead of her expected return to the country...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Pakistan Supreme Court has successfully created a constitutional mess that may do more harm than good. Its judicial activism and bravery in defying President Pervez Musharraf&#39;s efforts to humiliate the judiciary and in reinstating suspended Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry was appreciated in legal circles throughout the world. Its exercise of <em>suo moto</em> jurisdiction to protect fundamental constitutional rights has also been a beacon of light for lawyers in Pakistan and other Muslim countries where state officials commit gross violations of rights with little accountability. Despite these admirable successes, the Supreme Court has begun to venture into political minefields, raising serious questions about the long term sustainability of its judicial activism.<br /><br /><strong>Rights versus Politics</strong> <br /><br />The Supreme Court&#39;s judicial activism is overdone when it actually interferes with politics. Of course, rights cannot be separated from politics. And violations of rights which the Court must monitor are related to political forces that determine governmental policies. Yet a responsible judiciary must constantly distinguish between the calculus of rights and the dynamics of politics. The Supreme Court rests on firm ground when it intervenes in public matters to preserve constitutional rights. It treads shaky ground, however, when the Court wishes to engineer political forces for the good of the country or for the greater protection of constitutional order. Engineering political forces through active judicial intervention is, and ought to be, beyond the scope of judicial authority. <br /><br />Take the October 6 Presidential election. The Supreme Court may exercise its authority to hold whether a candidate holding two public offices, one civilian and the other military, may contest a Presidential election. This is not judicial activism. The Court may also rule whether the Presidential election for a five-year term ought to be held before or after general elections of the Electoral College. This is not mere politics. However, the Court&#39;s decision to split the baby between competing political forces has been most prejudicial to the nation&#39;s stability. The Court prohibits the Election Commission from announcing the result of an otherwise validly-held Presidential election. This sort of judicial engineering that throws the future into uncertainty is anything but the protection of rights. It invites forces of disobedience. <br /><br />According to Pakistani folk wisdom - sometimes superior to untested constitutional interpretations - the best time to stop the cat from drinking the milk is before he drinks the milk. No strategy is effective in squeezing the milk out of the cat&#39;s belly. This folk wisdom dictates that it will be highly adventurous for the Supreme Court to now declare that General Musharraf could not lawfully contest the Presidential election. Any such ruling would be harmful to the protection of rights. The time to shoo away the cat has passed.<br /><br /><strong>Politics versus Politics</strong><br /><br />The Supreme Court&#39;s judicial activism is even more objectionable when it begins to sort out political competition. When it comes to politics versus politics, a responsible judiciary stays out. In the United States, the doctrine of &quot;political questions&quot; provides useful, though imperfect, guidance for the judiciary. The political question doctrine clears the path for political forces to contest with each other, win, and lose. Judges may have a preferred dog in the fight. The political question doctrine, however, mandates that judges leave dog fights to dogs. Any judicial intervention to tilt the political field for or against a political party is uncalled for. The judiciary loses respect, not gains it, when it imposes its preferences on the political process or when it appears to be supporting or opposing certain political operators. <br /><br />Applying these insights, it would be inappropriate for the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the Executive Ordinance under which the Musharraf government has lately pardoned the alleged crimes of Benazir Bhutto. The Ordinance is most certainly a seamy political transaction between two political operators, Musharraf and Bhutto, who seek power and will do anything to keep it. The deal is even more repulsive after Nawaz Sharif&#39;s deportation contrary to Supreme Court order. Despite these obvious problems with the Ordinance, the Supreme Court must not disturb the Musharraf-Bhutto political deal. By declaring the Ordinance offensive to the Constitution, the Supreme Court will further confuse the political scene, inviting chaos and perhaps military intervention. <br /><br />Let the general elections in January 2008 sort out the politics.<br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan grew up in Pakistan and is a law graduate of Punjab University, Lahore.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Moeen Cheema, professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan, says that in its forthcoming ruling on the legal validity of General Pervez Musharraf&#39;s candidacy in the country&#39;s recent presidential election, the Pakistan Supreme Court is being urged to declare that democracy has a minimal content entailing free and fair voting and the absence of military domination and control over politics...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/moeencheema.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n October 6, General Pervez Musharraf contested the election for the office of the President of Pakistan and secured more than fifty-five percent of the votes cast by the members of the national and provincial legislatures that form Pakistan&#39;s electoral college. However, he cannot take the oath of office until the Supreme Court decides a number of petitions challenging his candidacy: the President-elect is also the chief of the armed forces of Pakistan and has contested the election for the Presidency while continuing to be 'in uniform.' <br /><br />Given Pakistan's chequered political history &#8212; dominated as it is by three long stints of direct military rule by army chiefs that displaced elected governments, including the reign of General Musharraf himself who has been in charge since 1999 and has simultaneously held the offices of the President and Chief of Army Staff since 2001 &#8212; it is refreshing that his candidacy has at least become somewhat controversial. It is quite likely though that this phase of refreshing legal controversy shall not last: if the judicial history of Pakistan repeats itself, the court shall once again legitimize the incumbency of a military ruler and validate the fa&Atilde;&#167;ade of democratization carefully erected to hide the real and lasting structures of power inherited from Pakistan's former colonial rulers, upgraded and reinforced over its 60-year history.<br /><br /><strong>The Political Background to the Legal Questions</strong><br /><br />The most important legal question before the court is simply this: can a serving chief of the army contest the election for the Presidency? Article 63(1)(d) of the Constitution appears to state otherwise: an incumbent President shall be disqualified from holding that office if "he holds any office of profit in the service of Pakistan other than an office declared by law not to disqualify its holder." This provision, though originally applicable to the members of parliament only, was made applicable to the President's office through the notorious seventeenth amendment to the constitution. There are two other grounds for the challenge to the general's candidature. First, it may be claimed that the general has already served two terms as President and may thus be barred from seeking a third consecutive term of office. Second, the general is seeking election from a parliament and provincial legislatures that are about to end their terms and thus lacks the mandate to elect a President who may occupy that office for a period of five more years. The answer to the above legal questions may only be sought in a re-appraisal of the political events that unfolded after the coup by General Musharraf on October 12, 1999.<br /><br />Immediately after the military's takeover of power, Pakistan began to experience the unfolding of a blueprint developed by the earlier military regimes of Generals Ayub Khan (1958-69) and Zia-ul-Haq (1977-88), and ratified by the superior courts. However, this time around the plan had been polished and lacked some of the crudity of the earlier takeovers. Immediately after the coup a Proclamation of Emergency was declared, the constitution was put in abeyance and a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) was issued to provide a temporary governing framework; no martial law was declared though and the general assumed the self-styled office of the Chief Executive. In reality, the Chief Executive was a martial law administrator and wielded all the powers of his military predecessors. <br /><br />In January 2000, when the Supreme Court entertained a challenge to the military coup, the efforts to undermine the independence of the judiciary began in an earnest. The judges of the superior courts were compelled to take a new oath of office pledging to serve under the PCO. Six out of a total of thirteen judges of the Supreme Court refused to take the oath and resigned from the bench, including the then Chief Justice Saeduzzaman Siddiqui and Justice (R) Wajih-ud-Din Ahmad, who is now the most notable opponent of the general in the 2007 presidential elections.<br /><br />A reconstituted Supreme Court decided the case of <em>Zafar Ali Shah v Pervez Musharraf</em> on May 12, 2000 and validated the coup on the grounds of the doctrine of state necessity. The court granted virtually unlimited powers to the military regime, including the power to amend the constitution so long as its salient features &#8212; parliamentary form of government, federalism and the independence of the judiciary &#8212; were left intact. The court, however, imposed one potentially meaningful restriction: the military regime had to hold general elections for the national parliament and provincial legislatures no later than three years from the date of the coup. <br /><br />In December 2000, a new local government structure was launched with a view to lay the foundations of the facade of democratization, and to cultivate a new breed of loyal politicians who may use their new-found powers and the control over public resources to influence a general election in favour of the regime. In June 2001, General Musharraf dismissed the lame duck President and assumed that office through a decree. In April 2002, he held a stage-managed referendum claiming to win 96% of the votes cast and securing the office of the President for a five-year term ending in October 2007. In August 2007, just prior to holding the general elections mandated by the court, he issued a Legal Framework Order (LFO) which barred the leaders of Pakistan's two main political parties from contesting and revived the notorious Article 58(2)(b) powers of the President to dismiss the incoming parliament at will.<br /><br />The general elections were held on October 10, 2002. Despite the best efforts of the intelligence agencies and the unqualified use of the local government resources, the so-called 'King's Party' of the general's loyalists, the Pakistan Muslim League (Q), failed to win an outright majority in the national legislature. An alliance of religious parties, the now much maligned Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), emerged as the prime beneficiary of the regime's efforts to undermine the mainstream political parties and won a substantial presence in the legislatures for the first time in the country's history. The MMA also won the right to form the provincial governments in the two provinces bordering Afghanistan that are now the centre of the attention in the War on Terror. <br /><br />For over a year the MMA and the other opposition parties succeeded in disrupting the business of parliament, thereby denying the military regime the satisfaction of the masquerade of a stable legislature and a popular elected government. Questions regarding the legal validity of the LFO, the referendum and other actions taken during the three-year long 'state necessity' phase also hounded the regime. In December 2003, the regime finally reached an agreement with the MMA and with its support mustered the two-third majority in parliament necessary to pass the seventeenth amendment to the constitution. The seventeenth amendment validated almost all of the actions taken during the state necessity phase, including the referendum and the revival of the presidential power to dismiss the parliament. In return the MMA secured a pro
mise from the general to give up the office of the army chief by end of year 2004. The seventeenth amendment formalized that understanding by making Article 63(1)(d), mentioned above, applicable to the office of the President as of the first day of 2005.<br /><br />In November 2004, the general reneged on his promise to give up the command of the armed forces and the efforts to provide legal cover to the simultaneous occupation of the offices of the President and army chief culminated in the passing by parliament of the President to Hold Another Office Act, 2004 (PHAA). Without the support of the MMA, this time the regime could only muster a simple majority to pass a simple legislation which stated that the office of the Chief of Army Staff (CoAS) was, under this law, declared to be an office that did not disqualify its holder from assuming the office of the President. This neat piece of legalism was made applicable to only one person, General Musharraf, and for one term of presidential office only.<br /><br /><strong>The 'Doctrine of Perpetual Transition and Indefinite Democratization'</strong><br /><br />In the <em>Pakistan Lawyers Forum</em> case the Supreme Court was called upon to judge the validity of this seventeenth amendment as well as the PHAA 2004. The court validated the above on the basis of arguments which were termed by many in the legal fraternity as an extension of the doctrine of state necessity. I believe that the doctrinal basis of the <em>Pakistan Lawyers Forum</em> case is sufficiently distinct, and arguably more sinister than the doctrine of state necessity, to merit in the least a separate and more glorious title. I propose the christening of the 'Doctrine of Perpetual Transition and Indefinite Democratization'.<br /><br />In the above case, the court refused to question the validity of the LFO and other actions undertaken in the first three years of the regime since these had been validated prospectively by the Supreme Court in the <em>Zafar Ali Shah</em> case and retroactively by parliament via the seventeenth constitutional amendment. The court dismissed the arguments that the LFO was violative of the <em>Zafar Ali Shah</em> case since it altered the salient features of the constitution, particularly the parliamentary form of government, and that the seventeenth amendment fell foul of the 'basic structures' doctrine referred to in some recent Supreme Court cases. The court stated that Pakistan had evolved (in the aftermath of the eleven-year long rule of General Zia-ul-Haq) a mixed parliamentary-presidential form of government. The idea of executive control over parliament was supported by references to constitutional mechanisms in several Western states which enable the executive offices of the President or the Governor General to dismiss legislatures or refuse assent to legislative measures. It was also mentioned, rather disingenuously, that until recently the Queen of England also enjoyed similar powers.<br /><br />Most significantly, the court ruled that it would not question the seventeenth amendment as it had been passed by an elected legislature, nor would it take any measure that might de-track the transition to democracy in Pakistan. The court appeared to have bought the arguments of the then Attorney General to the effect that there is no definite meaning or content of democracy beyond the basic requirement that elections of some sort be held for some posts. This relative and minimalist notion of representative democracy was satisfied, according to the court, by the facts that there had been general elections in the country, national and provincial legislatures were functioning and the structures of parliamentary democracy were in place, even if some of the spirit were lacking. It was also hinted that although this transitional democratic set-up fell somewhat short of the ideal notions of democratic rule, Pakistan is not unique in this respect for such is the case with every modern state: all modern democratic constitutions are imperfect in some ways, some more imperfect than others, and all are perpetually evolving towards more democratic forms.<br /><br />These notions of the vacuousness of democracy and the value of transition, no matter how slow in its progression, were then employed to validate the PHAA 2004. The court found no cavil with the Act that declared the CoAS eligible to hold the office of the President since it was a law validly passed by parliament and accorded with the literal interpretation of Article 63(1)(d). The court thereby appeared to hold that any law passed by parliament would qualify the holder of any office in the service of Pakistan to simultaneously hold the office of the President &#8212; for example, the CoAS, any Corps Commander or other army official, any bureaucrat, any employee of a semi-government organization, and so on &#8212; and that would not be contrary to the constitution. The absurdity of this pronunciation is further appreciated if one understands that by the same logic other office holders may also simultaneously occupy the office of the President: for example, the Prime Minister may also hold that office as well as any member of Cabinet, so long as parliamentary approval is forthcoming. Likewise, any serving bureaucrat or army officer may contest the general elections and become a member of parliament if the legislature were to validate that opportunity through a simple Act. According to the court, neither the constitution nor some ethereal notion of democracy bar such possibilities.<br /><br /><strong>Deligitimization of Military Takeovers</strong><br /><br />President-elect General Pervez Musharraf is on the verge of achieving what no military dictator has previously achieved in Pakistan: namely, a third term, a successful transition from military to semi-democratic rule and the possibility of a somewhat honourable exit. In late 2005, the cycle of local government elections then Presidential elections then general elections was re-initiated: pro-Musharraf local governments are well-entrenched and ready to throw their weight behind the loyalists in the upcoming general elections. The general, however, made the mistake of prematurely and aggressively seeking compliance from the superior judiciary through a failed attempt to dismiss the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in March 2007. It is this act which led to a movement by lawyers and civil society, triggering a wider political awakening in the country, and resulting in a wave of judicial activism beginning with the reinstatement of the Chief Justice by the Supreme Court. If the general had not made that false move, it is likely that the Presidential elections would have been won by now, a caretaker government of his liking would already have been in place, and the regime would be all set to stage-manage another general election.<br /><br />Instead, the Supreme Court has now to decide whether the general's candidacy for the presidency, while holding the office of the army chief, was valid even though he has promised to give up that office prior to taking the oath of the office of the President and has even nominated a successor. The court is being pressed to hold that the PHAA 2004 was unconstitutional to begin with, or in the least does not entitle the general to contest for another term in the Presidency while holding the office of the army chief. It is also being argued that the general has already served two consecutive terms, the first prior to and the second beginning with the referendum, and thus may not serve another term in the Presidency. Lastly, the court is being asked to undo the scheme of holding presidential elections prior to the general elections, thereby facilitating the maintenance of presidential domination over the incoming assembly, and require the president to seek election from the new parliament after a free and fair general election.<br /><br />In essence, the court is being asked to declare that there is a minimum content of democracy which entails free and fair elections and the absence of the military's domination and control over politics. The court is also being asked t
o commence the process of the delegitimization of military takeovers by dismantling first the doctrine that proffers legal validity to the controlled democracy put in place by successive military regimes and ultimately disbanding the doctrine of state necessity.<br /><br /><br /><em>Moeen Cheema is an Assistant Professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that US Attorney General nominee Judge Michael Mukasey should take a more forthright stand on the criminality of torture committed by US personnel acting under executive authorization in the &quot;war on terror&quot;...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavis.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>M</strong></font>any of us are closely watching the confirmation hearing for US Attorney General nominee Judge Michael Mukasey to get a sense of how this man will address a central issue affecting America&#39;s standing in the world: torture.<br /><br />The indications from his presentation Wednesday were troubling. When referring to the infamous 2002 Bybee memo, he seemed to dodge the issue of the actions of the US Justice Department and other lawyers by stating that "the Bybee memo was worse than a sin, it was a mistake.&quot;<br /><br />I could almost hear the lawyers who carefully worked to subvert the Geneva Conventions and other international law breathe a sigh of relief. To me, Judge Mukasey was signaling that he was going to go along to get along. What I mean by that is that he was going to view the legal efforts so roundly denounced as merely "misfeasance" &#8212; the classic dodge used for high-level civilian actions &#8212; rather than malfeasance &#8212; crimes for which low-level military were prosecuted as part of the detainee scandal. He appears to be saying those instructions in those memos as to what was permitted can be chalked up to "mistakes were made."<br /><br />Yet we know the intentionality with which those documents were carefully written to create a definition of torture that would permit torture. We know of the repudiation of December 2004 followed by the 2005 newly-revealed secret memos allowing the torture to continue that were a carefully orchestrated charade to get Attorney General Gonzales confirmed and keep the torture going.<br /><br />Judge Mukasey spoke of our treaty obligations and the President's Executive Order and stated that we do not torture. The problem with that trope, Judge Mukasey, is that we do torture. <br /><br />We have waterboarded &#8212; that is torture. We have had the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) report on acts done by our personnel in Iraq that were "tantamount to torture." And we know of an ICRC Report on the CIA Black Sites detention and interrogation which is reported to state that we have tortured. Further, on Thursday, Maher Arar is going to recite his being sent to Syria by the United States to be tortured. We have tortured and when Judge Mukasey is read in, I hope that those who have done all these things will read him in on the full dimensions of this torture. <br /><br />And that torture is not the result of a few bad apples, but of a policy and planning put in place by the President on down including the Office of Legal Counsel in his Justice Department. In an environment where persons aggressively bandy about the idea of a unitary executive, Judge Mukasey's distinct unwillingness to answer whether he thinks there is a Commander-in-Chief override on torture is very troubling. He has blinked when we seek a firm stare back at us.<br /><br />I would imagine he has blinked notwithstanding his recital of the abhorrent history of torture which we saw committed in World War II by our enemies. But now it is us who are tempted by the same demon. And every instinct of judicial deference Judge Mukasey has I would imagine is leading him to not stand in the way of the President who is bound to protect the United States.<br /><br />Yet, in the case of torture, the United States has an international obligation freely assumed in treaties which is also the product of painful customary international law creation to which there is no possibility of derogation or excuse. It is clear from Jack Goldsmith's new book that this White House and this Congress have not wished to bend their wills to that standard. Rather, they have preferred to bend the standard to their wills. That is not the rule of law &#8212; that is the rule of men.<br /><br />I hope that Judge Mukasey will have the intestinal fortitude to look back at the former and present lawyers and others who put in place this monstrous torture structure and cleanse the state of their criminality by prosecuting them for their malfeasance. There are plenty of federal laws that they have violated. As part of helping to develop the political will for that, I hope that he will be the one who will release the ICRC report on the CIA Black Sites to the American people. One does not have to be a former federal judge or confirmed by the Senate to be able to handle the truth. The American people can handle the truth. Let us read how our leaders have tortured in our names. Then, if we turn a blind eye &#8212; let it be on us. As in another generation in another country, let us not have the principal legal officer of our government continue to provide the American people that most convenient of alibis "I didn't know." There are plenty of good Americans who refuse to be good Germans.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<title>Is waterboarding torture? Judge Mukasey says he doesn&#039;t know</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/curriculum/tab_faculty.cfm?Status=Faculty&Detail=1794"><strong>Gary Solis</strong></a> [Adjunct professor, <a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/">Georgetown University Law Center</a> and former Marine Corps judge advocate and military judge]: &quot;[During his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing last Thursday,] Attorney General-nominee Michael Mukasey could not or <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/white-house-defends-mukasey-refusal-to.php"><strong>would not say</strong></a> if he considers waterboarding torture. &quot;If it is torture, it is unconstitutional,&quot; he responded when asked. By now, most of us know what the interrogation technique of waterboarding is. It is widely reported and generally understood that the U.S. employs it. Waterboarding is often described as inducing the sensation of drowning. That bland description hardly does justice to the agony, distress, and terror that the enhanced interrogation technique induces in victims. But Judge Mukasey doesn&#39;t know if waterboarding is torture.<br /><br />The U.S. Army has long known. During the U.S.- Philippine War (1899-1902), five Army officers, Major Edwin Glenn, Captain Cornelius Brownell, 1st Lieutenants Julien Gaujot, Edwin Hickman, and Preston Brown, were convicted by courts-martial for employing the &quot;water cure&quot; in interrogating Philippine prisoners. Although Brownell&#39;s victim, a local priest, died while being subjected to the water cure, Brownell&#39;s conviction was set aside on jurisdictional grounds. Army juries rejected the defense of &quot;military necessity,&quot; recognizing the water cure for what it is. The Army&#39;s Judge Advocate General, the reviewing officer of Glenn&#39;s case, derisively noted, &quot;the resort to torture is attempted to be justified&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;as the habitual method of obtaining information from individual insurgents.&quot; In the Vietnam War, Army Staff Sergeant David Carmon was disciplined after he was pictured torturing a prisoner with the water cure. But Judge Mukasey doesn&#39;t know if waterboarding is torture.<br /><br />After World War II, several nations prosecuted former enemies for variations of waterboarding. The U.N. War Crimes Commission, in its <em>Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals</em>, details convictions for the near-drowning of prisoners during interrogations. The <u>Sawada</u> case was a U.S. military commission in which &quot;the water treatment&quot; of captured Doolittle raiders was a basis for convicting Sawada and others. A Norwegian military court convicted Karl-Hans Klinge of the same torture. American military commission convictions reported elsewhere include, <u>U.S. v. Chinsaku Yuki</u>, <u>U.S. v. Yagoheiji Iwata, and U.S. v. Hideji Nakamura and Others</u>, all resulting from the water treatment of American or Philippine prisoners. The Judgment of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East says, &quot;The practice of torturing prisoners of war and civilian internees prevailed at practically all places occupied by Japanese troops&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;. Among these tortures were the water treatment&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;.&quot; But Judge Mukasey doesn&#39;t know if waterboarding is torture.<br /><br />U.S. domestic courts describe &quot;the water cure&quot; and &quot;water torture&quot; as human rights violations, and a means to coerce confessions, in <u>In Re Estate of Ferdinand E. Marcos</u> (D. Hawaii, 1995) and <u>U.S. v. Lee</u> (5th Cir., 1984). In Chile, the 2005 National Commission of Political Imprisonment and Torture, investigating abuses of the Pinochet era, documents the common use of water torture during interrogations. Argentine and Chilean criminal prosecutions continue today. But Judge Mukasey doesn&#39;t know if waterboarding is torture.<br /><br />Some suggest that waterboarding cannot be torture because it is part of U.S. military Survival, Escape, Resistance, and Evasion (SERE) training. But the difference between medically-monitored training and real-world abuse is like being inoculated against a disease and being injected with the disease. They are hardly the same. It remains amazing that, in 2007, any intelligent person can have any question that waterboarding constitutes torture, morally and ethically wrong, and contrary to U.S. law, U.S.-ratified multi-national treaties, and international criminal law. But Judge Michael Mukasey doesn&#39;t know if waterboarding is torture.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/rona_g.htm"><strong>Gabor Rona</strong></a> [International Legal Director, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.asp">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;I previously <a href="/hotline/2007/09/military-commissions-review-court.php">commented</a> on JURIST about the flaws in the U.S. Court of Military Commission Review&#39;s recent <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/CMCR%20ruling%209-24-07.pdf">decision</a> to reinstate the Guantanamo Military Commission <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-military-judge-says-khadr-terror.php">proceedings against Omar Khadr</a>, who is <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Apr2007/Khadrreferral.pdf">charged</a> with murder of an American soldier, attempted murder, providing material support to terrorists and spying. <br /><br />Khadr was 15 years old when taken to Guantanamo and is now in his 6th year of confinement there. Elaine Chao, the U.S. Secretary of Labor, has spoken of the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/_sec/media/speeches/20030507_ILAB_ChildSoldiers.htm">responsibility to give child soldiers special treatment</a>, to provide help for them to re-integrate into society. She announced a $13 million program to help re-integrate child-soldiers in Afghanistan back into Afghan society. Omar Khadr, however, was treated as an adult. He is the only person at Guantanamo to be charged for acts committed as a juvenile. That fact alone must cause one to wonder whether there isn&#39;t the slightest hint of desperation in the decision to charge him. Here&#39;s a juvenile who, having spent much of his short life with his parents in the throes of radical Islam and Al Qaeda camps, attacks a combatant who is fighting for an invading army. The death of even one American soldier is an unspeakable tragedy. But has America become so small, so frightened, that it has to make a criminal poster child out of a child soldier? Is this the right strategy in a &quot;war&quot; that is more about winning hearts and minds than gaining territory?<br /><br />And is Omar Khadr even a war criminal? Not likely. Khadr is charged with murder in violation of the laws of war - a crime under the Military Commissions Act (MCA). But remember, the person he allegedly killed was a combatant. It is the most fundamental principle of the law of armed conflict that combatants may be targeted (and civilians may not). Contrary to the assumption of the appellate court and the prosecutors, a civilian who kills a combatant does not thereby violate the laws of war. The recent U.S.- manufactured label &quot;unlawful combatant,&quot; and the decision to hang it on Omar Khadr, is a clever rhetorical device, but it cannot make criminal that which is not. While the U.S. could conceivably make it a crime for foreign civilians to kill U.S. combatants in wars overseas, it has not done so. And if it does, such a law could only be applied prospectively (to acts that occurred after that law is enacted). To apply a criminal law retroactively would violate the most fundamental principle of criminal law, the principle of legality, which prohibits prosecution for acts that are not criminal at the time of their commission.<br /><br />But that&#39;s just the tip of the melting iceberg. Khadr is also charged with attempted murder in violation of the laws of war, an allegation that is just as flawed as the murder charge, and for the same reasons. In addition, he is charged with conspiracy, with material support for terrorism, and with spying - all crimes that do not exist in the laws of war and did not exist under applicable U.S. law at the time of Khadr&#39;s alleged acts. (Yes, even spying is not a crime under the international laws of war. It can be made a crime under domestic law, and so it has been in the MCA, but the problem of retroactive application remains, due to a small detail involving application of law to facts. Historically, the laws of war prohibited trying an individual for spying if he managed to return to his own lines. Khadr is alleged to have returned to the bosom of Al Qaida following his alleged spying and before his capture. Domestic law could conceivably be written to erase this escape-valve provision, but again, it could only be applied prospectively). As for the crime of conspiracy, a U.S. Supreme Court plurality consisting of Justices Stevens, Souter, Breyer and Ginsburg has already stated, in <u>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</u> 126 S. Ct. 2749 (2006), that <a href="/forumy/2006/06/hamdan-v-rumsfeld-supreme-court.php">&quot;conspiracy&quot; cannot be charged</a> as a violation of the law of war. The bottom line: every act with which Khadr is charged is either not a crime or was not a crime at the time he allegedly committed it.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ecbalaw.com/attorneys/wilson.html"><strong>Andrew Wilson</strong></a> [attorney for Abdallah Higazy in <em>Higazy v. Millennium Hotel et al.</em>] &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2007/10/federal-appeals-court-rules-wrongful.php">Mr. Higazy&#39;s case</a> is based on his claim that FBI Agent Templeton coerced his confession which was later used against him in a bail proceeding in violation of the Fifth Amendment. <br /><br />Higazy was arrested on the suspicion that he was staying in a hotel across from the World Trade Center on September 11 with a ground-to-air radio capable of guiding the planes into the towers. After five hours of post-polygraph questioning from Templeton, Higazy confessed to owning the radio. This admission &#8212; at the time tantamount to being a conspirator in the 9/11 attacks &#8212; was then used against Higazy at two subsequent bail hearings: the first to detain him as a material witness, and the second as part of the government&#39;s criminal case against him for lying to federal investigators. After more than a month in solitary confinement fearing a trial on his role in the 9/11 attacks, all charges were dropped against Mr. Higazy when the owner of the radio, a pilot from Ohio, came forward and requested it back. <br /><br />The Second Circuit&#39;s recent decision in Mr. Higazy&#39;s civil case has reinstated liability against Agent Templeton for violation of the Fifth Amendment for use of the confession in Mr. Higazy&#39;s criminal bail hearing. This is an important decision for constitutional advocates because it establishes, after <u>Chavez v. Martinez</u>, 538 U.S. 760, 770 (2003), that the use of a confession at a criminal bail hearing violates the Fifth Amendment. The opinion leaves open the interesting question of whether a material witness bail hearing is a &quot;criminal case&quot; for the purposes of the Fifth Amendment. The latter question has far-reaching consequences in the &quot;war on terror.&quot; <br /><br />It has become clear that, in the rush to investigate the September 11 attacks, the FBI widely employed material witness statutes to arrest suspects, rather than obtain arrest warrants that would have required the demonstration of probable cause. Robert Mueller, the head of the FBI during the September 11 investigation, has acknowledged that, as part of the September 11 investigation, &quot;a number of suspects were detained on federal, state or local charges; on immigration violations; or on material witness warrants.&quot; (Robert S. Mueller, III, director, FBI, &quot;Speech at the Commonwealth Club of California,&quot; San Francisco, California, April 19, 2002). For those, like Higazy, who have been swept up in this activity, although detained as a material witness, they may be targets of the FBI&#39;s investigation from the outset. If that is the case, they are better considered as subjects of criminal proceedings and protected by the Fifth Amendment from the use of their testimony against them. The Second Circuit has still not decided whether the use of a coerced confession at a bail hearing pursuant to the material witness statute violates the Fifth Amendment.<br /><br />The Second Circuit&#39;s decision in Mr. Higazy&#39;s case means that his claim based on the use of his confession in his criminal bail hearing will be remanded to the District Court where he will proceed to trial for damages associated with the prolonged detention arising from the use of his confession.&quot;<br />

		<title>Katanga&#039;s ICC appearance should not be underestimated</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Katerina I. Kappos [Trial Watch Coordinator, <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/home.html">TRIAL</a>]: &quot;On 18 October 2007, a second arrest warrant concerning the situation in DRC was publicly announced and unsealed by the ICC. A day earlier, Katanga was surrendered by the Congolese authorities and <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/congo-militia-leader-charged-with-war.php">transferred to the ICC</a>. The warrant of arrest lists six war crimes and three crimes against humanity in the territory of Ituri, in the DRC allegedly committed by Germain Katanga, alleged commander of the Force de r&eacute;sistance patriotique en Ituri (FRPI). Katanga is the second suspect to be transferred to the ICC. The next important step in his case will likely be a hearing on 28 February 2008, at which prosecutors present a summary of their evidence and judges rule whether it is strong enough to merit sending Katanga to trial.<br /><br />While Katanga can be counted among the &#39;small fish&#39;, the significance of his appearance before the ICC should not be underestimated. At the local level, the fact that Katanga belongs to a different militia group than Lubanga (the first suspect to be put on trial before the ICC), shows that the proceedings of the ICC do not only target one militia group. Katanga&#39;s surrender contributes not only to discouraging the warlords in the eastern parts of DRC but also preventing the commission of further grave crimes against the civilian population. At the international level, the decision to prosecute Katanga for nine crimes, including sexual slavery, which is defined for the first time under the ICC Statute as a war crime and a crime against humanity, is a significant step in the fight against impunity for the worst crimes committed and continuing in Ituri and other regions of the world.<br /><br />Five years after its establishment, the system of international criminal justice represented by the ICC is still in its infancy. As opposed to a national justice system with which the citizen is confronted on a daily basis in the case of violation of a regulation or a law, the ICC remains a somewhat remote or abstract entity. The reason for this might be found in the extraordinary character of its jurisdictional competencies. On the one hand, it charged with prosecuting the &#39;crimes of the crimes&#39;, such as genocide or crimes against humanity. On the other hand, it was not set up to replace national justice systems. Rather, it is supposed to &#39;fill the gaps&#39; and prosecute those persons whom States are either unwilling or unable to prosecute. <br /><br />However, given that the ICC does not have its own police force, its collection of information and evidence is strongly dependant on the cooperation wit the State in which the crimes were committed. The &#39;big fish&#39; &#8212; the political masterminds behind the atrocities- are often still in positions of power and locally untouchable. Thus, in order to avoid multiple arrest warrants being issued but never executed, the solution to focus on the &#39;smaller fish&#39; like Lubanga and now Katanga is to be welcomed. Not least because by focusing on &#39;bigger fish&#39;, the ICC would risk becoming a &#39;court without cases&#39;. It would be launching multiple investigations and issuing arrest warrants without however being able to prosecute for lack of State cooperation in arresting the suspects. The effect of such a policy on the image of the ICC could be catastrophic.&quot;<br />

		<title>Gender identity amendment necessary for effective anti-discrimination law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.glad.org/"><strong>Jennifer Levi</strong></a> [Senior Staff Attorney, <a href="http://www.glad.org/">Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders</a> (GLAD)]: &quot;When Representative Sanchez voted against advancing out of committee the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) she made the understatement, &quot;We could have done better.&quot; <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/house-bill-to-protect-gay-workers.php">If passed</a>, the bill advanced by the committee would create law that prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of sexual orientation.  However, it is notably a bill without the support of any of the visible and vocal national, state or local lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations.  The community unified behind a comprehensive bill that would have prohibited not just sexual orientation discrimination but gender identity discrimination as well.  The gender identity provision would ensure that transgender people would be protected as well as lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals who face discrimination not based on their relationships but based on stereotypes about how gay people look and act.  <br /><br />While Congressional leadership abandoned the gender identity provision shortly after a hearing on the bill, the LGBT community was not satisfied with that decision.  Within days of HR3685 being introduced, hundreds of organizations representing thousands of members mobilized in opposition to leadership&#39;s decision.  The outpouring of community support for the inclusive approach reflected a grassroots mobilization, the likes of which have rarely been seen in recent times.  Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders (GLAD), a New England-wide legal organization that focuses in impact litigation to establish rights, played a central part in that mobilization effort.  <br /><br />GLAD believes that the reason the community so swiftly and decisively responded to the stripping of the gender identity provision from the original bill (HR 2015) was a wide-scale appreciation for the fact that the terms sexual orientation and gender identity are overlapping concepts that cannot be neatly divided.  Moreover, any effort to do so would result in an unprincipled and legally unsound division of the community.  Obviously, the Committee on Labor and Education disagreed and advanced the bill over the dissent of four Democrats who opposed it because of the omission of gender identity.<br /><br />In a somewhat late-breaking development but just shortly before the committee vote, Representative Tammy Baldwin announced that with the support of leadership she would advance on the floor a gender identity amendment that seeks to repair the damage done by the Committee.  That vote is scheduled for next week.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.farzanahassan.com/"><strong>Farzana Hassan</strong></a> [President, <a href="http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/">Muslim Canadian Congress</a>]: &quot;The Muslim Canadian Congress (MCC) has welcomed the Conservative Government&#39;s decision to <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/canada-government-introduces-bill.php">introduce Bill C-6 to ban veiled voting</a>. The organization considers this an essential and appropriate move to protect the integrity of Canada &#39;s electoral process. All voters, including veiled Muslim women will now be required to identify themselves visually. <br /><br />The bill was introduced on October 26, 2007, by Peter Van Loan, the Conservative House Leader in compliance with the provisions of the Throne Speech of October 16, 2007. The move is also a response to the controversy generated by Elections Canada&#39;s decision to allow veiled women to vote without removing their face veils in a September, 2007 Quebec by-election. <br /><br />The proposed legislation, while remaining mindful of religious accommodation, is nonetheless a step in the right direction towards ensuring the separation of religion and state. Burkas and veils are not religiously mandated attire and serve to undermine public identification. Such attire is promoted by Islamists as a tool to undermine the democratic process by negating the identity of half the population. It must therefore, not be endorsed.<br /><br />Bill C-6 is also an affirmation of the MCC&#39;s stated principle of achieving the separation of religion and state in all public places.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.harryroque.com/"><strong>H. Harry Roque Jr.</strong></a> [Professor, University of the Philippines College of Law; Director, Institute of International Legal Studies at the U.P. Law Center]: &quot;Due to the inherent problems in defining terrorism, crimes ordinarily punished by the penal laws are now sought to be <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/philippines-police-reluctant-to-enforce.php">punished under the PHSA</a> with a corresponding increased penalty with no clear test or measure when the penal laws or the PHSA applies. Also, the powers granted to the courts to classify terrorist groups under the PHSA in the absence of a clear definition of terrorism also violates due process. <br /><br />As such it is also posited that elevation of ordinary crimes into acts of terrorism punishable by much higher penalties would also raise concerns of equal protection due to the fact that such a distinction exponentially raises the penalty while making conviction easier due to the malum prohibitum nature of crimes punished under the PHSA. Simply stated, it is violative of equal protection in that the bill makes an unclear distinction then punishes those falling under this definition much more severely. As such the PHSA would raise serious concerns of equal protection especially in light of the difficulty in properly defining terrorism. <br /><br />Also due to the difficulty in defining terrorism it is similarly odious to free association. This could penalize many legitimate organizations including genuine independence movements that are exercising their legitimate and ergo omnes right to self-determination. Similarly odious to the right of free association is Section 17 of the PHSA on the power to proscribe a terrorist organization, since one of the grounds for proscribing a terrorist organization is that any member or members thereof have committed and act or acts of terrorism as defined in the PHSA. <br /><br />Further, the outstretched access provided by the PHSA may have a chilling effect on the freedom of speech. The application for the interception of communications encompasses all kinds of communications with the only proviso that such communication is because, or in furtherance of, the ill-defined crime of terrorism. It only penalizes the unauthorized interception of communications, which is interception of communications without judicial authorization. This creates situation for mischief usually exploited by law enforcement officers, where the law enforcement officer, who is not exactly the paragon of virtue in protecting human rights, would risk violating the law given that risk to the law enforcement officer is smaller than the advantages, i.e., catching the &quot;terrorists&quot;. Also, as it is limited to penalizing law enforcement personnel, companies handling communications services such as postal, messengerial and telecommunications companies escape liability under PHSA when they intercept communications out of cooperation or coercion of law enforcement personnel.<br /><br />Under international human rights standards, the accused should normally be released pending trial as stated in Article 9(3) International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Besides favoring pretrial release, international human right norms specifically bar long periods of pretrial detention as provided by Section 19 of the PHSA. The PHSA also creates an Anti-Terrorism Council, vesting it with vast powers without institutional safeguards on human rights. In a country where torture is practiced and where it has not been defined, contrary to the Convention on Torture, as a domestic crime, even 3 days detention without judicial intervention appears to be far too long. Besides, intervention of a Judge would be indispensable as deterrence to torture.<br /><br />In sum, as in the <a href="http://www.icj.org/IMG/UN-SR-CT-Philippines.pdf">words</a> of Mr. Martin Scheinin, Special Rapporteur by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights:<br /><br /><BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The Philippines is a country facing many challenging issues and I wish to reaffirm that I am fully conscious of the need to take effective measures to prevent and counter terrorism, and of the difficulties of States in doing so without compromising the freedoms of a civil society. However, I am concerned that many provisions of the Human Security Act are not in accordance with international human rights standards.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><br />

		<title>Sanctions against Burmese junta would support human rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maureen Aung-Thwin [Director, <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/bpsai/">Burma Project/Southeast Asia Initiative, Open Society Institute</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/myanmar-monks-resume-protests-ahead-of.php">Burmese military junta crossed a line</a> when they killed the monks.  When thousands of maroon-robed monks led peaceful protests across Burma against the 500% overnight increase in fuel prices, there was hope that the military would respond with restraint.  Instead, the whole world watched in horror at the violent images of fully armed soldiers beating up and humiliating the most revered figures in Buddhist Burma.  The question is: how will it end?  <br /><br />The psychological fall-out from the abuse of the monks is immeasurable.  Yet, in hindsight, we may look back to this terrible episode as the catalyst for a power shift, leading perhaps to genuine political transformation.  The official government line blames the protests on bogus monks alleged to be agents of the CIA. But now it appears even the generals&#39; sense that this time, they have gone too far.  Some military officials have been quick to offer alms to monks who dare not refuse the gifts, as earlier they had, turning over their begging bowls as a sign of rejecting supplicants who belonged to the armed forces. (However, the spirit of protest has not been totally quashed; some monks grudgingly accept the alms, before dumping them on the floor of the monastery).<br /><br />Likewise, recent events have led to a shift in international policy towards Burma, at least temporarily. The global community was outraged by the real-time video clips of the brutal crackdown sent through the internet by foreign and citizen journalists.  The United Nations Security Council, where earlier this year China and Russia vetoed a draft resolution on Burma, issued a rare, unanimously adopted presidential statement condemning the actions of the junta. At the Geneva-based Human Rights Council, every member, even the junta&#39;s usual allies such as Cuba, chastised the regime. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) foreign ministers, normally loath to interfere in internal affairs of its member nations, used unusually strong words in issuing the following statement:<br /> <br />&quot;[The ministers] were appalled to receive reports of automatic weapons being used and demanded that the Myanmar government immediately desist from the use of violence against demonstrators. They expressed their revulsion to Myanmar Foreign Minister Nyan Win over reports that the demonstrations in Myanmar are being suppressed by violent force and that there has been a number of fatalities. They strongly urged Myanmar to exercise utmost restraint and seek a political solution.&quot;<br /> <br />But do the Burmese generals give a hoot what the world says about them?  Possibly. The regime was swift to name a savvy, senior colleague to start meeting with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the long detained leader of the opposition National League for Democracy. Further, it agreed to a return visit by the UN Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari, as well as one by Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, the Human Rights Council&#39;s Special Rapporteur on Myanmar who has been refused a Burmese visa for the last four years. Notably, Pinheiro insists that if denied access to anyone he wishes to see inside Burma, he will immediately head for the airport.<br /><br />Expressions of outrage are important, but ultimately actions that are aimed at disrupting the regime and its cronies&#39; stranglehold on the country&#39;s economy will force them to the negotiating table. Through banking and financial sanctions, The United States and Australian governments are successfully targeting individual military officers and business cronies who for decades have milked the resource-rich country for personal gain. If more nations join in smart, targeted sanctions, the sooner the long suffering citizens of Burma can claim back their country.&quot;<br />

		<title>Extraordinary Rendition and the State Secrets Privilege: A Self-inflicted Wound?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://academics.utep.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=21347">William Weaver</a> of the University of Texas El Paso Political Science Department says that the lawsuit by five victims of extraordinary rendition against Boeing subsidiary Jeppesen Dataplan has given the federal judiciary another opportunity to consider its own endorsement of the state secrets privilege, under which the US government can prevent judicial scrutiny of patently illegal government policies and programs...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/williamweaver.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>&quot;E</strong></font>xtraordinary rendition&quot; is an oxymoron. It is a blended term that implies there is a legal basis for kidnapping people and delivering them to third party country thumbscrew and shocks-to-the-gonads artists. Plain old rendition, of course, is the delivery of people to justice in foreign jurisdictions under the terms of treaties and in accordance with other legal constraints. The &quot;extraordinary&quot; part of &quot;extraordinary rendition,&quot; on the other hand, is simply a codeword for extrajudicial kidnappings that can only be taken in the pitch black world where law cannot go. These &quot;snatches&quot; have mounted into the hundreds over the last six years, but there has never been any judicial or statutory authorization for this activity. <br /><br />The only United States Supreme Court pronouncement on the question of forcible removal of persons to foreign jurisdictions outside of treaty and on presidential authority alone came in <em>Valentine v. United States</em>. In a unanimous opinion, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes found that, &quot;[T]he power to provide for extradition . . . is not confided to the Executive in the absence of treaty or legislative provision.&quot; In <em>Valentine</em>, two United States citizens were accused of crimes in France and were arrested awaiting extradition by U.S. authorities. The crimes allegedly committed were extraditable offenses under a bi-lateral treaty between the United States and France, but the arrestees filed a habeas corpus action, &quot;upon the ground that because the treaty excepted citizens of the United States, the President had no constitutional authority to surrender the respondents to the French Republic.&quot; The Court made no indication that non-U.S. citizens not subject to extradition by treaty would be accorded any less protection, and indeed stated that, &quot;It necessarily follows that as the legal authority does not exist save as it is given by act of Congress or by the terms of a treaty, it is not enough that statute or treaty does not deny the power to surrender. It must be found that statute or treaty confers the power.&quot; Congress has never authorized extraordinary rendition, and the weight of international law clearly forges against the practice <br /><br />For most of our legal history, the presidential claim to unilateral power to undertake renditions outside of law was unthinkable. Abraham Lincoln ordered the first &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; and it almost cost him the 1864 election. Even in that case, a corrupt Spanish official and slave trader was given to the Spanish courts in Cuba and not delivered for torture. It would be over 125 years before another president claimed such power. And the last word on the subject before the events of September 11th sparked broad use of this activity came in a 1979 Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel opinion that the Shah of Iran could not be extradited to his home country, because &quot;The President cannot order any person extradited unless a treaty or statute authorizes him to do so.&quot; <br /><br />But the questionable legality of the extraordinary rendition program is protected from court scrutiny and public disclosure by the most powerful and vexing evidentiary privilege the executive branch possesses. The state secrets privilege is the legal equivalent of the Ring of Gyges; it simply makes potentially embarrassing cases and evidence of government criminality disappear. But as Plato noted with respect to Gyges, invisibility invites, nay entails, corruption and abuse of power. One case that is disappearing before our eyes is <em>Mohamed et al. v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.</em>, and as it fades from view so to does any evidence of the government&#39;s cooperation with private corporations to accomplish extraordinary renditions. In <em>Jeppesen</em>, five victims of extraordinary rendition filed suit against a Boeing subsidiary involved in operational planning of their transport to foreign venues. The government intervened and formally asserted the state secrets privilege to prevent discovery against Jeppesen and moved for dismissal. The great irony of the privilege, and one that is lost on the government, is that it is frequently employed to prevent the disclosure of information that is not and cannot be properly classified under statute or executive order. <em>Jeppesen</em> is an example of this enlarged use of the privilege.<br /><br />If the recent past is any indication, the privilege will presumably be used in <em>Jeppesen</em> to not only prevent discovery but also to stop the plaintiffs from entering into evidence facts that arise from their own experiences and information readily found in the public domain. Indeed, in other cases the privilege has been used to vitiate plaintiffs&#39; First Amendment right to testify and to prevent the introduction into evidence of material that has already been published and is admittedly not classifiable. The unvarnished truth is that the privilege is used by the Bush administration not so much to protect secrets as to prevent judicial scrutiny of patently illegal government policies and programs. The plaintiffs in <em>Jeppesen</em> have entered a world probably as psychologically disorienting as their secret kidnappings and captivity. For example, Milquetoast courts have in various cases agreed with executive branch assertion of the privilege that it would cause grave damage to the national security to: <br /><br />- Reveal the existence of a car battery on a military base (<em>Kasza v. Browner</em>) <br /><br />- Allow a deponent to provide her place and date of birth (<em>Burnett v. Al Baraka</em>)<br /><br />- Allow into evidence documentary material that had already been widely published (<em>Maxwell v. First National Bank</em>)<br /><br />- Reveal information in case files collected against a 12-year old boy (<em>Patterson v. FBI</em>)<br /><br />But if the executive branch presses secrecy beyond propriety it is the courts who allow agency claims to succeed. Judges who in other contexts speak of accountability and oversight of administrative programs and action fall to their knees at the mention of &quot;national security.&quot; The most recent example of judicial prostration syndrome came last week in <em>Higazy v. Templeton</em>, where a court agreed to take down a posted opinion at the behest of a U.S. Attorney for reasons of &quot;national security&quot; in order to redact a passage that recounted facts that had already been made public. The state secrets privilege is a self-inflicted wound; it is a judicial creation and it must be the judiciary that stanches its poisonous effects for our democratic traditions. The result in <em>Jeppesen</em> and other cases where the privilege is being considered will give us an indication of whether or not judges have decided to give up on law concerning anything claimed to be undertaken in the name of national security. <br /><br /><br /><em>William Weaver is a political science professor at the University of Texas El Paso and the Interim Director of its Center for Law and Border Studies. He teaches mainly in the areas of judicial process, constitutional law, private law and public policy, and abuse of official power. He is the co-aut
hor (with Robert Pallitto) of </em><a href="http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title_pages/9324.html">Presidential Secrecy and the Law</a><em> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007).</em><br />

		<title>Canada&#039;s New Terrorism Bills: Slow Down and Debate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.utoronto.ca/faculty_content.asp?profile=47&cType=facMembers&itemPath=1/3/4/0/0">Kent Roach</a> of the University Toronto Faculty of Law says that Canada&#39;s parliament needs to slow down and conduct an intelligent debate on the merits of two new anti-terrorism bills introduced in quick succession last week by Canada&#39;s minority Conservative government...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kentroach.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>C</strong></font>anadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day tabled new legislation in the House of Commons last Monday to allow British-style special advocates to play a role in security certificate cases that are used to detain and deport non-citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism. The bill responds to the Supreme Court of Canada&#39;s <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2007/2007scc9/2007scc9.html">decision</a> earlier this year that the existing legislation was unconstitutional.<br /><br />On Tuesday the government tabled another bill in the Senate to revive investigative hearings and preventive arrests. These Criminal Code powers were introduced after 9/11 but expired in March, 2007 after the government failed to convince Parliament to renew them for three years. The government now proposes to include the powers in the Criminal Code, subject to a some changes and a 5 year renewable sunset. <br /><br />The official opposition - the Liberal Party - has indicated some preliminary support for both bills and they appear likely to pass. There is a need to slow down and carefully consider both bills, as well as important work already done by Parliamentary committees on anti-terrorism law. <br /><br />When it enacted the Anti-terrorism Act (ATA) in the aftermath of 9/11, Parliament knew it had acted quickly and without precedent. It required a comprehensive review of the act to be completed by December, 2004. Early this year, a Commons and a Senate committee finally completed their reviews and issued comprehensive reports. Unfortunately, their work was ignored by the media, the public and Parliament itself. Only some of the recommendations made by these committees have found their way into the new bills.<br /><br />The last time Parliament debated security issues was in February of this year when the opposition parties defeated the government's motion to extend preventive arrests and investigative hearings. Regardless of one's views about the merits of the motion, the debate in Parliament was dismal.<br /><br />The government accused the opposition of being unsympathetic to the victims of terrorism. The opposition accused the government of engaging in slurs. What got lost in all this partisan bickering was reasonable discussion of the merits of the two controversial provisions that expired. Parliament now has a second chance to debate these proposals on their merits. The task will not be easy and it should not be rushed. <br /><br />Anti-terrorism law is complex and difficult. Fortunately, the reports of both the <a href="http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteePublication.aspx?COM=10804&Lang=1&SourceId=199086">Commons</a> and <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/39/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/anti-e/rep-e/rep02feb07-e.htm">Senate</a> committees explain many of the difficult issues. But before informed public debate about security legislation can start, people need to read and pay attention to the reports and the two new bills before Parliament.<br /><br />The Senate committee warned that any new special advocate should be able to consult with the affected person after having seen the secret evidence. This, however, is neither prohibited or guaranteed in the bill before Parliament. The bill is also silent on whether special advocates will have adequate resources and be able to demand disclosure and call witnesses. These are crucial issues that require debate.<br /><br />Both committees dealt with how to respond to the problems created by secret evidence used in security certificates and some other security proceedings. Both committees recommended that special advocates be available whenever the government makes secret submissions in security proceedings. The government's bill, however, only applies to security certificates. There needs to be discussion of this issue.<br /><br />The Senate Committee also provided some wise advice about how the government should respond to the legal quagmire created by security certificates. The current bill, however, is focused on the immediate task of responding to the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Charkaoui</em> and must be enacted before the end of February 2008 before the Court's remedy takes effect. The long term viability of the security certificate process needs to be debated.<br /><br />The bill is based on the British special advocate model, but the British experience has not been altogether happy. Canada can learn from the British, but here the under-resourced Parliamentary committees unfortunately did not do their homework. There is also a need to consider other Canadian alternatives to British special advocates including those previously used by the Security Intelligence Review Commission and the Arar Commission. Security cleared counsel used in both these Canadian processes are more robust than the British special advocates because they can communicate with the affected parties after having seen the secret information and because they have the power to demand disclosure and call witnesses.<br /><br />There are other details in the new special advocate bill that require consideration. The six month review of detention under security certificates is proposed to occur only following the conclusion of each preceding review. Does this mean that the six month clock only starts ticking after a judge has crafted and delivered his or her reasons? <br /><br />A special advocate is allowed to make submissions about "the relevance, reliability and sufficiency" of the information presented by the Minister to justify the security certificate, but has no explicit powers to call witnesses or seek disclosure. The judge is now asked to receive into evidence only "reliable" information, but what about information that may be prejudicial but perhaps not relevant?<br /><br />The new bill concerning investigative hearings and preventive arrests also requires careful consideration. A requirement of reasonable attempts to obtain information has been added as a safeguard, but the new legislation has not codified the <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2004/2004scc42/2004scc42.html">Supreme Court's 2004 ruling</a> that immunity for compelled statements should be extended to extradition and immigration proceedings.<br /><br />There is also a troubling new incorporation of an obscure provision in s.707 of the Criminal Code that could allow up to 90 days detention in a case in which an arrest warrant has been issued because of concerns that a person subject to an investigative hearing is about to abscond.<br /><br />The requirement to bring a person subject to a preventive arrest before a judge has been changed from "as soon as possible" to "as soon is feasible". Is there a difference? The arrestee can be still detained on any "just cause" despite the fact that the Supreme Court has <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2002/2002scc64/2002scc64.html">struck down the same phrase</a> in Canadian bail laws as excessively vague.<br /><br />The judge is still able to adjourn a hearing for 48 hours, but no reference is made to where arrestees will be held and whether they can be questioned during that time.<br /><br />Both bills deserve careful and informed scrutiny in the committees. <br /><br />Parliamentarians should also consider whether other recommendations made by the committees that conducted a comprehensive review of the ATA should be considered. Parliament has a chan
ce to redeem itself from the partisan debate over investigative hearings earlier this year. But it must slow up and take the time and care that is necessary to consider these complex bills. <br /><br />Canada will soon find out whether a minority Parliament is up to the task of conducting an intelligent debate about the merits of new anti-terrorism legislation. If Parliament fails again or becomes deadlocked, the courts will by default have to play the dominant role in reforming security legislation. Moreover, Canadians will be ill-served by their elected representatives on one of the defining issues of our times. <br /><br /><br /><em>Kent Roach is a Professor of Law at the University of Toronto.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.ggy.uga.edu/people/faculty/aross/">Amy Ross</a> of the University of Georgia Department of Geography and <a href="http://www.uel.ac.uk/law/staff/chandrasriram.htm">Chandra Lekha Sriram</a>, Chair of Human Rights at the University of East London School of Law (UK), say that former US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld&#39;s quick exit from a Paris speaking event last week in the face of a torture lawsuit brought by human rights organizations in a French court shows that univeral jurisdiction laws are making an impact by limiting &quot;zones of impunity,&quot; even if the most powerful often remain beyond the reach of actual prosecution...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/amyross.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/forumy/chandrasriramnew2small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>D</strong></font>onald Rumsfeld should be more careful about where he travels. <br /><br />In Paris last week, Rumsfeld left a prestigious speaking event in haste, slipping out a side door to avoid the human rights lawyers and journalists waiting to confront him with criminal charges of torture. He reportedly avoided the confrontation by sneaking out a door that attached the conference venue to, of all places, the United States Embassy. <br /><br />The charges have been filed in a French court by international human rights organizations. The claim is that France is under a legal obligation to investigate and prosecute Rumsfeld&#39;s accountability for alleged crimes.<br /><br />The legal pursuits against Rumsfeld are the latest in a trend toward invoking universal jurisdiction. <br /><br />The essence of the principle is that some crimes are so serious as to be of &quot;international concern." Hence torture in Guantanamo and Iraq is the business of all humanity, existing everywhere, and should be heard in the French courts. Indeed, any court in the world could host such a trial. <br /><br />Rumsfeld's presence on French territory last week sparked the demand that a judge investigate the charges. France must refuse to provide safe haven for torturers, the lawyers insist.<br /><br />Universal jurisdiction received little attention until it ensnared Chile's General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte in October 1998. While he was in London receiving medical treatment, British officials, acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge, placed Mr. Pinochet under arrest, triggering a decade-long, multi-national drama. <br /><br />For populations subject to the threat of torture, &quot;disappearance&quot; and other human rights abuses, the struggle to hold the most powerful perpetrators accountable has spawned a creative cartography. Faced with impunity at home, human rights activists have sought out sympathetic jurisdictions abroad.<br /><br />Today, there are dozens of cases before courts involving the principle of universal jurisdiction. Many high-level state figures, traditionally protected at home, are facing increasing pressure in foreign courts. <br /><br />Henry Kissinger reportedly fled Paris in 2001 after being tipped off to an imminent summons by a French judge; he later cancelled a trip to Brazil after being warned by the government there that he might face an international arrest warrant. Suits in Madrid against Guatemala's Efrain Rios Montt, charging him with genocide of Mayan Guatemalans during his government's scorched earth policy in the 1980s, have restricted his travel options.<br /><br />Shortly after a suit was filed against Ariel Sharon in Brussels, the government of Israel put out a travel-advisory to its high-ranking officials, alerting them to foreign countries that might be keen to entertain universal jurisdiction. The list includes many of the western social-democracies. <br /><br />Efforts to prosecute Israeli Major-General (reserve) Doron Almog for war crimes in Gaza were derailed when the accused managed to dodge an indictment in the United Kingdom. In 2005 Almog got as far as the jetway at Heathrow; when tipped off to his imminent arrest he was allowed to remain on board and return with the plane to Israel.<br /><br />Even the president of the United States of America has to be careful where he travels. In November 2004, during a visit by Bush, the Chilean government announced that the US president would have immunity during his visit. The unusual declaration was made after lawyers filed a criminal complaint against Bush in court, claiming that he and other U.S. officials were guilty of war crimes in Iraq. On a subsequent trip by Bush to Canada, lawsuits were filed against him in Vancouver under Canada&#39;s Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act. <br /><br />George W. Bush currently enjoys official immunity from prosecution, as a serving government official. Come January 2009, he might very well forego visits to Germany, where suits have been filed on behalf of four Iraqi victims of torture. <br /><br />Cases filed against Rumsfeld in Germany and other countries were barred while he was Secretary of Defense. But Rumsfeld resigned. He no longer enjoys the shield of official immunity. <br /><br />Nonetheless, he still has access to exclusive zones of impunity. While it may appear that universal jurisdiction is forcing even the powerful to confront their crimes, Rumsfeld's escape-route illustrates that certain global figures remain beyond the aspirations of international human rights law. <br /><br />It is a paradox of power. The most powerful are in a position to prosecute others for abuses, even as they commit crimes themselves, and avoid prosecution.<br /><br /><br /><em>Amy Ross is a professor in the University of Georgia Department of Geography specializing in human rights, international justice, geographies of justice, genocide, and the spatiality of violence.

		<title>Domestic Surveillance and the Decline of Legal Oversight</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.indiana.edu/directory/fcate.asp">Fred Cate</a> of Indiana University School of Law Bloomington says that a series of dramatic moves over the past five years - most recently the passage of the Protect America Act - has weakened statutory and judicial oversight of domestic surveillance to the point that one wonders whether, by the time the Bush Administration and Congress are finished, there is going to be any legal oversight of domestic surveillance at all...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/fredcate.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he political wrangling in Congress and coverage in the press about revising the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) have tended to obscure the most critical issue at stake in the regulation of electronic surveillance: the declining role of law and legal oversight. <br /><br />The government conducts surveillance outside of the United States without statutory (or apparently constitutional) constraint, but within the nation's borders, surveillance is regulated by two statutes. FISA permits the Attorney General to authorize domestic electronic surveillance (and physical searches) of foreign powers, but requires recourse to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court where U.S. persons who are acting as the agents of foreign powers are involved and a "significant purpose" of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act applies to all other domestic surveillance. <br /><br />Or so we thought until December 16, 2005, when the <em>New York Times</em> revealed that the National Security Agency was intercepting communications within the United States and without complying with either FISA or ECPA. In the face of the ensuing controversy, the Bush Administration acknowledged the existence of the "Terrorist Surveillance Program," which it described as involving communications into and out of the United States where there is a "reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the communications is a member of al Qaeda, affiliated with al Qaeda, or a member of an organization affiliated with al Qaeda." Rather than seeking review by a court, as required by statute, the Administration was operating pursuant to an order by the Attorney General that was renewed "approximately every 45 days." <br /><br />In an effort to blunt the controversy over the TSP, the Administration agreed in January 2007 to subject it to the oversight of the FISC, the eleven-judge court responsible for authorizing surveillance under, and ensuring compliance with, FISA. But in May 2007, a FISC judge refused to renew a "basket warrant" (under which the Court would authorize surveillance on a programmatic, rather than a case-by-case basis). The Administration responded by withdrawing its commitment to comply with FISA and seek review by the FISC of surveillance conducted under the TSP, and demanding that Congress enact statutory authorization that would not require future recourse to the FISC. <br /><br />Congress responded in August with the Protect America Act of 2007, which permits the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General to authorize surveillance "directed at a person reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States," whether or not the person is an agent of a foreign power. The role of the FISC is reduced to reviewing the Attorney General's procedures for implementing the Act to determine whether they are "clearly erroneous." The Attorney General is also required to inform four congressional committees on a semi-annual basis of "acquisitions" made under the statute, including incidents of noncompliance.<br /><br />The Protect America Act sunsets in six months, which has set the stage for the current debate in Congress and press over its reauthorization and the future role of FISA. Much of that debate has focused on whether telecommunications carriers that aided the Administration in its warrantless surveillance should receive retroactive as well as prospective immunity. But there are bigger issues at stake, especially with regard to the protection of individual privacy from government intrusion.<br /><br />The most important by far is whether by the time the Bush Administration and Congress are finished with the law, there is going to be any legal oversight of domestic surveillance at all. In the USA PATRIOT Act, Congress already changed the requirement that to qualify for the lower standard of review under FISA, the collection of foreign intelligence must be only "a significant purpose," rather than the "primary purpose," of the surveillance. The Act also permitted greater sharing of information obtained from FISA warrants with criminal investigators, which was then further expanded by a decision by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. Even before the Protect America Act, commentators worried whether the FISA process was in danger of becoming an end run around the requirements of ECPA and the Constitution for protecting U.S. persons from surveillance by their government. <br /><br />But FISA itself increasingly appears in danger of being undermined, and even its minimal requirements avoided in the pursuit of unsupervised surveillance. The Administration initially ignored FISA in its operation of the TSP. Then, after initially pledging to comply with the law, the Administration backed away from that commitment, and then collaborated with Congress in enacting legislation that undermines its most basic principle&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the focus on foreign powers. <br /><br />Simultaneously, the government has been moving away from FISA orders, which require judicial authorization, to other tools, such as National Security Letters, which do not. In 2005, the government reported seeking and obtaining 2,072 FISA orders, but issuing 9,254 NSLs. Then in March 2007, the Justice Department Inspector General reported that the FBI had underreported and in fact had issued at least 47,221 NSLs in 2005&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;22 times the number of FISA orders the government sought. <br /><br />Recall that while domestic surveillance has been subject to statutory protection and judicial oversight, surveillance abroad has not. The NSA reports receiving more than 650 million foreign intelligence intercepts every day, all without any judicial or legislative oversight. The Protect America Act is focused solely on domestic surveillance; no additional legal authority is needed for foreign intelligence gathering conducted outside of the United States. Similarly, surveillance of foreign powers even within the United States is generally exempted from FISC authorization. <br /><br />The only thing left for the Protect America Act to exempt is domestic surveillance of U.S. persons, which is precisely what it does. It permits domestic surveillance without recourse to a court, so long as the target of the surveillance is "reasonably believed to be" abroad. It eliminates the fundamental requirement of prior U.S. surveillance law that eavesdropping on U.S. persons requires compliances with ECPA (and obtaining an appropriate warrant issued by a court) unless the targets were agents of a foreign power, in which case compliance with FISA was required.<br /><br />The Protect America Act is only the most recent in a series of dramatic moves over the past five years to weaken statutory and judicial oversight of domestic surveillance from the requirements of ECPA to those of FISA, and from FISA to the virtually unregulated regime of NSLs and foreign intelligence gathering outside of the United States. The challenge for Congress, and ultimately for the courts, is whether this trend will be allowed to continue and our privacy to be the next victim of the war on terror. <br /><br /><br /><em>Fred H.

Mukasey, nominated by President Bush to serve the United States as Attorney General, has been giving conclusory answers to questions about the legality of torturing persons held in detention by the military. He says that if the torture is unconstitutional, then he is opposed to it. But he has been unwilling to answer operative questions, such as whether particular methods of torture are illegal.<br /><br />One might ascribe Mr. Mukasey's unwillingness to address specific methods of torture to the normal reluctance of senior judges to decide cases before hearing all the facts. But the essays Mr. Mukasey has written belie this assumption of legal distancing. He showed himself to be quite the pragmatist when he argued that outlawing too many methods of torture would only lead to the killing of torture victims so as to permanently silence the evidence. This is indeed an ultra-realist view of law, on a par with arguing that if a homeowner unexpectedly comes home and spots a burglar in the midst of gathering loot, the burglar should get a free pass from the law. Otherwise it would be in the burglar's interest to shoot the homeowner and get rid of the only eyewitness to the crime.<br /><br />Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island cut through the fog with pointed questions:<br /><br />WHITEHOUSE: Is waterboarding constitutional?<br /><br />MUKASEY: If waterboarding is torture, torture is not constitutional.<br /><br />WHITEHOUSE: It either is or it isn't. Waterboarding is the practice of putting somebody in a reclining position, tying them down, putting cloth over their faces, and then pouring water over them to simulate drowning.<br /><br />MUKASEY: If it amounts to torture, it is not constitutional.<br /><br />The fear of drowning &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; of having one's air supply cut off by water &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; is the most atavistic and greatest fear known to homo sapiens. Psychologists are uniform in saying that no threat or pain we can possibly experience comes close to the shock of drowning. <br /><br />The Torture Convention, which is part of the supreme law of the United States, defines torture as "any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person." Only the most brilliant law professor in the United States, Professor John Yoo of the Berkeley Law School, could possibly read that language as excluding waterboarding. Of course, Yoo's interpretation would at best merit a "But see" footnote in someone's article were it nor for the fact that Yoo included it in his infamous Torture Memo which was readily accepted by the Department of Defense as the Attorney General's definitive word on the subject. <br /><br />Since it was former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales's signing on to the Yoo Torture Memo (we don't know if Gonzales read it) that, among other things, got him kicked out of his job, maybe Mr. Mukasey is just trying to distance his confirmation hearings as far as possible from anything having to do with torture. After all, the job of Torturer-in-Chief should not be allocated to the Department of Justice. It rightfully belongs to Homeland Security. <br /><br /><br /><em>Anthony D.Amato is Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University, where he teaches international law and human rights.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/damato.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='120' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.niu.edu/go.cfm?do=Directory.View&did=105&ID=374">Marc Falkoff</a> of Northern Illinois University College of Law says the recent resignation of Guantanamo chief military prosecutor Col. Morris Davis and his remarkable public conversion from champion of the military commissions to one of their most devastating critics may finally signal to the American public that politics rather than principle reigns at the prison...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/marcfalkoff.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></b></font>ast month, Colonel Morris Davis stepped down as chief prosecutor for the military commissions at Guantanamo, citing political interference with the independence of his office. The resignation was a remarkable development in Guantanamo's embattled history, illuminating the degree to which politics rather than principle governs our notorious offshore prison.</p>

<p>Just sixteen months ago, the Supreme Court declared in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> that the military commissions, as initially created by President Bush, violated Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions because they were not "regularly constituted courts." In response, the Administration chose not to try terrorism suspects either before a court martial or in the civilian justice system, where Omar Abdel Rahman and other accused terrorists have been successfully prosecuted. Instead, the Administration pushed the Military Commissions Act through a Republican-led Congress, breathing new life into a jerry-built military commissions system.</p>

<p>The results have been predictable. Although Guantanamo has been operating as a detention center for nearly six years, to date not a single trial has taken place for any of the 750-odd men who have been imprisoned there. Only three prisoners have been charged with crimes &#8212; and one of them, Australian David Hicks, pleaded guilty almost immediately in exchange for the promise of only eight-months' further imprisonment, to be served in his home country.  The remaining trials ground to a halt soon after, while military judges dithered over whether the commissions' jurisdiction extended to all "enemy combatants" or only to "unlawful enemy combatants."  Although that issue has since been resolved, it presaged the host of legal squabbles that will inevitably arise as the military works out the kinks of its brand new justice system.</p>

<p>We already know, therefore, that the military commissions are a bad idea for those of us who want to see speedy justice at Guantanamo.  But with the resignation of Colonel Davis as chief prosecutor, we are now learning that the military commissions &#8212; whatever their inherent flaws and virtues &#8212; have themselves been corrupted by politics.  If Davis's allegations are to be credited, then the commissions system is being manipulated by political actors in an improper, unethical and potentially illegal manner &#8212; a politicization of the Guantanamo justice system that echoes the U.S. Attorneys scandal.</p>

<p>According to Davis, for more than a year Pentagon officials have sought to influence his decisions about "who we will charge, what we will charge, what evidence we will try to introduce, and how we will conduct a prosecution."   For example, speaking last week to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, he explained that in September 2006, Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England discussed with him the "strategic political value" in charging some of the prisoners before the midterm elections.  Similarly, in January 2007, Pentagon General Counsel William J. Haynes II (himself on the verge of being withdrawn as a nominee for the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals because of his involvement with the infamous "torture memos") telephoned Davis to prod him to charge David Hicks, apparently as a political accommodation to the Australian Prime Minister.  Even after Haynes was advised that this interference was improper, he again called Davis, suggesting that he charge other prisoners at the same time to avoid the impression that the charges were "a political solution to the Hicks case."  <br /><br />More recently, Davis filed a formal complaint alleging that Brigadier General Thomas Hartmann, the Legal Advisor to the authority overseeing the military commissions process, had pushed him to file cases that would attract more public attention and garner support for the tribunal system, even though such cases would require secretive, closed proceedings.  (By Pentagon regulation, the Legal Advisor is supposed to be an impartial administrator of justice, not an arm of the prosecution.)  <br /><br />In September of this year, Davis threatened to resign if anyone tried to intimidate him.  He has now done so, stating bluntly that, "as things stand right now, I think it's a disgrace to call it a military commission &#8212; it's a political commission."<br /><br />What makes this all the more alarming is that Colonel Davis is the last person you would expect to stand up as a whistleblower.  To be sure, other officers have gone public about abuses in the Guantanamo system.  Lieutenant Colonel V. Stuart Crouch, for instance, explained publicly that he had resigned as a prosecutor in May 2004 because Mohamedou Ould Slahi, the man he was supposed to put on trial, had indisputably been tortured.  More recently, Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Abraham drafted a declaration, filed with the Supreme Court, in which he detailed the ways in which the "Combatant Status Review Tribunals" on which he sat were rigged against the prisoners.  And just this week, National Public Radio reported that Lieutenant Colonel Colby Vokey, the Marine Corps' chief of all defense lawyers for the western U.S., was resigning because military staff had harassed him and interfered with his defense work for a juvenile prisoner at the camp.  Vokey called the legal system at Guantanamo "disgraceful" and a "sham," warning that "anytime you want to subvert the rule of law to the power of a government, you've got a very bad thing brewing."  But none of these men had, like Colonel Davis, previously spoken out in support of all things Guantanamo.  <br /> <br />For years, Davis has been the Administration's de facto spokesperson in defense of the military commissions.  He has penned encomiums to Guantanamo in publications from the <em>New York Times</em> to the <em>Yale Law Journal</em>, where he decried "those who want to sell a false and ugly picture of the facilities and the process."  Last year, Davis was particularly vociferous in attacking Major Michael Mori, David Hicks's defense counsel, for speaking in public about the failures of the Guantanamo legal system, even suggesting that Mori could be charged under Article 88 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for speaking contemptuously about top U.S. officials.<br /><br />And now we have the spectacle of Davis resigning and speaking out about the in-timidation and political interference he encountered as Guantanamo's chief prosecutor.  Although the Administration has, predictably, launched attacks on his character, Davis's resignation seems the only honorable course this defender of the military commissions could take, since the interference he experienced appears to be a patent violation of Rule 104 of the Manual for Military Commissions and &#167; 949b of the Military Commissions Act, both of which make it unlawful to "attempt to coerce or, by any unauthorized means, influence the exercise of professional judgment by trial counsel or defense counsel."  And these violations are not, of course, trivial matters.  Justice Kennedy, in his concurrence in <em>Hamdan</em>, specifically disapproved of the first military commissions exactly be-cause they lacked "the safeguards that are important to the fairness of the proceedings and the independence of the court."<br /><br />In the end, though, the real importance of the chief prosecutor's resignation does not lie in his revelation that the military commissions have been compromised.  After all, the very highest estimates from the Pentagon are that only eighty of the 350 men left at Guantanamo will be charged with a crime triable before a military commission.  The remaining prisoners are threatened with a legal limbo, subject to indefinite detention without charge or trial or any court oversight for the duration of the war on terror.  For these men, the proper functioning of the military commissions is utterly beside the point.<br /><br />For the majority of the prisoners at Guantanamo, the value of Davis's resignation is that it may finally signal to the American public that politics rather than principle reigns at Guantanamo, and that decisions about the administration of justice at the camp are being made &#8212; largely outside of public view and without accountability &#8212; by political actors for nakedly political reasons.  How else, for example, are we to explain the fact that every European who was dragged to Guantanamo has been returned to his home country, but that nearly ninety percent of the Yemenis who have been detained at the naval base remain there today &#8212; even though a number of them have actually been cleared for release by the military?<br /><br />For more than three years, my colleagues and I have visited with our clients at Guantanamo dozens of times, frequently bringing them "good news" about court victories we have won.  To a man, upon hearing our news, our clients have smiled politely and shrugged, pointing out to us that they still have not had their day in court and that they still are not treated in accord with the Geneva Conventions.  "You have to understand," they tell us, "this is all a big game."  More and more, I am starting to think they are right.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Marc Falkoff teaches criminal law and criminal procedure at Northern Illinois University College of Law.

One should not be led astray by the &#39;Proclamation of Emergency&#39; issued by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS). Although the official TV channel of the government is busy selling the idea of an &#39;emergency&#39; to its viewers, the reality remains that Pakistan is facing its sixth Martial Law since independence.<br /><br />Under the 1973 Constitution, the only way for the Federal Government to issue a proclamation of emergency is under Article 232 in case the country faces a threat of war or external aggression, or internal disturbances beyond the control of a Provincial Government. The proclamation is to be made by the President and must be placed before the Parliament for the latter&#39;s approval. While a proclamation is in force, the Federal Government may make orders to the Provincial Governments and may suspend the operation of constitutional provisions with regards to provincial bodies and matters. Such orders must be approved by the Parliament. The Parliament may also legislate on provincial matters while the emergency is in force and may extend its life for up to a year. The Federal Government may suspend the enforcement of fundamental rights. However, the government may not hold the constitution in abeyance and may not suspend provisions related to the senior judiciary. <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ARE YOU IN PAKISTAN?</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;What do you think of Musharraf&#39;s emergency rule declaration?

It has not been issued by the President but by the COAS. It contains no reasons that show neither an objectively verifiable threat of war or external aggression nor an internal disturbance that was actually outside the control of a Provincial Government. It only alleges that judicial activism is hampering the war against terror and is demoralizing the executive. The proclamation holds the Constitution of Pakistan in abeyance which is not permitted under the Constitution. Pursuant to this proclamation, the political leadership is being arrested alongside of prominent lawyers. Reports indicate that the Chief Justice of Pakistan, who was illegal removed not so long ago, has been put under house arrest and that other senior judges are being forced to retake oaths under a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO). The proclamation is hence illegal, unconstitutional and amounts to an act of treason under Article 6 of the Constitution. <br /><br />The PCO is of great importance as it manifests the intentions of the military dictator. The document provides that no court will take cognizance of any order made by the government pursuant to the proclamation of emergency. It further gives power to the federal government to require that all Superior Court judges retake their oaths and provides discretion to the former to choose which existing judges to call for such an oath. Such a measure has met tremendous resistance from existing judges. As of now, reports in leading newspapers indicate that only three Supreme Court judges out of seventeen and around twenty judges out of almost a hundred from the four provincial High Courts have taken oath under the PCO. Moreover, acting on the application of the Pakistan Bar Council President, a eight member bench of the Supreme Court set aside the PCO and the Proclamation of Emergency just hours before law enforcement agencies surrounded the SC building. The bench ordered all civil and military officers and personal to disregard any illegal and unconstitutional order of the government. <br /><br />The latest move by the general is an illegal, ultra-constitutional and desperate attempt to hold on to power by unconstitutionally clipping the power of the judiciary that was trying to uphold that constitution and safeguard the fundamental rights of the citizens. By clipping the power, the general has done away with the hundreds of cases challenging the actions of the executive including the case regarding his candidacy for the Presidency and the notorious National Reconciliation Ordinance. <br /><br />It remains to be seen what level of protest the political, legal, and civil communities can gather in the coming days and weeks. Clearly the public can draw inspiration from the Honorable Judges of the Superior Courts who refused to retake their oath and upheld the sanctity of the Constitution. <br /><br /><br /><em>Syed Umair Javed is a third-year law student in the Department of Law &amp; Policy, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that Judge Michael Mukasey&#39;s written response to Senate Judiciary Committee follow-up inquiries concerning his views on the legality of waterboarding and torture demonstrate views of America&#39;s obligations under international law so limited and problematic that he should not be confirmed...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavis.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>J</strong></font>udge Mukasey has responded to the Senate Judiciary Committee's written inquiry with regard to waterboarding and torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. His four-page letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee supplemented by 172 pages of related responses prompts several thoughts.<br /><br />First, Judge Mukasey notes that &quot;some Members of Congress, including those on the intelligence committees&quot;, have been briefed on the specifics of &quot;a program run by the Central Intelligence Agency&quot;. In the context of the confirmation process, it is essential that we now ask who were those members of Congress, whether they were briefed on waterboarding and other techniques as part of that briefing, and what were the members&#39; views on those techniques. It is far too convenient to hold Judge Mukasey's feet to the fire on waterboarding without also holding accountable the members of Congress who have been briefed on this subject. This information is important in the context of Judge Mukasey's confirmation because his phrase can be easily read as a veiled warning to those Congresspersons that they will be "outed" for what they allowed to go forward. That veiled warning has the effect of chilling further inquiry by other members of Congress for fear of alienating colleagues. We need to cut through this gamesmanship and get the truth out. Americans can handle the truth.<br /><br />Second, Judge Mukasey, in addressing the legality of &quot;coercive interrogation techniques,&quot; including waterboarding, provides an instance of the kind of legal analysis he would make as Attorney General as a way of assisting the committee in understanding his work method if he were to be confirmed. He essentially limits his analysis to federal statutes that are enabling legislation of the Convention Against Torture and Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment ("Convention Against Torture") and the Constitutional standard of "shocks the conscience" that is said to apply pursuant to a United States reservation to that treaty. He makes passing reference to the Geneva Conventions and to the Convention Against Torture itself. <br /><br />That is not enough. Let me be specific:<ul><li>Judge Mukasey&#39;s analysis does not take into account the prohibition against torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). His analysis does not take into account the non-derogability of those prohibitions even in times of public emergency as expressed in Article 4 of the ICCPR. <br /><br /><li>His analysis does not take into account the question of whether the US reservation to the Convention Against Torture is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the treaty and, as a matter of international law, of no effect. His analysis also does not express clearly whether he subscribes to the position that said reservation is only substantive (as was stated by Abram Sofaer, the negotiator of that treaty for the United States, in his January 2005 testimony to the committee) or whether he subscribes to the view that it is both substantive and geographic in limitation (i.e. only within the United States) as was stated by former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. This point is important since detainees are essentially held abroad. <br /><br /><li>His analysis does not take into account the fact that foreigners held by the United States are subject to the protection of the state of their nationality. Said state, as Australia did for David Hicks, will insist that their citizens be treated in accordance with the requirements of international law applicable. He does not seem aware that internal statutes of the United States are of no moment to such foreign states. What is important to those states is whether the United States is in compliance with the language of the relevant international law obligation (such as the Convention Against Torture) &#8212; not United States domestic law. He does not see that the internal law (which he might have used in his court) cannot be used in this non-court context on the international plane to extract the United States from its international obligations. <br /><br /><li>His analysis refers to Geneva Common Article 3 War Crimes but does not address the question of liability for Non-Common Article 3 War Crimes. In <em>Hamdan</em> the Supreme Court only said that Common Article 3 applied without reaching the broader question of whether other articles of the Geneva Conventions apply in the current armed conflicts. A careful analysis would therefore have looked at the non-Common Article 3 articles in the Geneva Convention III on Prisoners of War as well as the non-Common Article 3 articles in the Geneva Convention IV on Civilians including protected persons and security detainees. His analysis does none of that and therefore is unacceptably cursory. He presents a cramped vision of Geneva Conventions applicability that seems even narrower than that which Jack Goldsmith took but closer to that of David Addington, which I find extremely problematic. His vision limits the analysis to the detriment of evaluating waterboarding as a per se war crime under these other provisions of the Geneva Conventions. <br /><br /><li>He appears to be applying domestic U.S. standards for treaty interpretation and not international standards such as the Vienna Convention Law of Treaties which has been seen as authoritative by the United States in the past. With regard to the Convention Against Torture, it is of great concern that in his analysis he makes no mention of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties with regard to interpretation of our obligations. Rather than only referencing a couple of internal cases to describe the court's "shocks the conscience" standard, I hoped that Judge Mukasey would have taken into greater account the evaluation to be done is in the context of compliance with treaty obligations of the United States &#8212; not just compliance with a Constitutional standard. In a setting where he will be under enormous pressure to use internal law interpretations of the treaty that are the President's and by definition self-serving, his inability to even bring forward the idea of the more traditional international standard is deeply troubling. Thus, the evaluation of the "shocks the conscience" standard would need to take into account concerns such as compliance with the object and purpose of the treaty, the traditional methods in international law of interpretation of treaties, and issues of whether the "shocks the conscience" reservation is an improper derogation from peremptory norms. None of that appears in the four-page letter, nor is it intimated that he would consider such matters. This type of analysis is well-known by those steeped in international law but possibly less familiar to persons who work essentially in U.S. foreign relations law We are all aware of the separation of powers, but neither the President, the Congress, nor the Supreme Court are above the United States. The treaty obligations (as well as customary international law obligations) fall squarely on the United States and his analysis in domestic law of "shocks the conscience" should be tempered by this international background. This type of analysis is all the more important in a context
 where the techniques are being applied to foreigners who are subject to the protection of the state of their nationality. On the state to state level, the internal law modifications of the United States to treaty and customary international law obligations are of no moment. <br /><br /><li>In addition to not making any reference to the ICCPR in his analysis, he makes no reference to customary international humanitarian law, human rights law, law of diplomatic protection, or international criminal law. These additional areas of international law and the jurisprudence of international tribunals from the Nuremberg trials or the Tokyo trials onward are not referenced or analyzed in any meaningful manner. In the context of an armed conflict of global proportions, that lack of familiarity and absence in his legal analysis are of concern. <br /><br /><li>There is no evidence that Judge Mukasey looked at the relevant state practice of other states under treaty or customary international law with regard to evaluating waterboarding or at the American jurisprudence on the subject in domestic or in international tribunals we helped to create over the past 100 years. That is not good enough these days.</ul>Third, Judge Mukasey&#39;s analysis purports to present great concern for the impact of his comments on the personal jeopardy of those in the field or those charged with reviewing conduct of those in the field. His loyalty &#8212; upwards or downwards &#8212; is misplaced. It pains me greatly that his solicitude for those persons seems far greater than what I would hope is the central concern &#8212; defending and protecting the United States. In his role as Attorney General, an important part of the task ahead will be to cleanse the state itself of its criminality: whether at the level of those who wrote the shameless memos (that are more than mistakes), those who ordered the memos, or those down below to the lowest level implementer of the policy. It would seem that a truly independent person would show now a willingness to follow the facts where they lead both up and down and not personal loyalty concerns. If someone was induced in error as part of the common plan by someone above in the hierarchy, Judge Mukasey may determine to be solicitous towards such a person in his investigation and discretion as to prosecute. But, as the Attorney General nominee, these type of personal, almost managerial, concerns are beneath the office of the Attorney General.<br /><br />Fourth, because of what is not said in Judge Mukasey&#39;s analysis above, I am worried about his commitment to transparency in his approach to the Attorney General position. Maybe one way he could show that openness would be if he committed to release or examine releasing the International Committee of the Red Cross report on the detention and interrogation techniques in the CIA Black Sites referenced in a recent New Yorker article. That report no doubt has the truth on what we have been doing. Rather than playing internal law semantic games, the discussion of the ICRC would point out whether in our practice we have complied with the international obligations that fall upon the United States as a whole and for which we would expect the Attorney General to have great concern. Those who have read the report in Congress seem to suggest that we have failed miserably. Let the American people know what our leaders and the detainees know. Have we been leveled with by our leaders? We can handle the truth.<br /><br />Fifth, it pains me greatly that Judge Mukasey has not simply said that "waterboarding is torture and illegal." It pains me greatly that the international component of his analysis is not as extensive as I think it should be of the Attorney General who would serve at this crucial time. <br /><br />For these reasons, as a citizen I remain extremely troubled by Judge Mukasey's nomination and suggest that the Senate not confirm him. If he asks why, someone might respond as Churchill responded to an employee he had fired: "Not up to the job." <br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Moeen Cheema, professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan, says that President Pervez Musharaff&#39;s declaration of emergency rule is in effect martial law, imposed to crack down on a dissenting judiciary that was about to rule against Musharraf in a critical election case...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/moeencheema.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>ccording to media reports, a nationwide emergency has been imposed here in Pakistan. All independent media channels have been forcibly taken off the air. Paramilitary forces have surrounded the Supreme Court building in the capital. However, this is only an emergency in name: in reality it is yet another martial law proclamation. <br /><br />Under the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, the regime may impose an emergency if the country is facing external aggression or if there is serious internal turmoil. The Constitution has been placed in abeyance for the second time by General Pervez Musharraf. A Provisional Constitutional Order has been proclaimed, as was the case in 1999 when the military regime took over. The proclamation of emergency has been issued by the general in his capacity as the chief of the armed forces and not as the President of Pakistan.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ARE YOU IN PAKISTAN?</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;What do you think of Musharraf&#39;s emergency rule declaration?

The truth, evident to the overwhelming majority of Pakistanis is that this action was motivated by the fears that the Supreme Court may decide to invalidate General Musharraf's re-election as President. The case was scheduled to be decided by next Tuesday.<br /><br />According to the reports, eight-member bench of the Supreme Court has already declared the PCO and the proclamation of emergency to be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court and High Court judges are being asked to take a new oath under the PCO. The Chief Justice and a majority of Supreme Court and High Court judges have not been invited to take the oath, meaning thereby that the Chief Justice of Pakistan has been sacked for the second time this year. <br /><br />While the regime shall attempt to crack down on the media and protests in Pakistan at home over the coming days, internationally it will forward the claim that the Supreme Court's activism was threatening to destabilize the regime and hence undermining American interests in the War on Terror. The regime shall also attempt to present the softer face of an emergency. It must be realized that political leaders and activist lawyers are already being arrested all over the country. Fundamental freedoms have been suspended and the rights of the protesters shall in all likelihood be viciously trampled upon. <br /><br />In short, martial law by another name is just as brutal! <br /><br /><br /><em>Moeen Cheema is an Assistant Professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan</em><br />

		<title>US House must uphold truth and justice with Armenian genocide resolution</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frank V. Zerunyan, Esq. [Chairman, Board of Governors of the <a href="http://www.armenianbar.org/">Armenian Bar Association</a>; Mayor Pro Tem, City of Rolling Hills Estates]: &quot;The People&#39;s House of the United States of America must follow its tradition and uphold the truth above all else. The speaker of the House of Representatives must bring HR106 to a floor vote because the resolution is morally, intellectually, historically and legally consistent with our American values. We Americans must insist that our leaders promote truth, justice and the rule of law. We have a long tradition of accepting human dignity as an inalienable right and as the basis of our jurisprudence. No one could have described it better than Alexander Hamilton when he said &quot;The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for, among the old parchments, or musty records. They are written, as with a sun beam in the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of divinity itself; and can never be erased or obstructed by mortal power.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Never again&quot; to Armenians, Jews, Cambodians, Rwandans, Darfurians is not just a slogan in the context of the human rights debate in the world; it is a call to meaningful action to eradicate genocide from the world. Experts and scholars confirm that each perpetrator has used previous crimes against humanity with impunity. Indeed Adolph Hitler himself in 1939, before the invasion of Poland, reminded his commanding officers in a passionate speech &quot;who still talks now days of the extermination of the Armenians?&quot; Denial is part of and a completion of this crime against humanity. Our values simply do not permit us to be co-conspirators to the commission of or to the completion of the crime of genocide. <br /><br />At stake today in Washington DC, of course, is the question of whether the United States House of Representatives should offend Turkey by voting on a resolution condemning the Armenian Genocide of 1915. All actors in this debate are playing the roles they have played for decades. Turkish generals and ministers are threatening our military ties, the closure of our bases, air space and logistics routes. Ironically however, even before any word of this resolution, those routes were already closed to our sons and daughters when our nation went to war to liberate Iraq. There is also a new threat by our own government; &quot;radical Islam&quot;. Most if not all credible experts will agree that this threat is simply not credible as the Republic of Turkey will never chose this form of a regime over the great and overwhelming legacy of its founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Moreover, such a threat completely undermines contemporary Turkish identity.<br /><br />While the Republic of Turkey may react negatively in the short term (I think to their own detriment), recognition of the Armenian genocide is warranted for several reasons. First, the HR106 declares the truth; a truth that 23 other countries, 40 American States and countless Counties and Cities have already recognized. Second, no one discusses or even mentions our influence and the basis of our influence over the Republic of Turkey. The truth is that we brought Turkey into the NATO Alliance without which Turkey&#39;s security could not be guaranteed. We support Turkey&#39;s membership into the European Union; an economic &quot;must&quot; for the survival of Turkey into the 21st Century and beyond. We granted Turkey a most favored nation trading status resulting in more than $7 billion in annual trade and $2 billion in US investments in Turkey. Only Israel and Egypt outrank Turkey as recipients of US Foreign assistance. Third, it is inconceivable that even back in the days when the US prized West Germany as a buffer and deterrent against the Soviet Union, we Americans would have refrained from condemning The Shoah (the Holocaust) at Germany&#39;s behest. <br /><br />Finally and more importantly to this American of Armenian decent, it brings finality and closure, bringing back human dignity to humanity lost almost a century ago. I assume most of you know the eternal resting grounds of your great grand fathers and grand mothers; I don&#39;t. My ancestors formed the first Christian nation in the world (301 A.D.) only to become the invisible Christians in unmarked graves in the early stages of the 20th Century. <br /><br />I am the great-grand son of a victim and the grand son of a survivor. Ironically, I live today as the direct result of the kindness of a Turkish gentleman (Effendi) who had the humanity to shelter my grand father. I applaud his humanity and encourage our leaders to follow in his footsteps.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anonymous [advocate, Lahore High Court, Lahore, Pakistan]: &quot;This evening I had the pleasure and privilege of meeting with four very important judges of the <a href="http://www.lhc.gov.pk/">Lahore High Court</a> who refused to take oaths under the Provisional Constitutional Order promulgated by the Chief of the Army Staff on the evening of the 3rd of November. It is very unfair that not only have their names been removed from the website of the Lahore High Court, but their Lordships are not present in the list of &#39;former judges&#39; either. Even after an exhaustive Google search, the CV of Mr. Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed and Mr. Justice Umar Ata Bandial could not be found. Therefore, I have had to resort to my memory vis-&agrave;-vis date of appointment, date of retirement etc.<br /><br />The names of My Lords are: -<br /><br />1.                  Mr. Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed: - His Lordship was appointed in December, 2004 and was to remain a Judge till 2018. There was every likelihood of his elevation to the Supreme Court of Pakistan keeping in view the length of service available to him [age of superannuation of a High Court Judge in Pakistan is 62 years whereas of a Supreme Court Judge is 65 years].<br /><br />2.                  Mr. Justice Khawaja Muhammad Sharif: - His Lordship was appointed in May, 1998, and was the senior most Judge on the morning of 3rd of November. Consequently, he was the strongest candidate for the position of the next Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court. His retirement was to take place in 2010 and keeping in view his seniority, His Lordship was destined to reach the Supreme Court maximum by 2009. His biodata is <a href="http://www.lhc.gov.pk/judges/jbiodata/jkhawaja_m_sharif.htm">available online</a>.<br /><br />3.                  Mr. Justice Umar Ata Bandial: - His Lordship was appointed in December, 2004 and was to remain a Judge till 2020. There was every probability of his elevation to the Supreme Court keeping in view the length of service available to him, which means another 3 years of service bringing retirement in 2023. His Lordship was one of the most distinguished and most expensive corporate lawyers before elevation to the Bench.<br /><br />4.                  Mr. Justice Asif Saeed Khan Khosa: - His Lordship was appointed in May, 1998 and was to remain Judge till 2016. Keeping in view his seniority in the Lahore High Court, His Lordship&#39;s elevation to the Supreme Court was beyond any doubt which means another three years making 2019 as retirement year. One of the most learned, upright, courteous, and relief-giving Judges the Lahore High Court ever had in its sixty years history. A Barrister of the Lincoln&#39;s Inn as well as a Cambridge Graduate. In a short span of 9 years, His Lordship has benefited the profession of law with voluminous judicial precedents upheld by the Supreme Court which speak of quantity as well as quality. The best Judge in this world; nobody knows Criminal Law better than Mr. Justice Asif Saeed Khan Khosa. His biodata is <a href="http://www.lhc.gov.pk/judges/jbiodata/jasif_saeed_khan.htm">available online</a>.<br /> <br />I noted the following after meeting with them:<br /><br />1.                  Their faces were sparkling with the honour of saying No to an illegitimate de facto ruler of Pakistan.<br /><br />2.                  Their living rooms were full with guests congratulating them and their families for being so upright in the hour of adversity.<br /><br />3.                  None had any impression nor words of regrets for dropping such high offices with such length of service ahead of them.<br /><br />4.                  They did not have any major complaints about their colleagues who took oath under the PCO and regarded it as a matter of one&#39;s own conscience.<br /><br />5.                  Three of them were happily and confidently preparing to revert to their former law firms. The fourth one has two brilliant lawyer sons and I am not sure if he would join their Chambers.<br /><br />6.                  They were not vocal against the Chief of Army Staff. Not because of any fear but because they never resort to undignified language for the simple reason that they belong to the profession of law, not the profession of usurpation.<br /><br />7.                   All of them, however, were critical of the state of affairs in which their beloved country is being dragged to. The role of political parties, the western influence and the limits thereof, the increasing gulf between the civil and the military.<br /><br />8.                  All of them were very concerned about the ruthless baton-charge and subsequent detention of lawyers at the Lahore High Court on the 5th of November. They kept asking about the well-being of different busy lawyers who regularly appeared before them in the court room.<br /><br />9.                  All of them were very concerned about the seeds of hatred that had been sown between the Bar and the Bench subsequent to the abhorrent events of 5th of November.<br /><br />10.              All of them were very concerned about the well being of the country, the rule of law, the writ jurisdiction, the concept of independent judiciary, the Constitution, the fundamental rights that are now being denied to the people in the absence of the Constitution, and most importantly the safety of the Chief Justice of Pakistan under detention.<br /><br />In short, meeting them was meeting happy and satisfied people.  Their houses right from the main gate to the guests&#39; room were full with flowers and bouquets which people known and not known to them left not only as a token of respect but also as an approval of their decision. They were good judges. Their judgements have always been regarded as good judgements and it was the evening of 3rd of November when they handed down the last one.&quot;<br />

		<title>EYEWITNESS: Pakistani riot police clash with lawyers at Lahore High Court</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistani law student from the Lahore University of Management Sciences describes the clash between lawyers and riot police at the Lahore High Court Monday: &quot;Today, November 5th, the lawyers of Pakistan were to boycott the courts and protest at the promulgation of emergency and the issuance of the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO). What transpired is yet to fully settle in. Thirty to forty students reached the Lahore High Court building at about 08:15 am, and then waited for the rest of the interested parties to arrive. By the time that most of the lawyers assembled in the Lahore High Court building, they were surrounded by the police from all sides. <br /><br /><img src="/hotline/lahorehclawyers.jpg" align=left><img src="/images/s.gif" height=1 width=15 align=left> <img src="/hotline/lahorehcpolice.jpg"><br /><br />Not only this, but the police actually had the audacity to enter the High Court, and baton-charge the protesting lawyers who wished to exit the Court premises to peacefully protest. In addition to this, tear gas was being used from a very close proximity, even though it is a banned item under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Once again, it must be emphasized that all this was done from within the High Court premises. <br /><br /><img src="/hotline/lahorehcpolicebatons.jpg"><br /><br />The police had clearly been given the orders to crush the protest, as an excessive amount of force was exerted by them. Women were manhandled, doors and windows of the Lahore High Court were broken and desecrated, and the use of profanity and derogatory language by the &quot;law-enforcement&quot; agencies was regular and persistent. It seemed as though these protectors of the public had forgotten that they were in the Lahore High Court, once thought to be the premises where justice is to be served to the people, not injustice.<br /><br />By the end of the day, scores of lawyers were thrown into police vans in herds and were taken away to an undisclosed location. Even participating students seemed to get a good thrashing, but were lucky to be able to escape arrest, and hence tell this tale.<br /><br />It is amusing and telling that the so called &#39;new PCO&#39; Supreme Court Chief Justice remained silent through all this like an defunct organ of the state, whilst his judicial apparatus was desecrated, ridiculed and mocked by the same law enforcement agencies which were once accountable before it.&quot;<br />

The US Government will not hand over any of the three sentenced to death until all our application have been heard and dispensed with by a competant court. We have at all material times copied the US Embassy in Baghdad with our applications including (1) application to remit sentence to President Talabani (2) Constitutional challange in the High Court of Iraq (3) application chalanging the legitimate expectation to the High Court and we have now identified a further issue which is in our view pertinant to both the US and the UK.<br /><br />The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide<br /><br />Adopted by Resolution 260 (III) A of the U.N. General Assembly on 9 December 1948.<br />Entry into force: 12 January 1951 deals with the question of Tribunals in Art.<br />VI and Iraq, as well as US and UK are signatories.<br /><br />Article VI of the convention reads:<br /><br />&quot;Article VI: Persons charged with genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in article III shall be tried by a competent tribunal of the State in the territory of which the act was committed, or by such international penal tribunal as may have jurisdiction with respect to those Contracting Parties which shall have accepted its jurisdiction.&quot;<br /><br />The key word here is &#39;competent&#39; and in accordance with the maxim &#39;pacta sunt servanda&#39;, it is to be presumed that Iraq, US and the UK intends to honour its international relations. Thus the words in the Convention are to be given the meaning that is most favourable to that construction.<br /><br />In our submission the Iraqi High Tribunal can not be certified by any independant body to fall anywhere near the word &#39;competent&#39; Tribunal having received criticiusm from each and every body including but not limited to the UNHCR, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the UN Secretary General in pro per.<br /><br />It follows that until the issue as to whether or not in the literal sense the Iraqi High Tribunal can be classed within the word &#39;competent&#39; which in our view it cannot, any sentence from an &#39;uncompetent&#39; Tribunal may lead to intervention as regard the execution of sentences from such a Tribunal in Iraq, US, or UK.<br /><br />The Iraqi High Tribunal fails the test of competency required to comply with Art.VI and as such cannot, in our submission dispense justice let alone impose upon third party signatories to the Convention any obligations as such would de facto and potentially de jure make those third party countries accomplices. We will not hesitate to take the appropriate action in the unlikely event that our clients are executed and have indeed brought this matter to the attention of the UN.&quot;<br /><br />GIOVANNI DI STEFANO<br />MUQDAD S AL JOBOURI<br />ISSAM GHAZZAWI<br /><br /><iframe src="/related/giovanni.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='120' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ratchasima.net/"><strong>Awzar Thi</strong></a> [Member, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>, Hong Kong]: &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2007/10/myanmar-monks-resume-protests-ahead-of.php">The renewal of protests in Burma</a> during recent days should come as no surprise to anyone other than those persons who have written foolish articles making out that what happened in September was somehow not the doing of the people there themselves but rather a consequence of covert American foreign policy. <br /><br />Every society has its threshold, the point after which it will no longer tolerate things going on as before. The threshold for people in Burma is much higher than that of many other societies today, and thus they have put up with a lot more for a lot longer than might otherwise have been expected. This does not mean that they have not fought back, but rather that their forms of resistance have not attracted much outside interest, nor seriously threatened the army&#39;s hold on power. Rather, many have served to keep the country back from the threshold for so long. <br /><br />But it is no longer possible for people there to use ordinary methods of defiance to alleviate their problems. The conditions under which they are being forced to live have become intolerable. The protests are a consequence of the threshold being reached, not engineering from the outside. The struggle that is on now in Burma is ultimately a struggle for desperate survival. There is no other way. <br /><br />Once this is understood, it is also not surprising to find that monks have come out to play a lead role. In the past a Burmese pun ran that &quot;school students eat well, monastic students are beggars&quot; (they go to collect alms with the monks). In recent years, that pun has been ironically inverted: now monastic students eat well; school students are beggars. The monks get their food and living needs from the general population. When they see that others are going without in order to feed them, this is not something they can ignore: they must protect their adherents, as they have done for centuries. <br /><br />The struggle for survival of Burma&#39;s people is by corollary a struggle for survival of its dictators, whose response to the protests has throughout been characterised by lawlessness: the complete departure from not only international law but also from those domestic standards to which they pretend to subscribe. <br /><br />Although the international media have referred to thousands of persons being &quot;arrested,&quot; according to the authorities themselves they have only &quot;called, investigated and interrogated&quot; them, without regard to criminal procedure or any other established regulations. People are still being taken from their houses with no warning or explanation. Others are being pulled off the streets. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, have not been located and must be treated as forcibly disappeared until proven otherwise. The inability of the International Committee of the Red Cross to access prisons and other places of confinement, despite its best efforts, has greatly hampered attempts to account for the missing.<br /><br />Against this backdrop, the struggle for survival of Burma&#39;s people can also be seen as a struggle against the un-rule of law. Their demands are for both rice and rationality: each depends upon an end to the arbitrary rule under which they have been needlessly obliged to subsist for over four decades. And justice - both in the legal and social sense - will come to their country no other way.&quot; <br /><br /><em>(Awzar Thi is the pen name of a member of the <strong>Asian Human Rights Commission</strong> with over 15 years of experience as an advocate of human rights and the rule of law in Thailand and Burma.

		<title>Federal judge ruled correctly on Watada court-martial injunction</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.carneylaw.com/attorneys/getProfile.asp?attorney_id=75" alt="DOMESTIC_ONLY"><strong>Kenneth S. Kagan</strong></a> [attorney for US Army 1st Lt. Ehren Watada]: &quot;In February, 2007, 1LT Ehren Watada was tried by a court-martial for his refusal to deploy to Iraq, and for statements he made on four separate occasions in various media explaining his rationale for his intention to refuse to deploy (and on one occasion, explaining, after the fact, why he did not deploy with his unit). Prior to the commencement of his trial, 1LT Watada and the Government entered into a Pretrial Agreement and a Stipulation of Fact. Pursuant to that agreement, in exchange for his stipulating to the accuracy and authenticity of certain of the statements he made (thus relieving the Government of the burden of calling certain reluctant witnesses to establish a foundation for the admission of those statements), the Government agreed to move to dismiss two of the incidents (referred to as &quot;specifications&quot;) of &quot;Conduct Unbecoming an Officer.&quot;<br /><br />At the close of the Government&#39;s case, but before the defense presented its case, the presiding military judge, Lt. Col. John M. Head, announced that he was troubled by what appeared to him to be an inconsistent position taken by the defense (or at least, his sense of the position he believed the defense would be taking, as reflected by a proposed jury instruction relating to mistake of fact submitted by defense counsel). He thus thought that 1LT Watada acted in breach of the Pretrial Agreement, and indicated his intention to set it aside and reject the Stipulation of Fact. He undertook a lengthy colloquy with 1LT Watada, and engaged in a lively debate with counsel. What was most astonishing was the uniform approach taken by the defense and the prosecution, wherein both sides were in accord that there was no problem with the agreement, and no issue requiring a mistrial. The lead prosecutor went about as far as a lawyer can go in trying to dissuade the judge from declaring a mistrial, but, ultimately, after several hours, the prosecution caved in and reluctantly asked for a mistrial, which was granted over the defendant&#39;s vociferous objection. Defense counsel at that time, <a href="/hotline/2006/11/court-martialed-for-refusing-to-take.php">Eric Seitz</a> of Hawaii, even warned the judge that the judge was creating a situation in which a second trial might well be barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, but the judge was undeterred.<br /><br />My partner, Jim Lobsenz, and I took over as counsel for 1LT Watada in March, and sought relief in the military appeals courts (beginning with the Army Court of Criminal Appeals, and progressing to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces). Our arguments were that (1) a second trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause; and (2) a stay of further court-martial proceedings was required while the courts reviewed the double jeopardy issue. Notwithstanding our argument that double jeopardy relates directly to the &quot;right not be tried,&quot; and that therefore the only way the Double Jeopardy Clause would have any meaning would be if arguable claims were reviewed before a subsequent trial, the military courts were unsympathetic, and insistent that 1LT Watada&#39;s rights could be vindicated on direct appeal (assuming a conviction, of course).<br /><br />At that stage, there was no alternative but to seek relief by way of a Sec. 2241 habeas petition and a request for an emergency hearing on a request for a stay. The matter was assigned to Judge Settle, who scheduled an emergency hearing the same day he received the case and our briefing. After hearing our presentation and the argument of the Assistant US Attorney, Judge Settle, the next day, issued an order staying the court-martial (which was scheduled to convene in 4 days) until further order.<br /><br />Next, Judge Settle asked for further briefing from the parties directed more specifically to the Double Jeopardy issue, and after receiving a full complement of briefing, took the matter under advisement. On November 8th, Judge Settle issued a 33 page decision, granting a Preliminary Injunction. In his order, Judge Settle found that Judge Head had abused his discretion in setting aside the Stipulation of Fact; that even if he had not abused his discretion, there was no &quot;manifest necessity&quot; for a mistrial; that 1LT Watada had demonstrated in several respects that there was a significant likelihood he would prevail on the merits of his Double Jeopardy claim; that he would be irreparably injured if he was forced to go to trial; and that the balance of harms (to him versus the public) weighed in his favor.<br /><br />In <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-judge-grants-injunction-against.php">so ruling</a>, Judge Settle did not stake out any new or novel grounds. His decision was not activist or legislative in scope. Instead, he relied upon well-settled precedent, long-established principles articulated in cases from the United States Supreme Court and numerous federal circuits. What distinguished our experience with Judge Settle from our experiences in the military courts was that Judge Settle took the issues seriously, and made an intellectually honest decision divorced from politics. Regrettably, we are unable say the same for the military courts.<br /><br />As of this writing, it is unclear what the next step(s) will be, with regard to our seeking an order converting the Preliminary Injunction into a Permanent Injunction, and the Army&#39;s efforts to seek a vacation of the Injunction and the right to try 1LT Watada a second time. It seems reasonably certain the Ninth Circuit will get involved at some point, and we remain confident that the law (without regard to the politics) is on our side.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anonymous [advocate, Lahore High Court, Pakistan]: &quot;The legal fraternity in Pakistan so far is absent from the <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/pakistan-ex-pm-blocked-from-leading.php">long march</a> or other protests earlier planned by Mrs. Benazir Bhutto. There are a number of reasons why this is so.<br /><br />Firstly, a Bar Association is a registered body duly registered under the relevant law. It elects its office bearers through elections. Whenever an office bearer considers that a potential theme be placed before the open house of the bar so as to determine the course of action in given circumstances, he would himself or through a trusted colleague put forward a &#39;resolution&#39; and a day and time would be fixed to debate the issue and finalize the strategy if all the members of the Bar raise their hands in favour. Once a resolution is passed with a consent of the members, then the office bearer also issues a press release that on such and such issue we do or that we do not share views with a political party and/or in addition to this we shall take part in the protest as a &#39;Bar Association&#39; collectively. The reason why the Pakistan Peoples Party is devoid of Bar&#39;s support is the fact the office bearers are either under house arrest consequent to the invoking of Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance 1960, or in police lock up/jail subsequent to the First Information Reports recorded by the police.<br /><br />Secondly, it is seldom that a Bar Association would in its entirely support a political party through its office bearers in such a manner. There are certain groups in every Bar Association on the basis of caste as well as political affiliations, e.g. Peoples Lawyers Forum belonging to the party of Mrs. Benazir Bhutto. They are not &#39;registered&#39; under any law and would choose a leader amongst themselves who would necessarily be a lawyer and would have the backing of the elders of the political party. The leader of Peoples Lawyer Forum of Lahore High Court has direct blessings of Mrs. Benazir Bhutto. It is quite customary that such groups would participate in an event without the permission of the office bearers of the Bar Association that they belong to, but they would make it clear that their appearance or participation is not to be taken as participation of Bar Association by any means. A &#39;Bar Association&#39; always prefers to maintain its separate entity and identity by not aligning with any political party. The groups within serve the purpose.<br /><br />Thirdly, Mrs. Benazir Bhutto&#39;s call for this morning&#39;s &#39;Long March&#39; was jeopardized by the junta before the setting of the sun as last night detention orders were pasted on the face of the house in Defence Housing Authority where she is residing. So she is under protective custody; 900 &#8212; 1200 policemen have cordoned off the area. She can not come out; none can visit her either.<br /><br />However, she is residing at the house of Mr. Latif Khosa, a senior lawyer who is also member of the Senate of Pakistan elected on Peoples Party&#39;s ticket. Mr. Khosa has his own fairly large group of lawyers within the Lahore High Court Bar Association as well as the Lahore District Bar. There is every reason to believe that a good number of lawyers would be present at his residence or nearby his residence making futile attempts to reach there. But yes, this is true that the Bar Associations are not taking part in the long march and for obvious reasons.&quot;<br />

		<title>Pakistan government&#039;s rejection of court ruling on emergency usurps judiciary</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Basil Nabi Malik [third-year law student, <a href="http://www.lums.edu.pk/">Lahore University of Management Sciences</a> (LUMS), Lahore, Pakistan]: &quot;An 8 member bench of the Supreme Court has <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/musharraf-defends-emergency-rule-issues.php">held as illegal and unconstitutional</a> the Proclamation of Emergency and the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) issued today by the Chief of Army Staff. The Supreme Court restrained the Government of Pakistan, composed of the President and Prime Minister of Pakistan, from undertaking any such action which is contrary to the independence of the judiciary, and also declared that no judge of the Supreme Court or the High Courts including Chief Justices shall take oaths under the PCO or any other extra constitutional steps.<br /><br />However, within hours of such a decision, the Government dismissed the judicial decision as &quot;irrelevant&quot;. The reason given for disregarding the judgment was that under a clause of the &quot;extra-constitutional&quot; PCO, no action of the Government could be challenged in a Court of law. Interestingly enough, considering that the PCO itself had been declared illegal by the judiciary, it seems peculiar to validate one&#39;s decision to disregard a judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan on the basis of a law which has already been declared as unconstitutional by the same and only judicial apparatus of the country. <br /><br />The classification of the Supreme Court&#39;s decision as incorrect and unlawful by the Government of Pakistan is tantamount to the usurpation of the functions of the judiciary, which is to make such declarations with regard to the actions of the other organs of the State. Inter alia, the executive is doing exactly what it accuses the judiciary of doing: encroaching upon the functions of the other branches of government.<br /><br />The implications of this decision of the Supreme Court are profound. Never in the history of Pakistan has the Judiciary ever nullified or delegitimized a PCO issued by a Chief of Army Staff. In addition to this, the clear message of the apex court to the army staff, core commanders, staff officers and other to refrain from acting on the PCO depicts the continuing power struggle between the military and the judiciary. Not only did the Supreme Court decision state these dictums, but it also declared any future appointments of the Chief Justices and judges under the new arrangement as null and void. Hence it can be seen that a conscious effort has been made by the Court to protect itself from being &quot;purged&quot; of those elements which are seen to be adhering to the constitution in letter and spirit. <br /><br />With the Supreme Court invalidating the PCO and emergency declaration, and the resulting setting aside of the verdict by the military led Government of Pakistan, it seems that the tug of war between the judiciary and the military is entering its final phase. However, the question is not about which institution will triumph in this battle, but rather about whether at the end, justice will prevail.&quot;<br />

Judgment.  Temperament.  Legal philosophy.  Those are the requirements, at a minimum, for a qualified candidate for Attorney General of the United States.  <a href="/paperchase/2007_11_14_indexarch.php#4087780135834272091"><strong>Judge Mukasey</strong></a> has demonstrated those qualities, and more, over the last 35 years of his distinguished career.  One has every reason to believe that, as an Executive appointee, Judge Mukasey will lead the Department of Justice in an exemplary manner while the Country is at war.    <br /><br />In his opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearing, Judge Mukasey said at the outset that the hearing &quot;isn&#39;t about me&quot; and that legal decisions should be decided &quot;by facts and law, not by interests and motives.&quot;  His experience includes acting as the trial judge in some of the country&#39;s most important terrorism cases, and his temperament has been tested during the crucible of trial.  Unlike some, he understands the need to gather intelligence and protect civil liberties during wartime, and the real tension that goal reifies.  To Mukasey, &quot;the issue between authority and liberty is not between a right and a wrong&quot; as some describe the choice.  Much like a hardened commander during war, he has a sober, battle-tested understanding of the real threat al Qaeda poses to the United States.  During his confirmation hearing, he was his own man, agreeing and disagreeing with Democrats, Republicans, and the Administration on a variety of legal policy issues. <br /><br />Mukasey is a practical man, stating that &quot;reality has a way of undoing a lot of theories.&quot;  He believes that the &quot;constant, impartial, principled application of the law&quot; is the best way to approach legal challenges.  In short, Judge Mukasey is the right man for the job at a time when the Department of Justice needs a steady, experienced, un-flashy and unflappable leader.  It looks like that is exactly what we now have.&quot;<br />

He has alleged that Pakistan's superior judiciary had to be rendered compliant since it was undermining the security agencies. <br /><br />But a review of the FIR (First Information Report) pursuant to which 344 lawyers, out of an approximate total of one thousand, arrested during the crackdown on protests at the Lahore High Court on Monday have been charged with anti-terrorism offences reveals the nature of Musharraf's real War on Terror.<br /><br />The lawyers have been charged with a range of offences including attempted murder; property damage; rioting; public nuisance; and disobeying, hindering and assaulting public servants in order to deter the performance of their duties. This makes for rather mundane reading. More interestingly, the dissident lawyers have also been charged with a breach of &Acirc;&#167;16 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, dating back to the early days of Pakistan's first military dictator, General Ayub Khan. This provision criminalizes the publicizing of 'rumours' that may spread alarm and endanger public safety: presumably, the dangerous rumour that was being spread by the protesters in this case is that there is Martial Law in the country.<br /><br />Most interestingly, these protesting lawyers have also been charged with a violation of &Acirc;&#167;7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. In this regard, they were presented before the Anti-Terrorism Court in Lahore on Tuesday afternoon before being transferred to various jails in the country for a period of at least 14 days. It is anticipated that most of them shall be detained for a period of 60 days or more. Bail may not be granted to a person charged under this anti-terrorism provision, and hence the protesters may be detained without further recourse to judicial process. This may be somewhat frivolous, given that many of the lawyers who had gathered outside the Anti-Terrorism Court in Lahore were also attacked and arrested by the police.<br /><br />The protesters who have been targeted with these specifically harsh measures include most of the leaders of the legal community. This action is clearly designed to prevent the reorganization of the legal community for further protests. The protesters include several female lawyers, and many senior members of the bar. <br /><br />As for the newfound efficiency of the security forces, their vigor was fully displayed inside the Lahore High Court premises on Monday. During earlier protests against the first suspension of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, the police never ventured beyond the entrances of the court complex. On the one occasion that the police tried to enter the Lahore High Court premises, the Supreme Court intervened and swiftly reined in the police. <br /><br />This time the police forces had no fear of the Supreme Court, for no such court exists. All we have left is a building and eight old men playing dumb charades.<br /><br /><br /><em>Moeen Cheema is an Assistant Professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan</em><br />

He said history had shown that human rights had been regularly infringed upon in times of emergency, not by reason of calculated actions, but as a result of panic. Each time, after the crisis had passed, it had become clear that there had been no justification for violating civil rights. <br /><br />The Islamic Republic of Pakistan was once privileged to have a non-Muslim Supreme Court Judge: Mr. Dorab Patel, who belonged to the minority community of &#39;Parsis&#39; who refused to take an oath under a Provisional Constitutional Order originating from the table of General Zia-ul-Haq. While delivering a lecture in 1995 his Lordship stated, &quot;An independent judiciary is a judiciary which is able to resist the pressures not only of the government but also of public opinion and of popular prejudices. And in the long run, a judiciary will not remain independent if it is not able to fight the enemy within.&quot;<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ARE YOU IN PAKISTAN?</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;What is your reaction to emergency rule and the disestablishment of the judiciary?

Almost fifty Superior Court Judges belonging to the Supreme Court and the four provincial High Courts have been sacked. Mr. Justice Ramday, who headed the Bench delivering the landmark judgment of 20 July 2007 reinstating the then dysfunctional Chief Justice, has been put under house arrest under the talented supervision of Pakistan Rangers here in the city of Lahore. The status of Chief Justice House - the official residence of Pakistan&#39;s Chief Justice - in Islamabad is still unclear. More than 24 hours have passed in the 21st century but the entire country is forced to look at blank TV screens. At the same time, it is dreadful that US is merely &#39;deeply concerned&#39;, &#39;closely watching&#39;, and regards the imposition of Martial Law as &#39;regrettable&#39;.<br /><br />The &#39;enemy within&#39; has also returned from Dubai; Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, the Daughter of the East, the daughter of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who preferred to walk to the gallows rather than shaking hands with the then military dictator who had usurped him. Mr. Bhutto never believed in the lawlessness of Martial Law; Mrs. Benazir, however, firmly believes in the National Reconciliation Ordinance 2007 promulgated on 5 October 2007 which entitles her to exoneration from all corruption-linked cases registered between 01 Jan 1986 and 12 October 1999. Her self-centered post 20 July 2007 support for the government which has given a second lease on life to General Musharraf will long be remembered by the masses of Pakistan.<br /><br />The &#39;enemy within&#39; addressed the nation in the late hours of 3 November. The Chief of Army Staff was addressing the helpless people while wearing a local dress and not his uniform, perhaps an attempt to dilute the harshness of Martial Law - an unsuccessful attempt as always. The international community was also reminded of the concocted viewpoint that since the situation prevailing in Pakistan is radically different from the West, one should not expect identical standards of civil liberties and human rights. A bare perusal of the text of Proclamation of Emergency coupled with the speech of the Army chief testifies, however, that it was the functioning of the judiciary alone which created panic in the corridors of power. Their Lordships were accused of a number of wrongdoings, most particularly the following:<ul><li>The Supreme Court facilitated terrorists by releasing them thereby causing a huge setback to the government&#39;s fight against terrorism. (A poor attempt to seek the patronage of international community in favour of extra-constitutional crime).<br /><br /><li>Civil and police officials are being called to the courts and insulted; so, they are reluctant to take any action. (They were summoned with one simple question as to under which provision of the Penal Code detainees were arbitrarily detained for years).<br /><br /><li>Interference of the judiciary in matters exclusive to Executive and Legislature thereby resulting in poor economic growth. (National assets were sold at throw away prices. Executive and Legislatures were unconcerned, the Judiciary inquired into). <br /><br /><li>Uncertainty caused by the judiciary in respect the of presidential election. (A plain issue; do the military laws allow an army officer of whatever rank to submit his nomination papers for the presidential elections?)<br /><br /><li>Lack of harmony between the pillars of the state solely on account of judicial activism. (This activism for the first time in the history of Pakistan enabled poor people seeking justice against executive transgressions to access the apex court by just mailing a one-page letter).</ul>It must be clear to the entire world that on 3 November, Pakistan faced not an emergency but fully-fledged Martial Law. An emergency is imposed under the Constitution, but here the Constitution has been held in abeyance. An emergency does not provide for the sacking of Superior Court judges, only a Martial Law can commit this trespass. An emergency can be challenged before the Superior Courts; Martial Law does not provide this liberty. <br /><br />All the &#39;enemies within&#39; will become forgotten memories as opposed to those Honourable Judges of the Superior Judiciary who have declined to take an oath of allegiance to a military dictator. They will always live in the hearts of the people, in the pages of history.<br /><br /><br /><em>Faisal Naseem Chaudhry is an advocate of the Lahore High Court, Lahore, Pakistan</em><br />

The constitutional right that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law has been suspended. This suspension means that the government can imprison or kill anyone in Pakistan with no protection of law.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO AVAILABLE</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Video: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8307847950449727334&q=solidarity+pakistan+lawyers&total=13&start=0&num=10&so=0&type=search&plindex=3">Solidarity with Pakistan&#39;s Lawyers: If Not Now, When?</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />The lawyers of Pakistan are refusing to submit to the usurper because under the new regime anyone can be arrested without being informed of the grounds for such arrest. No longer does the arrested person have any right to consult or to be defended by a lawyer. <br /><br />The lawyers of Pakistan are protesting on the courthouse grounds because the usurper has suspended the freedom of movement. Many Supreme Court Justices and politicians have been detained in their houses. Numerous human rights lawyers have been made political prisoners in their own homes. <br /><br />The usurper has suspended the right to free speech and the freedom of press. The electronic media have been turned off. The newspapers are no longer free to report the crimes of the regime. They are not free to comment on the news or criticize a lawless government. The lawyers are marching in unison because a nation without free speech is a dead nation and a nation without a free press is vulnerable to gross violations of human rights.<br /><br />The usurper has suspended Article 25 of the Constitution, which says: All citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of Law. When the government abandons the equal protection of laws, weak individuals and weak groups are the first to suffer, and suffer the most. The lawyers have taken the vanguard of protest because legal safeguards against blatant discrimination have been removed. <br /><br />The usurper has fired the Supreme Court Justices who refused to accept unlawful dictation and who demanded that the usurper respect the Constitution. <br /><br />The lawyers of Pakistan are being beaten, detained, and taken away from their children and families. They have been charged with the crimes of terrorism because they have made a commitment to stand for the rule of law, democracy, and fundamental rights. <br /><br />The lawyers of Pakistan need the moral support of lawyers around the world.<br /><br /><strong>To the Lawyers of the World...</strong><br /><br />The lawyers of the world must support this struggle against a lawless dictator and express solidarity with the lawyers of Pakistan. <br /><br />Global solidarity among lawyers will forge effective resistance to a dictator in Pakistan who has revoked all constraints of law to gratify his infatuation with power. <br /><br />Global solidarity among lawyers is needed because dictators can rise in any nation. No legal text furnishes security against power addicts who subvert even the noblest constitution to maximize their willfulness. <br /><br />When the lawyers and judges of the world are fearless and determined to uphold the rule of law, the tide of tyranny can be abated. The power of law lies in the lawyer&#39;s commitment to subvert injustice. Lawyers are the guardians of the law. <br /><br />Global solidarity among lawyers will show to the world that the profession of law anywhere and everywhere stands for the rights of the people, all the peoples, and a right diminished anywhere is a right diminished everywhere. A tyrant tolerated in any nation pollutes the whole world as lawlessness spreads across borders. <br /><br />Let the lawyers of the world get together in big cities and in small towns. Let them assemble peacefully, exercise free speech, and pass resolutions to condemn the mistreatment of lawyers in Pakistan. <br /><br />Let the lawyers of the world speak against the suspension of fundamental rights in Pakistan. Let them demand that the Justices of Pakistan Supreme Court be freed from detention so that they can continue their charge of maintaining the rule of law. Let the lawyers of the world petition their leaders to put pressure on the Pakistani dictator to restore the constitution. <br /><br />If the lawyers of the world do nothing to support the lawyers&#39; resistance in Pakistan, tyranny will be entrenched.<br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan grew up in Pakistan and is a law graduate of Punjab University, Lahore.

		<title>Pakistan: Mock Trials, Kangaroo Courts and Court Jesters</title>

Although it is no laughing matter, the absurdity of the pretend Supreme Court bench's first proclamation should bring a hint of a smile to the faces of the lawyers presently behind bars for protesting against the imposition of Martial Law in the country and ought not to be taken very seriously by the media which is now under siege. <br /><br />In the immediate aftermath of the declaration of emergency and the simultaneous suspension of the constitution, a seven-member bench of the Supreme Court issued an interim order (the "Order") invalidating the unconstitutional actions of General Parvez Musharraf. The Order was passed pursuant to an application by Aitzaz Ahsan, the most prominent leader of the lawyers' rebellion earlier this year supporting the reinstatement of Chief Justice Chaudhry. The Order prospectively nullified the removal of any member of the superior judiciary from office and any judicial appointments that would take place pursuant to the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO). In short, constitutionally, the composition of the Supreme Court and the High Courts stands exactly as it was before the Martial Law. <br /><br />Disregarding the Supreme Court's Order, the General has attempted to reconstitute the superior courts by forcing some of the judges to take an oath under the PCO. Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar was administered an oath of allegiance under the PCO by the military dictator himself and is now the pretend-CJ of Pakistan. His first action after taking the oath of an office he does not hold, was to deny that the Order invalidating the PCO was ever passed by the seven-member bench of the real Supreme Court.<br /><br />The military regime has put tremendous pressure on some Supreme Court judges to follow the lead of Justice Dogar. However, thus far only three other justices have complied. In the face of such defiance from the Supreme Court judges, the regime has now been forced to find four other gentlemen who may act out the roles of Supreme Court judges. On Tuesday, the Mock Supreme Court met in an empty building on Constitution Avenue and reversed the Order which supposedly did not exist! This play is almost too farcical to be characterized as a tragedy.<br /><br />Ironically, one of the grounds on which the Mock Court has declared the Order of the Supreme Court to be invalid is that the said Order was passed without giving the government's lawyers an audience. Don't be surprised when the same Mock Court decides moot cases in favor of the regime and validates General Musharraf's occupation of the Presidential office in some direct or indirect way in the lonesome company of the government's lawyers. The overwhelming majority of lawyers in Pakistan do not see any humor in this and are determined to boycott this puppet show.<br /><br /><br /><em>Moeen Cheema is an Assistant Professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/moeencheema.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<title>Pakistan: Rights in the Absence of Law?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.lums.edu.pk/schools%20%26%20Programs/art_school/ba-llb/faculty_details/sadaf_aziz.asp">Sadaf Aziz</a> of the Lahore University of Management Sciences Faculty of Law in Lahore, Pakistan, says that the government's use of plainclothes thugs to brutally suppress dissent and protest in the present &quot;emergency&quot; makes it clear that Pakistan&#39;s citizens have been divested of basic rights to the point where they have no obligation to abide &quot;rules&quot; decreed by power....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/pakistanflaglong.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>&quot;H</strong></font>uman rights are most often upheld or flouted in the police-station&quot;. This is a truism that merits further investigation. Having participated in several of protests held at the Lahore High Court in the last year, where tear gas canisters were hurled into small semi-enclosed spaces and lawyers beaten at the gates and more recently within the premises themselves, I have thought often of this line. I have paraphrased it from an article written by the legal philosopher Costas Douzinas, where it is situated within a thesis suggesting that certain historical and material contingencies much be acknowledged so as to understand rights as not simply inhering by virtue of our being humans as such, but rather that rights need to be articulated with reference to the actual political structures that govern us. <br /><br />Now there is a temptation here to slip into an infinite relativism expressed in the statement that &quot;some societies respect 'so-called' human rights and others don't&quot;. In other words, we have rights when the powers that be decree that we should have them. To guard against this slippage, we have on the other side a belief that everyone, everywhere, at all times, is bestowed with rights. However, even this absolutism fails because sufficient empirical evidence can always be excavated to suggest that at the least, a self-understanding of rights is a precondition for asserting their existence. Thus, if we look more clearly at what rights are we see that they are an array of immunities and liberties which are vested primarily in individual subjects as protected spheres of action that superior powers cannot impinge without consequence. <br /><br />It becomes imperative to acknowledge the centrality of the state for defining what rights are. The state that does not know us individually - and which most of us never access other than at its lowest levels - is a mammoth of organizational strength.<br /><br />Given the managerial prerogative of defining and organizing populations and deploying productive potentiality towards determinate ends, the state has come to command a coercive apparatus that is most raw in its representation as military and police might. All of our fundamental rights mean particular things in reference to the power that the police force is accorded in exercising state objectives. While the correlative relation is clear in regards to some of the fundamental rights, such as the entitlement to due process according to law in cases of arrest and detention such as in Article 10 of Pakistan&#39;s currently suspended constitution, the rights to speech, assembly and privacy are also in part immunities against coercive action by these organs of the state. <br /><br />The conditions of a government's right to rule have to be broader than its capacity only to wield and control these institutions of force and coercion. The daily content of our lives is moulded in reference to guidelines and strictures that the state imposes but which we have internalized and which guide our behavior. In other words, those who paid taxes in the pre-martial law period will probably continue to do so now. Correspondingly, we will abide by rules for civil and commercial transactions, registration of births and marriages and not drive on the wrong side of the road because they are standards that we agree are desirable as social control mechanisms. We do them in consideration of the larger social totality and as contributions to the management of the state. <br /><br />The government that provides managerial direction in the service of the state relies upon these acts of voluntary compliance. Where such a government is non-representative, non-accountable, we as residents of such a state have no say in deciding where the aggregate aims of government policy are directed. Particularly when considerations and reasons which direct government policy cease to be stated and are kept from public purview, compliance becomes severed from its rational basis and the government has to rely on the use of overt force to maintain its prerogative. <br /><br />Of course we are used to such scenarios and the population of the nation has silently abided the recourse to force in establishing the 'writ' of the current government through such means in Balochistan and in the North. The notion that the legitimate use of force needs to be tempered by rights guarantees and proportionate to governmental objectives has not gained sufficient support amongst the general populace to pressure the government to change its course in those instances. Can we complain now that the Musharraf regime is employing similar tactics against those groups who are opposing current governmental actions to circumvent the law? Knowledge of our own hypocrisy should only bolster the claim that rights, once enunciated, have to be built upon and their content guarded against incursions because it is only in their constant restatement that an ever-broadening inclusion of the interests of a diverse populace can be maintained. <br /><br />The sheer repugnance that memories of the past week awaken should disturb the last vestige of a mutuality of relations between this government and private citizens. We should all rest assured that our relation to the police is no longer what it was before fear of reprisal became the only operative principle dictating compliance with official dictate. It is more than a little ironic that the exemplary adherents of law, lawyers, are the representative group for society in this face-off with the government. Clearly the lawyers are aware that a fundamental condition of their compact with the government has been altered or challenged. <br /><br />On the other hand, the formal description of roles within a constitutional governance regime entails that the police are the guardians of the order that is mandated by sovereign authority in the first place. For them to be considered to be legitimately so is to recognize them as having validation of a higher form than simply their names appearing on a payroll ledger. They are the police and not a mercenary army for reasons that are embodied in the notion of direct rule in the name of a general populace.<br /><br />When our interactions with the police are guided by the acknowledgment that it is only their efficacy in punishing us or in holding us hostage then the notion of legitimate force has lost its grounding. The immediate conditions of this failure are represented in this government's use of plainclothes thugs to brutally suppress dissent and protest. We first saw these men in white shalwar kameezes encircling protesters who had gathered outside the office of the Chief Election Commissioner on September 29th of this year. In combination with the uniformed police officers they assaulted those demonstrators in a brutal and shocking manner. The scenes of four, five or six of them throwing punches and kicking private citizens, young and elderly alike have been, to my knowledge, misconstrued by some foreign news channels as being indicative of 'mayhem' on the streets of Pakistan. However, to all in the country it is clear that the perpetrators of violence are receiving their instructions from the one unitary chain of command that wishes to only hear
 its own voice. <br /><br />When these men without name tags and discernible identities are given instructions to roam campuses, enter courthouses and spread fear, then it is clear that we have been divested of the basic rights that are necessitated wherever a government is constituted in the name of the state. Robbed even of the ability to name our tormentors when the actions of the police meld with the actions of these plainclothesmen, it is time to acknowledge that the imbalance has been tipped too far on one side for any of us to abide 'rules' decreed. <br /><br />I do trust, however, that there will be a return to a livable order, one which will provide space to discuss the organizational forms for continued collective living. A constitutional question that necessarily needs to be debated then is whether emergency action, however circumscribed by the enumeration of necessary conditions and the need for legislative assent, can ever be invoked in a manner that leaves us nakedly subject to police force. In spite of the fact that this is not by any means a constitutionally mandated emergency, I believe that public debate and perhaps judicial resolve is necessary to ensure that in the future such real rights can always be invoked, even if in the guise of an 'emergency constitution'. <br /><br /><br /><em>Sadaf Aziz is a professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/pakistanemergencyopeds.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

As opposed to this, a martial law proclamation is an extra-constitutional measure taken by the military to usurp power from an elected government. The emergency proclamation of November 3rd in Pakistan is effectively an act imposing martial law in the country as it was issued by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS). <br /><br />The ticker tape of news running alongside the stultifying discussions about the necessity of emergency action on the one channel (state-owned) that was allowed to function on this 'black Saturday', carried the news of the COAS's action in immediate succession to the promise that the President of Pakistan would be addressing the nation later on in the evening. Musharraf, to revive a seemingly incontestable issue in wake of the martial law order, occupies both roles himself. While he would reveal sure traits of megalomania later on in his broadcast address to the nation, it was uncanny that the issue of his occupying these roles simultaneously, an issue which the Supreme Court has been wrangling over for the last month, would be avowed with such candor. I was tempted to look up the diagnostic criteria for dissociative personality disorder at the time. <br /><br />For those who have argued that Musharraf's occupancy of the dual roles of civilian President and COAS are inconsequential, that concessions need to be made on the path to democratization in this country, there is a need for them to be convinced otherwise. In his address to the nation laying out the conditions which necessitated the emergency, it was his oft-repeated claim that he could not sit idly while members of the army, police and bureaucracy were being made subject to the humiliation of being summoned to court, directed to abide by laws framed as checks on executive abuse of authority and in a few cases, temporarily suspended through successful conviction on the basis of such laws. Whereas one would think that judicial review of such a sort would signal successful governmental functioning, the fact that this was the point which propelled the man to tears is telling. It was particularly at this moment of Musharraf's lament that it was resoundingly clear that the army man, despite all his pretences at enlightenment and benevolence, could never think as a civilian ruler is required. <br /><br />The army functions through the mechanism of direct order and presumed compliance. It also rewards those who obey orders efficiently and well. As the well-developed jurisprudence around the international law concept of command responsibility for instances of war crimes makes certain, the actions of subordinate soldiers and officers are oftentimes presumed to be mechanical applications of higher orders. Egregious violations of human rights standards and laws of war suggest knowledge and direction at the highest levels. The presumption rests on the empirical evidence presented by the hierarchical organization of army units, where action is directed through a chain of command, internally policed to ensure compliance. Additionally, the individual capacity of the soldier is limited to questions of maneuver, limited at the outset by the need to achieve team objectives. <br /><br />In a civilian-led government all tactical decisions involving the army are undertaken through a joint consultative process, limited not only to the executive branch but often necessitating legislative action to enable military maneuver. Where the army and the civilian government are melded with only minimal dissonance, as in Pakistan, the chain of command remains unitary from beginning to end. Musharraf is now rewarding the loyalty and obedience of his higher subordinates in both military and civilian dress. The problem that underlies all this is that we, members of what is somewhat spuriously termed civil society, are understood from position of the high command to be as divested of capacity as the lowest ranking soldier. We are asked repeatedly to take them on their word that a better future is promised if only we'll point and shoot with minimal reflection of who the moving target might be. In this case, we ourselves are surely the targets. <br /><br />On Monday, I and several friends and colleagues joined the lawyers who had turned out to protest the criminal orders of the COAS at the Lahore High Court and were witness to the General's personal vendetta being cruelly acted out against this brave professional fraternity. Standing out somewhat for not wearing the black and white uniform of lawyers, we were repeatedly asked by media persons about our reasons for protesting. While I find this a vexing question, I would nonetheless give a standard answer listing my grievances as against martial rule and the suspension of fundamental rights. One journalist responded that the government was only invoking a constitutional emergency provision. I responded at the time that they can call it 'a walk in the park' for all I cared. If one encounters a shower of bullets and batons whilst strolling in the park then the park is actually a battlefield. <br /><br />As I alluded somewhat above, a debate has been raging in the pages of English language papers in Pakistan as to the relative desirability of a 'transitionist' v. 'transformationist' approach to freeing the government from a veritable military monopoly of control. The former camp are incrementalists who caution that 'shock transformations' have been shown to harden and prolong periods of authoritarian governance and that power sharing agreements are a necessary stage in changeovers to civilian rule. The latter however have clung to an ethical legal standard emphasizing the constitutional illegitimacy of Musharraf's hold on power and the perversions it engenders. The fact that Benazir Bhutto, the US-ordained partner of such a power sharing agreement has reacted only balefully, if at all, to the discreditable act of annulling the judiciary in this country is proof of such perversion. It was completely foreseeable and expected that the judges of the Supreme Court would have soon given a verdict against the National Reconciliation Ordinance, the executive act granting blanket amnesty against criminal and corruption charges filed against her and other politicians. In an odd twist then, such transitions can turn army men into mercenaries but nowhere does the question get answered of how the army can deal without censure when they themselves encounter reflective and oppositional citizens and not soldiers in the country they rule. <br /><br /><br /><em>Sadaf Aziz is a professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.smu.edu.sg/faculty/law/shubhankard.asp">Shubhankar Dam</a> of the Singapore Management University School of Law says that in pressing Pakistan&#39;s Supreme Court in the direction of greater activism, Pakistan&#39;s lawyers embraced a problematic strategy that unintentionally helped to provoke General Pervez Musharraf&#39;s recent declaration of emergency rule with all its dire consequences...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/shubhankardam.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>&quot;I</strong></font> was too cowardly,&quot; Phillip Pirrip, the protagonist in <em>Great Expectations</em>, wrote, &quot;to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong.&quot; In the fluid political landscape of Pakistan, Pirrip's remorse about rectitude and courage is more relevant than ever before. <br /><br />More than five decades ago, the Pakistan judiciary's cowardice, many people said, paved the way for military regimes (vide the <em>Tamizuddin</em> decision). By a curious turn of fate, General Musharraf now blames the judiciary's "courage" for thrusting Emergency on the people of Pakistan. In his speech to the nation explaining the imposition of Emergency, General Musharraf held the Supreme Court (SC) largely responsible for the current state of affairs.<br /><br />So what precisely were the charges against the SC? General Musharraf made three points: (a) some members of the judiciary, he said, were "working at cross purposes with the executive and legislature in the fight against terrorism" (b) secondly, that the judiciary was "constantly interfering in executive functions," and finally (c) that some members of the judiciary were routinely "humiliating government officials during court proceedings." <br /><br />A closer look at the activities of the SC in the last six months or so suggests that the Court was broadly dealing with two different kinds of matter. On one hand, there were the "big ticket" items: reinstatement of the (former) Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), the Nawaz Sharif petition, eligibility of the General to contest (I) and the still pending constitutionality of the NRO. Given the stakes, "big ticket" items necessarily raise a lot of heat and dust and draw wide attention. More importantly, such items often have far-reaching consequences for the polity. <br /><br />On the other hand, there were "micro matters" that involved a great deal of close monitoring of issues on the ground, issues that affect the lives of everyday people. Some examples of the "micro matters" include suo moto petitions concerning price rise, contempt petitions against police officials for their violence against lawyers and journalists, petitions concerning the administration of Lal Masjid, petitions concerning the rights of missing persons, petitions concerning the investigations into the recent suicide attack and so on. <br /><br />Note that almost all of the General's allegations against "some members" of the SC were only about the micro matters. The reality, however, may be quite to the contrary. It may not be too outlandish to suggest that the General's concerns were really about the big ticket items. After all, any decision making him ineligible to concurrently hold the post of the President would have severely cornered him. <br /><br />For the SC, both the big ticket items and the micro matters raised different kinds of concerns. The big ticket items, in particular, created a peculiar paradox. Lawyers, journalists and commentators (almost across the board) wanted the SC to decide the matters only on the basis of law. But they also wanted the Court to decide those matters their way. <br /><br />In other words, for the lawyers, the right answer was what they said it was. How else does one explain the bizarre public demonstrations by the lawyers and journalists against the SC for its refusal to entertain a petition against the eligibility of General Musharraf? The same lawyers and journalists who congratulated the SC for reinstating the (former) CJP turned against it when it rejected a petition against General Musharraf. <br /><br />The micro matters, on the other hand, raised different concerns. Some of these micro matters were of the Court's own making but many were not. It needed the SC to confront government officials on a regular basis, both for their illegalities and inefficiencies. But for the confrontation to produce results, it also needed officials who were willing to abide by judicial decisions. Could that be achieved? Given the history of five decades, may be the SC overestimated the strength of its judgment in the face of a belligerent administration. <br /><br />So what was the net effect of both processes? In brief, both the big ticket items and the micro matters put a disproportionate burden on the SC. Lawyers and journalists expected too much from the Court in too little time. Like the administration, they too were belligerent. And boxed from both sides, the SC, not surprisingly, found itself in a tight corner. Consequently, the resolute defiance of the (former) CJP that triggered a process of democratic revival, in less than six months, lies in ruins. <br /><br />Somewhat surprisingly, a respected national daily editorial from Pakistan expressed sympathy for the General: "There is no doubt that there was 'judicial activism' in the country not normally seen in third world states where institutions often malfunction." It went on: "The apex court underwent a radical and extremist transformation that, as it turns out, has harmed rather than helped Pakistan &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; A <em>suo motu</em> judiciary went after the 'missing' people cases with a vengeance, regardless of the nature of the terrorist charges against them, threatening the civil servants with punishments, and indirectly causing them to lose initiative in the pursuit of their duties." To hold the judiciary responsible for the Emergency, as the editorial impliedly did, is to be highly irresponsible. <br /><br />This Emergency is the direct result of the Pakistani intelligentsia's self-defeating obsession with "right" and "wrong" answers. In insisting on their brand of right answers, the lawyers - with borrowed enthusiasm from journalists and commentators -have created a situation that further distances them from their ultimate end. Their intentions may have been noble; its consequences are hardly so. <br /><br />In conclusion, two points are worth highlighting. First, the events of the last six months must make one wonder about the viability of achieving democracy through "judicial politics." Any judicial process has structural limitations: it can aid, may be even abet but cannot (in the long run) sustain democratic institutions by itself. Secondly, constitutional litigation is like war: victory depends on a good strategy; not "right" and "wrong" answers. The challenge for Pakistan is to figure out a war strategy that will deliver its "Great Expectations." <br /><br /><br /><em>Shubhankar Dam is a law professor at the Singapore Management University School of Law working mainly in the area of South Asian law and politics.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.ubalt.edu/template.cfm?page=678">Byron L. Warnken </a> of the University of Baltimore School of Law says that the US State Department&#39;s reported grant of &quot;immunity&quot; to Blackwater security guards making sworn statements concerning the killings of 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad in September means much less than many might suppose...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/byronwarnken.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>re Blackwater personnel receiving immunity for killing 17 Iraqi civilians in September in what the Iraqi government is calling "deliberate murder"? ABC News obtained sworn statements by guards which include "use and derivative use immunity" language. Some reports have also included the word "Garrity." State Departments officials claim that no State Department higher up authorized -- nor would have had the authority to authorize -- immunity. Certainly, the Justice Department would have such authority. In any event, it seems that immunity has been granted. The $64 question is what does "immunity" mean in this case?<br /><br /><strong>Fifth Amendment Privilege Against Compelled Self-Incrimination</strong><br /><br />An understanding of "immunity" and "Garrity" begins with an understanding of the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. The Fifth Amendment entitles each of us to refuse to answer questions posed by the government if the answer may tend to incriminate us in a future criminal proceeding, and it entitles each of us to refuse to testify. If the government obtains a statement in violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege, that statement is inadmissible in a criminal trial. <br /><br />The Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination does not apply &#8212; and may be taken away by the government -- if the government provides an alternative protection that is just as broad as the Fifth Amendment privilege. The only thing that broad is immunity. The question is how much immunity must be granted to permit the government to take away the Fifth Amendment privilege. <br /><br /><strong>"Use and Derivative Use" Immunity</strong><br /><br />The term "immunity" refers to either "use and derivative use" immunity or "transactional" immunity. In <em>Kastigar v. United States</em>, 406 U.S. 441 (1972), the Supreme Court held that "use and derivative use" immunity is broad enough to "replace" the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Since 1972, when the government grants "immunity," it usually grants only the more narrow "use and derivative use" immunity and not the broader "transactional" immunity. <br /><br />When the government provides "use and derivative use" immunity, the government may still criminally prosecute the immunized individual. However, when so doing, the government may not use that individual's immunized statement and may not use any evidence that derives from that statement. If the government grants "use and derivative use" immunity, and then prosecutes, the prosecution has the burden to prove that its evidence was derived from a legitimate source wholly independent of the immunized testimony. On rare occasions, the government provides "transactional" immunity, which means that the government has agreed not to prosecute the immunized individual for any crimes arising from that "transaction." This case apparently does not involve "transactional immunity," meaning that the government may still prosecute criminally, despite immunity. <br /><br />Immunity is not typically negotiated. Instead, the government imposes immunity on an individual, and the immunized individual is compelled to testify. If an individual is granted immunity, yet refuses to testify, the individual may be held in contempt of court and incarcerated until he or she "purges the contempt" by testifying. <br /><br />When the government grants immunity, it is usually for one of two reasons. (1) The government already has enough evidence to convict, has no fear of the immunized individual "getting away," and compels testimony to obtain information to convict others. (2) The government does not have enough evidence to convict, but is willing to take the risk of having the immunized individual "get away" in order to "catch a bigger fish."<br /><br /><strong>Garrity Immunity</strong><br /><br />The media has thrown around the word "Garrity." This confirms that any immunity granted in this case is "use and derivative use" immunity and not "transactional" immunity." The Garrity issue is presented when the one granting immunity is the "boss" of the one being immunized. For example, a police officer, government employee, or government contractor, such as Blackwater, is suspected of criminal conduct. <br /><br />Prior to 1967, the government's position was that if you want to be a police officer, government employee, or government contractor, you must be willing to "leave your constitutional rights at the door." As such, the government would require these individuals to waive their Fifth Amendment privilege as a condition of being a police officer, government employee, or government contractor. <br /><br />The police cannot come to you or me and say, "if you do not tell us what we want to know, we will get you fired." However, historically, when the suspect was a police officer, government employee, or government contractor, the investigators could make the suspect choose between exercising constitutional rights and keeping a job or a contract.<br /><br />The Supreme Court addressed this situation in a series of cases, starting with <em>Garrity v. New Jersey</em>, 385 U.S. 493 (1967). In <em>Garrity</em>, police officers were interrogated about a conspiracy to obstruct traffic laws. Threatened with termination if they invoked the Fifth Amendment, the officers gave incriminating statements and were successfully prosecuted. The Supreme Court held that the officers' statements were involuntary because they were forced to choose between exercising their Fifth Amendment privilege and remaining a police officer. <br /><br />Other Supreme Court cases followed Garrity. In <em>Gardner v. Broderick</em>, 392 U.S. 273 (1968), the Court held that it was unconstitutional to terminate a police officer for refusing to answer questions before a grand jury. In <em>Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass'n v. Commissioner of Sanitation</em>, 392 U.S. 280 (1968), the Court held that it was unconstitutional to terminate government employees for refusing to waive their Fifth Amendment privilege. In <em>Lefkowitz v. Turley</em>, 414 U.S. 70 (1973), the Court held that government contractors could not be terminated or deemed ineligible because they asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege. <br /><br />In sum, the line of cases that begin with <em>Garrity</em> hold that the Fifth Amendment privilege of police officers, government employees, and government contractors is no bigger and no smaller than the Fifth Amendment privilege of the rest of us. Using these cases, the Supreme Court attempted to balance the Fifth Amendment privilege of these individuals with the government's right, power, and duty to require accountability, particularly in the area of public safety. This line of cases permits the government to have it either way, at its option, but it does not permit the government to have it both ways. By that I mean that the government may compel the statement and use it to terminate employment or a contract, but not also use it to prosecute.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if the government does not impose immunity, the police officer, government employee, or government contractor may invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination, just like you and I can, including not testifying and not being terminated from employment or contract. <br /><br />Alternatively, this also means
that if the government does impose use and derivative use immunity, it has afforded the full measure of the Fifth Amendment, and the immunized person has no Fifth Amendment privilege "left to spend." As such, the government may compel answers to questions narrowly tailored to the job or the contract, and may terminate based on either (1) the failure to answer narrowly tailored questions, or (2) the content of the answers, if sanctionable. <br /><br />In the Blackwater case, the government's primary goal is probably to "clean up this mess," to establish rules to minimize the chance of its recurrence, and to terminate any "bad apples." Thus, the government may grant "Garrity use and derivative use immunity," may ask questions narrowly tailored to the job or the contract, and may "terminate" bad individuals based on the content of those compelled answers. The government would be deciding that the value, to the government, of possible termination outweighs the value, to the government, of a successful criminal prosecution. Of course, even when granting use and derivative use immunity, the government may still prosecute, provided it does not use any immunized statements or any evidence derived therefrom. <br /><br />Thus, once Blackwater personnel have been granted "use and derivative use" immunity, they may be compelled to answer questions, narrowly tailored to their employment or contract, without violating the Fifth Amendment. In such scenario, the Blackwater personnel may be prosecuted criminally, but their immunized statements and evidence derived therefrom may not be used in the criminal proceeding, and only "independent" evidence may be sued. Of course, their statements may be used to have Blackwater personnel terminated and to have Blackwater contracts terminated, depending on the content of the immunized statements. <br /><br />In sum, "Garrity protection" puts police officers, government employees, and government contractors in the same position as ordinary citizens accused of a crime, i.e., their compelled statements may not be used in a criminal proceeding, as well as evidence derived therefrom. However, unlike ordinary citizens, when police officers, government employees, and government contractors are granted immunity under <em>Garrity</em>, their compelled statements may form the basis to terminate their employment or contract if (1) they refuse to provide answers when compelled, or (2) they provide answers that demonstrate sanctionable conduct. Moreover, there is no right to perjury. Thus, they may also be prosecuted criminally, as well as terminated, if they commit perjury in the answers they provide. <br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong><br /><br />On first blush, a non-lawyer might think that Blackwater personnel got a "free pass." After all, they got "immunity"! In fact, it probably means just the opposite. Immunity is a good tool for the government. First, it likely means that all of the Blackwater personnel will be terminated. Second, it likely means that Blackwater will lose some or all of its contracts in Iraq. Third, it may mean that the more culpable of the Blackwater personnel are prosecuted criminally.<br /><br /><br /><em>Byron L. Warnken has been a law professor for 31 years at the University of Baltimore School of Law. He has argued in the Supreme Court, testified in Congress on the Garrity issue, and represented police officers in 32 different agencies.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.williamgeorgeross.com/">William G. Ross</a> of Cumberland School of Law, Samford University says despite US attorney general nominee Michael Mukasey&#39;s success in winning approval in the Senate Judiciary Committee, the full Senate should take all the time it needs to consider his nomination even though the next attorney general is unlikely to serve past the end of Bush's term in little more than a year...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/williamrossnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he controversial nomination of Michael B. Mukasey to serve as attorney general has highlighted the Senate's important role in the confirmation of cabinet officials, particularly the attorney general. In its intense scrutiny of Mukasey's nomination, the Senate Judiciary Committee has properly exercised a constitutional duty that the Senate frequently has discharged in hearings on attorney general nominations but all too often has abnegated in its rush to confirm the nominations of other cabinet officials. The full Senate should subject the Mukasey nomination to the same careful scrutiny.<br /><br />A nomination that was expected to sail through the Senate has floundered over worries that Mukasey is too amenable to questionable tactics that the Bush Administration has used in fighting terrorism. Mukasey's refusal to unequivocally declare that so-called "waterboarding" of terrorist suspects constitutes illegal torture and his statements about the president's power to authorize warrantless wiretapping have generated particular concern and were major factors in the decisions of eight of the committee's nineteen members to oppose the nomination Tuesday. These senators may fear that Mukasey's opinions on these issues raise broader questions about Mukasey's willingness to oppose what many senators regard as growing abuses of presidential power.<br /><br />Critics of the Mukasey hearings, including President Bush, have faulted the Senate for its protracted deliberations. Senator Orrin G. Hatch complained last week, for example, about a "crazy, topsy turvy confirmation process" that had consigned Mukasey to "forty days in the partisan wilderness." <br /><br />The Senate should take all the time it needs to consider this nomination, however, even though the next attorney general is unlikely to serve past the end of Bush's term in little more than a year. Any attorney general is too important to receive cursory review during the confirmation process and the next attorney general should receive particularly intense scrutiny. In addition to grappling with constitutionally sensitive issues involving the exercise of executive power during wartime, the new attorney general must restore confidence to the Justice Department in the wake of allegations that U.S. Attorneys have been fired for partisan reasons.<br /><br />While there is general agreement that the Senate normally should accord some deference to the President's choice &#8212; as Alexander Hamilton observed in <em>The Federalist</em>, one president can select an executive officer more expeditiously than can one hundred senators &#8212; members of the Senate often have emphasized that they are significant partners in the selection process. Although a cabinet member is an executive official in whom the President must have trust because the official works closely with the President to execute presidential programs, the Senate must ensure that the cabinet official also will protect the nation's best interests. <br /><br />Numerous senators, commentators, public interest groups and scholars have correctly argued that the Senate has a responsibility to subject attorney general nominations to especially close scrutiny. As Senator Charles Percy explained during the controversy over President Carter's nomination of Griffin Bell in 1977, "the Attorney General requires more stringent standards than any other Cabinet post." Similarly, the president of Common Cause aptly remarked during the protracted hearings on Edwin Meese in 1984 that "the appointment of an Attorney General is too important to grant confirmation out of superficial examination of party regularity or upon the ground that the President is entitled to his choice." <br /><br />The starting point for senatorial scrutiny, professional competence, has been no problem in the Mukasey deliberations because the nominee, a former federal judge, has sterling credentials. The Senate also has a duty to make certain that the nominee is morally and ethically fit to serve as the nation's chief law enforcement officer. Concern about ethics have arisen in connection with the nominations of many attorneys general, particularly Meese in 1984, Richard Kleindienst in 1972, and Charles Warren, whom the Senate twice rejected, in 1925. In contrast, Mukasey's personal integrity appears to be beyond reproach.<br /><br />Since the attorney general is the official most responsible for the enforcement of civil rights laws, many senators and commentators have correctly argued that it is also essential that an attorney general take seriously her role as a guardian of the rights of the poor and the dispossessed, racial and political minorities, and other persons who need the special protection of the laws because they may lack effective means of influencing the executive and legislative processes. Nothing in Mukasey's background or his testimony appears have created concern about his commitment to racial and gender equality or his concern for the problems of the poor. <br /><br />In considering an attorney general nomination, the Senate also should consider whether the nominee is sufficiently independent from the president, and this is the issue that has haunted the Mukasey hearings. Scrutiny of a potential attorney general's independence is critically important because it is imperative that the nation's chief executive law enforcement officer should stand above the partisan politics of the administration in which she serves and administer justice fairly, even-handedly, and in a manner that will assure the nation and the world that the United States remains dedicated to the rule of law. <br /><br />As Senator Benjamin L. Cardin told Mukasey during the Judiciary Committee hearings last month, "as Attorney General of the United States you are the people's lawyer, not the lawyer for the President or a political official in the White House." Similarly, Senator Patrick J. Leahy aptly reminded Mukasey that "there is good reason why the rule of law requires that we have an Attorney General and not merely a Secretary of the Department of Justice. This is a different kind of Cabinet position, distinct from all the others, and it requires greater independence." <br /><br />Moreover, the professional independence of an attorney general is particularly important because the Justice Department is more closely connected than are other executive departments with both the legislative and judicial branches of government. By profoundly influencing the process by which federal statutes are enforced, the Justice Department necessarily interacts closely with Congress. As Senator Leahy stated during the Meese hearings, "although the Supreme Court has the last word on what our laws mean, the Attorney General often has the first word, and the first word, so many times, determines the last word...The success of so much of the work of Congress always depends on who is sitting at the head of the Justice Department."<br /><br />In considering whether a nominee is sufficiently independent from the president, senators may properly consider whether the nominee's ideological views are compatible with those of individual senators. As Professor Calvin MacKenzie has pointed out, the confirmation process "affords the Senate an opportunity to carry on...its persistent struggle with the executive branch to shape th
e contours of public policy." <br /><br />Although the President has a mandate from the electorate to shape public policy through his cabinet officers, senators likewise have a mandate from their constituents to ensure that cabinet members do not frustrate the policy preferences of the voters who elected the senators or thwart the legislation that Congress has enacted. As Dr. Louis Fisher has explained, "Department heads and their assistants are not merely staff support for the President. They are called upon to administer programs that Congress has enacted into law. A lack of interest by an administrator or overt hostility to a legislative program can eviscerate the policies that Congress has taken pains to announce as national goals." <br /><br />Although many critics of Mukasey fear that he would lack the independence needed in an attorney general, particularly in an administration that demands such stringent loyalty in its officials, Mukasey, unlike all too many previous attorneys general, does not have close personal ties to the president; during the twentieth century, attorneys general included three presidential campaign managers, a president's personal attorney, numerous presidential political advisors, and even a president's brother. Perhaps the failure of Bush's nomination of his personal aide Harriet Miers to the U.S. Supreme Court two years ago taught Bush the hazards of trying to elevate cronies to the very highest echelons of government, although neither of Bush's first two attorneys general were personal or political associates, either. <br /><br />To the extent, however, that Mukasey's testimony indicates a tendency to broadly construe questionable executive powers, many senators understandably are concerned about his ideological independence from the president and his willingness to distance himself even from from presidential policies with which he may disagree. <br /><br />The accretions of presidential powers over war and national security issues during the past six years naturally trouble many Americans, including Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives. Substantial numbers of Americans understandably fear that Congress has acquiesced too easily in the growth and exercise of these powers, and it is therefore natural that senators will take a long, hard, close look at an attorney general nominee who seems to support &#8212; or even expresses willingness to consider supporting &#8212; some of these presidential powers, policies, and practices. Even if senators believe that Mukasey is otherwise well qualified to serve as attorney general, these concerns alone are enough to justify the rejection of his nomination. <br /><br />The Senate is free to refuse to confirm a nomination for any reason. As Mukasey acknowledged during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, "you have the exclusive authority to vote me up or vote me down for any reason or no reason." <br /><br />Ultimately, senators must ask themselves whether they trust Mukasey to stand against any abuse of presidential power. As Senator Birch Bayh, Sr. aptly stated during the hearings on Bell three decades ago, "I do not know of any litmus test on which we can guarantee what kind of Attorney General...we get. We look at the facts. In the final analysis, it's the cut of the human being. It is the individual. It is the character of the person involved." Mukasey's reputation for high professional standards, fairness, and personal probity appear already to have helped win votes among judiciary committee members who had doubts about his views on presidential power, and such trust may ensure his confirmation.<br /><br />Although the Senate's probe of Mukasey's views on executive war powers have received widespread media coverage, Senate Judiciary Committee members also propounded oral and written questions to Mukasey on scores of other topics. These, too, are important and Mukasey's informed and thoughtful responses to these questions appear to have enhanced his support, even among senators who have qualms about his views on executive power. These questions and answers are particularly important because they have provided an opportunity for a rare dialogue between the legislative and executive branches on issues that also are closely connected with the judicial branch of government. Among other subjects, Senate Judiciary Committee members queried Mukasey about:<ul><li>prosecution of laws against racial discrimination, including employment discrimination;<br /><br /><li>antitrust enforcement, including monopolistic practices in agriculture and statutory immunity from antitrust laws;<br /><br /><li>enforcement of laws against illegal immigration;<br /><br /><li>protection of the rights of Native Americans, including coordination of law enforcement on tribal lands;<br /><br /><li>gun control, including the assault weapons ban and whether the Second Amendment applies to the states;<br /><br /><li>crime prevention, including federal financial assistance to state and local enforcement agencies;<br /><br /><li>use of foreign law and custom to help resolve American legal issues;<br /><br /><li>juvenile justice, including the transfer of youth to adult facilities and the treatment of mentally ill juveniles;<br /><br /><li>prison reform, including the prevention of sexual abuse of prisoners;<br /><br /><li>possession and sale of illicit drugs, including the disparity in penalties for possession of crack cocaine and powder cocaine;<br /><br /><li>expansion of protected groups in pending federal hate crimes legislation;<br /><br /><li>discrimination against gays in the Justice Department;<br /><br /><li>scope and enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act, including the definition of "disability" within the meaning of the Act and the Act's applicability to wounded military veterans;<br /><br /><li>scope and enforcement of anti-obscenity laws;<br /><br /><li>prevention of human trafficking.</ul>Whatever the outcome of the Senate's final vote on Mukasey, the Senate's robust consideration of Mukasey's nomination will help to ensure that the next attorney general enforces the nation's laws in a manner that is broadly consistent with the will of the voters who elect senators to offer advice in connection with Cabinet nominations and to offer &#8212; or withhold &#8212; consent.<br /><br /><br /><em>William G.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says General Pervez Musharraf&#39;s declaration of emergency in Pakistan has created a situation of lawlessness in the country that may actually prompt another military coup...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n November 3, Pakistan took its turn at playing the Dark Future &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a lawless game of alternate reality, a game in which the nation falls apart, the laws break down, and the players commit high crimes and misdemeanors to get ahead, to win. On this reckless day, Army Chief Pervez Musharraf, perhaps after receiving a signal from Washington D.C., proclaimed emergency throughout Pakistan and ordered that &quot;the constitution shall remain in abeyance.&quot; <br /><br />Article 232 of the Pakistan constitution allows the President to issue a Proclamation of Emergency under grave circumstances. The November Proclamation, however, has been issued by Pervez Musharraf as the Army Chief, and not as the President. This legal twist empowers the Army Chief to exercise more authority than a constitutional Proclamation of Emergency would otherwise allow. The constitution does not authorize an Army Chief to declare emergency. Nor does the constitution allow a wholesale termination of services of Supreme Court judges. On its very face, therefore, the November Proclamation is incompatible with the constitution. It is by all means an extra-constitutional coup. <br /><br /><strong>Disestablishment of the Judiciary</strong><br /><br />The coup specifically targets Pakistan&#39;s judiciary. The judiciary, which was making a successful transition toward independence, has been stopped in the tracks. The Proclamation offers twelve reasons for the suspension of the constitution. Six reasons lay blame on the judiciary, holding the judges responsible for releasing terrorists, working at cross purposes with the government, overstepping the limits of judicial authority, and placing judges beyond accountability. These charges against the Supreme Court, in the opinion of the nation&#39;s most respected lawyers, are exaggerated and erroneous.<br /><br />Judges throughout the country are divided over supporting the suspension of the constitution. Judges who depend on their jobs for supporting families are unable to defy the Proclamation. So far, however, only four out of the nineteen Supreme Court judges have taken the oath under the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO). A pro-military judge, under investigation for corruption, has been made the Chief Justice. Numerous judges of the four provincial high courts have also declined to take oath under the PCO. This unprecedented judicial resistance to the Proclamation will continue. <br /><br />The disestablishment of the judiciary will further deepen when lawyers boycott appearing before what they call &quot;traitor judges.&quot; The lawyers are unlikely to boycott lower courts where ordinary cases are litigated. They will continue to seek relief for political workers who are unlawfully arrested. Some lawyers will continue to expose the abuses of power even in high courts.<br /><br />A permanent harm to the judiciary may be spared if judges are united in their resolve to oppose the Proclamation. Even judges who have taken the oath under the PCO can play an important role in limiting the lawlessness that the Musharraf regime may commence to enforce its writ. <br /><br /><strong>Terrorism Unbounded</strong> <br /><br />Escalating terrorism is the other reason offered for suspending the constitution. The Proclamation highlights heinous terrorist activities, IED explosions, and suicide bombings that have bedeviled the government. These reasons are tendered to persuade Americans that a non-democratic regime in Pakistan is good for America. <br /><br />America understands that an unlawful government in Pakistan is a godsend for terrorists. Despite deceptive appearances of cooperation with the United States, Pakistani intelligence agencies team up with militants to inflict harm on American soldiers. A vast geographical area spanning through the four contiguous Muslim countries - Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan - furnishes militants unlimited breathing space and logistical support for planning and executing reprisals. Frustrated American forces may now be allowed to openly attack militants inside Pakistan. This course of action however will be imprudent. <br /><br />It is totally understandable, though morally discomforting, that the United States is using Pakistan for its own national benefit. No Kantian imperative dictates that American foreign policy must treat Pakistan as an end in itself and not a means. Still, wiser heads in Washington will refuse to destabilize Pakistan to win an elusive war on terrorism. Time is ripe for America to support democracy in Pakistan to win the hearts and minds of its population. Saving Musharraf is a liability that the United States cannot afford. <br /><br /><strong>Another Coup?</strong><br /><br />Meanwhile, Pakistan abounds with rumors and speculations that another military coup is imminent. In the past sixty years, Pakistani army chiefs have staged revolutions on the theory that the armed forces are highly disciplined in that no mutiny raises head in ranks and files once the army chief makes a decision to suspend the constitution. This theory may not work this time since Musharraf has become a pariah both outside and inside the armed forces. <br /><br />Outside the armed forces, Musharraf has no constitutional or political cover. The constitution has been effectively suspended. The Supreme Court has been effectively dissolved. The existing national and provincial assemblies would soon complete their terms and cease to exist. Ironically, though, a constitutional proclamation of emergency allows the extension of the term of the national assembly by a year. Musharraf may invoke this provision of the constitution to extend the life of the existing Parliament and postpone the general elections due in January 2008. These measures will not stabilize Pakistan. Lawyers, political parties, and the media are determined to challenge the continuation of the Musharraf regime. <br /><br />Things are worse inside the armed forces. Inside, Musharraf is viewed as a crass political operator. He is no longer a professional soldier. His uniform annoys the armed forces. It is no symbol of pride. It is a symptom of addiction to power. Furthermore, the armed forces resent ground realities. Soldiers have been placed in predicaments to kill innocent villagers. They surrender to the militants, saying brothers don&#39;t kill brothers. <br /><br />As world criticism mounts, lawyers boycott the courts, and confusion grips Islamabad, General Ashfaq Kiani, the designated army chief, will come under tremendous pressure to safeguard the honor of the armed forces and remove an ineffective addict from power. This coup may not be peaceful. <br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan grew up in Pakistan and is a law graduate of Punjab University, Lahore.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virginia Sloan [President, <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/index.cfm">The Constitution Project</a>]: &quot;Today, as I observed the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/supreme-court-hears-jury-selection-fda.php">oral arguments</a> in <u>Synder v. Louisiana</u> before the United States Supreme Court, I was struck by the fact that James Williams will almost certainly never face a judge, jury, or even a disciplinary panel for his malicious abuse of our criminal justice system. In 1996, Allen Snyder, an African-American man, was sentenced to death for the stabbing of his wife&#39;s male companion. After striking all African-Americans from the jury, Mr. Williams - the prosecutor in the case - urged the all-white jury to return a death sentence and not to let Snyder &quot;g[e]t away with it&quot; like O.J. Simpson did.<br /><br />In September, the Constitution Project &#8212; represented by former Solicitor General Seth Waxman - filed a <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/Snyder_v_Louisiana_SCOTUS_Merits.pdf">friend-of-the-court brief</a> on behalf of Mr. Snyder, concluding that this &quot;provocative and impermissible conduct was powerful evidence of the prosecutor&#39;s discriminatory intent to use his peremptory challenges to purge Mr. Snyder&#39;s capital jury of all African-Americans,&quot; in violation of the Supreme Court&#39;s 1986 ruling in <u>Batson v. Kentucky</u>.<br /><br />In 2006, the Constitution Project&#39;s bipartisan Death Penalty Committee, in &quot;<a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/MandatoryJusticeRevisited.pdf">Mandatory Justice: The Death Penalty Revisited</a>,&quot; urged courts to &quot;vigorously enforc[e] <u>Batson</u> ... [and] to ensure that members of all races are part of ... petit juries that decide guilt and punishment.&quot; The Committee went on to recommend that all &quot;jurisdictions that impose the death penalty should create mechanisms to help ensure that the death penalty is not imposed in a racially discriminatory manner.&quot;<br /><br />Prosecutorial misconduct and racial discrimination are a stain on the reputation of our criminal justice system. Mr. Snyder has - as do all defendants, no matter what their race - a constitutional right to fair treatment under the law. Mr. Williams was apparently not concerned by the fact that a life could be ended in part due to his spiteful manipulation of racial tensions in Louisiana. One can only hope that the Supreme Court is more troubled by this disregard of constitutional rights than he was.&quot;<br />

		<title>Denying habeas rights to Gitmo detainees undermines fundamental principles of democracy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.rutherford.org/About/AboutJWW.asp"><strong>John Whitehead</strong></a> [President, <a href="http://www.rutherford.org/">Rutherford Institute</a> and member, <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/libertyandsecurity/index.cfm?categoryId=3">Constitution Project Liberty and Security Committee</a>]: &quot;As oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court in <u>Boumediene v. Bush</u> concluded this afternoon, one could not help but think that it will prove to be one of the most important wartime cases in a post-9/11 America.<br /><br />The case centers on Lakhdar Boumediene, who was labeled an &quot;alien unlawful enemy combatant&quot; by President Bush and has been detained at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, along with several hundred other prisoners. Denied any habeas corpus rights, Boumediene has been imprisoned for the past five years without access to a court or meaningful communication with the outside world, including his family. And unless the Supreme Court intervenes, Boumediene and the other detainees could well remain in this state of limbo for the rest of their lives. <br /><br />As a nation of free people, it is in our best interests to ensure that such a thing does not happen. <br /><br />Americans have long adhered to the notion that a person is innocent until proven guilty. However, we cannot pick and choose when or to whom that principle should be applied. This is not to say that the detainees should be set free. Imprisonment is certainly appropriate and perhaps even necessary for those suspected of assisting terrorist organizations. However, imprisoning these individuals without providing them timely access to the courts goes against every principle we claim to stand for in the United States. After all, justice delayed is also justice denied.<br /><br />Earlier this year the Rutherford Institute joined with the <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">Constitution Project</a>, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>, and <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a> in organizing a <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/Amicus_Coalition_of_Non-Governmental_Organizations.pdf">friend-of-the-court brief</a> on behalf of Mr. Boumediene. This bipartisan group contended that &quot;[s]eparation of powers principles compel the conclusion that the habeas-stripping provision of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (&quot;MCA&quot;) is an unconstitutional exercise of Congressional power. The MCA attempts to prevent the Judiciary from carrying out its most basic and essential function&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;interpreting and applying the rule of law through the writ of habeas corpus.&quot;<br /><br />When we deny habeas corpus to the Guantanamo detainees, we risk more than just locking up individuals who might be innocent. We risk undermining the fundamental democratic principles that hold our government and its leaders in check.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alex Luchenitser [Senior Litigation Counsel,<br /><a href="http://www.au.org/site/PageServer">Americans United for Separation of Church and State</a>]: &quot;On December 3, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit<br />ruled that the State of Iowa has <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/federal-appeals-court-rules-state.php">violated the constitutional guarantee<br />of separation of church and state</a> by providing tax-funded aid to a<br />religious &quot;rehabilitation&quot; program operated in an Iowa prison. Inmates<br />in the program receive many special benefits that are not available to<br />other inmates, including better housing, expedited access to classes<br />required for parole, and greater contact with family members. Inmates<br />of other religions are effectively precluded from participating in the<br />program - a fundamentalist form of Christianity saturates the program,<br />and program personnel and materials have denigrated other faiths.<br /><br />The court&#39;s ruling is a major setback for the White House&#39;s Faith-Based<br />Initiative. The court held that public funds cannot be used to support<br />a program &quot;dominated by Bible study, Christian classes, religious<br />revivals, and church services.&quot; The decision reaffirms that government<br />bodies have an obligation to ensure that tax funds are not used for<br />religious activities. And the ruling makes clear that the government<br />may not channel public aid in a manner that makes the aid available only<br />to persons who hold certain religious beliefs.<br /><br />The ruling comes at a time when many states have been cutting funding<br />for secular treatment programming and instead turning to religion-based<br />options - often highly sectarian ones. The court&#39;s decision should put<br />the brakes on this alarming trend. Prison officials should ensure that<br />state-supported treatment programs provide instruction that is equally<br />appropriate for all inmates, and that religious rehabilitation is not<br />linked with any material benefits.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Danilo Reyes [<a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>]: &quot;There have been dozens of attempted coups in the modern history of the Philippines, but only one has succeeded: the February 1986 overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos. His regime and its constitutional foundations were toppled because even though the country&#39;s institutions were structurally intact, they were not credible to the vast numbers of people who came out onto the streets to demand change. <br /><br />By contrast the January 2001 ouster of Joseph Estrada, although depending upon popular support, did not challenge the constitutional order. The then-vice president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, was appointed in Estrada&#39;s stead in accordance with the 1987 law on succession. Although Estrada&#39;s camp up to now insists that he did not abandon or resign from his post, the Supreme Court overruled his claim to the presidency. Arroyo went on to win the 2004 elections and has a constitutional right to remain president, barring unforeseen eventualities, until 2010. <br /><br />Therefore, had the soldiers, politicians and others involved in the failed <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/philippines-officers-linked-to-2003.php">&#39;Peninsula Putsch&#39; of this November 29</a> had any chance of success, they would have thrown up enormous questions about constitutionality and the presidency of the Philippines. <br /><br />The attempt to seize government from a luxury hotel in downtown Manila had none of the elements of the removal of the presidents either in 1986 or 2001. There was no enormous public outcry or support for their actions. Nor were those who launched the attempt apparently interested in the use of legitimate constitutional means to attempt to have the president replaced. Rather, the idea of transitional government on which they seem to have placed their bets was for the chief justice to serve as an interim president. There is no provision in the 1987 Constitution for this apparently ill-considered and misguided approach to a change in power for the Philippines. <br /><br />Without either public support or adherence to constitutional norms, the November 29 coup attempt was doomed to failure. Future nascent coup leaders should tread more carefully, and learn from history. To succeed, either the law or the people must be on their side.&quot;<br />

		<title>UN death penalty moratorium a milestone in effort to eliminate capital punishment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Richard C. Dieter [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a>]: &quot;The overwhelming approval of the resolution for a <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/un-rights-committee-approves-death.php">global moratorium on executions</a> by the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly is an important milestone in the growing international effort to restrict and eventually eliminate capital punishment. Although the resolution is likely to be adopted by the General Assembly itself, it has no binding power on member states of the U.N. and no direct legal impact on the death penalty in the United States. Nevertheless, the resolution will no doubt be cited in U.S. court decisions and the U.S. will feel its impact in the various international forums in which it participates.<br /><br />The United States is bound by its own laws and constitution, and by treaties that it has ratified. The moratorium resolution does not fit into any of those categories. However, the Supreme Court has repeatedly confirmed that its understanding of what is prohibited by the &quot;cruel and unusual punishments&quot; clause of the Eighth Amendment is measured by the &quot;evolving standards of decency&quot; in society. Some would view that society to be confined by our own borders, but the Court has looked to international standards to confirm its interpretation of American values. In prohibiting the death penalty for the mentally retarded and for juvenile offenders, the Court took note of international trends on these issues. If the day comes when the death penalty itself is before the Court again, the emerging international abandonment of capital punishment will play an important, though not a decisive role.<br /><br />In the meantime, these international concerns may play a small but important role as courts consider collateral issues such as the cruelty of a particular method of execution or its use against the seriously mentally ill. As was seen in the eventual abandonment of apartheid by South Africa, it is very difficult for an isolated country to maintain respect in the international community if it flaunts a human rights standard that nearly every other country agrees on. The U.S. may not want to be one of the last democracies standing that still uses the death penalty. The stream of human rights flows strongly, often bringing even the reluctant into its flow. The U.N. resolution is a clear sign of the direction in which this stream is heading.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong>Joshua Rosenzweig</strong></a> [Manager, Research &amp; Programs, <a href="http://www.duihua.org/">The Dui Hua Foundation</a>]: &quot;The recently-published statistics for 2006 on <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/human-rights-group-reports-increased.php">political arrests in China</a> are especially troubling, as they indicate the reversal of a three-year trend from 2003 to 2005 in which such arrests declined substantially. It is not entirely obvious why political arrests doubled in 2006 compared to the previous year, but it fits with what many have been observing over the past two years: that the Chinese Communist Party-led government is taking firm, repressive measures to manage perceived threats to social and political stability. In part, these repressive measures seem designed to squelch any possibility of broad-based unrest in advance of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.<br /><br />The category of crime known as &quot;endangering state security&quot; (ESS, Art. 102&#8212;113 of the Chinese Criminal Law) involves a set of broadly defined prohibitions aimed at protecting the &quot;security and interests of the [Chinese] state.&quot; Among the most common charges from this category, the laws against &quot;subversion&quot; and &quot;splittism&quot; (including the incitement thereof) have no purpose other than the repression of political dissent. The law against leaking state secrets outside of China has been used to silence journalists, rights-defending lawyers, advocates of religious freedom, and those who champion the rights of ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans to seek greater autonomy or even independence.<br /><br />According to Chinese criminal procedure laws, decision on &quot;formal arrest&quot; is made by prosecutors after considering whether police have gathered enough evidence to justify detaining a suspect beyond the initial 30-day period of criminal detention. The decision to approve arrest has serious implications for a defendant, since about 90 percent of those who are arrested for ESS crimes in China are subsequently prosecuted and about 98 percent of cases that reach trial end in conviction and punishment.<br /><br />Moreover, because of their political sensitivity, many ESS cases are officially classified as state secrets, which carries significant consequences for the way those cases are handled under China&#39;s criminal procedure regulations. Defendants in ESS cases that are deemed to be state secrets are typically prevented from meeting with defense attorneys until the case has been submitted to prosecutors&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;a period that, under some circumstances, can last as many as six or more months. Trials in classified ESS cases are also entirely closed to the public, except for the final delivery of the verdict.<br /><br />The number of individuals detained for political reasons is actually much larger than the annual statistics show. Aside from a relatively small number of individuals detained on ESS charges but subsequently released without formal arrest, there recently appears to have been an increase in the use of non-ESS charges such as &quot;illegal business activity&quot; or fraud to punish individuals clearly targeted for their political activity. Illegal forms of house arrest for political activists have also been on the increase, individuals are placed in police-run psychiatric hospitals for treatment of their political &quot;fixations,&quot; and the controversial administrative detention procedure known as &quot;reeducation through labor,&quot; in which individuals may be deprived of their liberty for up to four years without trial, remains in common use. And the numbers incarcerated rise well into the thousands if one includes those detained for other forms of oppositional activity, such as participation in banned organizations or &quot;mass incident&quot; protests against corruption, land seizures, environmental damage, and other injustices.<br /><br />These are likely to be some of the last official statistics by which we can measure China&#39;s commitment to human rights and political freedom in advance of the 2008 Olympics. The numbers do not inspire much confidence in Beijing&#39;s progress on this front.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Anonymous</strong> [advocate, Lahore High Court]: &quot;The Lahore High Court on 27 Nov appears to have returned to normalcy; many people, many cars, many lawyers in their robes. <br /><br /><img src="/hotline/lhcnov27a.jpg"/ align =left><IMG src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=20 aligh=left><img src="/hotline/lhcnov27b.jpg"/><br /><br />Interestingly, resolutions have been passed by different legal forums including the LHC Bar Association validating a boycott of the new breed of judges, the PCO Judges who have sworn oaths under the declaration of emergency. <br /><br />It&#39;s easy to get confused about why everything appeared normal this morning, but keep these points in mind:<ol><li>A number of lawyers do not belong to wealthy backgrounds. They are hardworking professionals with no permanent source of income, and are lately finding it difficult to maintain a balance between a rebellious heart and the cruel realities of life.<br /><br /><li>Lawyers working in Criminal Law are finding it difficult to maintain a boycott in strict sense. A client is apprehending humiliation in the hands of the police department and seeks pre-arrest bail; someone has to represent him. Another client already in judicial custody had moved bail application on Nov 2 and the case is now fixed for Nov 27. The counsel would represent him because counsel&#39;s absence would amount to the denial of a possible relief. A person had appealed five years ago against the death sentence awarded to him; the execution of sentence was postponed subject to the fate of the appeal. It already took five years for the appeal waiting for its turn and now it is fixed for Nov 27; someone will argue the case on behalf of the appellant so as to probably save him from gallows.<br /><br /><li>Corporate lawyers are also hard pressed for the reason that corporate clients do not tolerate absence of their legal representative once a case is called. Huge investments, huge monetary interests, cross border transactions, liquidation proceedings, auction of properties, insurance matters, recovery of banks&#39; loans are involved.<br /><br /><li>Reasons number 2 and 3 above could have been no reasons at all if a little amount of leniency had been demonstrated by the new judges. Till last week, the practice was to send a notice to the party that his counsel did not appear and that he must do something. From this week, counsel&#39;s absence has straightaway started resulting in dismissal of petitions.<br /><br /><li>Keeping in view the apprehension of a dismissal right away, senior lawyers have started sending their junior colleagues to the courts that go there and simply seek an adjournment which is &#39;very graciously&#39; granted.<br /><br /><li>Unfortunately, there are many &#39;black sheep&#39; who are taking it as a golden chance of not merely minting some money but also attempting to win the heart of the administration so as to get paid for such loyalty in a variety of ways. </ol>In short, almost eighty percent of the lawyers present in the premises were not there tracking their cases. They were there merely to see what was going on; and everything is certainly not going well. Those who have been baton-charged, arrested, humiliated, tortured, made to sleep on cold floors during detention, denied medical treatment, shifted to far-flung areas will not forget what hardships they had to go through. They are not boycotting the institution of the Lahore High Court; they are boycotting individual judges.&quot;<br />

		<title>Saudi Arabia&#039;s treatment of rape victim unconscionable</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://farzanahassan.com/"><strong>Farzana Hassan</strong></a> [President, <a href="http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/">Muslim Canadian Congress</a>]: &quot;While staunch affirmation of human rights remains the mantra of the day, the world continues to witness violations both great and small of this noble human ideal. Recently, a Canadian Muslim woman also felt her human rights violated and took her grievance to the Human Rights Commission. Her complaint-- a uniform skirt that leaves her calf exposed which according to her devout belief and practice, constitutes a serious violation of religious precept. Although Ms. Muse has the option of wearing trousers to work that would satisfy the Islamic requirement for modesty, she finds the attire uncomfortable, especially in warm weather, as she feels she must keep her jacket on to further conceal the shape of her body. <br /><br />Miles away from this controversy, in a benighted prison cell in Saudi Arabia, a nineteen year old girl awaits the implementation of a punishment that may very well take her life. She was convicted earlier this year of the &quot;crime&quot; of leaving home unaccompanied by a close male relative. To her utter misfortune, the woman was gang-raped during the ill-fated trip to meet her fiance. Yet, instead of receiving redress for the atrocity, she was awarded the brutal and humiliating punishment of 200 lashes along with a six month prison sentence. <br /><br />Needless to say, such human rights abuses stand in stark contrast to Ms. Muse&#39;s relatively innocuous and somewhat disingenuous concerns. Despite this, there is deafening silence over the outrageous sentence from the champions of human rights. The insidious worldwide alliance between the leftists and the Islamists appear to be lending strength to misogyny and medieval values.<br /><br />Saudi Arabia&#39;s verdict on this young girl is unconscionable. <br /><br />Not only is it harsh in comparison to the so called &quot;crime&quot;, it also places the onus of rape almost exclusively on this woman by bringing into focus her infraction of having violated Saudi law, thereby suggesting she brought vulnerability upon herself. Such messages reek of patriarchy and misogyny as the woman according to the verdict must be taught a lesson by serving a sentence and receiving a public flogging. <br /><br />Saudi Arabia continues to implement a justice system that is medieval and archaic in upholding the most literal interpretations of the Islamic Shariah. <br /><br />Yet despite its cruel manifestations, as in the case of the nineteen year old rape victim, there is an absence of public outcry from within Saudi society. The sporadic voices decrying the verdict have come largely from abroad, where journalists both Muslim and non-Muslim have expressed outrage over the decision. <br /><br />What needs to be addressed is the very premise upon which the Saudi justice system is built&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;one that renders women voiceless, non-persons without freedom and socially marginalized. A society that criminalizes a single woman&#39;s unaccompanied movements must review the social fabric of the society that prompts such unwarranted restrictions on her freedom. The strictures of a highly conservative brand of Wahabi Islam must be reviewed, allowing for more humane applications of religious norms. Moreover, Saudi Arabia ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 2000 and as such is obliged under international law to repeal and amend all laws that blatantly discriminate against women. It must introduce laws and public education programmes that uphold the essence of the Convention based on the equality of women. <br /><br />While human rights activists contest Ms. Muse&#39;s right to wear a long skirt at her place of work, they must of necessity also direct their energies to addressing the gross human rights violations within Saudi society.&quot;<br />

		<title>Gun bans lead to increase in violent crime</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://johnrlott.blogspot.com/"><strong>John Lott</strong></a> [Senior Research Scientist at the University of Maryland and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1596985062/ref=nosim/?tag=johnrlotttrip-20">Freedomnomics</a>]: &quot;The District of Columbia&#39;s <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/07-290_pet.pdf">request for cert</a> made a simple argument: Whatever one thinks of the Second Amendment, banning handguns is a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/07-290_pet.pdf">&quot;reasonable regulation&quot;</a> to protect public safety. Indeed, most of the city&#39;s brief focused on public safety arguments. The problem for the city is that anyone who can look up the crime numbers will see that D.C.&#39;s murder and violent crime rates went up, not down, after the ban. <br /><br />Prior to the ban DC&#39;s murder rate was falling. After the ban, DC&#39;s murder rate rose, and only once fell below what it was in 1976. <br /><br />But it is not just DC that has experienced increases in murder and violent crime after guns are banned. While DC points to Chicago&#39;s ban to justify its own, Chicago also experienced an increase after its ban in 1982. <br /><br />Taking a page from recent Supreme Court cases, D.C. points to gun bans in other countries as evidence that others think that gun bans are desirable. But the experience in other countries, even island nations that have gone so far as banning guns and where borders are easy to monitor, should give D.C. and its supporters some pause. Not only didn&#39;t violent crime and homicide decline as promised, but they actually increased.<br /><br />D.C.&#39;s brief specifically points to Great Britain&#39;s handgun ban in January 1997. But the number of deaths and injuries from gun crime in England and Wales increased <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article2328368.ece">340 percent</a> in the seven years from 1998 to 2005. The rates of serious violent crime, armed robberies, rapes and homicide have also soared. Similar experiences have been seen with other bans, such as those in Ireland and Jamaica.<br /><br />What is also interesting is how the Supreme Court has rewritten the question posed by DC. DC originally asked that the question <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/07-290_pet.pdf">be:</a> &quot;Whether the Second Amendment forbids the District of Columbia from banning private possession of handguns while allowing possession of rifles and shotguns.&quot; The new question <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/07-290_pet.pdf">is:</a> &quot;Whether the following provisions &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; D.C. Code secs. 7-2502.02(a)(4), 22-4504(a), and 7-2507.02 &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; violate the Second Amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with any state-regulated militia, but who wish to keep handguns and other firearms for private use in their homes?&quot;<br /><br />What is most striking about this revised question is that the court appears to be questioning the city&#39;s claim that the ban <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/07-290_pet.pdf">comes</a> &quot;nowhere close to disarmament of residents. The District&#39;s overwhelming interest in reducing death and injury caused by handguns outweighs respondent&#39;s asserted need . . . .&quot; DC adds that they don&#39;t believe that the regulations that lock up and require the disassembling of guns does not &quot;prevent the use of a lawful firearm in self-defense.&quot; Of course, this is highly debatable because under DC law as soon as a rifle or shotgun is made operational it becomes illegal.<br /><br />But taking DC claims as accurate, locked guns are simply not as readily accessible for defensive gun uses. In the U.S., states that require guns be locked up and unloaded <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=228534">face</a> a 5 percent increase in murder and a 12 percent increase in rapes. Criminals are <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/product/0895261146/ref=nosim/?tag=johnrlotttrip-20">more</a> likely to attack people in their homes and those attacks are more likely to be successful.<br /><br />Since potentially armed victims deter criminals, storing a gun locked and unloaded actually encourages increased crime. If the phrase &quot;keep handguns and other firearms for private use in their homes&quot; was chosen for a purpose, it might be that gun lock laws raise their own problems that limit people&#39;s ability to use guns for defense.&quot;<br />

		<title>Australian terror ruling reminds governments to eschew abusive interrogation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asim Qureshi [Researcher in International Law, <a href="http://www.cageprisoners.com/index.php">Cageprisoners</a>]: &quot;Travelling through the world researching into abuses of human rights in the &#39;War on Terror&#39;, a familiar pattern begins to emerge; values and the safeguards of democracy are being stripped away in the name of international peace and security. Many governments have acquiesced the use of extra-judicial &#39;techniques&#39; to apprehend and question detainees around the world. While in Kenya investigating unlawful detentions in the wake of the Somali-Ethiopian conflict, I stumbled across cases of American and British citizens being held illegally while being questioned by MI5 and the FBI. Despite being held in such a way, none of these men had any recourse to the law as their vulnerable position was being abused. <br /><br />The <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/australia-drops-terror-case-after-court.php">case of Izhar Ul-Haque</a> serves as an initial step to restoring the balance between security and justice. The landmark case in Australia should send a reminder to its government, and indeed governments worldwide that in the search for international terrorist networks, techniques which undermine the value of the rule of law must not be incorporated. Often security and intelligence services rely upon fear and intimidation to extract information from individuals, however this process can come at a very high cost. <br /><br />Judicial systems worldwide should look to the Australian courts in terms of the clear message that has been sent out, much in the same way they did after the House of Lords ruling in the UK which denied the use of evidence gleaned from torture. Those disillusioned with the way in which western democracies have double standards in issues such as the use of torture and unlawful detention only use examples as that of Ul-Haque&#39;s to add fuel to their fire. For the security of the world, the security and intelligence services must conduct their investigations within the safeguards of due process.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peter Weiss [Vice President, <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>] and Jeanne Sulzer [lawyer, <a href="http://www.fidh.org">FIDH Legal Action Group</a>]: <br /><br />&quot;On October 26, while Donald Rumsfeld was attending a conference in Paris, a war crimes complaint based on his authorization for and encouragement of torture was filed against him by FIDH (Paris), the Center for Constitutional Rights (New York), the European Center for Human and Constitutional Rights (Berlin) and the French Human Rights League. On November 16 the District prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/french-prosecutor-rejects-war-crimes.php">dismissed the complaint</a> on the ground that he had been advised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that, &quot;by extension&quot; the ICJ judgment in Yerodia (Congo v. Belgium), which held Yerodia immune from prosecution for acts committed in his capacity as Congo&#39;s foreign minister, also applied to Rumsfeld. <br /><br />This is an egregious and no doubt politically motivated misreading of the ICJ opinion for at lest two reasons:<br /><br /><blockquote>(1) When Belgium issued its international arrest warrant for Yerodia, he was still Congo&#39;s foreign minister, while Rumsfeld no longer held any public office when he was sued in Paris. There is nothing in the ICJ opinion which holds that head of state or minister of foreign affairs immunity survives the term of office of the individual concerned. On the contrary, there is language which suggests the opposite.<br /><br />(2) In Yerodia, immunity for a foreign minister was found to exist by extension of head of state immunity, based on the fact that foreign ministers represent their countries abroad and must be free to do so without impediment. A further extension of this immunity to defense ministers would logically lead to the granting of immunity to any high government official who travels abroad on business for his or her government. This would represent a giant step backward from the principle of universal accountability for grievous crimes which has become enshrined in international law as shown in the recent past for example in the cases of Pinochet, Hissene Habre and Fujimori.</blockquote> <br /><br />An appeal has been filed with the General Prosecutor under article 40-3 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.specialreadiness.org/Index.html"><strong>Malcolm Nance</strong></a> [Director, Special Readiness Services International]: &quot;In my testimony last week to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Torture, I attempted to clarify exactly what is involved in waterboarding. Simply put, waterboarding, when used in any capacity in a coercive environment against detainees, captives or hostages, with the intent to illicit information or to break the will to resist, is unequivocally torture. <br /><br />The intense national discussion over this torture technique brought immediate scrutiny to a war crime practice. It has been revealed that Americans have actually been carrying out this practice in conflict with our laws and international treaties. Somehow this brutal torture based on real drowning, has made its way into the American lexicon as &quot;simulated drowning.&quot; In October 2005, the US Senate banned the use of torture by the military, though the intelligence community appears to have a loophole that has yet to be closed. The US military immediately complied with the laws banning the use of waterboarding and placed the ban directly into its interrogation field manual, FM 2-22.3. <br /><br />I am pleased to report that on November 6, 2007, the Department of the Army stood up for its honor, tarnished by the abuses and murders at Abu Ghraib and Kabul. In a statement to the Army leadership, the <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/us-army-memo-reconfirms-ban-on.php"><strong>Secretary of the Army noted</strong></a> that he wanted &quot;to eliminate any confusion that may have arisen as a result of recent public discourse on the subject&quot; and reiterated that Army policy and doctrine considers torture, including waterboarding, to be a banned practice. <br /><br />It is heartening to see that Army leadership decided to reiterate that the Army stands above its enemies and will not allow its personnel to practice acts that are war crimes. The message is necessary. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, on orders from White House policy makers, created a significant grey area on the inappropriateness of torture. These same politicians based their body of knowledge on interrogation from stereotypes of its efficiency seen in the popular media and old movies. This ignorance concerning the inefficiency of interrogation, in the face of the Defense Department&#39;s own empirical data on American captives from 200 years of conflict, rapidly filtered down to the field and resulted in the Army determining that our soldiers committed murder, torture and abuse. It made a stain on our battle streamers, but it is not indelible. <br /><br />Waterboarding is just one of the tortures used by our past enemies from the Nazis to Saddam Hussein&#39;s Iraq. Torture is beneath us as a nation and tarnishes our honor. I look forward to the mandatory video message from Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to everyone in the Department of Defense. From the privates in the field to the top generals and civilian leaders, they all need to see and hear the Secretary personally repudiate these techniques. He must clearly state that the honor of America&#39;s military is a force multiplier in the defense of our nation and that the Department of Defense will take the moral high ground and no longer use the tools of its enemies.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Anonymous</strong> [advocate, Lahore High Court, Pakistan]: &quot;I went to the Lahore High Court (LHC) this morning; it was as deserted as before. The President of the High Court Bar Association under detention has been released last night. He was detained under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance rather than a Police Report (FIR). The Home Department withdrew his detention orders and he was released as there was no need of a bail petition.<br /> <br />The remaining 50 or so lawyers which were denied bail earlier when 350 were released also got their bail this morning. These 50 and 350 were transferred to far-flung areas&#39; jails just to cause them inconvenience. The Police trucks which are used for transportation are horrible. A number of lawyers told me that for urination, they had to use empty plastic bags inside the police truck because the driver was under instructions not to allow food, water, tea or toilets enroute even under an armed police watch. And it takes at least 8 hours on a police truck to reach Bahawalpur Jail from Lahore; this figure of 8 hours does not include those additional hours for which the trucks were kept standing at different places just to prolong the journey.<br /> <br />There will be no reaction for some days as the recently released (the 50 &#39;hardcore criminals&#39;) would spend some time with their families though they are yet to be released from the jails. The bail petitions have been accepted but the released orders have yet not reached destinations.<br /> <br />The US deputy secretary of state has also gone back without any firm commitments from the General. The only good thing is that protests are taking place on daily basis in different parts of the country. Benazir is also silent as she didn&#39;t receive a very positive reply from Americans. The situation is not very encouraging. And then on top of this, the government has managed to obtain oaths from so many judges in bits and pieces. On the night of Nov 3, the LHC had only 12 out of 31; today it is 21 out of 31. Earlier 12 was a shameful figure, 21 looks respectable. One, Judge Mian Hamid Farooq, took oath this morning on the 19th making it 21. What more can I say?&quot;<br />

		<title>The Cambodian Genocide Court: Lessons for the ICC in Uganda?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="mailto:dwrist@pitt.edu">Wes Rist</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that especially in the context of its troubled pursuit of Ugandan rebels, the International Criminal Court in The Hague might take a leaf from the book of the new Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia and pursue a more cooperative attitude with local governments instead of simply seeking to enforce its writ regardless of potential domestic costs or consequences...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wesrist.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ate last month the first formal arguments were heard before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), as former Khmer Rouge official Kaing Guek Eav - also known as Duch - filed an appeal for bail before the body and Cambodian prosecutors opposed the motion. While the Duch case is a fascinating one, the real importance of this first step for the ECCC is its reflection of the cooperation that has existed between the United Nations and the government of Cambodia in the establishment and operation of the tribunal, and the example that sets for international involvement in the punishment of domestic human rights abuses generally. This cooperative spirit is exactly the kind of attitude the International Criminal Court (ICC) should adopt in its interactions with Uganda concerning the recent indictment of senior Lord's Resistance Army officials, instead of the rather hostile tone it has taken since President Yoweri Museveni requested that the ICC reconsider its indictments against Joseph Kony and his four senior lieutenants.<br /><br />There is little doubt in anyone's mind that the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s committed some of the worst crimes against humanity ever perpetrated in the modern world. With an estimated 1.7 million individuals dead or missing from that time period, the staggering sociological impact is still felt in Cambodia today. An entire generation of workers, educators, and spiritual leaders was wiped out. Not only did this deprive Cambodia of those people and their skills, but it also ensured that the current generation of Cambodians had no one to train them in the careers represented. There are no well-staffed medical schools to train new doctors, no law professors to train new lawyers, no monks and priests to train the next generation of devotees; they were all eliminated by the Khmer Rouge.<br /><br />With the last decade and a half of focus on prosecuting perpetrators of crimes against humanity, there was finally enough international attention on the issue for the Cambodian government to consider the possibility of pursuing justice against these individuals. Many of the worst offenders had been arrested and detained in the late 1990s as the Cambodian government sought to demonstrate that atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge were unacceptable. But the Cambodian government lacked the resources to pursue a large scale prosecution of Khmer Rouge officials on its own. Enter the United Nations. Interest in creating a Special Tribunal for Cambodia was growing and the UN originally seemed to consider something like the ICTY or ICTR to be the way to go.<br /><br />But Cambodian officials had watched the events in the ICTY/R carefully and they were aware of the complaints against the tribunals for imposing Western concepts of justice on a people that were looking for something relevant to their culture, not to an official in Geneva or New York. Cambodia held out for a fully domestic court system to hear the Khmer Rouge cases and eventually, the Agreement Between the United Nations and the Royal Government of Cambodia was signed in 2003. The Agreement specified that the trials would occur under Cambodian domestic criminal law, but with assistance from international experts and guidance. The agreement also set out the legal authority for the court, later formalized in Cambodia's Law on the Establishment of Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, and the procedures that would be used, which represented a careful agreement concerning international standards on judicial guarantees.<br /><br />The ECCC's hearing concerning Duch's detention is merely the first step in a long road. Circumstances demand that it be a rapid road, too, as many of the worst offenders are nearing the end of their natural life spans. But the work the ECCC has been doing in the short time since its creation is encouraging. Provided funding stays strong, the opportunity for the Cambodian people to see justice done is very strong. This cooperative approach to solving issues of national justice and international concern for procedural fairness and judicial guarantees is the true value of the ECCC in a rapidly globalizing legal community. And the ECCC represents more than just a solid collaboration between a national government and the UN, it is a sound guide for the International Criminal Court as well.<br /><br />The ICC itself is barred from hearing Khmer Rouge cases, as it can only try crimes that occurred after the Rome Statute entered into force. However, even with its current cases, the ICC is running into criticism over Westernized justice that the ICTY/R faced. Specifically, in the Court's Uganda case against leaders of the Lord's Rebellion Army, growing numbers of Ugandans wish to see the ICC withdraw its indictments of Joseph Kony and his top lieutenants, who have publicly stated that they will not pursue further peace talks unless the ICC arrest warrants are withdrawn. The ICC has repeatedly declined to review the indictments and just last week issued a strong statement claiming that any consideration of withdrawing the indictments would amount to throwing justice out the window.<br /><br />While there is certainly a justified reluctance in the international community to allow for grants of amnesty or immunity in cases of ongoing conflicts involving war crimes or crimes against humanity, the ICC seems to be ignoring the lesson that the ECCC offers. By working with, rather than against, a domestic government, the international community has a much more valuable role to play in seeing justice done for the worst crimes committed against humanity. Would amnesty for Joseph Kony and his lieutenants be a sad alternative to seeing them in the dock before judges at the ICC? Certainly. Is it a worthwhile price to pay to end the killings currently continuing in Uganda? That&#39;s an issue that the Ugandan people and government should be able to decide. <br /><br />The ICC's writ is based on complementarity. Since the Ugandan government invited the ICC to investigate the crimes committed by the Lord's Resistance Army, that initial determination of complementarity was waived. But I strongly doubt that there is a sufficient legal argument to be made that once a government invites ICC involvement, it no longer has a say in the internal affairs of its own country relating to that involvement, especially when the lives of its citizens are at stake. At this point, there needs to be a discussion of when the ICC's desire for justice is becoming an institutional goal that is accomplished at the expense of the people the Court is supposed to be seeking justice for. When the ICC is sacrificing lives, albeit indirectly, in order to accomplish the prosecution of five men, I begin to question what definition of "justice" is being served.<br /><br />As a lawyer, the idea of an amnesty for Kony and his men troubles me greatly. As a human being who has talked with victims of crimes similar to those of the LRA in Uganda, I have to wonder if the ICC cannot find another way to work towards justice that will not result in greater loss of human life in Uganda. There is sufficient leeway in the ICC statute for the Office of the Prosecutor to work with the Ugandan government in seeking an immediate end to a conflict that has
 raged for decades and has claimed much of the youth of the country. There are certainly valid arguments that obtaining justice in a court will go further towards accomplishing long term peace than any cease fire or political truce. But I question the impact of that justice in obtaining long term peace when the trial is not in Ugandan courts, not in Uganda at all, and will most likely never be seen or experienced by the majority of the Ugandan people. Outside of domestic prosecution of Kony, the long term benefits of courtroom justice pale in comparison to the very real benefits of preventing any more children being kidnapped and employed as child soldiers.<br /><br />Instead of championing its own causes and reaffirming the need for its own existence, the ICC should be considering what "justice" it was created to serve. If the Office of the Prosecutor can look Ugandans in the face and tell them that it is better that they die and Kony is tried than that they finally find peace in their country, maybe they are pursuing the right track. Otherwise, perhaps they should consider the ECCC and the example it sets for cooperation between international organizations and domestic governments.<br /><br /><br /><em>Wes Rist is an Adjunct Professor and Assistant Director of the Center for International Legal Education at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

Claiming to act on behalf of the people, he has further divided and weakened our nation while blackening Pakistan's image across the world.<br /><br />For the first time in our history, riot police and plainclothed intelligence agents stormed the apex courthouses and brutalized thousands of lawyers, students, and citizens whose only crime was to exercise their democratic rights. Hundreds remain behind bars on fraudulent, non-bailable "terrorism" charges. There are credible reports that leaders of the bar are being tortured in solitary confinement under the jurisdiction of military intelligence. Currently 55 judges of the higher judiciary, including 15 of 19 Supreme Court justices, are being detained under house arrest for courageously refusing to submit an oath of loyalty to the military regime.<br /><br />Under a new presidential ordinance, military courts have been authorized to courtmartial civilians on charges ranging from treason to "giving statements conducive to public mischief." These are not the acts of an enlightened, moderate leader committed to a peaceful democratic transition. What Pakistan faces today is the subordination of every independent organ of state to unchecked and unaccountable military-executive power. These unlawful measures are being given retrospective sanction by the newly-constituted Supreme Court, comprised of those justices who, in submitting to the loyalty oath, have not only compromised their personal integrity but also the independence of the judiciary.<br /><br />Under these extraordinary circumstances, the forthcoming elections will hold no legitimacy and offer no hope for resolving Pakistan's grave crisis of governance. We, the undersigned faculty, students, and staff of the Department of Law and Policy, appeal to lawyers, judges, academics, students, and legal associations worldwide to raise your voices against martial law in Pakistan, to demand the release of all political prisoners and the reinstatement of all judges who refused to take the oath, and to urge your governments to press for genuine democracy rather than back-room deal-making.<br /><br />Finally, we ask that you take a moment to send letters of support to those honorable Supreme Court justices who continue to stand for the rule of law despite threats and detention. Kindly circulate this request to your legal community and copy any such letters to lawfaculty@lums.edu.pk. <br /><br />Thanking you for your support and solidarity,<br /><br />Justice (Retd.)

They in fact apply to conflicts between states. So therefore the Geneva Conventions do not give you the answers about who can be held in a conflict with a non-state actor. They do not tell you how long you can hold someone in a conflict with a non-state actor. They do not tell you what countries to return people to. In a normal conflict where one is fighting one or maybe two countries, at the end of the conflict you return the combatants to those countries. In fighting al-Qaida we&#39;ve found that we have detained individuals from more than two dozen countries around the world. The Geneva Conventions do not provide answers to those questions so they don&#39;t provide sufficient guidance to countries as to what law to apply.</blockquote>I want to emphasize the consistent and relentless effort of those speaking for the United States Government to keep trying to convince all of us domestically and internationally that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to this armed conflict. It started soon after 9/11 and was enshrined very early on in the February 7, 2002 Presidential Military Order. Bellinger is one more of a long line of persons working overtime to argue for holes and seek our acquiescence in this view. <br /><br />The reason for these arguments is not one of principle but it is rather one of decisions made to be able to treat persons outside of law. The law is used to protect the persons who conspired to act outside of law who do not want to face any consequences for the decisions taken. As long as these persons are able to keep us guessing and arguing about the applicability of Geneva Conventions they can keep us from looking at their intended acts that are grave breaches and war crimes. We should not be duped by this ploy.<br /><br />Bellinger went on to say, <blockquote>The United States is firmly committed to the law that applies. We&#39;re also committed to working with other countries around the world to develop new legal norms in cases where existing law does not give one the answers. But what we do think is problematic is to simply suggest that the Geneva Conventions provide all of the answers in fighting international terrorism, and that countries simply need to follow the Geneva Conventions and that is the end of the matter.</blockquote>In his comments, Bellinger did not talk about the core aspects of Geneva treatment of persons held but more about issues like when you have to return people. It is clear to me that the lever of the issue of when to return people is trying to be used to encourage a review of several aspects of the Geneva Conventions. The reason for this effort is that if one can convince the world to create a new protocol to deal with things one argues were not covered in the prior Conventions or Protocols, then one is able to vindicate the United States Government's position since early on in the &quot;War on Terror&quot; that the Geneva Conventions and Protocols did not apply to the conflict. Through this maneuver, any prosecution for those leadership persons of the United States for grave breaches and war crimes for existing Geneva law violations before international criminal tribunals would then be undermined on the basis of the principle of legality.<br /><br />Bellinger reaffirms the United States opposition to torture, yet even that reaffirmation is weak. He speaks of having strong personal beliefs and we are supposed to understand that as meaning that he will advise Mukasey to find that waterboarding is torture. But, the fact is that all those policies were worked out when Bellinger was at the White House and on into his time at State. I have no faith that his strong beliefs depart in any significant manner from those of the Haynes', Bradbury's, Yoo's, Goldsmith's, Gonzales&#39;, Addington's or others on these topics who have created and extended the legal argumentation to enable U.S. torture in this armed conflict. Nothing in his tenure at State suggests his views are different from those of these other apologists for torture.<br /><br />If there is one lesson from the torture debates it is that there is an almost unending availability of clever lawyers willing to build up sandcastle analyses to enable the sovereign to argue that what he/she is doing is perfectly legal. As long as those lawyers can include an Attorney General willing to see this as misfeasance the clever lawyer gets off scot-free as does the sovereign who sought the legal advice to allow the illegality. <br /><br />If one is willing to take the scales from one's eyes and just call things as they are, then the Bellingers are stopped in their tracks for their enabling of grave breaches and war crimes. That would be a clarification of American high-level civilian and military culpability that has been long delayed by efforts at spinning the War on Terror. It is a day of reckoning that is long awaited.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

Justice M. R. Kiyani, Chief Justice of the West Pakistan High Court during the days of General Ayub Khan&#39;s martial law, told the Karachi Bar Association in December 1958 that, &quot;Misfortunes come not alone, but in battalions; and in this case it was a whole army&quot;. Our society still faces the dismay of 1958 and there are plenty of &quot;servicemen&quot;, this time also in plain clothes.<br /><br />Yesterday morning, a news item appeared in national dailies reporting the summary of a 58-page judgment of the three dissenting judges who disagree with the Supreme Court court&#39;s recent rulings in the election eligibility case. The petitioners in that had challenged the validity of General Musharraf holding dual offices and contesting elections for another term while still in uniform. According to newspapers this morning, the Attorney General for Pakistan made the <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=11277">following remarks</a> while terming the dissent &quot;nothing but a piece of paper&quot;<blockquote>It has no significance as these judges no longer hold their posts. Judges cannot even sign a judgment after losing their job...I found General Musharraf to be the most courteous and accommodating person and undoubtedly a good military commander who is bearing these judges.</blockquote>The country is already full of Generals in uniform and now we have these &quot;plain clothes&quot; Generals: Attorney General, Advocate General, Prosecutor General. It was not so long ago when the present Chief Law Officer of Pakistan himself signed &quot;a piece of paper&quot; on June 26, 2001 thereby <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1410387.stm">tendering his resignation</a> from the position of Judge of the Lahore High Court subsequent to the Supreme Court&#39;s judgment when the top court severely indicted him for delivering a politically biased judgement convicting former premier Benazir Bhutto and her husband Asif Ali Zardari in the SGS Case. Such a misfortune.<br /><br />This evening, DAWN TV brought before us Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman, the leader of MMA, a coalition of religious parties in Pakistan who said, &quot;We do aim at the Independence of Judiciary but it has nothing to do with the restoration of individuals. We believe in the institutions, not in people&quot;. Hearing this one would like to beat one&#39;s head against a wall, particularly when it is so proudly claimed by the government that the literacy rate here has risen to 53%. Majesty of law without restoration of our deposed judges would become a tyranny of Law. Such a misfortune.<br /><br />Or take the case of Mr. Syed Afzal Haider, a very well-respected lawyer of Lahore, former President of the Lahore High Court Bar Association, former Law Minister for the Government of Punjab, a great advocate of the &quot;rule of law&quot; and the author of two voluminous books on the murder-trial of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He took an oath as Federal Law Minister on November 17 in the caretaker cabinet inducted by General Musharraf. Within five days under the able guidance of Mr. Haider, the draftsmen at the Law Ministry successfully drafted the Ordinance promulgated today, the 21st, under which the General purified all his acts, deeds, and misdeeds subsequent to November 3, and further curtailed the powers of Courts by disallowing hearing of petitions against such acts, deeds, or misdeeds. Such a misfortune.<br /><br />Misfortunes come not alone; they come not in battalions either, but this time in platoons. And these platoons must remember that Pakistan is inhabited by very sentimental people. When they love or hate, they do so without reservations. <br /><br /><br /><em>Faisal Naseem Chaudhry is an advocate of the Lahore High Court, Lahore, Pakistan</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/researchpost.php?postid=427">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that the Sunni-Shi'i divide in the Iraqi parliament is only one split complicating the passage of controversial legislation in the troubled state...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hamoudi.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>C</strong></font>onventional wisdom seems to suggest that the ability of Iraq's legislative body, the National Assembly, to pass crucial legislation is hampered primarily by sectarian conflict. There is some obvious truth to this, but there is also significant danger in attempting to view a multifaceted problem solely in this one dimension. In particular, there is another, far less reported divide among Iraq's parliamentary factions that gives rise to enormous complications whenever any draft legislation is considered by the National Assembly. Specifically, there is significant divergence within the National Assembly in attitudes towards the United States and the American presence in Iraq. A brief review of the two most recent legal issues discussed in Iraq and in its National Assembly makes this amply clear. The first is the current impasse respecting the enactment of a "justice and accountability law" meant to allow former members of Saddam's Ba'ath party to return to employment at ministries and receive pensions, and the second concerns extending the legal authority of the U.S. military to remain in Iraq.<br /><br />As for the justice and accountability law, media reports are nearly always uniform. The Shi'is oppose the law because they suffered under the former regime, and the Sunnis favor it because the Ba'ath members were largely Sunni, hence the impasse between them. Quotes are then brought forward to demonstrate this, from angry Shi'is who oppose what they consider an amnesty, or angry Sunnis who feel that individuals who have done nothing wrong are denied an income or a means to survive. <br /><br />A closer inspection, however, reveals this explanation to be somewhat incomplete in a number of ways. First of all, Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki has endorsed the bill, and has sent it to the National Assembly where he must have expected he had the votes to pass it. The most recent disruption of the National Assembly to delay the bill was caused not by the Shi'is generally, but by the Sadr faction, consisting of only 30 members of the 275 member Shi'i dominated parliament. The Iraqi National Accord, a non-sectarian party led by the Shi'i Ayad Allawi, supports the legislation. Not all Sunnis support the bill, Saleh Mutlaq, the Sunni leader of the hardline Iraqi National Dialogue Party, opposes it. What precisely is going on?<br /><br />First of all, while the Ba'ath party was predominantly Sunni, there is no question of significant Shi'i membership. The Iraqi National Accord, led by a Shi'i, has many former members in its ranks, including Allawi himself. The story of Shi'i opposition because of former repression is largely true, but overly simplistic.<br /><br />More importantly, certain Shi'i groups are more tolerant of the continued American presence than others, and thus respond more readily to repeated American pressures to pass the legislation. Hakim's Supreme Islamic Council in Iraq (SICI) has not voiced opposition, and as noted above, Maliki's Da'wa party, or at least its leader, has endorsed the bill. Sadr's extremist faction, hostile to the United States given its recent history with the US, is naturally unaffected by American pressure, or indeed perhaps responds to American pressure by resisting what the US wishes to see; a comprehensive bill on de-Ba'athification. <br /><br />The explanation seems more complete when this "America factor" is taken into account. Leaders and members of the Da'wa, SICI and the Sadr factions all suffered under the former regime, few if any were ever Ba'athists, none have promoted extensive reconciliation with Sunnis on other fronts other than rhetorically. There is thus no real explanation for the difference among these Shi'i parties respecting the rehabilitation of former largely Sunni party members other than that SICI and Da'wa have closer relationships to the Bush administration than Sadr and are more responsive when the administration urges progress on the bill. Thus do the Sadrists, and nobody else, disrupt the National Assembly and dismiss the bill as "amnesty" for supporters of totalitarianism, preventing its passage.<br /><br />Hostility to the US similar to that of the Sadrists might explain why Mutlaq's hardline Sunni party is equally uninterested in the justice and accountability law. Naturally Mutlaq cannot oppose the proposed law for the same stated reason as the Sadrists, that it promotes amnesty, given that much of Mutlaq's support comes from former party members. Rather, Mutlaq wishes to see the bill defeated, he says, because there should be no restrictions on any former party member, no matter how senior, from taking any position in government, no matter how high, unless he can be convicted in a court of law for criminal activity. This rather absurd legal standard has absolutely no chance of being realized in today's Iraq, and Mutlaq must know that. Only two explanations are plausible. First, Mutlaq is a hotheaded extremist who has no interest in returning Ba'athists to their jobs via compromise and instead wishes to take an untenable position and lose out of principle, or second, that Mutlaq, like his Shi'i counterpart Sadr, would like to see America fail, and is deliberately avoiding compromise to ensure that this is achieved.<br /><br />Consideration of the second of the two legal issues roiling Iraq, the status of the American troop presence, makes this divide even clearer. President Bush and Prime Minister Maliki have signed an agreement in principle to negotiate the continued status of US troops in Iraq, with a final agreement to be completed by July 2008. Provisions concerning American investment are also included in the letter, as are the expectations of what the American troops' functions will be, and the conditions under which they might withdraw. Again, the reactions mirrored in some ways the positions on de-Ba'athification, although this time it was entirely clear the source of the division. SICI has been largely silent, Da'wa's leader signed the agreement, and neither the Iraqi National Accord nor the more mainstream Sunni parties have issued a statement. Yet the hardline Association of Muslim Scholars has denounced even this cursory letter agreement to agree as "a conspiracy with collaborators." The hardline Sadrists likewise expressed serious reservations. Thus have the hardline Sadrists and Sunnis joined hands in their opposition to the US and its continued presence in Iraq.<br /><br />This is not to suggest that the Sunni Shi'i divide is not real, only that it provides only a partial explanation. Hostility to the United States, present among hardliners within each faction, helps to show yet another divide within Iraqi society and the Iraqi National Assembly, with significant consequences for any legislation that may ultimately emerge, or fail to emerge, from it. <br /><br /><br /><em>Haider Ala Hamoudi is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that Pakistan&#39;s political parties should boycott the parliamentary elections scheduled for January and support Pakistani lawyers&#39; more fundamental efforts to restore the suspended constitution and reinstate the superior court judges ousted by General Pervez Musharraf under emergency rule...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he lawyers' movement in Pakistan - which by its courage has inspired the lawyers of the world to show solidarity for the rule of law - is on the verge of collapse. Political operators from all over the world have landed in Pakistan to share the spoils of a dying regime. Soon, the lawyers will be divided. Their ties with competing political parties will split them apart. And if major political parties participate in the January general elections, the lawyers' movement will be buried alive in the filth of Pakistan's politics. <br /><br />Foreseeing these dangers, the Pakistan Bar Council has rightfully appealed to political parties to boycott the January elections and support the lawyers in their struggle to restore the constitution and reinstate the deposed judges. <br /><br />The lawyers' movement is not aimed at unseating a military ruler or paving the way for two former prime ministers to end exile, come home, and run for office. The lawyers have not forgotten the lawlessness, corruption, nepotism, and incompetence of former prime ministers. Former prime ministers were no champions of the rule of law. They too subverted an independent judiciary. They offer no more hope to Pakistan than does the unconstitutional regime in power. Therefore, the lawyers' movement is not political. It is not even for democracy. <br /><br />The lawyers' movement was launched to restore and preserve two fundamental norms of the legal system: the rule of law and judicial independence. If these norms are compromised, Pakistan will remain an unstable nation in the foreseeable future whether its rulers wear military uniform, shalwar kameez, or pinstriped suits. Time and again, civil and military rulers have betrayed the people of Pakistan by letting the constitution crumble under real and manufactured emergencies. <br /><br />Political parties obsessed with gaining power will happily tolerate a mangled constitution. They will also sacrifice the deposed judges for self-serving political deals. For lawyers, therefore, restoring the constitution and reinstating the deposed judges are far more important than holding general elections. The lawyers cannot ignore these clear priorities. <br /><br /><strong>Restore the Constitution</strong> <br /><br />First, the lawyers demand that the constitution be restored. The constitution safeguards the rule of law. No legal system can function without commitment to the rule of law. No laws, not even good laws, are good if the rule of law is uncertain. No laws, not even bad laws, are bad if the rule of law stays intact. Only under the rule of law can good laws be preserved and bad laws overturned. When the constitution is suspended, the ruler's arbitrary hand turns ruthless. History demonstrates that rulers who suspend the rule of law inflict more harm than do good. Rule of law, therefore, is no clich&Atilde;&copy;. It is the foundation of a reliable legal system. <br /><br />For most of its history, Pakistan has been unable to institute the rule of law. Civil and military rulers see the rule of law as an inefficient barrier to the supposed good they want to do for the people of Pakistan. Military rulers suspend the rule of law to create a militaristic culture where laws are ignored but orders are obeyed. Civilian rulers suspend the rule of law to create illegitimate space where friends and families enjoy a free hand in making money and distributing government jobs and contracts to cronies on the basis of connection rather than merit. <br /><br />Dramatic subversions of the rule of law, such as the November Proclamation of Emergency, are not the exclusive crimes of the military regime. Political parties that occupied the national and provincial assemblies aided and abetted the suspension of the constitution. Politicians in collusion with generals have perpetuated arbitrariness. When a single man can change the nation's constitution, suspend fundamental rights of life and liberty, and arrest the nation's eminent lawyers without legal basis - while national and provincial assemblies were still functioning - the rule of law is thoroughly subverted. <br /><br />Since the politicians out of power are no more credible than the politicians in power, the lawyers demand that the constitution be restored regardless of who is in power. First the constitution, then democracy. <br /><br /><strong>Reinstate Deposed Judges</strong><br /><br />Second, the lawyers demand that the deposed judges be reinstated. The lawyers make this demand not for any political reasons. Nor do they make this demand because the lawyers prefer judges who oppose the regime in power. Nor do they make this demand because they distrust the judges who side with the regime in power. The lawyers make this demand because no executive, let alone an army chief, must command authority to fire the high court judges <em>en masse</em>. <br /><br />If the deposed judges are not reinstated, future rulers too will have no respect for the judiciary. Too many times, the judges with conscience have been ignored and forgotten. Too many times, the judges have been forced to embrace the commands of willful rulers. Too many times, the constitution has been suspended because the usurpers know in advance that the judges can be compromised, intimidated, detained, fired, and sent to oblivion. <br /><br />This time, the lawyers refuse to accept the degradation of the judges. They demand that the deposed judges, who declined to accept the suspension of the constitution, be reinstated. They demand that the dignity and independence of judges be restored.<br /><br /><strong>Lawyers' Commitment</strong><br /><br />The lawyers' commitment is transparent and candid. An independent judiciary cannot be separated from the rule of law. No nation can enjoy the rule of law without an independent judiciary. And no judiciary can be independent without the rule of law. Therefore, the lawyers of Pakistan cannot support the holding of the general elections unless the constitution is restored and the deposed judges are reinstated. <br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan grew up in Pakistan and is a law graduate of Punjab University, Lahore.

		<title>Death penalty reform in Japan has a long way to go</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maiko Taguscari [Staff attorney; researcher on penal system reform, <a href="http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/index.html">Japan Federation of Bar Associations</a>]: &quot;On Dec. 7, the Ministry of Justice disclosed the names of the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/japan-discloses-identities-of-3.php">three death row inmates who were hanged</a> that day, as well as the summary of the crimes they were convicted of and the locations where they were hanged. Some media say this is an important step toward transparency of the death penalty system, but this argument is totally away from the point. <br /><br />The ministry says that &#39;disclosure of such information is important to explain to the public that executions are being properly carried out, since the voice of the public including crime victims which demands disclosure of related information has increasingly become louder&#39;. However, obviously there has been no movement by family members of crime victims which calls for disclosure of the information concerning the executions. Moreover, even in previous practice, the ministry informally provided the media with the names and other information which identified the hanged inmates. That is, there is substantially no progress but the ministry pretends to take an important step on the grounds that victims are demanding disclosure. <br /><br />By referring to rising of victims&#39; voice, the ministry tried to justify both the previous hidden practice and its modification. It can be said that the ministry does not have any intention to disclose much more information, such as why these inmates were selected for executions or whether the inmates had any mental disorders or not, and drastically review its secret policy. More international pressures are needed to stir up public discussion in Japan and change the ministry&#39;s obstinate attitude.&quot;<br />

		<title>UK terrorism detention proposal violates basic rights</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2007/12/uk-government-detention-proposal/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Benjamin Ward [Associate Director, Europe and Central Asia division, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;The Home Office announced on December 6 that it will ask Parliament to grant it special powers to <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/uk-government-proposes-42-day-detention.php">extend the 28-day pre-charge detention period in terrorism cases</a>. The proposal would give the Home Secretary the power to authorize the detention of terrorism suspects for up to 42 days, upon the recommendation of the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Parliament would have to approve the power within 30 days and be notified of each individual extension.<br /><br />The current 28-day limit is already significantly longer than the maximum allowed in comparable legal systems, such as in the United States and Canada, and is by far the longest in the European Union. There is no case to date in which an extension beyond 28 days has been required. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald and former Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, have indicated that they regard the current powers as sufficient. Human Rights Watch <a href="http://hrw.org/backgrounder/eca/uk1105/">opposed the extension</a> from 14 days to 28 days under the Terrorism Act 2006 on the basis that it violated the right to liberty. A further extension would compound that violation. <br /><br />The government has suggested that the new proposal contains strong parliamentary and judicial safeguards. But the power to extend detention beyond 28 days can be used for 30 days before Parliament need approve it, by which time the 42-day time limit could already have expired for some detainees. Parliament is also ill-equipped to review individual cases, a function best performed by the courts. The limited judicial safeguards remain unchanged. To justify continued detention, a judge need only be satisfied that it is necessary to further the investigation, and that the police are acting with due diligence. It is not necessary for the judge to determine whether reasonable grounds exist to believe the individual being detained has committed a terrorist offense. <br /><br />As a recent Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/eca/uk1007/">briefing paper</a> points out, a further extension of detention would create a significant risk of unjust extended detention. According to UK government statistics, over half of all those arrested as part of terrorism investigations since 2001 were released without charge. Were detention further extended, it is highly likely that terrorism suspects, most of them Muslim, would be detained for extended periods and then released without charge. The experience of internment in Northern Ireland and the indefinite detention of foreign terrorism suspects at Belmarsh prison indicate that such measures can sour community relations and undermine cooperation with the police.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark Earley [President, <a href="http://www.prisonfellowship.org/default_pf_org.asp">Prison Fellowship</a>; former Virginia Attorney General]: &quot;The Eighth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/federal-appeals-court-rules-state.php">recently clarified the law</a> surrounding government funding for faith-based services that address America&#39;s intractable social problems. Americans United for Separation of Church and State had challenged the state of Iowa&#39;s establishment of a voluntary faith-based pre-release program for prisoners launched by Prison Fellowship. <br /><br />In the ruling, the Eighth Circuit held that Judge Pratt&#39;s injunction ordering the program in Iowa be shut down doesn&#39;t apply to programs that aren&#39;t funded by the state. Because the IFI program in Iowa is no longer partially funded by the state, the injunction does not apply to it. In reversing the prior ruling, the Eighth Circuit also rejected the &quot;pervasively sectarian&quot; standard used by Judge Pratt and affirmed that faith-based organizations are not barred from partnering with government simply because they are faith-based.<br /><br />While the court held that the previous method of payments for the InnerChange program violated the Establishment Clause, the court also held that that a voucherized system, which offers both religious and secular alternatives, could satisfy the Establishment Clause.<br /><br />Several aspects of the opinion were helpful to Prison Fellowship&#39;s efforts to help transform prisoners&#39; lives:<br /><br />First, the IFI program may continue to operate as a privately funded faith-based program, which all of our programs are.<br /><br />Second, IFI and Prison Fellowship do not have to repay the $1.5 million to the state of Iowa. This was extraordinarily important, not only for Prison Fellowship, but also for the principle and other faith-based programs. <br /><br />Third, the court ruled that Judge Pratt&#39;s allowing of so-called &quot;expert testimony&quot; disparaging evangelical Christians was &quot;not only unnecessary but also offensive.&quot;<br /><br />Fourth, the ruling gives IFI and other faith-based organizations additional guidance as we move forward in working with governments to address one of the most pervasive social problems facing our country: crime and the high recidivism rate of prisoners. <br /><br />A very important issue was at stake here, and that is: Can the faith community assist in assuring the public safety? The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to handcuff people of faith who are helping corrections officials turn prisoners&#39; lives around. The keys to reducing recidivism and protecting the public from repeat offenses are the very kinds of effective rehabilitation and re-entry services provided by IFI.<br /><br />This opinion will allow faith-based organizations to continue their great tradition of charitable work. From fighting slavery to establishing hospitals; from running soup kitchens to rescue shelters; from disaster relief to ministering to men and women behind bars, people of faith have been a driving force for good in our nation. And that work will continue.&quot;<br />

		<title>Death penalty abolition in New Jersey could provide model for rest of US</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Terry Kay Rockefeller [Member of the Board of Directors, <a href="http://www.mvfr.org/">Murder Victims&#39; Families for Reconciliation</a> (MVFR)]: &quot;I am a long time opponent of the death penalty, in all cases, for the fundamental reason that I do not want to be the citizen of a state that murders. My views were not changed when my sister, Laura, was killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But, having a family member murdered has led me to learn a great deal more about the realities of the death penalty in our country.<br /><br />Most murder victims&#39; families never receive the aid, counseling, or support that 9/11 families received. Instead, they enter a judicial system where, if there is an accused who is brought to trial, their case will take years before trials and convictions and appeals are concluded. The cost of these proceedings and the emotional toll of waiting can be extreme. Very little in the way of services or financial aid is available for these families who are grieving, distraught, and very likely struggling economically. The state spends far more money to execute a person than it does to reach a swift decision for life without parole, including the cost of keeping a person in prison for life. Eliminating the death penalty would immediately make more funds available to actually help the family members of people who are murdered. And it would end the great inequalities in the ways in which the death penalty is meted out in American society.<br /><br />So, I am happy that <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/nj-senate-panel-passes-death-penalty.php">New Jersey appears to be poised to end capital punishment</a>. I am proud that Murder Victims&#39; Families for Reconciliation (MVFR) and many family members of murder victims were at the center of bringing the study, debate and deliberation of the issues to this point. I believe citizens across the U.S. will learn from New Jersey that ending capital punishment will in fact increase speedy justice and make possible more effective support for all victims of violent crime.

The fact is that Serbia has so far fulfilled most of its obligations towards the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, including the extradition of its two former presidents. All of them have been charged with the gravest criminal offences recognised by the international humanitarian law. The extradition of the remaining indictees would be a proof that the Serbian people do not want to carry this burden on into the future.<br /><br />Substantial capacities of the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor&#39;s Office have been focused on the solution to this problem. What motivates us to proceed with our efforts is the acknowledgement that the Serbian state institutions have done their best in order to have The Hague fugitives brought to justice.&quot;<br />

		<title>Pakistan: Lahore lawyers protest detention order against High Court judge</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Anonymous</strong> [advocate, Lahore High Court, Lahore, Pakistan]: &quot;Mr. Justice Khawaja Muhammad Sharif was the seniormost Judge of the Lahore High Court on the morning of November 3, i.e. No. 2 after the Chief Justice. Because of the extra-constitutional steps of General (Retired) Musharraf, he is one of those Judges who were unceremoniously and unlawfully removed from their positions under the declaration of emergency rule. <br /><br />At the request of the present President of the Lahore District Bar Association Mr. Muhammad Shah, His Lordship accepted the invitation to address the Bar today, December 18. The function was scheduled to take place at 10:30 AM, and earlier the President of the LDBA was supposed to go to His Lordship&#39;s house in the morning so as to bring His Lordship to the Bar Room in the context of a public rally.<br /><br />The Provincial Home Department issued 03 Days Detention Order of the deposed Judge last night, however, so the entire residential area (Block S of the Defence Housing Society of Lahore) was cordoned off, and the roads leading to His Lordship&#39;s house were sealed with barricades and barbed wires.<br /><br />This morning, the President of the LDBA Mr. Muhammad Shah, while aware of the detention order, reached His Lordship&#39;s residence along with dozens of lawyers but was denied access. After heated discussion with the police officials, the President was allowed to see the deposed Judge. The President presented a bouquet and expressed his good wishes; the Judge because of obvious reasons expressed his incapacity to accompany him to the lawyers&#39; gathering.<br /><br />The lawyers chanted slogans against General (Retired) Musharraf, the unlawful ruler of Pakistan and came back to the Lahore District Bar Association in order to proceed with the scheduled function. Since the Judge was not present, hence it was not a huge gathering. Nonetheless, not less than 300 lawyers were present.<br /><br />The Bar was addressed by the President as well as the son of the deposed Judge who informed the Bar Members how roughly the Police entered the house last night for service of the Detention Order and misbehaved with the Judge and his family once improper manners was protested against.<br /><br />The Judge also addressed the Bar through his Mobile Phone and during the said 20 minutes address, he strongly condemned the detention of Judges, the imposition of Martial Law, the molestation of constitution and the fundamental rights guaranteed therein, the unconstitutional re-election of General (Retired) Musharraf to the post of President of Pakistan, and the sacking of Judges. The Bar had already arranged for a Shield / Memento to be presented to the Judge which then was presented to his son present there.<br /><br /><img src="/hotline/lahorejudgestalk.jpg" align=left/><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=10><img src="/hotline/lahorejudgesaddress.jpg"/><br /><br />Once the speeches were over, the President requested the members to gather out on the main road for recording of agitation against the detention of the Judge when his address to the Bar was already scheduled as well as announced. The lawyers took out a sizzling procession to the nearby Post Master General Square which was surrounded by heavy contingents of riot police. The lawyers chanted slogans against the Retired General, recited poems specially developed against his unconstitutional rule and set ablaze the election banners of the ruling clique. After a noisy show of 30 minutes, the lawyers peacefully dispersed at around 12 noon.<br /><br />Today&#39;s events were part of ongoing demonstrations since November 3 against the illegal rule of Musharraf. On one hand, the Retired General claims the constitution is restored, while on the other hand, respectable members of superior judiciary are detained in their houses in such a shabby manner. This is the real face of &#39;our democracy&#39; and we are fighting our &#39;war against terror&#39;.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Faisal Naseem Chaudhry</strong> [advocate, Lahore High Court, Lahore, Pakistan]: &quot;At 6:16 pm this evening, Pakistan lost Benazir Bhutto (BB). Plenty of individuals in this country had severe differences of opinion with her policies and politics, yet one could never imagine such a demise for Pakistan&#39;s most popular leader. She was, after all, a leader, and the loss of her life at such a critical juncture is the greatest national tragedy.<br /><br />It is true that some radical elements had threatened to blow her up in a suicide attack but it also true that similar threats had previously been made to others, including President Pervez Musharraf. But only she was successfully hit. She survived a deadly attack on 18 October but this time the ambush was perfectly designed. Bullets were fired at her followed by a suicide explosion resulting in fatal injuries to the head and neck. Her husband and children have left Dubai and are likely to reach the hospital at 3 in the night.<br /><br />BB&#39;s demise on 27 December with 08 January as the election date will have serious consequences for the country, the political system, Musharraf, the legal framework, and the lawyers&#39; movement.<br /><br />There is no likelihood of elections taking place on January 08 notwithstanding the fact that George Bush and Pervez Musharraf &#39;desire&#39; the election process to continue as scheduled. For Pakistan and the Pakistanis, this tragedy is greater than Sep 11 events, and the magnitude of public response has started appearing on TV screens. Violent demonstrations have erupted in virtually every part of the country, so much so that the protesters are not only burning public and private property both movable and immovable, but open gun-firing is also taking place. This is not at all a conducive environment for nationwide elections; forget them.<br /><br />Musharraf is in serious trouble. The <em>New York Times</em> has already reported that PPP workers at the General Hospital Rawalpindi, where she was declared dead, were shouting &#39;Musharraf dog&#39;. Everyone will point a figure at him, not only accusing him of having a clandestine role, but also for bringing the menace of suicide bombings into Pakistan. After all this is he and his policies alone which have blessed us with this new hazard. After the October attempted suicide Attack, the &#39;jammers&#39; provided by the Government were found inoperative and defective, enabling the assailants to hit twice, first with a device planted in a car (which could not work if the jammers were working properly) and the second with a suicide bomb. Even a couple of days ago, the chief security advisors of BB reminded the government that inadequate security measures have been provided to BB. Musharraf will definitely be accused of her death in one way or the other. If he was not responsible for providing security to BB then who else was?<br /><br />The lawyers&#39; movement in Pakistan shall gain momentum in the wake of BB&#39;s death. Not that the lawyers will try to cash in on the situation, but this tragedy further strengthens their allegations of legal, judicial and executive breakdown in Pakistan. What justification will now be available for Musharraf&#39;s junta to continue in office? The public will also join the movement, maybe independently, may be in their own way, but the absence of &#39;public&#39; participation previously complained of by the lawyers would not be absent anymore. The lawyers were not struggling only to have individual judges back to their positions - they also regard Musharraf as the most incompetent ruler in the history of Pakistan, an absolute illegitimate ruler who simply cannot run this country. There can be two views with regard to the deposed judiciary. First that the tragedy would fade away the target of having them back. The second that the objective remains intact. I feel inclined towards the later possibility. If these &#39;harsh and straight-forward&#39; judges were in their seats, the security arrangements for BB would have been foolproof. <br /><br />The weaknesses of the legal framework already in shambles will become more obvious and will and will worsen. It would be beyond the capability of any Attorney General or any Military General to handle the situation. Pakistan ultimately is going to pay a very heavy price. The separation movements in parts of provinces of Balochistan and Sindh will strengthen, particularly when three Prime Ministers belonging to the Province of Sindh have been assassinated (Liaqat Ali Khan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and BB). Separation is not a myth, particularly when Bangladesh was known as East Pakistan in the past. When incompetent people take over the country&#39;s helm merely because they wear a uniform, the country suffers as a natural consequence.<br /><br />Benazir Bhutto&#39;s death will not have been in vain. Maybe a dead Benazir will bring us the real democracy that the living Benazir was promising shortly before taking a bullet in her neck. Very tragic.&quot;<br />

		<title>The Supreme Court ponders habeas rights for Guantanamo prisoners</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>J. Wells Dixon [Staff Attorney, <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> and lawyer for several Guantanamo prisoners]: &quot;The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) returned to the United States Supreme Court yesterday for <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/supreme-court-weighs-guantanamo-habeas.php">arguments</a> in <u>Al Odah v. United States</u> and <u>Boumediene v. Bush</u>, which will likely decide the fate of about 300 men held without charge or trial in Guantanamo Bay.  At stake are questions directly impacting our government&#39;s delicate system of checks and balances, including whether the Executive may hold prisoners indefinitely in military custody without the right to appear before a neutral court and argue for their release.<br /><br />Former Solicitor General Seth Waxman, counsel for six Bosnian-Algerians, argued that Guantanamo prisoners have a constitutional right to habeas corpus that entitles them to relief because (i) all have been confined for six years without meaningful notice of the grounds for their detention or opportunity to challenge those grounds; (ii) under the D.C. Circuit&#39;s decision in these cases, the prisoners have no prospect of that opportunity; and (iii) all of the prisoners claim they are innocent of any wrongdoing.  The principal question for the Court, Waxman argued, is whether limited review under the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA) of &quot;enemy combatant&quot; determinations by Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) provides a constitutionally adequate substitute for habeas.  It does not, he said, because the CSRTs are structurally flawed and incapable of being cured through DTA review.<br /> <br />A majority of the justices appeared to agree with Waxman that the threshold question of whether the prisoners in Guantanamo have a constitutional right to habeas had already been decided in the Court&#39;s 2004 decision in <u>Rasul v. Bush</u>, a case brought by CCR.  Congress has since attempted to reverse Rasul by enacting the DTA and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), which purported to eliminate statutory habeas jurisdiction over Guantanamo and make the DTA process the sole form of review available in federal courts.  Prompted by questions from Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia, current Solicitor General Paul Clement argued for the government that Guantanamo prisoners have no constitutional rights under the DTA and MCA because they are non-citizens held outside the sovereignty of the United States.  Most of the justices seemed to reject that argument, however, including Justice David Souter who remarked at one point during yesterday&#39;s argument that the Court was &quot;past that point&quot; and the government was effectively rearguing <u>Rasul</u>.  <u>Rasul</u> held that the reach of habeas depended on practical questions concerning exclusive jurisdiction and control over Guantanamo Bay rather than formal notions of territorial sovereignty.  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that the lease agreement granting the United States exclusive jurisdiction and control over Guantanamo was not something that Congress had changed by enacting the DTA (section 1005(g) of which purports to define the &quot;United States&quot; to exclude Guantanamo) and MCA.<br /> <br />Several justices also questioned the government&#39;s alternate argument that DTA review is a constitutionally adequate substitute for habeas.  Justice Souter questioned whether meaningful DTA review is possible because the CSRT panels were not neutral and had denied prisoners the remedy of release.  He specifically noted the case of Ali, a Chinese Uighur who was initially found by a CSRT not to be an enemy combatant, but, rather than be released, was subjected to further CSRTs until an enemy combatant finding was eventually obtained.  Justice John Paul Stevens likewise questioned the neutrality of CSRT participants and the prisoners&#39; lack of counsel during the hearings.  Justice Stephen Breyer then asked whether a Guantanamo prisoner could argue under the DTA that, regardless of a CSRT finding, the Constitution does not allow him to be held for six years without charge or trial.  When Clement responded that a prisoner could not make that argument under the DTA, Justice Breyer noted that was &quot;exactly!&quot; his point, and expressed skepticism that such a limitation could be constitutionally adequate.  <br /> <br />Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose vote will likely be critical to the prisoners&#39; challenge, also appeared to side-step the question of whether Guantanamo prisoners have a constitutional right to habeas.  He appeared to assume that right and instead explored whether DTA review, if found to be a constitutionally inadequate substitute for habeas, could be cured of any defect by the D.C. Circuit.  Appearing almost to abandon its argument that Guantanamo prisoners have no constitutional right to habeas, the government ultimately asked Justice Kennedy and other members of the Court to remand the cases to the D.C. Circuit and allow that court to supply any constitutionally required guidance to the CSRTs.  The Court could do that, the government urged, without expressly reversing the D.C. Circuit&#39;s decision that Guantanamo detainees have no constitutional rights.  <br /> <br />In his rebuttal, Waxman raised the case of German resident Murat Kurnaz as an illustration of why the CSRTs are fatally flawed and cannot replace full habeas review.  Kurnaz was held for several years at Guantanamo because of his affiliation with an alleged suicide bomber, who, his counsel later learned, was in fact alive and living an ordinary life in Germany.  Kurnaz&#39;s CSRT did not disclose this fact, and DTA review would not have allowed for the introduction of this &quot;new evidence&quot; &#8212; evidence obviously critical to the question of whether he was properly detained.  Thankfully, Kurnaz was released from Guantanamo several years after his exoneration.  Sadly, several hundred innocent men remain imprisoned in Guantanamo, including the Uighur Ali, waiting for the Supreme Court to decide whether they will have their day in court.&quot;<br />

The United States led postwar efforts to prosecute Nazi crimes in Nuremberg and played the lead role in establishing international tribunals to prosecute those responsible for the Rwanda genocide of 1994 and perpetrators of atrocities, including the 1995 Srebrenica genocide, committed during the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Yet it took 40 years for the United States to ratify the 1948 Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and, until last week, when the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/bush-signs-legislation-allowing-non.php">President signed into law the Genocide Accountability Act</a> (GAA) of 2007, U.S. law provided an impoverished set of tools to hold to account those who commit crimes aimed at extinguishing a human group.<br /><br />Until amended by the GAA, the law implementing U.S. obligations under the Genocide Convention, known as the Proxmire Act, allowed U.S. prosecutors to punish genocidaires only when they committed genocide in the United States&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;thankfully, an improbable scenario&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;or when the perpetrator was a U.S. national. Not surprisingly, this law has provided no occasions for enforcement since it was enacted almost two decades ago, and those who committed genocide abroad had little to fear if they sought sanctuary in the United States.<br /><br />In recent years, Congress has acted to narrow the impunity gap left open by the Proxmire Act, principally by amending U.S. immigration laws. The United States can now deport, denaturalize or exclude genocidaires and can also prosecute them for customs fraud for lying about their background. Another law directs the Attorney General, when deciding on legal options relating to such aliens, to consider options for prosecution.<br /><br />All too often, however, the Attorney General&#39;s options have been largely illusory. In countries that have recently emerged from genocidal violence, local courts are likely to be in shambles. In Rwanda, only 11 lawyers reportedly survived the 1994 genocide.<br /><br />Until now, options for prosecuting genocidaires in the United States were largely limited to charges of visa fraud. Consider the case of Ratko Maslenjak, a member of an infamous Serb military unit connected to the 1995 genocide in Srebrenica who settled in the United States. When U.S. authorities discovered this, they brought charges against Maslenjak&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;not for genocide, but for lying about his service in the Srebrenica unit when he applied for his green card.<br /><br />In 2007, Congress transcended partisan divisions to close the gap in U.S. law highlighted by this case, enacting the GAA unanimously in both Houses. The new law allows U.S. prosecutors to bring genocide charges against individuals, regardless of their nationality, who are believed to have committed genocide abroad and are in the United States. On December 21, 2007, President Bush quietly signed the act into law (the presidential statement announcing this historic act listed it, without comment, along with twelve other laws signed that day). Now, almost 60 years after it signed the Genocide Convention, the United States has given its prosecutors a powerful weapon against the impunity that emboldens genocidaires. The challenge now is to ensure the law is used when the next Maslenjak is found here.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/researchpost.php?postid=427">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that a recent proposal to turn the contentious northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk into an independent federal regionate could be a starting point for further discussions that could meet the needs of Turkomen, Kurds and Arabs alike...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hamoudi.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ast week, in a little reported event, a little known Turkoman representative of the Iraqi National Assembly, Fawzi Akram, offered an ingenious plan to address Kirkuk&#39;s future - the creation of an independent federal regionate specifically for Kirkuk, separate and apart from the regionate of Kurdistan Iraq but enjoying the same, broad autonomy from the central government as the Kurdish regionate. The idea seems to have gone nowhere, as it disappeared from the Arab news in less than a day, and so far as I can tell never reached the English speaking media. However, it is to my mind precisely the type of creative, legal thinking sorely needed in Iraq to address the pressing issues of concern that continue to divide the various groups within the country. <br /><br />The problem of Kirkuk is among the most significant that face Iraq today. Long a city composed primarily of three ethnic groups, the Turkomen, the Kurds and the Arabs, Saddam upset the city&#39;s precarious balance through a mass deportation &quot;Arabization&quot; program that removed Kurds from the area, and replaced them with Arabs from the south. Tens of thousands of Kurdish families lost their homes as a result, and tens of thousands of Arab families, not necessarily connected to the former regime, were given those homes. The justice of the cause on behalf of those Kurds so removed, for no reason other than their ethnicity, cannot be questioned.<br /><br />Nevertheless, apparently unaware of, or unconcerned with, the rather appalling consequences in previous attempted mass population transfers around the world, the Kurdish parties have demanded as the solution, almost from the day that Saddam fell, a &quot;restoration&quot; of Kirkuk to its status prior to Saddam&#39;s Arabization program, moving tens of thousands of Arab families out, and replacing them with their original Kurdish inhabitants. The Shi&#39;a parties within the Iraqi government (or most of them, save possibly the Sadrists), more interested in consolidating their power throughout the south than worrying about Kurdish demands in areas of lesser concern to them, promptly acceded to this central Kurdish demand, and from this, Article 140 of the Iraq Constitution emerged. <br /><br />Article 140 draws on a similar, earlier provision in the Iraqi Transitional Administrative Law and sets forth a three stage process meant to &quot;restore&quot; Kirkuk. First, the Kurdish families are returned, and the &quot;new&quot; Arabs (meant to distinguish them from Kirkuk&#39;s long standing Arab population, who are supposed to be unaffected) are sent back to wherever they came from decades earlier, with compensation. Second, a census is taken, and finally, a referendum on Kirkuk&#39;s status is held, all of which is to take place by December 31, 2007.<br /><br />To say that this has not precisely gone according to plan is to understate the matter considerably. The first problem is that the constitution is supposed to be amended to meet certain Sunni demands, one of which concerns precisely Article 140 of the Constitution, to which the Sunnis are nearly uniform in their objection. Secondly, Arabs accuse the Kurdish parties of packing the city with individuals with no connection to it in order to win a referendum. Third, the Kurds have blamed the central government for deliberately causing delays and have grown impatient, and finally, the work of the property claims commission responsible for all of this restoration has been controversial and slow moving. There is therefore nearly in place, if media reports are to be believed, an agreement between the Kurds and the central government to delay the vote for six months.<br /><br />Now it appears that the most hardline Sunni party in the National Assembly, the Iraqi National Dialogue Front, aware that a vote by the end of the year is all but impossible at this point, has indicated that there can be no delay, and that once the New Year arrives, in the words of the Front&#39;s spokesman Haider Al-Mulla, &quot;no power on earth can under the constitution join Kirkuk to Kurdistan.&quot; At the same time, Fu&#39;ad Ma&#39;sum, the deputy chairman of the Iraq Constitutional Review Committee, has indicated that significant differences remain among the various factions seeking to amend the Constitution concerning four issues, among them Article 140 and the status of Kirkuk, and that more work, and more direction from the political leaders of each faction, is needed to bridge the differences. As a result, his committee also seeks an extension of the time from the National Assembly for the time allotted to it to finish its proposed constitutional amendments.<br /><br />So to summarize this rather complicated legal and political tangle, the Kurds and the Shi&#39;a have more or less agreed on the Kurdish formula for Kirkuk, its implementation is proving messy, and the Sunnis, or a fair number of them, are so viscerally opposed to Article 140 in the first place that they seem to be arguing that (i) it must be amended and (ii) even if it is not, once December 31 passes, no referendum is permissible under the Constitution. This is hardly the makings of an elegant, grand political bargain. Moreover, while the New York Times may indicate that the Bush administration prefers to see small steps in place of a grand bargain, this will not work with Kirkuk. The Kurds are impatient and want their referendum, their parliament issues decree after decree concerning it, and even sent a representative to discuss the matter with Prime Minister Maliki. Infinite delays and small steps will not satisfy them.<br /><br />Enter the Sadrist Fauzi Akram, with a rather simple solution. Create an independent regionate, belonging neither to the Kurdish north nor the Arab south, and bridge the problem by joining it to neither of the two. Problems will still remain concerning the city, and who should or shouldn&#39;t be living there. But the need to overpopulate with any particular ethnicity would be dramatically reduced. It was framed precisely as a potential compromise solution.<br /><br />It should be noted that Akram is a Turkoman, and the Turkomen dominate in no other region than, potentially, Kirkuk, and so there is no question that the solution tends to favor his ethnic group. That said, he does not represent the Turkoman list, but the Shi&#39;i Sadrist list. Moreover, his solution hardly creates the opportunity for Turkoman domination of Kirkuk given that the Turkomen are not a clear majority in Kirkuk at this time (and if they were, they would thwart any move to join Kurdistan in a referendum, making the Kurdish demands moot). The proposal would still therefore require everyone to find a way to get along. And most importantly, it&#39;s a new idea, the only new idea I have heard for some time, and therefore a starting point for further discussions that can meet all the parties&#39; needs.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, as noted above, the idea died quickly, Kurds whom I know dismissed it as a Turkoman&#39;s ploy, and everyone was soon enough back to their old tricks, digging in familiar territory, claiming the inability of any power on earth to do one thing, or blaming the central government for failing to do another, demanding constitutional changes or refusing to consider the same. Speeches abound, delivered with increasing levels of grandiloquence, as if what will lead to
 a solution will not be creative legal and political ideas, or compromise, but rather a particularly rousing speech that will cause one faction to realize the entire poverty of its own position and adopt that of its opponents. Such is not the climate in which deals are often struck. We can only hope that the next time someone raises a novel idea, the leadership in the various factions pay more attention to it.<br /><br /><br /><em>Haider Ala Hamoudi is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that new revelations about top US lawmakers&#39; encouragement and support of state-sponsored torture in the years immediately following 9/11 make them complicit in acts many would now condemn and show us how far we have sunk in ostensible defense of American values...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavisnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he <em>Washington Post</em> reported over the weekend that in 2002 and 2003 members of Congress were briefed on, acquiesced in and even encouraged now-decried CIA interrogation techniques:<blockquote><em>With one known exception, no formal objections were raised by the lawmakers briefed about the harsh methods during the two years in which waterboarding was employed, from 2002 to 2003, said Democrats and Republicans with direct knowledge of the matter. The lawmakers who held oversight roles during the period included Pelosi and Rep. Jane Harman (D-Calif.) and Sens. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) and John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), as well as Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.) and Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan). <br /><br />Individual lawmakers&#39; recollections of the early briefings varied dramatically, but officials present during the meetings described the reaction as mostly quiet acquiescence, if not outright support. &quot;Among those being briefed, there was a pretty full understanding of what the CIA was doing,&quot; said Goss, who chaired the House intelligence committee from 1997 to 2004 and then served as CIA director from 2004 to 2006. &quot;And the reaction in the room was not just approval, but encouragement.&quot;</em></blockquote>In April 2005 at a conference on the War on Terrorism at Duke University Law School's Center on Law, Ethics and National Security, I <a href="http://realmedia.oit.duke.edu/ramgen/law/lens/04082005b.rm?start='00:33:45.00'">publicly challenged</a> [video] Rep. Jane Harman, saying that I fully expected that in closed door briefings members of Congress had been made aware of the torture. She, as was the wont of others there, dismissed me, distinctly leaving the impression that nothing of the sort had happened. Now we know that she was carefully leaving a false impression.<br /><br />In this last year of the current Administration, revelation after revelation of Congressional complicity in the American form of torture is occurring and more revelations are fully expected. The complicity described is both bipartisan and sustained. Over the past few years, I have heard many lawmakers speak disparagingly of the Geneva Conventions, human rights law, international humanitarian law, and argue over and over about why our enemies in this "War on Terrorism" are outside of that law. It is only today that we find out about the blood on their hands with regard to that treatment that was inflicted on these persons. They are like mafia leaders ordering someone's legs broken and then saying the person deserved it as they bend down in prayer at their house of worship. All the revelations make me sick. <br /><br />As the leadership of both parties has been involved in torturing people, there will be absolutely no interest from these elites in U.S. domestic criminal prosecution of some of their members for their role in a conspiracy to commit torture and violations of the most fundamental rules of international law and domestic statutes that I have written about in my article <a href="http://www.law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/articles/Refluat%20Stercus%20SEPTEMBER%2030-Sandy%20Draft.doc">Refluat Stercus</a>.<br /><br />When we hear these revelations let us look again at the pictures of Abu Ghraib and think of all the low-level soldiers who were court-martialed for their acts there. We must conclude that the abhorrent acts that those low-level persons were doing were exactly what they had been asked to do. As many suspected and passionately argued to deaf ears, we must also conclude that the rejection of the low-level persons' defenses of superior orders and the unwillingness of the courts-martial to go up the chain of command were calculated to keep "damage control" to the low-level people doing the bidding of the high-level people. Now we know that the political class was aiding and abetting &#8212; and probably continues to aid and abet &#8212; torture.<br /><br />In light of these revelations, I would like to suggest that the President now pardon all the low-level soldiers who have been convicted for the abuses at Abu Ghraib. These soldiers should be pardoned because they were doing the extralegal bidding of their superiors in the Executive and Congress. As a matter of international law these pardons will not disculpate them from liability before international criminal tribunals, but it would seem that if internal law is going to be used to protect the high-level civilians and military who ordered these horrendous acts, then that same internal law should be used to let the low-level soldiers doing the bidding off the hook. Impunity should flow all the way down, not just among elites who can organize their protection scheme like a mafia family. <br /><br />Let us not allow our leaders to hide behind the skirts of Lynndie England.<br /><br />These continued revelations about our leaders&#39; willingness to torture people - almost all of whom are non-white and foreigners - brings me back to a wonderful novel by the French author Romain Gary called <em>Chien Blanc</em> or <em>White Dog</em>. Gary was married to Jean Seberg - the woman in <em>Breathless</em> with Jean Paul Belmondo - in the 60's. She was close to members of the Black Panther Party and was alleged to have been pregnant with the child of one of them. The FBI at the time was said to have harassed her to no end and Gary believed that their harassment caused her to have a miscarriage. It was said that she attempted suicide on the anniversary of that miscarriage every year afterwards.<br /><br /><em>Chien Blanc</em> is the story of a German shepherd dog that Gary adopted but was also a metaphor for America at the time. The dog was very sweet and loving. Then one day, a black man happened by the house and the dog went into a homicidal rage at the site of the black man. Over the course of the novel, the Frenchman learns about the practice then in America of training dogs to be &quot;white dogs&quot;: i.e. dogs that will attack a person of color but be absolutely normal with white people. Gary describes in his book discussing the phenomenon of his dog at cocktail parties with good old left-leaning Americans in the 60's. He also talks about later on getting phone calls from some of those left-leaning persons wishing to "get the white dog off his hands." He understood that they were willing to pay him significant sums to have themselves guarded by such a white dog.<br /><br />The members of Congress and others who have tut-tutted about the torture done all these years since 9/11 to foreigners and Americans (essentially all of whom are non-whites), we now know were in fact briefed on what was going on and in fact approved of it and encouraged it. Those members of Congress remind me of those people calling Gary in private and seeking to purchase his white dog. The timidity of the protests are as damning as the acquiescence. Vocal supporters of torture in the US right-wing media at least have the willingness to say where they stand in public, if saying one supports torture is something of which to be proud.<br /><br />But let us celebrate the emergence into the light of our leaders - of both the Executive and Congress, and of both parties - as avid proponents of state torture. Let us recognize their willingness to torture in our names. Let us revel in their allowing their dark side to triumph in the interest
 of protecting our American way of life. The truth shall truly set us free of any illusion that our leaders want our city on the hill to be anything more than a dark cell and that the shining light to humanity is to be anything more than a lightbulb kept on all night to keep some human we hate awake during sessions of sleep deprivation.<br /><br />All these things have been done in our name as Americans. Let us also accept that responsibility as we have not resisted this in a meaningful manner. We suspected but did not want to know about these things done in our names. We were good Americans like the good Germans in another period.<br /><br />As we revel in what we have allowed ourselves to become, I would suggest however that we keep in mind a couple of things about state torture. When we look back at the days of the Salem Witch Trials, I do not remember much discussion in the literature about this person or that person who was burned at the stake having truly been a witch. When we look back on the Spanish Inquisition (the Brazilian version of which my ancestors escaped from to the Caribbean), I do not remember much discussion in the literature about this person or that being truly possessed of the devil or truly a heretic. When we look at the Soviet gulag, I do not remember much discussion in Alexander Solzhenitsyn about whether the persons tortured in the salt mines were truly enemies of the state. When we look at the Moscow show trials, I do not remember much discussion as to whether the confessing defendants did the crimes of which they were charged and convicted. When we look at the Nazis in Lyon under Klaus Barbie, I do not remember the focus being on any criminality under the current law of the persons tortured for fighting against the occupying power. When we look back to Chile, Argentina, or Brazil, I do not remember our focus being on the alleged crimes of the persons disappeared, tortured, and killed.<br /><br />In all of these settings where a state feared and a state tortured (always of course in the name of protecting its good people) what we remember is the state's barbarity, not the alleged or actual barbarity of the state's victims. And, in the future, we will talk of this period in America as a time of transnational state torture, aided and abetted by the political classes and with the acquiescence of the courts. <br /><br />I still look for someone who will say "Round up these leaders and charge them with the crimes they have committed or caused to be committed." In return, all I can hear is a deafening silence. I see human rights groups struggling daily to raise awareness and get courts to do something meaningful, somewhere in the world but there appears to be a conspiracy of silence that whispers "It is OK to do this to these people because we all know they are all bad."<br /><br />And, for those who might think this can not happen in America, let me remind them of a conversation at that same Duke conference about the alleged essential good nature of Americans. I took the liberty of pointing out in that conversation that not far from Durham - in Edenton, North Carolina - a 14 year old ancestor of mine named Barbary, born free in Africa, became a slave when she was sold like a horse, or a cow, or a dog. We must not forget that in our souls we are capable also of great evil and that the battle for human justice requires us to recognize the humanity in each human and to say that no one is beyond the law. Our political leaders have forgotten that since 9/11 and we see how far they are willing to go into depravity.<br /><br />We must preserve memory. Remember what we are doing and explain to your grandchildren what you did when it was going on. In an earlier generation the question would have been what did you do when they came to intern your Japanese-American neighbor, or when the night-riders came, or maybe ask any JAG officer with any memory of World War II about Plot E.<br /><br />Some may take comfort in the fact that Americans of all races, religions, genders etc may be like those left-leaning persons decrying the white dog, but seeking its protection in private. I have been told of students of color willing to go along with torture just like these Congresspersons because "9/11 was real." The problem we are facing is not a black/white thing but is a question of what is the nature of the American soul. That is the soul for which I fight. <br /><br />The one modest power I have is the one that James Meredith reminded me of back in 2006. I have the power of a citizen - my connection to the sovereign. I can assert that power &#8212; weak as it is &#8212; and hope that I am heard. Once again, no doubt falling on deaf ears again, I say to you <em>refluat stercus</em>. Torture is against the law even if the lawmakers are willing to go along with it. Now do something about those willing to countenance state torture if you really stand for American values.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

Every Pakistani Chief of the Army Staff, known as the COAS, daydreams of morphing into a Caesar. Since the creation of Pakistan in 1947, four Chiefs have successfully anointed themselves as Caesars. Pervez Musharraf has crowned himself twice to confirm and reconfirm that Caesar has &quot;all powers&quot; to suspend and amend the Constitution at will. The people of Pakistan are angry but quiescent. The politicians are contesting undemocratic elections to share the crumbs of power. However, the lawyers of Pakistan are not supporting Caesar&#39;s <em>charkha</em>, the spinning wheel of all powers. <br /><br /><strong>Caesar&#39;s <em>Charkha</em></strong><br /><br />Caesar&#39;s <em>charkha</em> spins to gather all powers. Before lifting the emergency on December 15, Caesar, acting alone, using all powers he had previously bestowed on himself, made several amendments to the Constitution. The Constitution requires that the bicameral legislature pass amendments with &quot;not less than two-thirds of the total membership&quot; of each House. This procedure, however, applies only if the Constitution is operative. If the Constitution is suspended, Caesar assumes all powers to amend the Constitution. <br /><br />But how does Caesar assume all powers to suspend and amend the Constitution? Caesar simply asserts power to obtain power. On November 3, Caesar issued the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) to assert all powers. In turn, the PCO conferred all powers on Caesar. Using all powers, Caesar suspended the Constitution. The PCO further yielded that Caesar &quot;may from time to time amend the Constitution, as is deemed expedient.&quot; Hence, Caesar enjoys the power to amend the Constitution. <br /><br />The logic is magical. Caesar has all powers to make the law that confers all powers on Caesar. Take Article 270C of the Constitution. A day before lifting the emergency, Caesar - without consulting the Senate, a powerless chamber of the bicameral legislature, which, ironically, can never be dissolved - issued an Order to amend the Article. The Article thereby stood amended. The amended Article declares that the judges &quot;not having been given or taken oath&quot; under the Oaths law have ceased to be judges. But it was Caesar who made the Oaths law not to invite certain judges to take oath. Caesar&#39;s <em>charkha</em> turns as he pleases.<br /><br />It gets better. Article 270C did not exist in the original Constitution. Using the <em>charkha</em> of all powers, Caesar added Article 270C to the Constitution to permanently remove &#39;disloyal&#39; judges who refused to endorse his first (1999) suspension of the Constitution. The current amendment to the Article removes &#39;disloyal&#39; judges who refused to endorse his second (2007) suspension of the Constitution. <br /><br />After removing the Supreme Court and Provincial High Courts judges who will not spin with Caesar&#39;s <em>charkha</em>, Caesar still has no trust even in the judges who have taken the oath to protect and preserve Caesars&#39; <em>charkha</em>. To safeguard even against the PCO judges, Caesar issued an Order, under which all constitutional amendments that Caesar made &quot;shall not be called in question by or before any Court, including Supreme Court, Federal Sharia Court, a High Court, any forum or authority, on any ground whatsoever.&quot; No more evidence is needed to show that Caesar detests the judiciary. He detests the lawyers even more because he has not yet been able to pass a law that would disbar all lawyers that challenge Caesar&#39;s <em>charkha</em>.<br /><br /><strong>The Lawyers&#39; Call</strong><br /><br />The lawyers of Pakistan hold Caesar&#39;s <em>charkha</em> in contempt. They refuse to endorse the undemocratic elections that are being held to defraud the people of Pakistan and to perpetuate the PCO hegemony of the armed forces. They cannot accept PCO laws and amendments that Caesar has made to muzzle the press and turn the nation into a slave state of foreign masters. The lawyers of Pakistan will not trade away the rule of law for any benefit whatsoever. Therefore, they call for the following measures.<ol><li>The lawyers of Pakistan call for an end to PCO revolutions. A PCO revolution is the mockery of law. It subjects the Constitution to the Order of Caesar. The Constitution is meant to be the supreme law of the land. When a self-anointed Caesar can suspend the Constitution at will, the Order of Caesar is the supreme law of the land. A legal system in which the Order of Caesar is the supreme law of the land, no democracy can succeed, no constitution can survive, and no fundamental rights are protected. Any democratic elections held under the Order of Caesar are inherently deceitful. Therefore, the lawyers of Pakistan are not supporting the January 2008 general elections. <br /><br /><li>The lawyers of Pakistan call for the restoration of an independent judiciary. The first step, beyond compromise, must be to reinstate the judges who have been removed from office on baseless charges of aiding terrorists and conspiring to harm the nation. The second step, beyond compromise, must be to undo the laws that disable the judiciary from reviewing the PCO amendments Caesar has made to the Constitution. An independent judiciary is indispensable for the rule of law. Therefore, the lawyers of Pakistan cannot sacrifice the judiciary to foolishly safeguard the Order of Caesar. <br /><br /><li>The lawyers of Pakistan call for Caesar&#39;s trial under Article 6 of the Constitution. Article 6 reads as follows: &quot;Any person who abrogates or attempts or conspires to abrogate, subverts or attempts or conspires to subvert the Constitution by use of force or show of force or by other unconstitutional means shall be guilty of high treason.&quot; An independent Judicial Commission must be established to investigate whether Caesar has violated Article 6 of the Constitution. An open and fair trial, but without granting any immunity to the defendant, will restore the supremacy of the Constitution and verify the claims of Caesar whether the judges he removed were indeed aiding and abetting terrorists and conspiring to harm the nation, forcing Caesar to proclaim emergency and abrogate the Constitution.</ol>In supporting the lawyers, Pakistan declines to live under the Sword of PCOs, which can fall anytime to cut the Constitution into pieces.<br /><br /><em>Ali Khan grew up in Pakistan and is a law graduate of Punjab University, Lahore.

		<title>Perfidy in Pakistan: Understanding the Bhutto Assassination</title>

Just as Spain withdrew from the war in Iraq after the Madrid terrorist bombings, Pakistan too might use Bhutto&#39;s death to withdraw from the war in Afghanistan. For sure, Pakistan is no Spain. It will be much harder for corrupt Pakistani rulers to say no to billions of dollars coming from America. If Islamabad does not change its devious ways, however, the war on terror will consume and destroy Pakistan. <br /><br /><strong>Subservience and Subversion</strong><br /><br />Since its birth in 1947, Pakistan has been a subservient but subversive ally of the United States. Lacking resources and strong political institutions, Pakistani rulers have played the role of <em>makkar noker</em> (cunning servant) who takes pleasure in servitude but nonetheless resents and subverts the wellbeing of the master. That duplicitous Pakistani officials can outsmart na&Atilde;&macr;ve American policymakers has been the defining attribute of Islamabad&#39;s furtive foreign policy. This policy may have brought fame and fortune to some military and political individuals, but it has been a proven disaster for the people of Pakistan. <br /><br />In countering the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, for example, General Zia ul-Haq was overly eager to support the American-sponsored jihad. But Zia strived hard to deceive American officials into believing that Pakistan was nowhere near building the nuclear bomb. President Bush Sr. still resents that Zia lied to him straight face. Inspired by Zia&#39;s victorious hypocrisy, General Pervez Musharraf too has played the <em>makkar noker</em> to get huge amounts of money from the United States to fight real and imagined terrorists. The reports are now surfacing that crafty accountants inflated the cost of fuel and ammunition to increase the amount of aid. Furthermore, the aid has been diverted into buying weapons to fight India &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; an incorrigible obsession of Pakistani rulers. <br /><br />As a broader principle, though, Pakistani rulers believe that hypocrisy is diplomacy and that duplicity is the sure way to conduct foreign policy in a treacherous world. This crude principle has led to lawlessness at home and deceit in foreign affairs. It has also sunk Pakistan into regional isolation and moral darkness. Furthermore, the <em>makkar noker</em> policy frustrates both friends and masters (Americans) who might have better understood the needs of Pakistan if Islamabad were pursuing a hardnosed but honest foreign policy. <br /><br /><strong>Double-Dealing</strong><br /><br />The September 11 attacks provided the perfect occasion for the United States to issue "with them or with us" threats to Pakistan that had given birth to the Taliban phenomenon in hopes of fomenting terrorism against India. Musharraf, who at the time was consolidating his illegitimate military coup in Pakistan, had no option but to turn over Pakistan&#39;s terrorism policy. In deposing the Taliban but without abandoning them, Pakistani generals saw the opening of a grand opportunity that would bring money, military hardware, hobnobbing with Washington D.C., and influence peddling. <br /><br />Pakistan&#39;s September 11 somersault, however, has been nothing but deceitful. It oscillates between killing and dealing. Pakistani rulers accustomed to duplicity shore up the rhetoric of Pakistan being the frontline ally in the war on terror so that more American aid would pour into the nation&#39;s militarized economy. Periodically, poor villagers and school children in the tribal areas are killed to showcase the war on terror. These killings are ritual sacrifices to quench the Bush administration&#39;s insatiable thirst for blood - blood as proof that Pakistan is killing Muslim militants. But even Pakistan's killings are intermittent and convoluted. To frustrate Americans and to confuse the people of Pakistan, the ruling elites frequently flip and make peace with the militants.<br /><br />The 2007 Red Mosque massacre captures what Lord Macaulay has called &quot;the ambition and perfidy of tyrants.&quot; Bearded militants and veiled women occupying the mosque in Islamabad, not far from the halls of secular power, supplied the perfect TV footage to highlight the fears of Islamic radicalism. After doing nothing for months so that the Red Mosque militancy could be fully advertised, the Pakistani military eventually conquered the mosque, killing more than a hundred men and women. A triumphant military spokesman informed the world, &quot;The military part of the operation is over. There are no more gunmen inside the mosque.&quot; The White House, delighted to see the Pakistani army butchering radicals and extremists, continued with its pressure mantra: &quot;You aren&#39;t doing enough to kill militants.&quot; The people of Pakistan were stunned to see the military assault on the mosque. They pointed the finger at America and its operators in Islamabad.<br /><br /><strong>Murdering Bhutto</strong><br /><br />The double-dealing entered a dramatic phase when the Bush administration persuaded the operators in Islamabad to pardon Benazir Bhutto and allow her to put a democratic face on the war on terror. Bhutto, a dreamer born in a feudal family, was a democracy goddess who relished the sight of worshipping hands waving all around her. Bhutto had the uncanny ability to turn puppetry into a noble policy. Bravely, she went to the heartland of militants to make speeches against violence. Bravely, she met President Karzai of Afghanistan, a despised character in the region. Bravely, she considered working with Musharraf provided the general resigned from the army and put democracy back on the rails. In calculating risks to her life, however, Bhutto overestimated the protection that the American intelligence services might have offered in her fight against Islamic terrorism. <br /><br />Retrospectively, the Bhutto murder makes perfect sense. Anybody who sides with America can be killed in the Muslim world, knowing that the Al-Qaeda is there to absorb blame. Already, false tapes have been manufactured to &#39;prove&#39; that the Al-Qaeda-Taliban Axis killed Bhutto. The Axis denies the glory. In murdering Bhutto, Islamabad&#39;s perfidy was consummate. The context was flawless. The goddess had challenged the dark forces of evil. And the goddess with Oxford and Harvard connections was a fabulous sacrifice. If assassinated, the people of America and Pakistan could be duped into believing that Muslim militants killed the voice of democracy, the woman. This murder, someone thought, will make it easier to carry on the war on terror. The American money will continue to flow, the generals will remain in charge, the deposed judges will be forgotten, the lawyers will be compromised, and Islamabad will be back in business as usual. <br /><br />Given the deep roots of perfidy in Pakistan, it is unlikely that the new leadership emerging from the 2008 general elections will abandon the principle of deceit particularly with respect to the war on terror and understand that the nation&#39;s foreign policy must be derived from morally sustainable national interests.<br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan grew up in Pakistan and is a law graduate of Punjab University, Lahore.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/shane.html">Peter Shane</a> of Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, says that last week&#39;s executive privilege ruling by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy shows that Congress has the stronger argument in its fight for White House documents on U.S. attorney firings, but that a rule of law ethos cannot be restored to relations between Congress and the White House unless Congress is willing to back its legal stance with political muscle....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petershane2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>n especially well-written <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200711/112907a.html">legal opinion</a> by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) implicitly raises the question: is "separation of powers law" an oxymoron? Senator Leahy's statement responds formally to a June 28, 2007 <a href="http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/ssi/white_house_letter_to_congress_28.pdf">letter</a> from White House Counsel Fred Fielding conveying President Bush's decision to invoke executive privilege and direct non-compliance with Judiciary Committee subpoenas for documents relating to the controversial discharge of United States Attorneys. The Fielding letter relies, in turn, on an <a href="http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/ssi/letter_from_doj_to_white_house_28.pdf">analysis</a> furnished a day earlier by Solicitor General and then-Acting Attorney General Paul Clement that purports to find all responsive documents properly subject to an executive privilege claim.<br /><br />Both sides in this dispute concede that executive privilege is not absolute; each recognizes that Congress's entitlement to the documents depends upon a principled balancing of the competing institutional interests of the legislative and executive branches. For two reasons, however, it is patent that this balancing favors Congress &#8212; reasons that the executive branch documents simply refuse to acknowledge.<br /><br />First, it is not clear that the documents at issue are even properly within the category of materials about which the executive branch can legally claim executive privilege as against another branch of government. As Senator Leahy points out, the White House has vigorously denied President Bush's involvement in the U.S. Attorney firings. There is thus no reason to think that any of the documents touches on presidential privacy at all, or on the branch of executive privilege that protects presidential deliberations. <br /><br />If the communications in question were not undertaken as part and parcel of a process calling ultimately for presidential decision making, then the only form of executive privilege applicable to them would be the general "deliberative privilege." Claims of general deliberative privilege are unavailing in judicial proceedings when non-presidential documents are relevant to the investigation of government wrongdoing. As explained by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit: "[W]here there is reason to believe the documents sought may shed light on government misconduct, 'the privilege is routinely denied,' on the grounds that shielding internal government deliberations in this context does not serve 'the public&#39;s interest in honest, effective government.'" In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 738 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Given Congress's constitutional responsibility to investigate government wrongdoing and the strong evidence already elicited in committee testimony that the U.S. attorney firings may have entailed violations of law, "deliberative privilege" for the documents in question should simply be unavailable as against Congress, as well.<br /><br />Second, the executive branch's attempts at balancing are all highly generalized. They speak to the importance of confidentiality to the integrity of executive branch decision making in general, but not to the specific factors at stake in the current investigation or the threat to the public interest posed by the disclosure of any particular document. In contrast, Senator Leahy has documented a specific need for White House documents to follow up strong preliminary indications that the firings at issue were both illegitimate and unlawful. He has indicated his committee's willingness to weigh privilege claims with specificity on a document-by-document basis. His case thus rests not only on the general interests of Congress that are entitled to as much general respect as the general interests of the executive branch, but on a showing of need rooted in the facts of this particular dispute. Such a nuanced approach to the branches' competing interests is inherently more compelling than the blanket privilege claim tendered by the White House.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, White House intransigence in this, as in other separation of powers contexts, threatens to render the relative strengths of the two branches' legal arguments all but irrelevant to the outcome of subpoena fight. Senator Leahy has threatened to push for contempt sanctions, a route already initiated by the House Judiciary Committee. But - even putting aside the announced position of the White House that the Justice Department cannot be compelled to prosecute contempt against witnesses asserting executive privilege claims - the President is armed with the pardon power. Given the President's solicitude for former vice presidential chief of staff I. Lewis Libby, no witness facing contempt charges based on the Leahy subpoenas can reasonably be fearful of ultimately suffering any legal sanction.<br /><br />For these reasons, I believe the White House can be shocked into taking the law seriously only if Congress stands ready, willing and able to use its inherent political powers as aggressively as the Bush Administration. In a recent <em>Roll Call</em> <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/articles/shane_070918.php">column</a> I argued that, until the White House complies with the Judiciary Committee subpoenas, Congress should refuse any further appropriations to pay senior advisers in the Executive Office of the President who are not serving in advice-and-consent positions. As I there stated, "Congress decided under President Franklin Roosevelt to fund a generous staff of senior confidential advisers to the president to help him conduct the affairs of state. It is fair to tell his successors that they may not use these resources to deprive Congress of information genuinely relevant to a good-faith investigation of possible executive branch wrongdoing."<br /><br />We have been brought to the current impasse because the Bush White House ignores the reality that a successful separation of powers system depends upon interbranch norms of mutual accommodation, as well as each branch's principled assertion of its constitutional prerogatives. The past seven years have escalated the assault on those norms that has become all too routine since the Reagan Administration. As a result, and paradoxical though it may seem, any successful return to a "rule of law" ethos between the elected branches now requires Congress to back its legal arguments with political muscle.<br /><br /><br /><em>Peter M. Shane teaches separation of powers law at the Moritz College of Law at The Ohio State University. His forthcoming critique of the theory and practice of presidentialism is being published by the University of Chicago Press in February, 2009.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/shane.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />
