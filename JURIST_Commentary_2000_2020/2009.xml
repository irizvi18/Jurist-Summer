		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://millercenter.org/about/staff/baliles/" title="DOMESTIC_ONLY"><strong>Gerald L. Baliles</strong></a> [former Governor of Virginia; Director, <a href="http://millercenter.org/">Miller Center of Public Affairs</a>]: &quot;The lineage of the pardon power and executive clemency generally runs to ancient Rome.  British practice in the colonial period and before, itself drawing on antiquity, was the immediate precedent for the presidential pardon power <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A2Sec2.html">found in the Constitution</a>.  The power is broad, based on British royal prerogative: &quot;The President...shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.&quot; <br /><br />In some regards, just as the founders saw the president&#39;s veto power as a check against the legislative branch, they saw the pardon power as a check against the judicial branch.  Presidents indeed have typically used the pardon power to address matters of individual clemency when they have deemed a court sentence to be too severe, just as <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/bush-issues-19-pardons-commutes.php">President Bush has done in recent weeks</a>. <br /><br />Presidents have varied greatly in the number of pardons they have given.  Franklin Roosevelt, elected to four terms (two more than any other president), gave by far the most pardons &#8212; more than 3600.  Woodrow Wilson, Harry Truman, and Calvin Coolidge all gave significant numbers as well - more than 2400, 2000, and 1500 respectively.  George Washington by contrast gave just 16 in eight years.  Recent presidents likewise have not given significant numbers of pardons by historical standards.  President Bush has given fewer than 200, and President Clinton before him gave fewer than 500, although many of those came at the close of his presidency outside the ordinary review process, which drew criticism. <br /><br />Since the 1860s, the U.S. Department of Justice&#39;s Office of the Pardon Attorney and its predecessors have been in place as a channel for those seeking clemency.  The Office reviews requests and makes recommendations to the president, though the president in the exercise of his constitutional pardon power is not bound by those recommendations or by the processes of the Office of Pardon Attorney. Certainly some of the most famous pardons have been made outside this process, such as Gerald Ford&#39;s pardon of Richard Nixon.<br /><br />Pardons at a president&#39;s own prerogative usually have had a political impetus, or - perhaps put in a different light - have contemplated high matters of state.  Such use of the pardon power though is also not without precedent in the founders&#39; own thought and practice.  In <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed74.asp">Federalist 74</a>, Alexander Hamilton noted that &quot;in seasons of insurrection or rebellion, there are often critical moments when a well-timed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquility of the Commonwealth.&quot;  In fact, several of George Washington&#39;s few pardons when in office went to leaders of the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794.  Abraham Lincoln similarly, in sweeping fashion, pardoned Confederate soldiers and supporters.  More recently, Jimmy Carter issued a general pardon to those who evaded the Vietnam draft.<br /><br />The presidential pardon power is indeed broad, and the extent of its use has varied.  Since the 1860s a review process for clemency has been in place at the Department of Justice, but presidents at times have still acted at their own prerogative for reasons of politics and statecraft, as the founders contemplated may at times be prudent.&quot;<br />

		<title>Obama must not allow Bagram prison to remain an Afghan version of Guantanamo</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/muhammedAlly_s.aspx"><strong>Sahr MuhammedAlly</strong></a> [Senior Associate, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/us_law.asp">Law and Security Program</a>, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.aspx">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;On January 20th, President-elect Barack Obama will inherit the responsibility for thousands of detainees being held by the United States in Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay, and Iraq. Obama has already pledged to close Guantanamo, and the outgoing Bush Administration has <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-presidential-council-approves-us.php">entered into a Status of Forces Agreement </a>(SOFA) with the Iraqi government, which contains provisions for handling the 15,000 remaining Iraqi detainees. (Most will be transferred to Iraqi custody for release or prosecution.) But the future for the 600 plus detainees held by the U.S. at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan remains unclear. <br /><br /><strong>The Bagram Detainees</strong><br /><br />In comparison to Guantanamo, the public knows little about Bagram. Following the U.S. invasion in Afghanistan in October 2001, Bagram Air Base became the central clearing house for captured detainees. In February 2002, the Bush Administration wrongly denied application of the Geneva Conventions to persons detained in Bagram and Guantanamo. Therefore, no proceedings were held by a &quot;competent tribunal,&quot; as required by the Geneva Conventions, to determine the status of detainees. This was the first step in creating legal black holes in both Bagram and Guantanamo. Military and intelligence personnel sent many Afghans and suspected terrorists captured in Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere to Guantanamo for detention and interrogation. Transfers from Bagram to Guantanamo, however, began to decline after the 2004 U.S. Supreme Court decisions in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/542/466/case.html">Rasul v. Bush</a> and <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/542/507/case.html">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a>, which recognized limited rights of Guantanamo detainees to challenge their detentions in U.S. courts.<br /><br />Like Guantanamo, the prison at Bagram is controlled by the United States. The government states that there are over 600 detainees at Bagram, but an exact number is unknown. Unlike Guantanamo, we don&#39;t know the nationalities of many of the detainees, why or how long they have been detained, and the circumstances of their capture. We also know little about the treatment they have received or conditions of confinement at the facility. We do know that at least some of the detainees were not captured on any battlefield, but were brought to Bagram from other countries without the benefit of any legal process. Under generally accepted interpretations of the law, this is known as the crime of kidnapping. Press accounts report that some were held by the CIA before being brought to Bagram. In 2002-2003, reports of detainee abuse, including of deaths of two detainees in Bagram, were widely disseminated. The <a href="http://www.icrc.org/">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) is the only entity allowed to visit Bagram. Neither the United Nations nor any international or Afghan human rights organizations can visit Bagram detainees. <br /><br />There is no judicial process afforded to Bagram detainees. Afghan courts are unable to exercise jurisdiction over their own, or any other country&#39;s, nationals held by the U.S. military in Afghanistan. According to U.S. government court filings, a panel of three U.S. military officers - called an Unlawful Enemy Combatant Review Board (UECRB) - reviews a detainee&#39;s status usually within 75 days of being processed in Bagram and every six months thereafter, and recommends release or continued detention. Before April 2008, detainees were not even permitted to appear before the UECRB. There is no appeal from the UECRB determination. Detainees don&#39;t question government witnesses, nor can they call their own witnesses or receive guidance from an advocate.<br /><br /><strong>Habeas for Bagram Detainees?</strong><br /><br />On January 7, 2009, in the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia, the International Justice Network, along with law clinics at Yale and Stanford Law Schools, attempted to shed light on some of the Bagram detainees they represent. The lawyers for the four petitioners allege that their clients were seized in Yemen, Pakistan, Thailand, and Tunisia, rendered to Bagram, and have been detained without charge for up to six years. The lawyers, who have never met their clients, were contacted by family members of the detainees. They argue that their clients should have the same rights as Guantanamo detainees to challenge their continued detention in federal court. Habeas rights were restored to Guantanamo detainees by the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/553/06-1195/">Boumediene v. Bush</a> in June 2008.<br /><br />The Bush Administration maintains that the Bagram detainees are enemy combatants and the United States can detain them indefinitely, without charge or access to lawyers, until the end of hostilities, whenever that may be. The Supreme Court has rejected this argument repeatedly in connection with Guantanamo detainees. (See <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/analysis-some-overseas-extension-of-habeas/">SCOTUSblog</a> for a description of the hearing and see Andy Worthington, <a href="http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2009/01/10/seven-years-of-guantanamo-and-a-call-for-justice-at-bagram/">Seven Years Of Guant&aacute;namo, And A Call For Justice At Bagram</a>).<br /><br /><strong>Current U.S. Policy</strong><br /><br />Unlike Guantanamo, which has a declining population, the population of Bagram is growing. The U.S. is building a larger, more permanent, facility to house over 1,000 detainees.  The United States is the only military force that imprisons detainees in Bagram. European allies transfer persons to the Afghan government within 96 hours of capture. <br /><br />The United States has released some Afghans through the National Peace and Reconciliation Committee. Others, defined by the Pentagon as &quot;low level enemy combatants,&quot; have been transferred to Afghan custody for prosecution in the Afghan National Defense Facility (ANDF), built by the United States, in Pul-e-Charkhi prison in the outskirts of Kabul. (See <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/USLS-080409-arbitrary-justice-report.pdf">Human Rights First, Arbitrary Justice: Trials of Bagram and Guantanamo Detainees in Afghanistan</a> [PDF file]). While in ANDF, detainees are tried by Afghan authorities under Afghan national security law. I observed trials of former detainees at the ANDF. These trials fall far short of international or even Afghan fair trial standards. Nevertheless, while in Afghan custody, detainees are able to meet their families. The ICRC, the Afghan human rights commission, and the UN all have access to the detainees. President Karzai also has appointed a presidential review committee to evaluate allegations against detainees transferred from the United States and assess whether they should be prosecuted. The transfer to Afghan custody and use of the regular criminal justice system to adjudicate guilt or innocence, and ultimately the duration of continued detention, is a significant change from indefinite detention without judicial review in U.S. military custody. <br /><br /><strong>The Way Forward</strong><br /><br />While a U.S. court is examining the reach of the writ of habeas corpus, the incoming Obama Administration should break with past policies and commit to the application of the rule of law to Bagram detainees. Bagram should not be allowed to remain a law-free zone.<br /><br /><em>Release or Transfer Detainees for Prosecution</em>: In June 2002, the government of Hamid Karzai was elected, and the international armed conflict between the United States and the Taliban government ended. In an internal, non-international armed conflict, such as the present conflict in Afghanistan, persons can only be detained pursuant to domestic law. Thus, where appropriate, persons captured by Coalition Forces in Afghanistan after June 2002 should be treated as criminal suspects under Afghan law and transferred to Afghan authorities for prosecution. Some of these detainees can also be prosecuted in U.S. federal courts if suspected of having committed offenses against the United States.  Those who cannot be prosecuted should be released. Detainees captured overseas and brought to Afghanistan should be repatriated, released, or transferred for criminal prosecution in their home country or in U.S. federal courts.<br /><br />This will be a lengthy process, requiring on-going U.S. diligence. To reduce the risk of further abuses, it will be critical to immediately implement mechanisms to monitor post-transfer Afghan proceedings and to ensure that those transferred are not subjected to ill-treatment. <br /><br /><em>Assist with Judicial Reform</em>: Fair trial and treatment of Bagram detainees transferred to Afghan authorities will require significant resources for training judges, prosecutors, lawyers, law enforcement agencies, and the development of court and prison infrastructure. The United States is one of the largest donors for justice sector reform in Afghanistan and, in coordination with European nations, should extend judicial reform efforts to improve the fairness of trials in Afghan courts for persons engaged in hostile actions against Afghan and Coalition Forces. The U.S. should provide more personnel and resources to Judge Advocate General (JAG) officers - the judicial arm of the U.S. military - in Afghanistan so they can assess and prepare evidentiary files for detainees and train soldiers on evidence collection as is done in Iraq. A serious contribution to the rule of law in Afghanistan could be a true lasting legacy of the United States. <br /><br /><em>End Practice of Bringing Detainees to Afghanistan</em>: The Obama Administration must end the practice of transferring persons captured outside of Afghanistan to Bagram and detaining them until the &quot;cessation of hostilities.&quot; <br /><br />A prison such as Bagram created with an express purpose of avoiding compliance with the law is fundamentally at odds with American values. Strategically, it&#39;s also a mistake. Detaining a large number of prisoners indefinitely and without criminal charge is not the best way to win the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; and cooperation of the local population in Afghanistan. A real commitment by the Obama Administration to bring the United States within the rule of law is not limited to closing Guantanamo, but must involve creative thinking to reverse the policy mistakes of the Bush Administration. Bagram must not become Obama&#39;s Guantanamo.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Nusrat Jahan Choudhury</strong> [Attorney, Karpatkin Fellow, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a>]: &quot;A year and a half after the American Civil Liberties Union and New York Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Raed Jarrar, the defendants - two Transportation Security Administration officials and JetBlue Airways - agreed to pay him $240,000 to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/tsa-officials-and-jetblue-airways.php">settle his claims</a> that they discriminated against him on the basis of his racial and ethnic background and violated his First Amendment rights.<br /><br />This settlement is a victory. Even absent a court judgment, it marks progress in the fight to promote safety and security in civil aviation while protecting the civil rights and liberties that are the hallmark of this country.<br /><br />When TSA and JetBlue officials prevented Mr. Jarrar from boarding his flight at John F. Kennedy Airport until he covered his t-shirt, they treated him differently from all of the other passengers in the gate area. When JetBlue decided to move Mr. Jarrar from his seat in row 3 to the back of the airplane, it once again singled him out for differential treatment.<br /><br />Why? Ostensibly because other passengers had expressed concern about what he wore: an ordinary black t-shirt that featured the sentence &quot;We Will Not Be Silent&quot; in Arabic and English.<br /><br />The lawsuit revealed, however, that neither the TSA officials involved nor JetBlue could identify a single passenger who had supposedly been &quot;concerned&quot; by Mr. Jarrar&#39;s t-shirt. Nor had they inquired whether the nature of any purported &quot;concern&quot; was based on a legitimate reason or an illegitimate racial bias, perhaps grounded in the stereotyping of Mr. Jarrar as a &quot;terrorist&quot; simply because he is Arab and wore a shirt with Arabic script. The lawsuit also revealed that the defendants took their actions even though they did not consider Mr. Jarrar to pose a security threat.<br /><br />Mr. Jarrar was nevertheless singled out for differential treatment. And according to him, not only did JetBlue and two TSA officials make it clear that he would be unable to fly unless he covered his t-shirt, one TSA official told Mr. Jarrar that wearing a shirt with Arabic script on it was akin to &quot;wearing a t-shirt at a bank stating, &#39;I am a robber.&#39;&quot;<br /><br />The t-shirt that Mr. Jarrar wore on August 12, 2006, reflected who he is - an Iraqi-born U.S. resident and a vocal critic of the war in Iraq. Its &quot;We Will Not Be Silent&quot; message was coined by student peace activists challenging the rise of Nazism before World War II. That the t-shirt featured this message in both English and Arabic, Mr. Jarrar&#39;s native language, further reflected Mr. Jarrar&#39;s identity as an Arab immigrant to the United States.<br /><br />Requiring Mr. Jarrar to cover his t-shirt and moving him to the back of the plane did nothing to promote safety or security. It did, however, relegate him to the status of a second-class citizen for being and expressing who he is.<br /><br />This incident underscores that ordinary, law-abiding Muslims, Sikhs, Arabs, South Asians, and people perceived to be of these backgrounds continue to experience differential treatment by airlines and government officials when engaging in air travel - even though they do nothing to warrant heightened security scrutiny.<br /><br />This treatment is unacceptable. In our country, diversity, inclusiveness, and a commitment to equality and liberty are defining characteristics and rank among our greatest strengths.<br /><br />Mr. Jarrar courageously challenged the racial profiling he experienced and the infringement of his First Amendment rights by filing a lawsuit. The settlement of his claims for a landmark sum of $240,000 sends a clear message: airlines and government officials cannot discriminate against passengers based on their race or the ethnic content of their speech.<br /><br />We have the ability to promote security in air travel while protecting rights to freedom of speech and freedom from racial discrimination protected by the Constitution and civil rights laws. When airlines and government officials fail to respect these rights, they should be held accountable.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ambroise Pierre</strong> [<a href="http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=36">Africa Desk</a>, <a href="http://www.rsf.org/">Reporters Without Borders</a>]: &quot;As head of Paris-based Reporters Without Borders&#39; Africa desk, I am both concerned and exasperated by the harsh conditions in which the Zimbabwe authorities <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/trial-on-hold-pending-medical-care-for.php">are holding journalist</a> and human rights activist <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=38377691731">Jestina Mukoko</a>. <br /><br />First of all, I am concerned because her state of health has seriously deteriorated in the last few weeks. We know that she was tortured in prison after she was abducted from her home on December 3, 2008, and then held in secret for nearly three weeks. In addition, she has been put in solitary confinement in Chikurubi high security prison, which will undoubtedly prove extremely grueling for her. Jestina Mukoko is sick and needs medical treatment, which is being denied to her by the men who are holding her. <br /><br />Exasperated as well, because it seems that the courts in Zimbabwe, answering to the orders of the country&#39;s political authorities, are doing everything to keep her in detention, even though a High Court ruling on December 24 determined that she should be taken to a hospital. The trial of Jestina Mukoko and her co-accused is a sham, the rights of the detainees are being trampled on, and hearings are constantly being adjourned. As for the charges against this director of the human rights organization, the <a href="http://kubatana.net/html/archive/archorg_index.asp?orgcode=zim028">Zimbabwe Peace Project</a> (ZPP), they are absurd and baseless. Hidden behind the charge of &quot;a terrorist plot aiming to overthrow President Robert Mugabe&quot; is the reality of the authorities&#39; determination to hound opposition activists. <br /><br />It is as though the regime of Robert Mugabe was trying to undermine the power-sharing agreement signed with the opposition in September 2008, as though Mugabe has decided to lay bare his cruelty in gagging any independent and critical voices. Against this background, negotiations between the ruling ZANU-PF party and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai&#39;s <a href="http://www.mdc.co.zw/">Movement for Democratic Change</a> (MDC) will prove to be complicated.&quot;<br />

		<title>Amnesty International&#039;s anti-Israel stance undermines human rights and international law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.globallawforum.org/page.aspx?id=16"><strong>Avi Bell</strong></a> [Director, <a href="http://www.globallawforum.org/Default.aspx">Global Law Forum</a>, <a href="http://www.jcpa.org/">Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs</a>]: &quot;It is tragic when distinguished human rights organizations soil their reputations by resorting to falsehoods and legal misstatements in the service of political propaganda. Unfortunately, this is the only way to characterize Amnesty International&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-accuses-us-of-insufficient.php">January 2 broadside against Israel</a> in an open <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/LetterToSecretaryRice.pdf">letter</a> [PDF file] to the US Secretary of State.<br /> <br />Amnesty purports to be &quot;deeply concerned about the escalation of human rights abuses following the series of Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip that began on December 27th,&quot; but it fails to mention nearly all of them. Newspaper reports indicate that the Hamas terrorist organization has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE4BS1QG20081229?virtualBrandChannel=10112">dispatched death squads</a> to summarily execute Palestinians accused of &quot;collaborating&quot; with Israel. Hamas has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J08GqXMr3YE">seized children</a> [video] and other civilians and illegally used them to shield combatants from attack. It has hidden weapons and combatants in <a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=42093">mosques and hospitals</a>, and dressed its combatants in civilian dress in illegal acts of perfidy. Hamas has targeted and murdered Israeli Jews in the service of an <a href="http://globallawforum.org/UserFiles/puzzle1.pdf">explicitly genocidal ideology</a> [PDF file]. Hamas has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7801881.stm">denied wounded Palestinian civilians permission</a> to cross the border to waiting Egyptian ambulances in Sinai. Hamas has sought to preempt challenges to its post-coup d&#39;etat rule in Gaza by <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1230733155685&pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull">preemptively detaining, maiming and murdering</a> rivals in the Fatah terror group/militia. And, of course, Hamas itself is a terrorist organization to which states must deny material support and safe haven under <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/sc7158.doc.htm">Security Council Resolution 1373</a> and various international conventions. Other than a pro forma reference to Hamas&#39; indiscriminate rocket attacks, Amnesty&#39;s letter mentions none of these facts, nor any of the other human rights abuses Hamas has inflicted upon the Palestinian population under its control in Gaza, such as restrictions on religious practice, speech and due process.<br /> <br />Instead, Amnesty bristles at imaginary Israeli wrongdoing. Amnesty writes that &quot;aid agencies and residents of Gaza have long ago run out of provision reserves due to the Israeli blockade&quot; just two days after the UN&#39;s World Food Program <a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=42061">informed</a> the Israel Defense Forces that it would not be resuming shipment of food commodities to Gaza through Israeli crossings because WFP  warehouses were already at full capacity. In service of its indefensible claim that Israel is not acting in &quot;legitimate self-defense,&quot; Amnesty carefully omits the material fact that the current round of fighting began when Hamas, on December 19, <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/19/mideast/mideast.php">announced an end to the cease-fire</a> and attacked Israeli cities with the declared aim of bringing thousands of Israeli civilians &quot;under fire.&quot; In contrast, Israel&#39;s air strikes on Gaza were only commenced 8 days later, in response to the <a href="http://www.maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&ID=34211">more than 100 Hamas attacks</a> in the preceding week. Amnesty falsely insinuates that Hamas has done no wrong in hiding its combatants within the civilian population, and falsely insinuates that Israel has no legal right to strike at Hamas combat targets in urban areas due to the expected collateral damage. Amnesty falsely insinuates that Israel is not allowing Palestinians passage for medical treatment even as <a href="http://imra.org.il/story.php3?id=42061">Israel treats Palestinian wounded</a> in Israeli hospitals at Israeli expense. Amnesty accuses Israel of failing to meet the legal requirements of necessity, proportionality and distinction in its combat operations, despite all the evidence to date that Israel is complying fully by solely targeting Hamas positions. And Amnesty implies that because Hamas has thus far failed in its mission of slaughtering mass numbers of Israeli Jews, the rule of proportionality grants Hamas forces near-total immunity from defensive Israeli measures. This perverse interpretation of the rule of proportionality has never been accepted or even proffered in any other conflict in the world, and  legal scholars commenting on the fighting thus far, from traditional opponents of Israel to supporters (<a href="http://opiniojuris.org/2009/01/03/dershowitz-on-israel-and-proportionality/">Kevin Jon Heller</a>, <a href="http://www.volokh.com/posts/1231001072.shtml">Eric Posner</a>, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123085925621747981.html">Alan Dershowitz</a>, <a href="http://www.ejiltalk.org/a-follow-up-on-israel-and-gaza/">Marko Milanovic</a> and <a href="http://www.ejiltalk.org/israeli-raids-in-gaza-proportionality-and-the-status-of-hamas-policemen/#more-283">Dapo Akande</a>, so far), have universally rejected it.<br /> <br />Amnesty&#39;s attack is not simply Israel&#39;s problem. It is a tragedy for human rights supporters everywhere. By abusing the language of human rights and international law to promote a political agenda based on factual and legal falsehoods, Amnesty International undermines the cause of human rights and international law. Amnesty&#39;s letter seems designed to convince rank-and-file Israelis to ignore international law, because their country will be attacked as guilty no matter what it does. Simulataneously, Amnesty&#39;s letter signals to Hamas and other anti-Israel terrorist groups that they can violate human rights and commit war crimes, yet still enjoy human rights organizations&#39; de facto support.  Unfortunately, Amnesty is not alone in its campaign against the values it purports to uphold; Human Rights Watch too issued an <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/12/30/israelhamas-civilians-must-not-be-targets">anti-Israel statement</a> on December 30 containing many of the same falsehoods and material omissions as Amnesty&#39;s letter. But Amnesty International&#39;s company in wrongdoing is no excuse; indeed, it makes the need for accuracy all the more pressing.<br /> <br />Shame on Amnesty International. The many Palestinian and Israeli victims of Hamas&#39;s war crimes and crimes against humanity deserve better.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.davidchandler.org"><strong>David Chandler</strong></a> [Professor of International Relations, Department of Politics and International Relations, <a href="http://www.wmin.ac.uk/">University of Westminster</a>]: &quot;Nearly two decades after its establishment, in 1993, the ad hoc <a href="http://www.icty.org/sections/AbouttheICTY ">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) plans to close by the beginning of 2012 and is slowly winding down. In the process, the ICTY is transferring the task of pursuing prosecutions arising from the 1992-1995 Bosnian war to the domestic Bosnian courts, with the recently established Bosnian War Crimes Chamber (WCC) playing a central role. <br /> <br />In this context, international commentators have stressed that it is now up to Bosnians themselves to ensure that their war criminals are held to account. It is <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/ij0206webwcover.pdf ">argued</a> [pdf file] that by bringing justice closer to the people of Bosnia the domestic judicial process will assist much more in the task of bringing reconciliation. There is little doubting the activism of the Bosnian courts, evidenced by the Bosnian Prosecutor&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/bosnia-prosecutor-indicts-8-bosnian.php">announcement</a>, on January 8, 2009, that 8 former Serb military police were being indicted for war crimes committed on Mount Vla&Aring;&iexcl;i&Auml;&#8225; in August 1992. The men are <a href="http://www.tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/?id=331&jezik=e ">alleged</a> to have taken part in the massacre of over 200 Bosniak and Croat men, throwing their bodies into the deep ravine.<br /> <br />However, Bosnian dissatisfaction with the judicial approach to war crimes has little to do with whether alleged war criminals are pursued by the ICTY or the domestic WCC. The attempt to apply the law to atrocities committed in the Bosnian war looks set to continue to lead to frustration, disappointment and division. Understanding civil conflict as a series of war crimes neither helps reconciliation nor the development of a collective sense of justice. Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/ij0207webwcover.pdf ">argues</a> that, &quot;There are literally thousands of war crimes cases emanating from the conflict, which have not yet been addressed...the criminal justice system as a whole - is not in a position to handle all of these cases.&quot; For families who lost relatives and loved ones to the war, the special recognition of some deaths as war crimes and not others is seen as a slight to their own suffering. <br /> <br />It is clear that the ICTY and the WCC can only ever be selective in their judgments, and that legal approaches to war crimes can never include every act of war or recognise every victim. Through its external pressure, the international community has forced Bosnian discourse to become mired in a competition over claims to recognition of victim status - claims which can never be satisfied and <a href=" http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/0000000CAC9B.htm">can only be divisive</a>. Postwar reconciliation has little to do with legal judgments and much more to do with the practice of getting on with life and developing shared interests in the present. The high international judicial profile given to the Bosnian war has become a major barrier to Bosnian people focusing on their shared future, rather than their divided past.&quot;<br />

		<title>Guantanamo detainees seeking UK asylum would face uncertain future under current law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Liz Griffith</strong> [Policy Officer, <a href="http://www.lawcentreni.org/">Law Centre</a> (NI), Belfast, Northern Ireland]: &quot;President-elect Obama&#39;s apparent decision to close Guantanamo has received wide support in the UK government. Nine UK nationals were returned to the UK in 2004 and 2005 following extensive campaigning by civic society and high level representations from the UK government. Three men who were previously lawfully resident in the UK were also returned in December 2007. Organizations, such as Amnesty International, are still campaigning for the release of 3 more men who have connections to the UK.<br /><br />Despite speculation, the Foreign Office has confirmed that it has made no formal offer to the US to accept any <em>additional</em> detainees. However, the UK has urged European countries to follow its example in respect of their own nationals and former legal residents.<br /><br />This comment outlines a backdrop to some of the legal issues that could arise if the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/ireland-open-to-accepting-released.php">UK agrees to accept additional detainees</a>. This only applies to Guantanamo detainees from other countries, such as Yemen, who have never held UK residency and have no UK connections but who cannot be returned to their own country.<br /><br /><strong>Exclusion from refugee status</strong><br /><br />A Guantanamo detainee may be eligible to submit an application for asylum in the UK under the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/protect/PROTECTION/3b66c2aa10.pdf">1951 Refugee Convention</a> [PDF file]. However, the Refugee Convention contains exclusion clauses that prevent its provisions being extended to persons who are considered to have committed serious crimes or to be a threat to national security. In such circumstances, a person cannot be awarded the usual 5 years limited leave or refugee status, or the equivalent human rights status. Potentially, these exclusion clauses could apply to some Guantanamo detainees. However, none of the returned Guantanamo detainees have been brought to trial in the UK.<br /><br /><strong>Living in limbo?</strong><br /><br />What status, if any, could thus be granted to detainees who are excluded from refugee status? This issue became apparent in February 2000 when nine Afghans intent on fleeing the Taliban hijacked an airplane and flew to London. The then Home Secretary expressed his determination to deport everyone on the airplane. However, the nine hijackers, fearing reprisals, argued that they would be subject to torture or serious harm on return to Afghanistan. The exclusion criteria clearly applied and the UK would be in breach of its human rights obligations if it were to deport the men. The government was determined not to grant the hijackers any form of status that would enable them to work, study or access benefits, thus effectively leaving the men in limbo. The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,4565c22538,45a51ac42,470269f92,0.html">case</a> was heard before the Court of Appeal amidst widespread political controversy and media condemnation. The court ruled it unlawful to leave the hijackers in limbo and ordered a grant of leave, to be reviewed every six months. This was a landmark case in asylum law and could potentially affect Guantanamo detainees.<br /><br /><strong>Anti-terror legislation and Control Orders</strong><br /><br />Another issue that may be relevant to Guantanamo Bay detainees deemed to pose a terrorist threat is Control Orders. Following the events of September 11th 2001, the UK government entered a derogation to the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art5">European Convention on Human Rights Article 5</a>(right to liberty and security). This derogation enabled parliament to pass the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/ukpga_20010024_en_1">Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001</a> which provided for indefinite detention without trial for foreign nationals who were considered a risk to national security but whose deportation would put them at risk of ill treatment. Ten men were detained under these new powers and were not brought to trial as the government argued that prosecution would risk revealing &quot;sensitive and dangerous intelligence.&quot;  However, after a lengthy legal battle, the government&#39;s derogation was quashed by the House of Lords who <a href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd041216/a&oth-1.htm">ruled</a> that even if a public emergency existed, the legislative response was disproportionate and that the discriminatory aspect was incompatible with the Convention.  <br /><br />The government responded by enacting new anti-terror legislation, the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2005/ukpga_20050002_en_1">Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005</a>. This provided the legislative basis for Control Orders: a stringent restriction regime sometimes referred to as a &quot;prison without bars.&quot; Control Orders have attracted significant legal scrutiny and the courts have <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldjudgmt/jd071031/homejj-1.htm">declared</a> some of the most intrusive restrictions &#8212; such as 18 hour curfews - to be incompatible with human rights legislation.  However, in February 2008, parliament renewed Control Orders legislation and their validity. This could mean that a Guantanamo detainee resettled in the UK could become subject to a Control Order.<br /><br /><strong>The political climate</strong><br /><br />It remains unclear what would happen to any additional detainees who are resettled in the UK. Asylum is a highly politicized issue in the UK and each year sees the advent of new, more stringent legislation that affects all forms of immigration. In recent years, parliament has attempted to pass legislation that could undermine human rights such as increasing pre-charge detention to 42 days. In this instance, the House of Lords acted to prevent its implementation. The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court on Human Rights</a> (ECtHR) has thankfully remained somewhat impervious to the changing political climate and has consistently ruled against states&#39; attempts to reduce human rights obligations. For example, last year ECtHR <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?docid=47c6882e2">declared</a> that states could not rely on &quot;memorandums of understanding,&quot; a form of diplomatic assurance that European states argued would prevent the torture or ill treatment of a person if deported to their home country.  Despite the worrying political trends to the contrary, civic society is hopeful that human rights will gain new respect under the new US administration. All eyes are on Obama!&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Marc D. Stern</strong> [Acting Co-Executive Director/General Counsel, <a href="http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer">American Jewish Congress</a>]: &quot;Amnesty International reads the law of war as if it was a law banning war. In evaluating <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-accuses-us-of-insufficient.php">Amnesty&#39;s criticisms of Israel&#39;s actions in Gaza</a>, one needs to take into account the manifold ways it distorts a body of law which actually permits, while regulating, war. <br /><br />Amnesty perversely reads that body of law in ways that unduly handcuff nations with legitimate reasons for military action. Indeed, in a recent letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice about the Gaza conflict, Amnesty imposes a new - and entirely unfounded - restriction on the use of military force: that it be &quot;strictly necessary.&quot; Presumably Israel&#39;s assault on Gaza is not &quot;strictly necessary.&quot; Israel could live with ongoing rocket attacks or simply accept whatever terms Hamas dictates as a condition for stopping its rocket fire. Fortunately for the rest of us, peace at any price or yielding to blackmail by rocket fire is not required by international law.<br /><br />These distortions are plainly evident in a series of statements and letters Amnesty has written since Israel began its invasion of Gaza. Although these statements rely repeatedly on the principle of distinction - requiring combatants to do their best to distinguish between civilians and combatants - Amnesty manages to not once mention Hamas&#39; plain duty under that principle to avoid placing its military assets (i.e., rockets and rocket launchers) amongst civilians in civilian neighborhoods. If one wants to protect civilians, that is the place to start.<br /><br />There is no question that such a duty exists and that, as demonstrated by a <a href="http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/pdf/hamas_e028.pdf">report</a> [PDF file] by Israel&#39;s Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, Hamas pays it no mind. Amnesty necessarily also elides the point that Hamas&#39; violation does not immunize dual use military sites from attacks which inevitably have collateral consequences of harm to civilians.<br /><br />Amnesty&#39;s silence about that systematic violation of the law of war is made worse by the fact that Hamas&#39; &quot;fighters&quot; often wear no uniform or identifying symbols as soldiers of national armies must do, so that it is far more difficult to distinguish them from civilians in the first place. <br /><br />These human shield tactics, used as well by Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Taliban in Afghanistan, are what put civilians in harm&#39;s way, not Israel&#39;s attacks. Pretending such a duty does not exist, but insisting that Israel may not attack such sites because they endanger civilians, is to confer on Hamas de facto immunity from military action except at the precise instant a rocket is being launched and then only if no civilians are in the vicinity, a circumstance that does not often exist in Gaza. It is certain that those nations which ratified the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols did not intend for international law to be a terrorist&#39;s most impenetrable shield.<br /><br />It is equally telling that while Amnesty repeatedly denounces Israel&#39;s attacks as &quot;disproportionate,&quot; it never explains to what the attacks are disproportionate. Reading its materials, it appears to understand proportionality to mean &quot;too many Palestinian casualties,&quot; an irrelevant figure in calculating proportionality. But even on this made-up test of proportionality, Israel&#39;s actions pass muster. By Amnesty&#39;s own figures, the overwhelming number of persons killed are not civilians, but Hamas personnel. Hamas has so admitted, boasting of its &quot;martyrs.&quot; By Israeli figures, some three-quarters of the dead are not civilians. <br /><br />More importantly, the actual texts of the Geneva Conventions use an entirely different proportionality calculus. The texts talk of civilian casualties disproportionate to the expected military advantage, not casualties disproportionately on one side or the other. Amnesty makes no effort whatsoever to make any military advantage calculus, evidently on the theory that it is legally irrelevant. <br /><br />We know, too, from prior correspondence with Amnesty that whatever shrunken conception of military advantage it has is at odds with that of the sovereign nations that have ratified law of war treaties. Amnesty thinks every individual attack (bullet) must be analyzed. The history of the relevant treaties established that what is relevant is whether the individual attack makes a measurable contribution to the overall military objective. In Amnesty&#39;s view, destroying a small missile depot or a single rocket launcher, insufficient in itself to change the strategic or tactual balance, can never justify harm to civilians. The law however is otherwise, so long as the attack has more than a trivial effect on the overall war effort. Wars are typically won by cumulating small actions, not by a few decisive blows.<br /><br />Finally, Amnesty perversely criticizes Israel for warning civilians that attacks are planned. If Israel does not warn civilians, its attacks are, for Amnesty, indiscriminate; if it warns civilians (thereby often alerting legitimate targets as well, so that they too can flee), it is guilty of fear-mongering. This makes sense only if one thinks international law gives an absolute immunity to civilians from the costs of war. It doesn&#39;t. <br /><br />Civilian casualties as such are always truly unfortunate, and to be avoided if possible. They are not illegal on the law as it exists, nor should they be so long as war is legal. Amnesty - if its real game is not simply sympathy for Hamas - might like it to be otherwise. It is free to urge a change in the law of war; it is not free to impose such a change unilaterally by distortion.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://nimj.org/myGrid.aspx?base=Staff">Jonathan Tracy</a> [Assistant Director, <a href="http://nimj.org/home.aspx">National Institute of Military Justice</a>]: &quot;Several reports, including the recent Senate Armed Services Committee <a href="http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/supporting/2008/Detainees.121108.pdf">Inquiry into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody</a> [PDF file], confirm that U.S. agents committed or tolerated abuses.  Further, the evidence indicates that since September 11, 2001, violations of U.S. law, international human rights law and international humanitarian law have been approved by senior administration officials and carried out by U.S. military and civilian personnel.  I hope that once in office, <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-not-ruling-out-prosecution-of.php"><strong>President Obama will not allow</strong></a> these events to pass ignobly into the dark recesses of history.  The American public deserves a full accounting of what its representative government did in the name of security.  To do otherwise would continue the erosion of America&#39;s moral standing in the world, and, more importantly, give further credence to the undemocratic notion that certain individuals and offices exist above the law. <br /> <br />The U.S. military considers the obligations imposed by the law of war binding upon every soldier, sailor, airman and marine.  A Department of Defense Regulation requires that all service members must comply with the law of war &quot;during all armed conflicts, however such conflicts are characterized, and in all other military operations.&quot;  The prohibition against torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment has long been considered a violation of the law of war.  Corresponding articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the law that governs the prosecution of military personnel, criminalize acts by service members that constitute ill treatment of captured persons.  However, an important goal of military law is to not limit responsibility to the lowest persons in the chain of command.  The principle of &quot;command responsibility&quot; has long been a theory of liability in military prosecutions.  Basically, senior officials can be legally responsible for illegal actions of subordinates when the commander ordered the illegal act, knew of the act, either before or during its commission, and did nothing to prevent it, or should have known and failed to take necessary and reasonable steps to insure compliance with the law of war.  Based on this principle, prosecuting only lower-level soldiers is not enough when some responsibility belongs to senior commanders and administration officials.  Instead, there must be a thorough investigation and accounting on all rungs of the chain of command.      <br /> <br />I believe that early in his administration, President Obama should appoint a non-partisan commission to examine, and provide a comprehensive report on, allegations of detainee abuse and on the policies and procedures that were implemented by all relevant government offices and agencies.  When evidence indicates that senior officials bear responsibility the law must be used to deliver justice.  One of the cornerstones of a liberal democracy is that the government will operate openly.  Such openness is an essential check on government abuse and the arbitrary application of power.  But years of secrecy have diminished this principle, further eroding our democratic principles.  To stem this erosion and regain our stature and commitment to democracy, President Obama must allow for an open and comprehensive investigation of this sad chapter in our history.  This will allow us to chart a new course.&quot;<br />

		<title>Germany&#039;s use of sovereign immunity to block claims from WWII atrocities lacks basis in international law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Alexandros-Ioannis Kargopoulos</strong> [Attorney (Thessaloniki-Greece), Faculty member - <a href="http://www.esdi.gr/">Hellenic National School of Judges</a>]: &quot;Germany&#39;s action against Italy has, once more, fueled the debate around a quite controversial legal subject: the issue of state immunity and WWII civil actions brought in national courts. This subject has been in the epicenter of many judgments delivered during the last decade. However, it was the Italian Supreme Court, which by issuing a landmark judgment on the <u>Ferrini</u> case, held that Germany was not entitled to immunity for the serious violations committed by its armed forces of occupation during WWII. It is the rationale adopted in these judgments that Germany&#39;s action is directed against and it does so by invoking the application of state immunity that the Italian courts have rejected.<br /><br />The proponents of state immunity, like Germany in this instance, widely envisage state immunity as a fundamental right of the state flowing from customary international law and uphold its value by resorting to the principle <em>par in parem non habet imperium</em>, according to which a state cannot be submitted to the judicial organs of another state because they are equal. Moreover, in a subsidiary basis, state immunity is invoked in order to avoid discord in international relations and cooperation. However, this conception of state immunity is defective as state immunity is not a &quot;right,&quot; but only an exemption to the fundamental principle of the exclusive adjudicatory jurisdiction of national courts. As the President of the ICJ, Judge Rosalyn Higgins has stated in the past: &quot;It is very easy to elevate sovereign immunity into a superior principle of international law and to lose sight of the essential reality that it is an exception to the normal doctrine of jurisdiction.&quot; <br /><br />In particular, according to the fundamental principles of international law, state sovereignty, territorial integrity and adjudicatory jurisdiction, a state enjoys absolute and exclusive adjudicatory jurisdiction inside its borders due to its sovereignty. Therefore, the capacity of a foreign state as a subject of rights diminishes, when it &quot;conflicts&quot; with another state&#39;s exclusive jurisdiction, especially when this conflict takes place inside the territory of the forum state where the perpetrator state and its organs have no authority at all. In result, any persons and property found inside the forum state should be under its sole control and authority. For none of the fundamental principles of international law, neither the theory <em>par in parem non habet imperium</em>, can persuasively lead to the conclusion that a state is barred from applying its adjudicatory jurisdiction over another state and especially when the dispute concerns acts conducted by the foreign state inside the territory of the forum state. Hence, &quot;there is not a rule of international law obliging states to grant jurisdictional immunity to other states&quot; and thus, the forum state has absolute competence, by implementing its internal legal rules, to adjust the privileges of jurisdictional immunities of foreign states. State jurisdictional immunity can not be considered a right, but only a privilege granted by national law and courts acting on their discretion. Furthermore, pleas of state immunity can be rejected, even in the light of opposite case law or legislation, directly by the supreme nature of <em>jus cogens</em> rules. Those rules create, according to the ICJ, obligations <em>erga omnes</em> and thus, widen the right, but also dictate the duty of states to act against these violations. Consequently, <em>jus cogens</em> rules should be afforded supreme means of enforcement and should quash pleas of state jurisdictional immunity. <br /><br />This is clearly reflected in Article 12 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/English/Notpubl/English_3_13.Pdf">2004 UN Convention on the Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property</a> [PDF file], which specifically provides that states cannot plea immunity in order to evade their civil liability arising out of death or injury of natural persons and out of damage or loss of property. It is also noteworthy that the implementation of that treaty does not depend on the characterisation of the disputed acts as <em>iure imperii</em> or <em>iure gestionis</em> and that it applies even in the event of civil claims arising out of acts or omissions of armed forces, whether those acts were conducted during peacetime or during the course of war. The same position more or less has been adopted by common law countries, which in contrast to most European countries that resolve this issue as a matter of international law, deal with state immunity as an internal legal issue and regulate it through the use of national legal rules and legislation, which provide for similar instances where a foreign state is to be held liable in national courts, even if it acts <em>iure imperii</em>.<br /> <br />For all those reasons, it has been suggested that state jurisdictional immunity grants states with disproportionate protection than that which is provided for by international law precepts, especially when the respective claims arise due to gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law. In reality, a foreign state is granted immunity due to commands originating from the political authorities and not due to international law imperatives. Therefore, whenever the principle of sovereign immunity is applied to cover acts that bear the seal of sovereign power, the judiciary is actually pre-empted from hearing the dispute. Accordingly, courts resort to the distinction of <em>iure imperii</em> and <em>iure gestionis</em> acts with the purpose of avoiding the adjudication of politically sensitive cases. <br /><br />Nevertheless, the Italian courts have, quite courageously, shown in practice that the necessity to affirm values of extreme significance, is leading to fundamental changes when dealing with the issue of state liability, since what has led them to refuse jurisdictional immunity to the German state was not  &quot;...merely the formal supremacy of the <em>jus cogens</em> category,...but the substantial importance which can be attributed to the values protected by these norms, in contrast to the traditional principle of state sovereignty.&quot; National courts have exclusive adjudicatory jurisdiction and thus are able, but more importantly, are obliged to adjudicate these matters due to the importance of <em>jus cogens</em> norms and <em>erga omnes</em> obligations to the international legal order. Although, on the one hand, it may true be that enforcement of these judgments is a distinct issue to which legal limitations apply, on the other, there is nothing obliging the courts to refrain from issuing decisions on the merits of cases involving gross violations of <em>jus cogens</em> norms of international humanitarian and human rights law. Quite the opposite, by acknowledging that private persons have a limited capacity to respond against crimes committed by foreign states and that a state has the right, but also the obligation, to protect its own citizens and respond to such violations by recognizing them as a violations against itself, it follows that, national courts are the appropriate forum to deal with the respective claims. <br /><br />Concerning the specific action, it seems to be ironic that Germany is a big supporter of the ICC and of the fight against impunity of international crimes and one of the few supporters of the attribution to the ICC of a true and unlimited universal jurisdiction, while, at the same time, it persistently refuses to withhold the same commitments in regards to the so many heinous crimes that its armed forces committed during WWII. Truly, in the eyes of an objective observer, it is obvious that Germany, by resorting to an outdated conception of state immunity and claiming to herself an immune status, is egoistically applying a different set of criteria to herself than to others. More importantly, in that way Germany practically renounces her undeniable responsibility for the commission of those dreadful crimes vis-&agrave;-vis those who were mostly affected: the victims and their descendants. Every crime must bring consequences for the perpetrators and if this means that Germany is to be found liable in national courts then it should be held so. Quite significantly also, it should be borne in mind that the ultimate function of state immunity should be to protect a state from its arbitrary subjection to a foreign sovereign, which pursues its own political ends. <br /><br />In this instance, this is far from the truth, as the Italian courts are not pursuing political ends, but they rather aim at the attribution of justice through the implementation of supranational legal norms in protecting what is the undisputed and grossly violated rights of victims of unimaginable atrocities. In this manner, the Italian courts not only have reinforced some of the most fundamental principles of international law, but more importantly, they have upheld the function of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary against executive power at international level. As such, Germany&#39;s complaint is aimed not only against the highest values of international law and the precepts of human rights and humanitarian law, but against the independent functioning of national courts which deliver substantial justice. And as such, the ICJ, should acknowledge, by reference to Art 38 par 1 (b) and (d) of its statute, the validity of the Italian judgments and uphold the same values that the Italian courts have promoted and thus enhance both the implementation of international law at the national level and the independence of the judiciary by not submitting to the will of the executive -in this case that of Germany.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Asim Qureshi</strong> [Senior Researcher, <a href="http://www.cageprisoners.com/">Cageprisoners</a>]: &quot;One of the key components of the Bush administration&#39;s understanding of torture is the extreme technicality with which they approach the topic. When the teenager <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsJawad.html">Mohammed Jawad</a> was captured in Afghanistan in 2002, his abuse at the hands of his captors was by Afghans and not US personnel. It is this fact that provides the Bush administration with the technicality they need in order to attempt to bypass the rules against torture.<br /><br />This form of legal manipulation in many ways is symptomatic of the US led War on Terror. The humanity of the strongest norms of human rights and international law have been reduced to a difference of legal opinion in a process where the US has sought to pave its own will into international legal order.<br /><br />What is forgotten in the process of legalizing torture, arbitrary detention and rendition, is that the norms that were established to protect the innocent and guilty were put into place to directly deal with the world in which we live in today. The Geneva Conventions and <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Convention Against Torture</a> find their most relevance in today&#39;s world, a world where the lines of humanity are being blurred by all.<br /><br />Using technicalities to circumvent the rule against torture only serves one purpose, and that is to deny the essence of the rule and its importance to the world and future generations. In the case of Jawad the <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/federal-circuit-hears-guantanamo.php">ruling of judge Stephen Henley</a> that Jawad&#39;s confessions were obtained in circumstances that amount to torture and duress should be commended and ordered to stand, for such judgments truly recognize the ethics of the law.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Steven R. Shapiro</strong>, <strong>Robin L. Dahlberg</strong>, <strong>Dan Barrett</strong> [<a href="http://www.aclu.org">ACLU</a>], <strong>Anthony Franze</strong>, <strong>Robert Stolworthy</strong> and <strong>Stanton Jones</strong> [<a href="http://www.arnoldporter.com/">Arnold &amp; Porter LLP</a>]: &quot;On January 13, 2009, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/supreme-court-hears-right-to-counsel.php">heard argument</a> in <u>Vermont v. Brillon</u>, which addressed whether trial delays caused by underfunding, mismanagement, and breakdowns in the State&#39;s public defense system deprived an indigent defendant whose trial was delayed for nearly three years of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.   <br /><br />The Vermont Supreme Court had reversed the defendant&#39;s conviction and ordered the charges dismissed, finding that his trial was unconstitutionally delayed due largely to failures of the public defender system that left the defendant unrepresented for months at a time or merely nominally represented by a series of assigned counsel who did little to prepare his case.  The Vermont Supreme Court held that the State, not the indigent defendant, was responsible for these types of delays under the U.S. Supreme Court&#39;s longstanding balancing test used to assess speedy trial violations.   <br /><br />On appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the State of Vermont (and its amici curiae, including 40 other states) originally took a bright line position.  They argued that delays caused by public defenders can <em>never</em> be attributed to the State because defense counsel are not state actors.  Pet. Br. at 26, 30; Utah et al. Amici Br. at 6-8.  Vermont further asserted that the Vermont Supreme Court&#39;s decision was &quot;a first in the history of American jurisprudence&quot; and &quot;turn[ed] thirty-six years of settled jurisprudence into chaos.&quot; Pet. Br. at 1. <br /><br />By the time of the oral argument, however, the State appeared to have dramatically changed its position, essentially conceding the core legal issue in the case.  Specifically, the defendant&#39;s brief correctly pointed out that like Vermont, other courts had repeatedly charged States with pretrial delays such as those at issue.  Moreover, on behalf of amici curiae the ACLU, ACLU of Vermont, and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, we identified decades of jurisprudence in the closely related post-trial context attributing to the State delays caused by breakdowns in appellate defender systems.  ACLU et al. Amici Br. at 2-3, 18-30.  Beyond that, a group of retired state court justice amici pointed out that, in the lower court, the State&#39;s lawyers had <em>conceded</em> that allowing the defendant to go unrepresented for months could be weighed against the State.  Justices Amici Br. at 3.  <br /><br />Thus, at oral argument Vermont retreated from its prior position that in a speedy trial analysis, courts could never attribute to the State delays caused by public defenders.  For instance, Chief Justice Roberts asked Vermont&#39;s counsel whether the State would be responsible if &quot;[t]he State has so many cases, and it&#39;s only willing to hire one lawyer.  That lawyer can&#39;t possibly handle all the cases.&quot; Tr. at 7.  Vermont&#39;s attorney responded affirmatively.  Similarly, the Solicitor General, arguing in support of Vermont, acknowledged during the argument that courts can hold the State responsible for some delays caused by public defense systems, Tr. at 24-25, and recognized that Vermont had conceded as much in the lower court.  Tr. at 28. <br /><br />Having retreated from a bright line rule, the State devoted most of the oral argument to debating the facts &#8212; the purported causes of the defendant&#39;s trial delays.  This prompted Justice Souter to note, &quot;it seems to me that there isn&#39;t an issue of principle dividing the parties here, it&#39;s a series of issues of details.&quot; Tr. at 10.  Justice Scalia later lamented, &quot;you began your presentation with a statement that gave me so much hope.  You said you were going to give us three reasons why we wouldn&#39;t have to get into the hairy facts of the case and could decide it on...issues of law.&quot; Tr. at 18.   <br /><br />In short, once the State was forced to abandon its overreaching and demonstrably incorrect position that the Vermont Supreme Court&#39;s approach was unprecedented, and then had to retreat from its original bright line rule, and finally was confronted with its waiver of the issue in the lower court, there remained little doubt that the Vermont Supreme Court&#39;s decision not only adhered to decades of lower court jurisprudence, but also presented a poor vehicle for examining the scope of the speedy trial right.  The remaining thread by which the State&#39;s position hangs is a disputed factual assertion already rejected by the lower state court.  That is not the type of determination the Supreme Court should overturn.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.niu.edu/law/faculty/directory/marc_falkoff.shtml">Marc Falkoff</a> of Northern Illinois University College of Law says that recent release orders, statements by some military lawyers and judges, and the military&#39;s own admission of detention mistakes all confirm that the only way for the Obama administration to restore our legal system&#39;s legitimacy in the eyes of the world will be to close down Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, scrap the ill-conceived military commissions, and charge in federal court those prisoners we think committed crimes....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/marcfalkoff.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->M<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->ore revelations about the illegitimacy of the Bush administration&#39;s war-on-terror detention system have cascaded into the public consciousness this week.  This new round of disclosures and court decisions should give pause to those who have joined the fashionable call for creation of new &quot;national security courts.&quot;  We now have a critical mass of information from military insiders about detainee abuse and procedural irregularities at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, removing all doubt about our need to treat our detainee population in the civilian justice system.<br /><br />The news from Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo has been relentless.  A military official, for the first time, confirmed on the record that we have straight-up &quot;tortured&quot; prisoners at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.  A federal judge, infamous in some circles for his hostility to the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo prisoners&#39; legal arguments, ordered the release of his sixth habeas petitioner in a month.  After nearly seven years in detention, another Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo prisoner was determined by the military itself to have been wrongly labeled an enemy combatant.  And, most stunningly, a military prosecutor detailed in court papers the utter disarray that grips the office of the military commissions, and declared there was no way for the system to provide fair trials to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo prisoners.<br /><br />By far, the splashiest news of the week was made by Judge Susan J. Crawford, &quot;convening authority&quot; of the military commissions, who told the <em>Washington Post</em>&#39;s Bob Woodward that she refused to allow the prosecution of at least one Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo prisoner because &quot;we tortured him.&quot;[1]   The <em>Post</em> noted that the prisoner, Mohammed al-Qahtani, was threatened with a military working dog, forced to wear women&#39;s underclothing, led around on a leash and made to perform dog tricks, told that his mother and sisters were whores, and subjected to 18-to-20 hour interrogations for 48 of 54 consecutive days, sometimes while standing naked in front of a female agent.  Once during this period, Qahtani&#39;s heart rate dropped to 35 beats per minute, and he was taken to the camp hospital to prevent total heart failure.[2]   <br /><br />While we have known about Qahtani&#39;s treatment since the Spring of 2006, what is new is an administration official conceding that this treatment &quot;met the legal definition of torture,&quot; and candidly acknowledging that testimony coerced out of a prisoner in this manner cannot, consistent with the rule of law, be allowed into evidence against him.  Unremarked by the <em>Post</em> article, however, is that Judge Crawford&#39;s observations about this one prisoner go a long way toward undermining the legality of detentions far beyond Qahtani&#39;s.  Statements made by Qahtani, after all, have been used to justify the detentions of perhaps scores of men at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.  Indeed, in a press release issued by the Pentagon in June 2005, authorities bragged that Qahtani was the primary source for the military&#39;s conclusion that another 30 prisoners at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo were affiliated with al Qaeda.[3] <br /><br />We habeas lawyers have been saying for years that the evidence - including, for example, coerced statements from Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo prisoners like Qahtani - against our clients is tainted and unreliable.  But it is only in the past few weeks that federal judges have overwhelmingly confirmed our assertions.  Judge Richard J. Leon, of the federal district court in D.C., for example, ordered the release of petitioner Mohammed el Gharani, a Chadian national who was only 14 when he was taken into custody.  This decision may strike some as remarkable, since Judge Leon&#39;s history with the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo cases suggests he would be hostile to the claims of the petitioners before him.  In January 2005, he had held that the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo prisoners had no constitutional rights and that they were therefore not entitled to habeas hearings at all.  <br /><br />Nonetheless, since June 2008, when the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Boumediene v. Bush</em> that the prisoners could pursue their habeas claims,[4]  Judge Leon has granted the writ and ordered the release of prisoners in six out of seven cases before him.  In <em>Gharani</em>, Judge Leon was particularly scathing in his analysis of the government&#39;s evidence against the petitioner, noting that most of the allegations were made up of statements by fellow prisoners whose credibility the government itself had called into question.  The government case, according to the judge, was &quot;a mosaic of tiles bearing images&quot; that were so &quot;murky&quot; as to reveal &quot;nothing about the petitioner with sufficient clarity, either individually or collectively, that can be relied upon by this Court.&quot;[5] <br /><br />Just a few months earlier, in October 2008, Judge Ricardo M. Urbina had ordered the release of 17 Uighur prisoners into the United States after the government conceded that they were not enemy combatants.[6]   So, for those keeping track, Judge Leon&#39;s decision this week makes the habeas litigation scorecard 23 to 3, in favor of the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo prisoners.  If you add in the military&#39;s own admission last week that Haji Bismullah has been wrongly detained as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; since 2003 [7],  then the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo prisoners are up 24 to 3, or three touchdowns over the government.<br /><br />The most remarkable news of the week, however, has so far gotten the least attention in the press.  Lieutenant Colonel Darrel Vandeveld, a military lawyer who was detailed to prosecute Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo prisoner Mohammed Jawad, filed a <a href="http://gsmcneal.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ltc-vandeveld-declaration-in-jawad1.pdf">declaration</a> in support of Jawad&#39;s habeas corpus petition.  All of the alleged evidence against Jawad, Vandeveld told the court, was either unreliable, coerced, nonexistent, or missing.  In addition, Vandeveld told the court that he was certain Jawad had been abused while in U.S. custody.  <br /><br />Vandeveld&#39;s turnaround is as remarkable as last year&#39;s principled resignation of Colonel Morris Davis, who had served as the chief prosecutor - and <em>de facto</em> Bush administration spokesman - for the military commissions at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.   Colonel Davis, an unlikely critic of commissions system, resigned his position after citing political interference with the independence of his office.  &quot;As things stand right now,&quot; he said at the time, &quot;I think it&#39;s a disgrace to call it a military commission - it&#39;s a political commission.&quot;<br /><br />Vandeveld now joins Davis and a growing number of military lawyers who have gone public about abuses in the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo system.  Lieutenant Colonel V. Stuart Couch, for instance, resigned as a prosecutor in May 2004 after concluding that Mohamedou Ould Slahi, the man he
 was supposed to put on trial, had indisputably been tortured.  Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Abraham, who served on the military&#39;s &quot;Combatant Status Review Tribunals,&quot; filed an affidavit in the summer of 2007 in the Supreme Court in the <em>Boumediene</em> case, describing the manner in which these administrative proceedings were rigged against the prisoners.  And Lieutenant Colonel Colby Vokey, the Marine Corps&#39; chief of all defense lawyers for the western U.S., announced his resignation last year because military staff had harassed him and interfered with his defense work for a juvenile prisoner at the camp.  Vokey called the legal system at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo &quot;disgraceful&quot; and a &quot;sham,&quot; warning that &quot;anytime you want to subvert the rule of law to the power of a government, you&#39;ve got a very bad thing brewing.&quot; <br /><br />But the Vandeveld defection, and particularly his declaration in the Jawad habeas case, are unique because of the detailed description he provides of the chaos that rules within the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo prosecutors&#39; office, and the corresponding impossibility of providing detainees with a fair hearing in a military commission.<br />  <br />In his declaration, Vandeveld describes himself as, initially, a true believer in the military commissions process, convinced that the man he was tasked to prosecute was a war criminal who had confessed to attacking two U.S. soldiers with a hand grenade.[8]   What he learned as he tried to put together his case, however, was that any presumption of regularity in the gathering of evidence against Jawad was unmerited.  After a fact-finding trip to Afghanistan, for example, Vandeveld began to suspect that Jawad&#39;s alleged confession to Pakistani police was coerced.  His suspicions were confirmed when he learned that Jawad&#39;s &quot;confession&quot; (which the U.S. military has relied on to justify his detention) was written in a language he did not speak, that Jawad was functionally illiterate at any rate, and that the thumb print which supposedly verified the confession as his own was not even his own thumbprint.  <br /><br />Vandeveld, who had been informed there was a videotape of the grenade attack, was also stunned to learn that the tape had disappeared, and that no one in the Criminal Investigative Task Force (CITF) could locate it.  He learned, moreover, that neither CITF nor the Office of Military Commissions (OMC) maintained a central repository for case files, and that the evidence, &quot;such as it was,&quot; was &quot;scattered throughout an incomprehensible labyrinth of databases,&quot; or &quot;strewn throughout the prosecution offices in desk drawers, bookcases &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;, or even simply piled on the tops of desks vacated by prosecutors who had departed the Commissions for other assignments.&quot;  At one point, after many months of searching, Vandeveld was able to locate some of his case documents - including discovery information to which Jawad&#39;s defense was entitled - in a locker whose contents had been forgotten at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.  <br /><br />His declaration also describes Vandeveld&#39;s initial dismissal, in open court, of Jawad&#39;s allegations of abuse as exaggerations - along with his gradual realization that Jawad had indeed by abused while in U.S. custody.  Vandeveld came across documents proving that, while at Bagram, Jawad was shoved down a stairwell while hooded and shackled.  He learned that a Behavioral Science Consultation Team psychologist had prepared a psychological assessment of Jawad&#39;s mental condition in order to assist interrogators in extracting information from him.  He uncovered documents proving that the military had carried out a systematic program of sleep deprivation on Jawad, moving him from cell to cell 112 times during a two week period.  These same documents revealed that Jawad attempted suicide at least once by banging his head repeatedly against his cell wall.<br /><br />In the end, Vandeveld says he became &quot;utterly convinced,&quot; because of the chaotic state of the evidence maintained by CITF and OMC, that he could not comply with his professional obligations to turn over discovery materials to the defense.  He also concluded that no Commissions prosecutor could do so consistent with professional obligations.  Coupled with &quot;unnecessary restrictions imposed under the guise of national security,&quot; it is &quot;impossible for anyone involved (the prosecutors) or caught up (the detainees) in the Commissions to harbor even the remotest hope that justice is an achievable goal.&quot;<br /><br />Lieutenant Colonel Vandeveld&#39;s declaration, Judge Leon&#39;s release orders, Judge Crawford&#39;s plain talk about torture, and the military&#39;s own admission of detention mistakes, all confirm that the only way for the Obama administration to restore our legal system&#39;s legitimacy in the eyes of the world will be to close down Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, scrap the ill-conceived military commissions, and charge in federal court those prisoners we think committed crimes.  Our experiment with new courts and untested procedures has been a failure, and it is not an experiment that we as a nation can afford to repeat.<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes<br /><br />1.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law says the pending closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison by executive order of new US President Barack Obama pointedly leaves open the politically and legally troubling question of what to do with all the detainees...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kellyupdated.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>P</strong></font>resident Barack Obama&#39;s <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/gitmo_final_exec_order.pdf">executive order</a> to close down the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba within a year raises a raft of issues - not the least of which is what to do with the <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo">247 detainees</a> currently housed there.  Their legal fate is one of many problem areas in the global war on terror that former President Bush left for the new president. In addressing this thorny question, President Obama said in his order that the closure would be &quot;consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice....&quot;  <br /> <br />Most agree that many detainees pose no threat to the U.S. and whatever intelligence value they may have had is no longer useful.  Consequently, release back to their home countries, or third countries if their home countries refuse to take them or would otherwise mistreat them, is the best option.   And, as Obama notes in his order, &quot;prompt and appropriate disposition of the individuals currently detained at Guantanamo and closure of the facilities in which they are detained would further the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice.&quot; <br /> <br />Several European states, including Germany, France, Sweden, Ireland and Portugal have stepped forward to accept detainees who, if returned home, would face abuse or execution.  Albania, one of the few Muslim states in Europe, has already accepted five Chinese Muslim Uighurs on humanitarian grounds.  Failing repatriation to their home states or another state, release into the U.S. on some sort of immigrant status might be the only solution.  Sixty of the detainees have already been cleared for release.<br /> <br />Of the detainees that do present a threat, trial is warranted and section 4 of the order undertakes to review those who can be tried.  But how and under what conditions?  The evidence against them, obtained by coercion or torture, would not stand up in U.S. federal courts.   Such evidence is inadmissible.  Nevertheless, Obama promises in his order to determine whether trial before Article III courts is feasible.   The faulty Bush military commissions are not an option for political reasons - these will be shut down and the order halts any pending proceedings.   <br /> <br />Regularly constituted military courts under the Uniform Code of Military Justice are an option, and the language of the order ostensibly provides enough wiggle room for this possibility, although it is not explicit.  The U.S. Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene</a> chastised the Bush Administration for not adhering to statutory and treaty strictures in the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions with respect to its treatment of Gitmo detainees.  Military prisons at Ft. Leavenworth (Kansas) and Camp Pendleton (California) would be likely venues for such military trials.<br /> <br />Establishing a new national security court within the U.S. judicial system has been championed by former Attorney General Mukasey, who as a U.S. District Court judge for the 2nd Circuit, tried the terrorists involved in the first World Trade Center bombings in 1993.  There is significant resistance to such a move, however, from civil libertarians who worry that basic defense rights will be curtailed and secrecy will become a norm in prosecutions before such a panel.   Again, there is nothing in the order on this and nothing about an international option either. <br /> <br />A hybrid Afghan/International criminal tribunal in Kabul is yet another possibility, although more remote.  Establishing <em>ad hoc</em> international criminal tribunals involves United Nations Security Council backing and financing.  The two <em>ad hoc</em> tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia have dragged on for years and cost millions.  The two hybrid tribunals (incorporating domestic and international legal experts and traditions) for Sierra Leonne and Cambodia have experienced political setbacks.  While such tribunals have traditionally only prosecuted perpetrators of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, the new Special Tribunal for Lebanon is a hybrid model and is set to break new ground by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4926536.stm">prosecuting perpetrators of terrorist acts</a>.  <br /> <br />With such an opening, a joint Afghan/International criminal tribunal could try the remaining Gitmo detainees who are non-releasable for violations of the laws of war and/or terrorist involvement.  Of course the government of Hamdi Karzai would have to agree.  And the question of which Muslim legal experts would participate is of paramount importance.  Further involvement by the Muslim legal community in the process of international criminal law (which is sadly lacking) would certainly be a beneficial by-product of this venture.  <br /> <br />As indicated by the new European states stepping up to take cleared detainees, the world may be ready to help President Obama with this tricky legal problem.  He should graciously accept.  In addition to emptying Gitmo, the new president would garner even further global good will by shutting down the Guantanamo military base altogether and converting it into, say, a <a href="/forumy/2008/11/converting-gitmo-into-front-line-post.php">first-class scientific research station for climate change</a>.  Together with leading the world beyond the Kyoto process and shoring up the science going to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a base conversion of this sort carries a symbolic and real commitment of enormous import.  Having Guantanamo&#39;s deep water port used by research vessels and its new airbase used by scientific planes would be a physical manifestation of America&#39;s disavowal of the worst aspects of its &quot;war on terror&quot; and a mark of its renewed dedication to international co-operation in an era of a new and potentially far more deadly threat - global warming.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J.

		<title>After Bush: Taking Meaningful Steps Towards Accountability</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a> and <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/Friedman.cfm">Lawrence Friedman</a> of New England School of Law say that although nothing is likely to come of calls for prosecuting President Bush and other administration officials for a variety of controversial actions, Congress should at least take the opportunity to create the mechanisms needed to hold senior leaders accountable in future when their failures lead to illegal conduct by subordinate officials...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hansennew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/forumy/friedmannew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s the Bush presidency comes to an end, calls for investigations by the incoming Obama administration and the new Congress seem to be increasing. To say that the policies pursued by the Bush administration with respect to the war on terror and other national security issues were controversial would be an understatement. A number of programs established by President Bush soon after September 11th, including warrantless domestic surveillance, the creation of a detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, and the interrogation techniques used for gathering intelligence, have all come under scrutiny and severe criticism from within and outside of the government. <br /><br />The Senate Armed Services Committee recently issued a report critical of the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody. All that has been made public is an unclassified executive summary of the report, but even that sheds new light on how the United States military found itself engaging in abusive interrogation techniques that are both illegal and violate the core values of our military ethos. Contrary to statements by President Bush and other administration officials at the time, the incidents of abuse at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and elsewhere were not solely the actions of a "few bad apples." The Senate report appears to confirm what many have known for some time: very senior Bush administration officials participated in the development of abusive interrogation techniques and in many cases authorized their use. In addition, the atmosphere and attitude created and encouraged by senior administration officials helped facilitate detainee abuse. <br /><br />Now we hear the calls for investigations, blue ribbon panels and accountability. Some commentators have gone so far as to suggest that senior military officials and top administration officials, including former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, former Attorney General Gonzales, Vice President Cheney, and even President Bush should be prosecuted as war criminals. These cries recall the suggestion, at the end of the Vietnam War, that then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger be tried as a war criminal for his involvement in the bombings of Cambodia. <br /><br />Nothing came of those demands after Vietnam, and nothing is likely to come of the calls for prosecuting President Bush and other administration officials now. One reason is that the decision to prosecute these officials is at its base, a political determination. There is no indication that either party or the public at large has the interest or the will to actually see such prosecutions go forward; it is always easier and politically safe to criticize from the sidelines. In addition, it is unlikely that even the most skilled prosecutor would be able to gather sufficient evidence to link the actions of senior officials to the abuse committed on the ground, and even that is assuming a prosecutor would have full access to all the evidence. <br /><br />That is not to say that there would not be some benefit in attempting to hold senior officials accountable in a court of law. Certainly prosecutions would bring home the point that no one is above the law, and that even executive authority and exigent circumstances have their limits. Such criminal prosecutions would also show that it is not just the lower-level actors and government officials who will be held accountable, and that we recognize the need to hold accountable all of those leaders entrusted and empowered to act on our behalf. Criminal prosecutions would also send a clear and powerful message to our friends and foes that we are a democracy with strong institutions, and that we take seriously our responsibilities as a world leader. Such prosecutions would also signal a clear break with the failed policies of the past. <br /><br />So while there does not seem to be either the political will or the legal mechanisms to enforce this kind of accountability, Congress should at least ought to take the opportunity to create the mechanisms needed to hold senior leaders accountable when their failures lead to illegal conduct by subordinate officials.<br /><br />We are talking about a domestic codification of the military doctrine of command responsibility. Under the doctrine of command responsibility, both military and civilian leaders can be held criminally responsible for the law of war violations committed by their subordinates, if these leaders failed to adequately prevent, suppress or punish law of war violators. This is a form of vicarious liability, based upon a leader's duties and the relationship between the leader and the subordinate forces. <br /><br />At the conclusion of World War II, the United States was among the strongest proponents of the doctrine of command responsibility in the various prosecutions of German and Japanese war criminals. The doctrine has since become a part of customary international law. At the same time, the United States has failed to codify any form of the doctrine that might apply to our civilian and military leaders; consequently, when situations like the abuse at Abu Ghraib arise, we are left without a means to hold our leaders sufficiently accountable for their failings&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and our leaders lack a clear legal standard by which to assess their own compliance with the law of war. <br /><br />It is difficult and perhaps impossible to say that the abuse at Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo and elsewhere would not have occurred had the doctrine of command responsibility been codified as a part of our domestic law. What can be said with certainly is that, if command responsibility had been codified, commanders at all levels would have had a powerful tool at their disposal to push back against pressure to do whatever it took to gain actionable intelligence from detainees. As well, we would have a legal mechanism with which to prosecute those of our leaders, at all levels, whose failures contributed to serious law of war violations. <br /><br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps and currently teaches courses in criminal law at New England School of Law, where Lawrence Friedman teaches courses in constitutional law.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/about-us/staff-board/kadidal%2C-shayana">Shayana Kadidal</a>, senior managing attorney of the Guantanamo project at the Center for Constitutional Rights, says that the timing of military commissions convening authority Susan Crawford&#39;s admission in the last days of the Bush administration that a Guantanamo detainee he represents was tortured should not be allowed to open the door to a &quot;preventive detention&quot; scheme for prisoners who supposedly can be neither released nor tried...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/shanekadidal.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ast Tuesday evening saw the selectively-timed revelation that a U.S. official (Susan Crawford, the head of the Guantanamo military commissions) has finally confirmed what everyone else in the world already understood: that the interrogation techniques used on our client Mohammed al Qahtani, including the combination of five months of isolation in mind-warping solitary confinement, 54 days of sleep deprivation, forced standing, threats of violence (including with dogs) and actual violence, and humiliation (being forced to urinate on himself, forced sexual contact with female interrogators, being led around on a leash like an animal, and more) constituted torture. <br /><br />It's a significant concession, coming from a Bush administration official, because it confirms that techniques that when used singly might fall short of the administration's old definition of torture (methods creating pain "equivalent to organ failure or death") can still, when used in combination over log periods of time, constitute torture. Not "enhanced interrogation techniques," not "a little dunk in the water" &#8212; but torture, condemned by international law and by the laws of every civilized nation on earth. Torture: exactly what the administration always insisted it never did.<br /><br />Crawford made her admission by way of explaining why military commission charges were dropped against our client this summer. But it will also be relevant in the <em>habeas corpus</em> cases challenging the continued detention of the 220+ detainees who haven't been charged with any crime and will likely never be. Innocence, not torture, is the reason most of these other detainees will never be charged. But the stain of torture is going to rapidly shrink the body of evidence the government can use in court to trump up reasons to keep holding these men. The kind of abuses Al Qahtani suffered &#8212; sleep deprivation and isolation in solitary confinement &#8212; were commonplace at Guantanamo. Just this week a former prosecutor said the 'frequent flyer" program of sleep deprivation was in common use thru 2005, and two new solitary confinement facilities have been in operation since 2006. The two primary torture techniques used on al Qahtani were used on the vast majority of detainees; al Qahtani's case was unique only because of how well documented the abuse was, and how closely supervised from Washington. Crawford's admission presages that the results of many interrogations under torture will be thrown out as the <em>habeas</em> cases progress in the weeks to come. <br /><br />With so much to lose, then, what did the administration have to gain from making this admission now? <br /><br />It's pretty clear what their intent was: to turn our client into the poster boy for a new "preventive detention" law under which men like him could be held forever without charges or trial, a Guantanamo 2.0 specifically for people "too dangerous to release but who cannot be tried." <br /><br />What the ticking time bomb is to the torture debate, the "too dangerous to release but can't be tried" hypothetical detainee is to the preventive detention debate. Let me elaborate. The Ticking Time Bomb hypothetical asks us to stipulate a whole series of conditions that could never exist in the real world, where there are limits to human knowledge: that we know with absolute certainty that the person we have caught is the right person, that he really has a bomb planted somewhere, that the only way to get the information about it out of him is torture (i.e. that torture will work, and that nothing else will work). In the real world, torture never works, and none of the other things can be known with anything approaching certainty. The "ticking time bomb" is a false problem inviting a false solution (torture).<br /><br />So too is the "too dangerous to release but can't be tried" argument for preventive detention. First, "can't be tried" is a rarity: in the real world, there are hardly ever situations where excluding torture evidence leaves no evidence whatsoever available to convict a criminal conspirator on any charge. In the real world, those cases are likely to be very rare: if the government has the facts right, there will usually be many other sources for them besides dubious confessions. In theory, one could imagine a case where there may be no evidence against a military commission defendant that was not procured through torture. But every civilized legal system in the world rejects evidence procured by torture not only because accepting it would be immoral, but also because it is unreliable. If there is no evidence other than torture evidence behind an accusation, then there is no trustworthy evidence, period.<br /><br />Beyond that, flexibility in charging decisions means that there are often lesser charges proved with different evidence that can be brought &#8212; think Al Capone finally getting put away for tax evasion.<br /><br />What about the "too dangerous to release" part? As an initial matter, our system has never allowed the government to detain people (with limited exceptions, including for example the criminally-dangerous mentally ill) based on a prediction that they may pose a danger to the public. But putting centuries of Anglo-American legal tradition to one side, how is someone like Al Qahtani supposed to pose a danger to the public? He's denied the allegations against him and recanted everything he said under torture, and the government has dropped all charges against him. He was never even alleged to be a planner; quite the opposite. His home country, Saudi Arabia, has a highly successful custodial rehabilitation program into which Al Qahtani could be sent. Once he was graduated from that program, as with anyone released to freedom, nothing would stop the authorities from watching over him within the limits of the law if they deemed it wise.<br /><br />Apart from the facts of this one case, as a general matter, even active members of terrorist criminal conspiracies who roam free only pose a danger if law enforcement doesn't know who they are. Once a suspected conspirator is on the authorities' radar screens, he becomes exponentially less dangerous &#8212; law enforcement can tail him, wiretap his phone, infiltrate the criminal enterprise, making sure he doesn't execute his plans while also letting him lead you to the rest of the conspirators. The standard law enforcement playbook on investigating criminal conspiracies (be they involved in terrorism, drug dealing, or other organized crime) says that you treat the first suspect you find as if he were the tip of an iceberg, and, instead of detaining him immediately, you direct more investigative resources at him. On the battlefield you arrest the enemy at first sight. But that "war" mentality doesn&#39;t work well at the painstaking process of investigating terrorist conspiracies--it causes you to lose the sunken part of the iceberg. The known conspirator is an asset to law enforcement while he is free; he ceases to be as useful once he is in custody. From law enforcement's perspective, this is the very best argument against preventive detention as policy. <br /><br />Every street cop in America knows this, because they all have experi
ence investigating drug conspiracies. Will the best and the brightest of the new administration understand it in time to resist the conspiracy among the defeated forces of the right to use their own admission of torture to promote "preventive detention"?<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Shayana Kadidal is senior managing attorney of the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo project at the Center for Constitutional Rights.</em><br />

In recent years, Italian courts, including the Corte di Cassazione, have granted a number of applications directed against Germany, thereby infringing upon Germany&#39;s right to jurisdictional immunity (the landmark <em>Ferrini</em> decision has been translated and reprinted in 128 ILR 659 as has been commented on by Bianchi in 99 AJIL (2005) 242).<br /> <br />That such claims are possible appears clear from international treaty law: Art. 91 of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions (AP I) states that violations of provisions of the Geneva Conventions or the Additional Protocols lead to the liability of the &quot;party to the conflict which violates the provisions of the Conventions or of this Protocol&quot; - liable to pay compensation and that it &quot;shall be responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of its armed forces.&quot; <br /><br />Art. 3 of the Fourth Hague Convention (Laws and Customs of War on Land) (Hague IV) also requires that &quot;[a] belligerent party which violates the provisions of the said Regulations shall, if the case demands, be liable to pay compensation It shall be responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of its armed forces.&quot;<br /><br />Art. 3 Hague IV has become part of the law of the land of the Federal Republic of Germany by virtue of Art. 25 of Germany&#39;s Federal Constitution (the Grundgesetz) and both Hague IV and the AP I have been ratified by Germany. While Hague IV dates from 1907, the AP I only dates from 1977. Of course only Hague IV applies to World War II. <br /><br />Only states as parties can bring such claims under AP I and Hague IV because these conventions do not provide for compensation claims by individual victims. The wording of Art. 3 Hague IV and Art. 91 AP I emphasizes the obligation of a party to provide compensation in case of a breach of an obligation under the treaty in question. Back then such obligations were meant to be between the states which are parties to an international treaty. Although a lot has changed between 1907 and 1977 with regard to the position of the individual under international law, the choice of the virtually identical wording in Hague IV and AP I indicates that the drafters of AP I did not want to create rights for the individual, despite the fact that by 1977 there existed already rights of individuals outside human rights treaties, for example in Art. 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations which dates back to 1963. Individuals therefore cannot sue directly under Art. 91 AP I or Art. 3 Hague IV &#8212; and states in general don&#39;t do so. The fact that these rules are rarely resorted to by states does not mean that there is customary international law to the contrary and that these rules have become the object of desuetudo. As a matter of fact, states which want to defend themselves against such claims have resorted to a kind of act of state doctrine, as Japan has done until recently, or relied on the principle of jurisdictional immunity. The latter is at stake here.<br /> <br /><strong>Jurisdictional immunity</strong><br /><br />Is a fundamental consequence of the principle of state sovereignty, which in turn is the very cornerstone of the Westphalian international legal order, that one state cannot adjudicate over another state in matters related to the second state&#39;s activities as a state (as opposed to, say, as a commercial actor). Therefore plaintiffs will find it hard to obtain reparations for violations of the laws of war before national courts of a state other than the perpetrators&#39; state. This is the problem at the core of the case currently pending between Germany and Italy.<br /> <br />The <em>Distomo</em> case from several year ago provides a good explanation of the principle of jurisdictional immunity. <br /><br />The plaintiffs in <em>Distomo</em> were relatives and descendants of the victims of a 1944 massacre by German SS-Forces, which at that point had been integrated into the regular German Army, in the Greek village of Distomo in the Provice of B&Atilde;&para;otia. The plaintiffs sued the Federal Republic of Germany both based on rights inherited from their deceased family members and on their own rights: claims have been brought forward related to the destruction of family homes and family businesses as well as in relation to damage caused to the plaintiffs&#39; health and other damages. In earlier proceedings, the plaintiffs requested compensation for damages under Tort Law or, in the alternative, compensation for loss of property. After lower courts had rejected their claims, the plaintiffs brought the case before the <em>Bundesgerichtshof</em>, which also rejected their claims on the basis of jurisdictional immunity.<br /><br />Already in 1997 the District Court in Livadeia, Greece, had awarded the plaintiffs approx. 240,000,000 Greek Drachmas, almost the equivalent of 29,000,000 EUR. The German government, claiming state immunity under international law, appealed the ruling and requested a cassation of this judgment by the Areopag, Greece&#39;s Supreme Court. In April 1999 the Areopag rejected Germany&#39;s appeal. The Areopag&#39;s judgment made headline news in Germany as well when the plaintiffs attempted to enforce the judgment against Germany and asked the Greek authorities to seize property of the Federal Republic, in particular the buildings housing the renowned Goethe-Institute in Athens, for that purpose. (Essentially the same is happening now in Italy with a German-Italian cultural center, the Villa Vigoni, which has been placed under a <em>ipoteca giudiziale</em>, a judicial mortgage.) <br /><br />Under Greek Law, a judgment can only be enforced against foreign property located in Greece if the Greek government agrees to this enforcement (unlike the legal situation in a number of other countries, in which it is required that there is a connection between the state property to be seized and the subject matter of the proceedings). Yet especially in cases of tort it is unlikely that any prior commitment of the resources of the respondent state located in the state (in this case the Goethe Institute&#39;s assets) in which the proceedings take place have been used for tortious activities before, see also <em>Letelier v. Republic of Chile</em>, 748 F.2d (2nd Cir 1984) at p. 793; 63 ILR 378. The Greek government however refused to give this permission, causing the Greek plaintiffs to bring the case before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Some <em>Distomo</em> plaintiffs also found their way to Italian courts which declared some Greek judgments
enforceable in favor of the Greek applicants.<br /><br />In Strasbourg the plaintiffs asserted, based on the ECtHR&#39;s earlier decision in <em>David and Ada Hornsby v. Greece</em>, that the Greek rule requiring consent of the government to the enforcement of the Areopag&#39;s judgment was incompatible with Art. 6 (1) ECHR and with Art. 1 of the 1st Additional Protocol to the ECHR. The ECtHR held that the application was inadmissible (European Court of Human Rights, Decision on admissibility of individual complaint no. 59021 / 00, <em>Aikaterini Kalogeropoulou et al. v. Greece and Germany</em>, 12 December 2002. The decision is only available in French. An unofficial German translation is provided by the German Federal Ministry of Justice on the Court&#39;s website at <a href="http://www.coe.int/T/D/Menschenrechtsgerichtshof/Dokumente_auf_Deutsch/Volltext/Entscheidungen/20021212_Kalogeropoulou%20u.a.20_E.asp">http://www.coe.int/T/D/Menschenrechtsgerichtshof/Dokumente_auf_Deutsch/Volltext/Entscheidungen/20021212_Kalogeropoulou%20u.a.&quot;20_E.asp</a>) since at that time, it was, not generally accepted that states lose their state immunity guaranteed by international law in relation to cases involving compensation claims made abroad concerning crimes against humanity (cf. also European Court of Human Rights, Judgment, <em>Al-adsani v. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</em>, Case no. 35763 / 97 EGMR 2001 &#8212; XI). Consequently, so the Strasbourg-based Court said, the plaintiffs <em>de lege lata</em> cannot force the Greek government to violate the rule of international law providing for state immunity. Nevertheless wanted the ECtHR to leave open a door for future developments, e.g. through a change in customary international law (European Court of Human Rights as quoted by the <em>Bundesgerichtshof</em> in its judgment of 26 June 2003, Case no. III ZR 245 / 98, pp. 11 et seq.). The BGH in its decision in the <em>Distomo</em> case agreed with this view. <br /><br />Finally Greece&#39;s Special Supreme Court (which is comprised of all Senates of Greece&#39;s High Courts and usually only becomes involved in proceedings if two Greek High Courts disagree on a legal question) ruled in favor of the principle of jurisdictional immunity. The Special Supreme Court was called together by Judge Stephanos Matthias, the presiding judge in the Areopag&#39;s decision, who had voted against the majority opinion in the ruling which rejected the appeal of the German Government against the already mentioned judgment by the Livadeia District Court, despite the fact that the most important requirement to do so - a dispute between two Greek High Courts - was not met. Accordingly, Ioannis Stamoulis, a former prefect of the province of B&Atilde;&para;otia and former member of the European Parliament who happened to be the attorney for the plaintiffs, accused Judge Matthias of breaking the Greek Constitution. Nevertheless did the Special Supreme Court remain seized of the matter and decided in September 2002 that, albeit the plaintiffs had valid claims against Germany, the judgment issued in their favor could not be enforced due to the principle of jurisdictional immunity.<br /> <br /><strong>Conclusions</strong><br /><br />Unfortunately, Italy has chosen to follow the line of reasoning of the Livadeia court rather than that shared by the Areopag, the Greek Special Supreme Court, the <em>Bundesgerichtshof</em> and the European Court of Human Rights. The International Court of Justice will in all likelihood rule in Germany&#39;s favor. <br /><br />As the European Court of Justice left an opening in <em>Kalogeropoulou</em> by concluding that there was no customary law contrary to the concept of jurisdictional immunity, the International Court of Justice now has the opportunity to elaborate on the relationship between the modern position of the individual under international law and the concept of jurisdictional immunity which is a direct consequence of the fundamental principle of state sovereignty. <br /><br />This case teaches us that international law is not yet as post-Westphalian as many (including many lawyers) want it to be and the law applicable in this case is fundamentally Westphalian. That means that states can only be sued if the state in question in principle agreed to possibly being sued. <br /> <br />Fortunately, the international legal order also contains post-Westphalian elements, allowing individuals to sue states directly. Violations of International Humanitarian Law will often also constitute violations of regional human rights documents, such as the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which provides for compensation for victims of human rights violations. Accordingly the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has received a substantial number of cases related to the situation in Turkish Kurdistan and Chechnya and already has elaborated on the applicability of the ECHR to (military) activities outside the territory of the parties to the convention in Bankovic and Loizidou. Under the Statute of the permanent International Criminal Court in The Hague, individual perpetrators can now also be held liable for the damages caused by their actions. The law is developing, but slowly. Most of the world still lacks the compensation possibility afforded to Europeans by the ECHR and the number of cases before the ICC is still too small to make any predictions as to its effectivity, but the ICC of course was never intended to be an international court of tort law.<br /> <br />State sovereignty will remain the cornerstone of Public International Law for some time. But states should become aware of the fact that this will have a price, or in other words &quot;with great power comes great responsibility&quot;. States cannot be sued against their will, i.e. unless they have agreed to the possibility of being sued. Given that states are reluctant to sue each other over violations of International Humanitarian Law, they should provide effective avenues for victims of their violations of international law to be compensated. Nothing less is their obligation under Art. 91 AP I and Art. 3 Hague IV.<br /><br />Because most armed conflicts today involve at least one non-state actor and non-state actors such as Hamas, Hezbollah or Al Qaida deliberately terrorize civilians by targeting them or at least violating the distinction principle, states should have an interest in creating a rule of customary international law to the effect that victims of violations of the laws of war can sue the perpetrator in person as well as the organization behind the perpetrator, regardless of the nature or identity of this organization, be it a state, an international organization or a terror group (on damages owed by state sponsors of terrorism cf. also 7 <em>German Law Journal</em> (2006) 777). So far, their own reluctance to pay their victims or to sue other states, including state sponsors of terrorism (the Lockerbie case being a notable exemption), has prevented the emergence of such a rule. It is up to the states as the fundamental unit of international legal relations to act upon the responsibility which comes with this position.<br /> <br />   <br /><br /><em>A member of the American Society of International Law (ASIL), the Lieber Society and the German Red Cross Expert Pool on International Humanitarian Law, Stefan Kirchner is admitted to the bar in Germany (Rechtsanwalt) and mainly handles cases concerning human and civil rights, in particular before the European Court of Human Rights and the German Federal Constitutional Court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=152">David Crane</a> of Syracuse University College of Law, former Chief Prosecutor for the UN Special Court for Sierra Leone, says that following a period when the United States on the world stage was like a blinded giant swinging a bludgeon in all directions with little thought, it is high time for the American exercise of &quot;smart power&quot; in keeping with the rule of law...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidcranenew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><strong>S</strong></font>mart power is, well, smart. Taking from a West African proverb, Theodore Roosevelt spoke these words at the turn of the last century and perhaps the new administration of Barack Obama a century later appears to be paying head to the words of the proverb, for now. The recent confirmation hearing of Hillary Clinton to be the next Secretary of State was our first official glimpse of the Obama administration's basic approach to diplomacy and it struck the right tone indeed.  <br /><br />It is a secure nation that uses its military power sparingly and with care.  Nations that react with armed force as a first resort show their insecurity and place in the world.  Over the past seven years or so this nation has been like a blinded giant swinging a bludgeon in all directions with little thought, other than apparently to let the international community, and would be terrorists, know we have a great deal of military power and can use it.  The so-called "global war on terror" has been a joke and made this once proud and considerate nation the laughing stock of the world.  <br /><br />This country once governed itself  based on the rule of law and approached the international community with that basic fundamental premise in mind.  For this we were respected.  As an example of this, nations from around the world sent members of their armed forces to learn about the laws of armed conflict in our service schools, knowing that they were getting the best training in the world in the rule of law on the battlefield.<br /><br />Then the rules changed.  The Bush administration declared that the very system with which we used force under the rule of law was "quaint" and "outdated".  Declaring that the rules had changed, this nation went on a legal and moral rampage after September 11, 2001.  Torture, secret camps, inhumane treatment, and domestic surveillance of US citizens without legal review became common place.  The world recoiled in horror.  This was "dumb power" and essentially in violation of international and domestic law.<br /><br />The signal sent at the confirmation hearing of Senator Clinton on January 13, 2009 was a message that such ham-fisted policies would become a thing of the past.  Senator Clinton declared: "I believe that American leadership has been wanting, but is still wanted.  We must use what has been called "smart power", the full range of tools at our disposal&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;diplomatic, economic, military, political, legal, and cultural&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;picking the right tool, or combination of tools, for each situation".  <br /><br />America is still wanted, but an America that wears the values of freedom, democratic ideals, and the rule of law on its sleeve.  Use of armed force is never the first solution absent surprise and in self defense.  Reprisal is a legal reaction, but it is an exception to what the United Nations Charter declares that we solve our disputes peacefully. The world knows our military strength, but the world needs to once again appreciate our greatest strength and that is the moral strength enshrined in our Constitution. <br /><br />Smart power in the beginning of the 21st Century is mandated for this nation. Where the rules have changed are the real threats that face all mankind, threats far greater than any one nation can face, such as global warming, failing states and economies, food and water distribution, international criminal actors, among others.  Smart power is a realistic balance of national strength and international reality.  <br /><br />Smart power will make this nation safer as we no longer become a threat to the world, a bully pouting after a blackened eye, but a nation of calm and reasoned strength.  Shooting first and asking questions later may work in Texas but that is not the world of today.  The true measure of mankind should be in the strength of a hand shake.  Smart power appears to be a cornerstone to our new foreign policy led by a new President and Secretary of State who understand this point.  <br /><br />As Senator Clinton declared:  "Diplomacy is hard work; but when we work hard, diplomacy can work, and not just to defuse tensions, but to achieve results that advance our security, interests and values." Smart.<br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

It is unclear whether he meant "war" in the classic sense, a term of art or as a political phrase. What is clear is that &quot;Operation Cast Lead&quot; is fundamentally different than classic operational counterterrorism.  The operation includes four goals: <br /><br />- destroying tunnels between Egypt and the Gaza Strip used for smuggling weapons; <br />- destroying Hamas's ability to manufacture Kassam missiles; <br />- destroying Hamas ammunition depots; and<br />- preventing Hamas from firing Kassam missiles into Israel.<br /><br />The IDF launched Cast Lead after two significant developments: Hamas had fired 6,000 missiles from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel during the past three years after Israel had unilaterally disengaged from the Gaza Strip and Hamas had unilaterally violated an Egyptian negotiated cease-fire.<br /><br />This is classic self-defense; to that extent, Operation Cast Lead is not different.<br /> <br />From a legal perspective, however, there are three critical differences between Cast Lead and previous IDF operations, each of which may pose significant challenges to existing interpretations of international law:<br /><br />- declaring war against a non-state actor; <br />- re-articulating proportionality; and <br />- redefining what is a legitimate target in the context of collateral damage.<br /><br />Before analyzing these three issues, one should recall that Israel previously has referred to its operational counterterrorism measures in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as "armed conflict short of war". While surely a clumsy phrase, it signaled Israel's attempt to articulate a "hybrid"&acirc;&#8364;&#8221; something that is neither war nor a police action. Declaring war on Hamas is not "armed conflict short of war"; it is an additional step &#8212; perhaps more than that - in the definitional spectrum. It suggests that war can be declared against a non-state entity.  While President Bush declared war on "terrorism" after 9/11, a declaration of war specific to a particular organization represents a fundamental change.<br /><br />How that change comes into play"  best illustrated in how proportionality and  collateral damage  are discussed. <br /> <br />Israel and Hamas have disproportionate weapons available to them. The IDF has planes, helicopters, tanks, artillery and patrol boats. Hamas has Kassam and Grade missiles. What needs to be asked as a matter of international law is whether the available, disproportionate weapons are used proportionally. With regard to the current situation in Gaza, proportionality must be viewed from two perspectives: the threat posed and how is that threat posed.<br /><br />The threat posed is to a million innocent Israeli civilians - Jews and Arabs - living within a 40 km (25 mile) radius of the Gaza Strip. The threat is actual and has been realized.  There have been fatalities, injuries, damage to property and general disruption of daily life within Israel.  How this has occurred is critical in understanding Operation Cast Lead in the context of collateral damage. It has occurred because of a broadly-based Hamas infrastructure.<br /> <br />In declaring war on Hamas, Israel has deliberately left undefined the degree to which an individual must be affiliated with Hamas in order to be categorized as a legitimate target. The consistent and constant bombing of southern Israel over a number of years required a broadly based and highly developed infrastructure. Such an infrastructure enabled the digging of many tunnels, the building of weapons and their storage and the firing of thousands of missiles. In contrast to the traditional model associated with the suicide bombing infrastructure predicated on the individual bomber, the planner, the driver and the financier, the Hamas rocket firing infrastructure is inherently broader.<br /><br />By expanding the definition of "legitimate target," the IDF has narrowed the definition of "collateral damage."<br /> <br />This new paradigm presents enormous risk, for it invariably leads to the photographs that have caused Israel significant damage in the court of international opinion. The visual images from Gaza during the last two weeks are far more powerful than any spokesman's words.<br /><br />However, Israel declared war on an organization, and by extension on all those involved in that organization &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; active and passive alike. That is precisely how Operation Cast Lead is different from all previous Israeli operations. <br /> <br />While self-defense (in the classic model) is the legal basis for Cast Lead, the IDF's re-articulation of proportionality and collateral damage is a new development in international law.  How this new paradigm is implemented in the Gaza Strip is the essence of the issue. It means that the IDF is conducting an aggressive policy directed at Hamas. It suggests expanding the number of legitimate targets and broadening the definition of  "military necessity". <br /><br />It does not &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and must not &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; mean that all Gazans are legitimate targets. Israel's Defense Minister declared war on Hamas, not on Gaza. The IDF must minimize collateral damage; to do otherwise is a violation of international law.<br />  <br />Further, Israel must not ignore its international humanitarian law obligations. To do otherwise is a violation of international law. The three-hour respites from aerial attacks to facilitate attending to humanitarian needs represent an attempt to balance between humanitarian obligations and operational necessities.  However, the essence of the Israeli policy &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the rightness or wrongness of which must be debated &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; is that declaring war on an organization that has fired more than 6,000 rockets into Israel since 2005 justifies enlarging the definition of legitimate targets and therefore narrowing the definition of what is considered collateral damage.<br /><br /><br /><em>Amos N.

For two weeks the scenes of carnage, mutilated body parts, and dead children have haunted our television screens and appeared in pictures in newspapers and on the internet. Israel has used all the sophisticated military paraphernalia at its disposal to destroy Hamas. And Hamas has in turn continued to fire rockets into Israel. Since Israel launched its offensive in Gaza on 27 December 2008, 1,010 Palestinians and thirteen Israelis have been killed. Of the Israeli dead 10 have been soldiers and three are civilians. According to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, one third of the dead are children. Almost 5,000 Palestinians have been injured. We do not know the exact proportion of Hamas fighters amongst the figures for Palestinian dead. Israel is not allowing any foreign journalists to enter the Strip to independently verify the facts. <br /><br />In resolution 1860, the UN Security Council stressed the urgency of the situation and called for "an immediate, durable and fully respected ceasefire, leading to the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza." The resolution has been ignored by both sides and Israeli troops are reported to have entered Gaza City. But was this war necessary? And is it lawful?<br /><br />On the very morning Israel launched its offensive in Gaza, the day it killed 225 Palestinians, Gabriela Shalev, its UN Ambassador, sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General announcing that "after a long period of utmost restraint, the Government of Israel has decided to exercise, as of this morning, its right to self-defence." Two weeks into the conflict, the US House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution "recognizing Israel's right to defend itself against attacks from Gaza" by a majority of 390-5. On 6 January, when an Israeli tank shell killed 40 Palestinians at a UN school, Australia's Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said: "Australia recognizes Israel's right to self-defence." And in his last press conference at the White House, President George W. Bush said that Israel had the right to defend itself, but should be mindful of "innocent folks."<br /><br />It may therefore come as a surprise to some that, despite these statements, many international lawyers argue that Israel cannot rely on the right of self-defence to justify its actions in Gaza. In a <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article5488380.ece">letter</a> published in the <em>Sunday Times</em> Israel's plea of self-defence was rejected by over two dozen international lawyers. They argued that Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip amount to aggression, not self-defence. <br /><br /><strong>Self-defence: what is an armed attack?</strong><br /><br />Article 51 of the UN Charter provides that UN members have the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs. The question then is, what is an armed attack? <br /><br />To the non-specialist, the word "armed attack" might signify any attack. But under international law the issue is not so straightforward. If, for example, it were the case that a single shot fired across a border amounted to an armed attack for the purposes of Article 51 of the UN Charter then states could invoke their "inherent" right to self-defence and go to war. This could cause endless instability in international affairs. It could also lead to accidental wars. One has only to think of the tensions between India and Pakistan, China and Taiwan, North and South Korea, Greece and Turkey, Russia and Georgia to realise the danger. Moreover, if the threshold for an armed attack is low then states could effectively manufacture a war. All they would need to do is provoke a border incident, allege that they had been attacked first, and then send in the troops. <br /><br />In the <em>Nicaragua</em> case the International Court of Justice drew a distinction between the "scale and effects" of a particular military operation that could be classified as an armed attack as opposed to "a mere frontier incident." An armed attack carried out by "armed bands, groups, irregulars or mercenaries" the Court said, would have to be "of such gravity as to amount to an actual armed attack conducted by regular forces." The Court's jurisprudence in Nicaragua was upheld in the case concerning Oil Platforms where it said that in ascertaining whether an armed attack had taken place it was necessary to distinguish "the most grave forms of the use of force from other less grave forms." Even cumulative attacks, the Court said, might not necessarily amount to an armed attack for the purposes of Article 51 of the UN Charter.  <br /><br />As regards the Israel-Palestine conflict we are not dealing with a single shot fired across a border. We are faced with a decades-old territorial dispute. Assuming that the right of self-defence for the purpose of Article 51 of the UN Charter can apply to attacks initiated by non-state actors like Hamas, are the rockets fired by its military wing into southern Israel of such a "scale and effect" that they amount to an armed attack as opposed to a border incident? And are they of "such gravity" that they amount to an armed attack conducted by a regular army? If so, how is one to quantify rockets attacks for the purposes of an armed attack? By the numbers fired? Or by the number of deaths they cause? Does a rocket fired into an open field or into an empty building amount to an armed attack? What if it causes damage or injures or kills someone?<br /><br />Whilst it would not be possible or even desirable to quantify precisely what amounts to an armed attack, as it will depend on the individual facts of each case, the deaths of a dozen civilians, over a one-year period, deplorable as that is, would probably not qualify as an armed attack for the purposes of Article 51 of the UN Charter. Moreover, one cannot ignore the conduct of Israel's armed forces in the occupied territories and examine the Hamas rocket attacks in isolation. After all, there are two parties to this conflict. In the three years after Israel's redeployment from Gaza, 11 Israelis were killed by rocket fire. And yet between 12 September 2005, the day Israel completed its "disengagement" from Gaza, and the 27 December 2008, the day Israel launched its air strikes, the Israeli army had killed approximately 1,250 Palestinians in Gaza according to data collected by the United Nations Organization for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. <br /><br />According to a fact sheet produced by the Israeli consulate in New York City, after the ceasefire began in June 2008, the rate of rocket and mortar fire from Gaza dropped to almost zero, and stayed there for four straight months. As Nancy Kanwisher, Johannes Haushofer and Anat Biletzki point out in the <em>Huffington Post</em>, the ceasefire ended on 4 November 2008 "when Israel first killed Palestinians, and Palestinians then fired rockets into Israel." For the purposes of the law of self-defence, however, it is not always a question of who attacks first&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;although Article 2 of the UN General Assembly's 1974 Definition of Aggression stipulates that: "The first use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression." A
s Professor Yoram Dinstein of Tel Aviv University argues in his book <em>War, Aggression and Self-Defence</em> (Cambridge University Press 2005) p. 191, it "is not who fired the first shot but who embarked upon an apparently irreversible course of action, thereby crossing the legal Rubicon. The casting of the die, rather than the actual opening of fire, is what starts the armed attack." But without doubt, it was Israel's 27 December attack on Gaza, the biggest air assault on the Strip since 1967, that, to use Dinstein's phrase, constituted the crossing of the "legal Rubicon." Although, according to the Israeli Government, Hamas had fired hundreds of rockets into southern Israel in the week prior to its 27 December attack, only one Israeli civilian had been killed by a rocket in his apartment building in Netivot. Importantly, these rockets were fired as retaliatory action for the 4 November 2008 assassinations carried out by Israel in Gaza.<br /><br /><strong>Proportionality: the bigger picture</strong><br /><br />Of course one could argue that Israel cannot invoke self-defence because its response was not necessary or proportionate and not because the rocket attacks fired by Hamas do not amount to an armed attack. In its <em>Nuclear Weapons</em> advisory opinion the International Court of Justice stipulated that "a use of force that is proportionate under the law of self-defence, must, in order to be lawful, also meet the requirements of the law applicable in armed conflict which comprise in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law." In other words, any use of force in self-defence to repel an armed attack must be necessary, proportionate, and in conformity with international humanitarian law. <br /><br />In any assessment of proportionality one must take into account all the facts of a particular claim of self-defence. An attack cannot be examined in isolation to the incidents which were alleged to have provoked it. This was the approach to proportionality adopted by the International Court of Justice in the <em>Oil Platforms</em> case. In assessing the proportionality of an Iranian attack, the Court said it could not "assess in isolation the proportionality of that action to the attack to which it was said to be a response; it cannot close its eyes to the scale of the whole operation." <br /><br />In other words, when assessing Israel's claim to self-defence and related questions of proportionality one must be mindful of the deaths caused by Israel's own actions in the Gaza Strip prior to the escalation of hostilities. Even during the so-called "ceasefire" Israel assassinated Palestinians in Gaza such as its attack on 4 November which killed six people. It also blockaded Gaza for 18 months prior to its 27 December assault on the Strip. In any assessment of proportionality one cannot ignore the sheer scale of Palestinian dead in the three years prior to Israel's 27 December assault which included 222 children. Nor can one ignore the number of civilians killed during the current hostilities. Is the death of one Israeli civilian in the week prior to Israel's air assault proportionate to the deaths of over 1,000 Palestinians? <br /><br /><strong>Occupied territory and belligerent occupation</strong><br /><br />Although Israel relocated its troops from Gaza in August-September 2005, many international lawyers, such as Professor Iain Scobbie of the School of Oriental and African Studies, have argued that the Gaza Strip remains occupied territory under international law. (See Iain Scobbie, "An Intimate Disengagement: Israel's Withdrawal from Gaza, the Law of Occupation and of Self-Determination" in Victor Kattan (ed.), <u>The Palestine Question in International Law (London: British Institute of International and Comparative Law</u>, 2008), p. 637). This is because Israel controls all of Gaza's entry and exit points, its airspace, its territorial waters, and population registry. The capacity of the Israeli army to invade the Gaza Strip at its time and choosing, to block humanitarian access, to close the border crossings at will, to control the supply of food, fuel and electricity, as well as its ability to bar all foreign correspondents from entering the Strip which it had enforced prior to the latest conflagration, all point to the conclusion that Gaza has always been under effective Israeli control. As the preamble to UN Security Council resolution 1860 stresses: "the Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967 and will be a part of the Palestinian state."<br /><br />According to the Chatham House Principles of International Law on the Use of Force in Self-Defence, an armed attack is an attack directed from outside the territory controlled by the state. Recalling the International Court of Justice's advisory opinion in Wall, the authors of these Principles noted that "unless an attack is directed from outside territory under the control of the defending State, the question of self-defence in the sense of Article 51 does not normally arise." Thus, in principle, a state cannot invoke self-defence in relation to an attack which originates within territory it occupies.<br /><br />It is important to note that not all defensive measures are measures taken in self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. This is because self-defence is an exculpatory plea regarding resort to force in the first place, and not for an offensive taken during an armed conflict. In the Targeted Killings case, Judge Barak accepted that the Israel-Palestine conflict is an international armed conflict where the laws of belligerent occupation are applicable. Under the law of belligerent occupation the appropriate legal framework is the <em>jus in bello</em> and not the <em>jus ad bellum</em>. Self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter is only relevant to the <em>jus ad bellum</em>.<br /><br />Under the law of belligerent occupation Israel could use the justification of belligerent reprisals to justify pin-point attacks against Hamas. But the sheer scale of Operation Cast Lead goes well beyond the proportionality requirement inherent in the law of belligerent reprisals. Most importantly, the law of armed conflict prohibits belligerent reprisals against civilians, civilian populations and certain civilian objects. This is confirmed in Articles 51, paragraph 6 and Article 54, paragraph 4 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. It also goes beyond the proportionality requirement in the law of self-defence. This is because in the <em>Caroline</em> formulation, the test of proportionality was stated to require "nothing unreasonable or excessive, since the act, justified by the necessity of self-defence, must be limited by that necessity, and kept clearly within it." <br /><br />Under the law of belligerent occupation Israel has the duty to ensure law and order in the occupied territory. Article 43 of the Hague Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 1907 provides that the Occupying Power "shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country." Article 64 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 further provides that the Occupying Power may subject the population of the occupied territory to provisions which are essential to enable it to fulfill its functions, to maintain orderly government, and to ensure its security.  Because Israel has failed to fulfill these obligations, it allowed the situation to develop where Hamas could prepare and launch offensives against southern Israel. The deaths, injuries and damage caused by Operation Cast Lead is retribution inflicted on Gaza as a response to activities which Israel had the responsibility to prevent.<br /><br /><strong>Aggression</strong> <br /><br />So if Israel's actions do not amount to self-defence then what is it? The answer must be that it is an act of aggression, which the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg referred to as "the supreme international crime." When a state uses massive fo
rce, such as bombardment, blocking access to ports, and a ground invasion which has not been authorized by the Security Council of the United Nations, and cannot be justified under any other ground such as self-defence or "humanitarian intervention" then there is a <em>prima facie</em> case that its actions amount to aggression. <br /><br />Article 1 of the UN Definition of Aggression annexed to General Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX) of 1974 provides that: "Aggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this Definition." One of the purposes of the UN according to Article 1 (2) UN Charter is "to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace." To this end Article 1 of the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations provides that: "Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to above in the elaboration of the present principle of their right to self-determination and freedom and independence."<br /><br />Under Article 3 (c) of the Definition of Aggression, any blockade is an act of aggression. The Gaza Strip had been subject to a blockade prior to Israel's attack on 27 December for almost 18 months. In the <em>Nicaragua</em> case, the International Court of Justice recognised the Definition of Aggression as a source of international law. According to 3 (a) of the Definition of Aggression "any military occupation, however temporary, resulting from such invasion or attack" is an act of aggression. It is not necessary for the occupied territory to belong to another state. Therefore, even if one took the view that Gaza is no longer occupied territory, which happens to be the perspective of the present Israeli Government, then the military occupation that has arisen as a result of the current hostilities could still qualify as an act of aggression. Otherwise, Israel's four-decade long occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and its annexation of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights amount to a continuing act of aggression.<br /><br /><strong>Self-determination</strong><br /><br />By attacking Gaza, and maintaining an occupation that has lasted for almost 42 years, Israel is forcibly depriving the Palestinian people from exercising their right of self-determination. As an aspect of that right the Palestinian people must be allowed to freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. They have a right to choose their own form of government. It is not for Israel to determine the political leadership of the Palestinian people. <br /><br />In 1970, the UN General Assembly in resolution 2649 (XXV) affirmed "the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples under colonial and alien domination recognized as being entitled to the right of self-determination to restore to them that right by any means at their disposal." <br /><br />Article 7 of the Definition of Aggression provides that none of the acts enumerated in Article 3 "could in any way prejudice the right to self-determination, freedom and independence, as derived from the Charter, of peoples forcibly deprived of that right." They have the right to struggle to that end and to seek and receive support from the international community. In this connection, Article 1 (4) of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts provides that it applies to "armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes in the exercise of their right of self-determination, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations." <br /><br />This conflict can only be solved by diplomacy. The use of force must always be a last resort. The rockets fired by Hamas into Israel in retaliation for the 4 November assassination of six Palestinians was not an armed attack of "such gravity" that, in the words of the <em>Caroline</em> formulation, was "instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation." And even if one was to argue that the Hamas rocket attacks did amount to an armed attack, that Gaza is not occupied territory, and therefore that the law of belligerent occupation is not applicable, Israel's bombardment and re-invasion of the Strip is grossly disproportionate. Israel could have negotiated with Hamas instead of deliberating isolating and denigrating them, and lobbying other states to collectively boycott the people of Gaza for exercising their democrat right to chose their own form of government in what must amount to one of the most cynical and depressing sanctions in modern history. As a member of the United Nations, Israel is required to settle its "international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered." One day, someone is going to have to talk to Hamas. The movement is still going to be around long after this war is over. <br /><br /><br /><em><a href="http://www.victorkattan.com">Victor Kattan</a> teaches international law to students of diplomacy at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London.

		<title>TURKMENISTAN: The Right to Rest</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gunesh Bakgalova, Pitt Law LLM &#39;09, compares &quot;right to rest&quot; laws in her native <span style="font-weight:bold;">Turkmenistan</span> with American labor regulation:<br /><br />When I came to the United States I was very surprised to hear that employers are not required to give employees paid vacations, or to include paid leave in employment contracts. The so-called &quot;Right to Rest&quot; grants employees the right to paid vacation and leave, and is one of the Human Rights proclaimed in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In Turkmenistan, this right is guaranteed by the Constitution, but in the US, the Family Medical Leave Act only requires that certain employers grant employees up to 12 weeks per year of unpaid leave for births, adoptions, and medical issues. <br /><br />The US government is expanding the applicability of the Act, but only in a limited capacity. As of January 2009, the Act also permits 26 weeks of unpaid leave for certain employees to care for injured family members in the US Armed Forces. Despite this expansion, the Act continues to apply only to certain types of employers. Furthermore, it does not require those employers to grant paid leave. <br /><br />In Turkmenistan, all employers are required to grant paid leave, and thus all employees are covered by our legislation. Furthermore, as employees, we are guaranteed not only this Right to Rest, but three specific types of paid leave: (1) main annual leave, (2) additional leave, and (3) social leave. <br /><br /><strong>Main annual leave</strong><br /><br />Employees automatically receive paid annual leave of 24 calendar days per year. A longer vacation is granted to teachers, professors, and disabled persons, who receive 35 calendar days per year of paid annual leave.<br /><br /><strong>Additional leave</strong><br /><br />In certain circumstances, employees can receive extended paid leave in addition to their main annual leave.  First, annual leave can be extended up to 15 additional calendar days if employees work in harmful or dangerous conditions.  Second, when a couple gets married, they can choose two family members who will get an additional leave of ten days each for their wedding. Finally, additional leave of ten days can also be granted to two close relatives of a deceased person for the person&#39;s burial and commemoration.<br /><br /><strong>Social leave</strong><br /><br />Women in Turkmenistan receive 112 calendar days of social leave for pregnancy and child birth, 56 days prior to and 56 days after childbirth. If the mother or child experiences medical complications, the mother&#39;s leave can be extended up to 16 calendar days. Additionally, if the woman has multiple births, then maternity leave is extended by 40 days for a total of 152 calendar days. Social leave is unique because it not only grants additional paid days of leave, but allows mothers to extend their time off after their paid leave has ended. After paid social leave, the employee-mother can take unpaid social leave until the child reaches three years old. She has the right to return to work at any time, and her position will be kept open until the child reaches three years old.<br /><br />These specific provisions, now required by law, stem from cultural expectations and the common practice of providing all employees in Turkmenistan with paid leave. The Right to Rest was legally granted to citizens of Turkmenistan over 70 years ago under the 1936 Constitution of the U.S.S.R.  After Turkmenistan gained independence from the U.S.S.R. in 1991, the general Right to Rest was granted under Article 32 of the 1992 Constitution. Later, these specific requirements for main annual leave, additional leave, and social leave were adopted under the Turkmen Code of Labor Laws.<br />

		<title>THAILAND:  Legal Obstacles to Citizenship for Indigenous Groups</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2009/01/thailand-indigenous-population-faces/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Staffer Necia Hobbes, Pitt Law &#39;11, volunteered in Chiang Rai before starting graduate school:<br /><br />In the United States, citizenship is granted to those born within US borders or to US citizen parents, and can be obtained through naturalization. The Kingdom of Thailand, however, places more severe restrictions on obtaining citizenship, effectively limiting human rights access for the hill tribes, indigenous populations living along the Northern and Western borders of the Kingdom. Lacking citizenship status, thousands of indigenous persons are excluded from education, health care, and employment, and the vulnerable population is an easy target for the human trafficking operations that plague Southeast Asia.<br /><br />I witnessed the effect of Thailand&#39;s restrictive citizenship laws while traveling with a mobile medical clinic among Lahu and Karen hill tribe settlements in the jungles of Northern Thailand. Many hill tribe members lacked citizenship status, although they had been born and raised within Thai borders. Anyone over the age of 15 must prove citizenship to have access to health care, education, employment, and even to be able to travel freely. Without national citizenship, hill tribe members turn to subsistence farming or other means of employment, such as prostitution, in order to survive.<br /><br /><img src="/dateline/neciathailand1.JPG" /><br /><br />As we traveled among villages, we brought vegetables, rice, and beans in our backpacks so that we could share meals consisting of more than the usual water-soaked bamboo and saplings. In the villages, starvation and malnutrition are constant problems, simple illnesses are life-threatening, and mortality rates are high. Some people successfully bribe local officials so they can travel and find menial labor, but the threat of deportation and ethnic cleansing lies just across the Burmese border. I met people who had lived in Thailand their whole life, but lived in constant fear of detention or even deportation because of their lack of citizenship.<br /><br />The major legal barrier to citizenship is the Nationality Act B.E. 2508 (1965) as amended by Acts B.E. 2535 No. 2 and 3 (1992). Most hill tribes were not included in Thailand&#39;s first national census in 1956, which recorded Thai origin and nationality. Nine years later, the government passed the Nationality Act, which guaranteed citizenship only to people who could prove that they were born to Thai citizens or legal aliens. The birth registration process is inadequate and must be improved, but unless a person can prove that the parents listed on their birth certificate are Thai citizens or legal aliens, even a birth certificate will not be enough to obtain citizenship. Since most people in the hill tribes were not registered as Thai or otherwise in the first national census, neither they nor their children are guaranteed citizenship under the Nationality Act.<br /><br />Additionally, Section 7 of the Nationality Act excludes from citizenship the children of parents who entered the state illegally or temporarily. Hill tribe members have been fleeing from Burma for nearly 40 years and joining hill tribes in Thai jungles near the borders, so Section 7 excludes them and their children from citizenship, unless they can prove they entered Thailand legally. With no legal records, it is difficult for hill tribe members whose ancestors have been in Thailand for centuries to distinguish themselves from hill tribe members who entered as unregistered refugees or who are the children or grandchildren of unregistered refugees.<br /><br /><img src="/dateline/neciathailand2.JPG" /><br /><br />Numerous international aid organizations and U.N. agencies, including the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Committee on the Rights of the Child, have called for changes to Thailand&#39;s Nationality Act, birth registration process, and legal process for obtaining citizenship. They also recommend that Thailand loosen restrictions on basic rights so that persons who are not citizens can at least access opportunities like employment and basic health care.<br /><br />To resolve the problems of statelessness, Thai regulatory bodies and agencies have attempted to allow certain portions of the hill tribe population to obtain citizenship, but the Nationality Act remains intact. In 2000, the Cabinet of Ministers decreed that hill tribe children could obtain citizenship if their parents entered the country before October 4, 1985 and if they could prove that they were born in Thailand. However, this decree and other regulations are not entirely consistent with each other, nor widely understood or enforced. Without a fundamental change to the Nationality Act, it seems unlikely that these piecemeal regulations will have much of an effect.<br />

		<title>Plaintiffs in Illinois &#034;moment of silence&#034; case lack standing under the Constitution</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jeremy Tedesco</strong> [Legal counsel, <a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/main/default.aspx">Alliance Defense Fund</a>]: &quot;The Northern District of Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/federal-judge-rules-illinois-school.php">recently struck down</a> an Illinois law that mandates a brief period of silence before the start of each public school day in <u>Sherman v. Township High School District 214</u>.  The lawsuit was brought by a prominent Illinois atheist and his daughter, who attends a public school where the moment of silence was implemented.  Among other things, the court&#39;s decision illustrates the problem with the lax, indeed nearly non-existent, standing &quot;requirements&quot; that some federal courts apply to Establishment Clause plaintiffs.<br /> <br /><a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/article03/10.html#4">Pursuant to Article III</a> of the United States Constitution, a plaintiff must demonstrate, <em>inter alia</em>, an &quot;injury in fact&quot; for a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over his case.  The United States Supreme Court has explained that this injury must be &quot;actual&quot; and &quot;concrete,&quot; and cannot be &quot;conjectural&quot; or &quot;hypothetical.&quot;<br /> <br />So what injury can a student possibly claim by being exposed to a room full of completely silent students?  There is none.  Because every student in a class is silent during a moment of silence, the only way to claim an injury is based on the <em>assumption</em> that other students are praying.  But there are several problems with this.  First, it is black-letter law that an Article III injury cannot be predicated on mere conjecture, but that is all a plaintiff can rely on in challenging a moment of silence.<br /> <br />Worse, this &quot;I know what you are thinking&quot; theory of standing asks a court to accept the nonsensical - that a plaintiff is &quot;coerced&quot; to pray because he assumes that other students around him are praying, even though he cannot know if they are praying.  If we are making assumptions, why not assume that students are using nonreligious modes of silent activity during the moment of silence, like reflecting on an upcoming math test?  Is a student &quot;coerced&quot; to reflect on the math test if he assumes a fellow student is silently reflecting on the test?  Of course not, and neither is he &quot;coerced&quot; to pray if he <em>assumes</em> a fellow student is praying.  This whole theory of standing is a house of cards that tumbles under the slightest scrutiny.<br /> <br />While other litigants must show evidence of a direct and actual injury to satisfy Article III&#39;s standing requirements, courts all too often allow Establishment Clause plaintiffs to satisfy these requirements by merely alleging that they think a law violates the Establishment Clause, or that they are offended by the law.  That is all the plaintiff in <u>Sherman</u> could muster.  If this is sufficient to confer standing, that doctrine no longer exists for Establishment Clause plaintiffs.&quot;<br />

		<title>FTC should consider competition from regular supermarkets in review of Whole Foods merger</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.dbmlawgroup.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=25&Itemid=65"><strong>Robert Doyle</strong></a> [Partner, <a href="http://www.dbmlawgroup.com">Doyle, Barlow and Mazard, PLLC</a>]: &quot;The FTC&#39;s insistence on pursuing the consummated Whole Foods/Wild Oats transaction is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of present competition between traditional supermarkets and organic food stores.  <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/federal-appeals-court-rejects-whole.php"><strong>The FTC is seeking to undo</strong></a> Whole Foods&#39; acquisition of rival Wild Oats after losing a 2007 preliminary injunction proceeding which was overturned on appeal. Whole Foods and Wild Oats quickly merged prior to the appellate court&#39;s reversal. <br /><br />Traditional supermarkets and specialty organic food retailers have competed with each other and continue to do so aggressively, particularly now given the deep and growing recession we face and the desire for consumers to balance price and quality, and to seek out the least cost food alternatives. Post acquisition evidence suggests that organic food stores, particularly Whole Foods, have suffered sales and revenue losses to the more traditional supermarkets that now offer a number of new organic food lines. Regardless of what the internal Whole Foods&#39; documents or the company&#39;s CEO might have said at the time of its acquisition of Wild Oats, which seem to have formed the basis of the FTC case, the Commission needs to look now at the realities of the marketplace today and judge the state of competition. Though the merged parties may have acknowledged in their past planning and marketing documents the uniqueness of the organic food retail market and shopping experience, present face-to-face competition between Whole Foods and traditional grocery stores speaks volumes of the degree to which these two shopping alternatives now interact in the marketplace. To now argue, as the FTC continues to do, that all organic food stores are a separate market with distinct pricing power, facing no competitive influence from traditional supermarkets, is unrealistic and contrary to everyday observations in the marketplace.<br /><br />In addition to pursuing a flawed theory, this continued FTC action wastes Commission resources and directs FTC attention away from more productive conduct and merger enforcement actions. Crafting a remedy may be futile since many Wild Oats stores have been fully integrated into the Whole Foods&#39; system, are in disrepair, or have been shuttered and abandoned. After years of litigation, if the Commission were to win, it may be unrealistic to expect a court to resurrect or reconfigure a set of abandoned stores that could be a viable supermarket competitor in the future.  Simply said, it is too costly and too late to unscramble the eggs!&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.utlaw.edu/students/faculty/Friedman/friedman.htm">Howard M. Friedman</a></strong> [Distinguished University Professor Emeritus, <a href="http://www.utoledo.edu/">University of Toledo College of Law</a>]: &quot;For an administration that has made so much of both transparency and technology, to date the Obama staff has earned an extremely low grade on content and timeliness of the new <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House website</a>. The Bush White House quickly posted Presidential statements and remarks, news items regarding the President&#39;s activities, bill signings, and the like. It also posted transcripts of daily press briefings. The Obama White House website, at least so far, has little of this.<br /><br />Much of the website contains fairly static material. The &quot;Briefing Room&quot; section is apparently intended as the repository for current developments. Presumably Obama&#39;s section captioned &quot;The Blog&quot; is intended to be the replacement for daily news postings from the Bush White House. However, as of Thursday afternoon the latest Blog posting was <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-pledges-loyalty-to-rule-of-law-in.php">Obama&#39;s Inaugural Address</a>. The media have chronicled a number of newsworthy events occupying the President on Wednesday and Thursday. One might have at least expected some mention online of the <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-retakes-presidential-oath-on.php">second &quot;swearing-in&quot;</a> of President Obama.<br /><br />Like the Bush website, Obama&#39;s has sections for the text of Executive Orders and Proclamations. One would have hoped that the important Executive Orders relating to the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility would have been posted immediately upon their issuance. As of Thursday afternoon, they had not appeared.<br /><br />I suspect there were press briefings on Wednesday and Thursday. No mention of them, let alone transcripts, appears. There is a section of the website for &quot;Pool Reports.&quot; As of Thursday afternoon, none appear.<br /><br />A final irritation is that the Obama White House has taken down all the primary source documents (Executive Orders and Proclamations) that were on the Bush White House site. Many of these still have the force of law, and continued access to them in some way would be most helpful.<br /><br />Perhaps the new White House webmaster&#39;s office has not yet quite gotten its act together. However I would expect more since the first White House Blog posting that appeared emphasized that the new website (put up within minutes of Obama&#39;s swearing-in) &quot;will feature timely and in-depth content to keep everyone up-to-date and educated.&quot;&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.robsherman.com/information/aboutrob.htm"><strong>Rob Sherman</strong></a> [Social activist, plaintiff in <u>Sherman v. Township High School District 214</u>]: &quot;The real purpose of the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?GAID=9&SessionID=51&GA=95&DocTypeID=SB&DocNum=1463&LegID=&SpecSess=&Session">Student Prayer Act</a> was a &quot;see, try and buy&quot; marketing scam by Christian legislators. Christians already had the right to pray before, after and even during school. What they really wanted to accomplish through this law was to force a captive audience of non-religious kids to see the Christian kids praying, in the hope that the non-religious kids would then try it, too, and like it enough to buy into their religious lifestyle. This was all about marketing religion, and nothing about religious freedom.<br /> <br />As stated above, religious kids already had the right to pray, any time they want, even during school. What we atheists objected to was a law that required the teacher to stop teaching during instructional time so that the religious kids could waste time praying during class time instead of studying like they&#39;re supposed to be doing. We atheists certainly resented a law that requires us to waste our time, standing around doing nothing during what should be productive time, just so that Christian kids could make a sales pitch for religion.<br /> <br />When I learned that the judge was a former Board Member of the ACLU of Illinois, I knew that, basically, all we had to do was show up and <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/federal-judge-rules-illinois-school.php">we would win</a>.  If the Illinois Attorney General appeals, I&#39;ll surely lose, because the 7th Circuit is well known to be radically conservative, so I hope that she doesn&#39;t appeal.<br /> <br />As a result of the extreme politicization of our courts by the past three Republican presidents, the courts have lost all credibility. Court cases are decided on the basis of politics, not on the basis of the facts or the law.  Most of us can predict the outcome of Supreme Court cases strictly on the basis of politics. Indeed, we can reliably predict not only how many votes each side will get, but also which justices will vote which way. When that happens, it says that court decisions truly are based on politics, not the merits.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.aclu.org/intlhumanrights/gen/34520res20080319.html">Jennifer Turner</a></strong> [Human Rights Researcher, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/intlhumanrights/index.html">ACLU Human Rights Program</a>]: &quot;President Obama&#39;s recent executive orders to close the Guant&aacute;namo Bay prison camp within a year and to reverse many of the Bush Administration&#39;s most egregious detention and torture policies were a huge first step in restoring America&#39;s standing in the world. With his swift actions, Obama sent a message to the world that the U.S. is newly recommitted to the rule of law. In an encouraging sign, our European allies are now responding to that recommitment. On Monday, European Union (EU) Commissioner Javier Solana announced that several EU member states would likely be <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/eu-member-states-to-consider-accepting.php">willing to accept</a> former Guant&aacute;namo Bay prisoners.<br /><br />The ACLU welcomes the interest of the European leaders, who are trying to assist Obama in making good on his promise to shut down Guant&aacute;namo.  Their leadership signals a new day not just in America, but <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/38502prs20090127.html">in relations with our European allies</a>. Guant&aacute;namo was a problem created by the Bush administration, and the fact that several European countries are willing to assist in this uniquely American legal debacle should be welcomed and appreciated for what it is. <br /><br />To encourage other countries to support the Obama Administration&#39;s closure of Guant&aacute;namo and to facilitate swift restoration of the rule of law, the United States should also accept some of the former Guant&aacute;namo detainees cleared of wrongdoing for resettlement in the U.S. As a first step, the Obama Administration should respond to the EU&#39;s offer by resettling in the U.S. the 17 Uighur Guant&aacute;namo detainees who are members of a long-persecuted Chinese Muslim minority. More than three months ago, a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/37075prs20081007.html">federal judge ordered</a> the government to transfer the Uighurs to the U.S., but that order is on hold due to a pending Bush Administration legal challenge.<br /><br />While it is positive news that progress is being made to implement the closure of Guant&aacute;namo, it should be noted that the executive order signed by the president merely outlines a process and not the complete plan for shutting down the prison camp. The executive order leaves open questions as to whether terrorism suspects may still be held indefinitely without charge or whether the military commissions will be ended and not just halted. <br /><br />The Obama Administration must continue to take steps to fully restore the rule of law as it moves toward shuttering Guant&aacute;namo. That means full and fair criminal trials of Guant&aacute;namo detainees in U.S. courts, or repatriation to their home countries or resettlement in third countries in cases where detainees would face torture or indefinite detention at home. Assurances from the Obama Administration that indefinite detention will be unequivocally banned and that the Guant&aacute;namo military commissions won&#39;t be shipped to American shores would help expedite the closing of Guant&aacute;namo and the long-delayed release of certain prisoners, and assure the world that the rule of law will be fully restored.&quot;<br />

		<title>Brillon case gives Supreme Court chance to clarify limits of speedy trial rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.vermontlaw.edu/Our_Faculty/Faculty_Directory/Cheryl_Hanna.htm"><strong>Cheryl Hanna</strong></a> [Professor of Law, <a href="http://www.vermontlaw.edu/">Vermont Law School</a>]: &quot;The <a href="http://www.vtnetwork.org/main.php">Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Assault</a>, along with seventeen other similar organizations from across the country, filed an amicus brief in <u>Vermont v. Brillon</u>  to call to the Court&#39;s attention the <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/supreme-court-hears-right-to-counsel.php">impact the decision will have</a> on victims of domestic and sexual violence.  We are particularly concerned that allowing a speedy trial claim based solely on delays attributable to the defendant and his counsel will frustrate the ability of the state to prosecute these crimes. <br /><br />One of the most troubling aspects of the case is that the Vermont Supreme Court decision did not account for the fact that in domestic and sexual violence cases, there is a particularly high risk that defendants will manipulate the court system and attempt to further control and harass victims. Unfortunately, the defendant&#39;s behavior in this case is all too typical of domestic and sexual offenders.  Michael Brillon is a habitual domestic offender with fourteen prior convictions, including a felony sexual assault of a minor. His abusive and controlling behavior did not end upon his arrest and his case would have been tried within a reasonable time but for his own behavior. He fired three attorneys, in part because they did not engage in arguably unethical discovery that would have &quot;trashed&quot; his victim and dissuaded her from proceeding. Brillon even threatened the life of one of his attorneys, turning his abusive behavior on the court itself. The kinds of delays and abusive behavior he exhibited can significantly impact a victim&#39;s life physically, emotionally, and financially. Such delays also make it less likely a victim will decide to proceed with a criminal case. Defendants and their counsel understand that without the victim&#39;s participation, prosecution is unlikely.  The Vermont Supreme Court decision gives even more incentive to defendants and their counsel to game the system to their strategic advantage. This is particularly troubling given that the remedy for a speedy trial violation is dismissal. <br /><br />We agree that continuances and delays caused solely by an indigent defendant&#39;s public defender can rise to a speedy trial violation if attributable to the inability or unwillingness of the state public defender system to appoint adequate counsel in a timely manner.  However, a speedy trial claim should never be predicated on delays caused by defendants and/or their counsel. The only way for a court to determine the cause of a delay is to engage in adequate fact-finding. We are hopeful that the United States Supreme Court will clarify the limits of the speedy trial right and alert the trial and appellate courts to the particular risks of defense delay tactics in domestic and sexual violence cases and the consequences of those delays on victims, the public, and the criminal justice system.&quot;<br />

		<title>Guatemalan reparations program for civil war victims&#039; families about more than compensation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ghrc-usa.org/AboutGHRC/Staff.htm"><strong>Amanda Martin</strong></a> [Director, <a href="http://www.ghrc-usa.org">Guatemala Human Rights Commission/USA</a>]: &quot;In April 2005, the United Nations Human Rights Commission adopted a set of international principles on reparations for victims of human rights violations. These include restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition.  Satisfaction includes a search for victims, identification of bodies and reburial, fact verification, public disclosure of the truth, public apologies, commemoration, and tribute to the victims.<br /><br />The Guatemalan National Reparations Program (NRP) was created in 2005 as a result of the recommendations of the UN-sponsored Commission for Historical Clarification.  The program compensates victims&#39; families with $3,000 (US) for each victim. For example, when a family from the department of Q&#39;uiche (where 45% of the massacres took place during the internal armed conflict) <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/guatemala-files-criminal-complaints-for.php">files</a> for compensation for the murder of their father, their case is reviewed, and if accepted, they receive this sum of money. <br /><br />There are several criticisms of the NRP program. As one massacre survivor said, &quot;What amount of money can compensate for the loss of my son?&quot; <br /><br />Many Mayan communities support a comprehensive compensation program. &quot;The current program is purely economic; it doesn&#39;t provide justice to the families.  We want complete reparations, which include housing, because our houses were destroyed during the scorched earth policy.  We want potable water in our communities, accessible health care facilities with updated equipment, paved roads, bilingual education in Mayan villages, medical and psychological services for families suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, an official apology from the Guatemalan government and a promise to never repeat these crimes,&quot; said Maria Dolores Itzep, lawyer from the Rabinal Popular Lawyer&#39;s Collective, who represents her community before the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR) in a massacre case against the Guatemalan state.<br /><br />In 1982, the Guatemalan Army massacred 268 people in the Mayan Achi town of Plan de Sanchez.  The people of the community took their case to the IACHR where a &quot;friendly agreement&quot; was determined with the State. However, the Guatemalan government failed to comply with the terms of the agreement. The case went to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Costa Rica. The community won the case in 2004 and the government now has to comply with each of the items on the list. To date, however, the state has taken few actions to fulfill its obligations, except for economic reparations of $60,000 (US) for each family member killed, and a formal apology by the Vice President in 2005.<br /><br />The backlog of cases filed for the NRP is enormous. With over 150,000 people killed and 47,000 forcibly disappeared, the program is insufficiently staffed and severely under funded. <br /><br />One NRP worker said, &quot;I lost my brother and sister during the war; they were disappeared by the army. Now I work with the NRP, interviewing survivors, taking their testimony. The money is not enough to help them. When $3,000 is divided among 10 family members, it disappears quickly. The testimony is so important; it is part of the ongoing Historical Clarification Commission project, to tell the true story of what happened during the genocide.&quot;&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Matt Belcher</strong> [<a href="http://www.belcherlawoffice.com">Belcher Law Office</a>, Chicago]: &quot;As the &quot;Governor Rod&quot; <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/illinois-senate-removes-blagojevich.php">story ends</a> (for the time being) I wonder if &quot;Citizen Rod&quot; - the future &quot;Defendant please rise Rod&quot; - ever looks in the mirror and wonders how this all happened. It is a fascinating story - almost Chi-town Dostoevsky.<br /><br />The average cable news viewer probably only knows the two-minute version of the story: &quot;Illinois Governor with funny name, Burt Convey hair helmet, who channels Elvis and quotes Tennyson, attempts to sell Obama&#39;s Senate seat to the highest bidder, so says U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald.&quot;<br /><br />Yet beyond the pompadour and circumstances &#8212; the back-story of our young Milorad &quot;Rod&quot; Blagojevich is compelling.<br /><br />The young protagonist, &ETH;&#339;&ETH;&cedil;&ETH;&raquo;&ETH;&frac34;&Ntilde;&#8364;&ETH;&deg;&ETH;&acute; &quot;Rod&quot; &ETH;&#8216;&ETH;&raquo;&ETH;&deg;&ETH;&sup3;&ETH;&frac34;&Ntilde;&#732;&ETH;&micro;&ETH;&sup2;&ETH;&cedil;&Ntilde;&#8250;, born in Chicago of sturdy immigrant peasant stock, struggles against adversity, prejudice and a stacked-deck to succeed against the odds to the soaring heights of the Governorship of the great state of Illinois...by first selling his soul to the Chicago political machine and then marrying it (literally). Suddenly getting too big for his britches and his pride wounded, Rod began burning bridges and taking no prisoners, and thus he ultimately overstepped the protection of the very Chicago machine that allowed his success -leading to his tragic downfall from grace and into the dark pit of a federal penitentiary.<br /><br />The novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment">Crime and Punishment</a> focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemma of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a poor Russian ex-student who plans and commits the murder of an unscrupulous pawnbroker to solve his financial woes while simultaneously ridding the world of a worthless parasite. Raskolnikov also strives to be an extraordinary being, on par with Napoleon, believing that murder may be justified if committed in service to a higher purpose.    <br /><br />Since the MTV generation may not have the patience for a new 500 page novel, is this scandal the setting for the Rod Blagojevich made-for-TV movie?  Or, should we believe the &quot;Rod is Solzhenitsyn&quot; ala <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gulag_Archipelago">The Gulag Archipelago</a> media blitz as witnessed on The View and David Letterman?<br /><br />So much depends on the rest of the story. Blagojevich may be the underdog in the criminal trial if even only a small part of the evidence offered by Fitzgerald pans out.  <br /><br />Assuming the worst, does our protagonist then go quietly and suffer in silence like a good Chicago machine soldier - or does the egomania set in and he vindictively decides to take everyone down with him?  <br /><br />We will have to wait and see if there is a cyrillic version of &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omert%C3%A0">omert&agrave;</a>&quot; (the code of silence) and whether the cold, gray walls of prison convince &quot;Inmate Rod&quot; to sing because no one swims to the top of the Chicago machine without knowing the secrets which lay in the darkness of the deep.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Stephen Blanks</strong> [Secretary, <a href="http://www.nswccl.org.au/">NSW Council for Civil Liberties</a>]: &quot;Last week, Abdul Nacer Benbrika and <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/australia-court-sentences-algerian.php">6 followers were sentenced</a> in the Victorian Supreme Court, Melbourne, to terms of imprisonment ranging from 6 years to 15 years, for terrorism related offenses committed in 2004-2005. The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSC/2009/21.html">offenses</a> included belonging to and financially supporting a terrorist organization, and possessing material in preparation for a terrorist act.<br /><br />No act of violence or terrorism was in fact committed, nor was one even planned. The organization to which those convicted belonged was an unincorporated group of persons led by Benbrika, and comprising members of his mosque. It had no apparent affiliation with any outside organization. The group engaged in detailed discussion about violent jihad and members expressed support for acts of terrorism. The materials to which the possession charge related were a CD.<br /><br />Aspects of these convictions raise serious concerns about the operation of Australia&#39;s anti-terrorism laws.<br /><br />The convictions are under laws about which the Courts have <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/2006/101.html">noted</a>:<br /><blockquote>Preparatory acts are not often made into criminal offenses. The particular nature of terrorism has resulted in a special, and in many ways unique, legislative regime...A policy judgment has been made that the prevention of terrorism requires criminal responsibility to arise at an earlier stage than is usually the case for other kinds of criminal conduct, e.g. well before an agreement has been reached for a conspiracy charge.</blockquote><br />Indeed, in the present case, the convictions are based in part on a version of the laws which had been amended with retrospective effect to ensure that a conviction could be obtained for acts done in preparation for a terrorist act, without the need to identify any particular terrorist act that was being prepared. These amendments were <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/australian-pm-backs-down-in-face-of.php">reported</a> in <em>JURIST</em> in November 2005.<br /><br />Inchoate offenses such as those in this case are inherently susceptible to discrimination and abuse. This is especially the case where the political environment creates an environment of fear for which the natural response is &quot;tough action.&quot; The jury in this case found 4 of the accused not guilty of any offense. They had spent nearly 3 years in maximum security jail conditions while on remand.<br /><br />Some commentators have described the convictions as being based primarily on &quot;loose talk&quot; by the group. Unlike the US, Australia has no constitutional protection for free speech. Given that there was no planned or imminent act of terrorism, it is doubtful that convictions could have been obtained if this conduct had occurred in the US.<br /><br />It appears that the only occasion in which Benbrika was involved in any sort of overt act was an incident where a Victorian police officer who had infiltrated the group demonstrated to him how to make an explosion using commonly available chemicals. There is plenty of room for debate on whether this style of police infiltration goes too far.<br /><br />There is also room for debating whether application of criminal sanctions for these type of offenses is the best method for defeating the threat of terrorism. More effective counter-terrorism strategies in this case may have been to engage with Benbrika and his associates, to undermine any support for violence and to take measures to integrate them more with the mainstream Muslim community and wider Australian community. Criminalizing their conduct risks further alienating their community, rather than being a deterrence.<br /><br />Although lengthy, the sentences are perceived to be a disappointment to the prosecutors and the proponents of tough anti-terrorism laws, who like to take a &quot;throw away the key&quot; approach.<br /><br />There will no doubt be appeals against conviction and sentence. The final outcome of this case is definitely one to watch.&quot;<br />

This decision marks a critical turning point in post-September 11 American policy.  <br /><br />The decision also says something about Mr. Obama's view of Presidential emergency power.  It has long been understood that the commander-in-chief has the authority to act quickly and decisively in the face of an attack on the United States.  After September 11, President George W. Bush used this power to establish the Guantanamo facility and the network of secret prisons.  <br /><br />To be sure, a legitimate emergency situation existed on and after September 11, one that likely justified at least the detention, at remote locations, of individuals who threatened harm to American citizens.  The problem with the exercise of the emergency power is determining when the threat has abated and the President, to achieve his policy ends, must once again resort to the traditional mode of lawmaking, as spelled out in the Constitution. <br /> <br />President Obama's decision to close Guantanamo suggests that, in this instance, the original emergency has at last ended, such that the terror suspects may now be held and tried safely in either our criminal or military justice systems.  This decision will have precedential value in evaluating future claims of emergency power, as President Obama must have determined that any threat posed to our interests by entrusting the detainees to the criminal or military justice systems in the United States has passed.<br /><br />Importantly, the President is not saying that the larger threat of terrorism is at an end &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; far from it. Rather, his order is a step toward dismantling the responses to September 11 that President Bush created using his emergency authority and returning the government back to its traditional mode of lawmaking.  Experience shows that the products of this mode of lawmaking are superior to exclusively executive efforts, not least because the involvement of Congress creates multiple avenues for holding government leaders accountable for their actions and ensuring they are responsive to the needs of constituents.<br /><br />Still, the question remains:  how should the public evaluate any Presidential claim of emergency?  <br /><br />In addition to looking to the considered judgment of the person occupying the Oval Office, guidance may be found in the U.S. Supreme Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. There is an exception to the Fourth Amendment's requirement of a search warrant when the benefits of obtaining a warrant are outweighed by the costs to law enforcement and to society at large of the delay in obtaining one, and a number of factors relevant to this Fourth Amendment analysis are also applicable in the national security context.  <br /><br />The most important factor is the potential harm if the President could not respond to an immediate threat absent Congressional approval.  At some point, however, a threat is no longer immediate, and then the emergency has ended. Were this not the case, the President would enjoy essentially unchecked authority indefinitely.  <br /><br />Applying this guidance to the detention of terror suspects, it seems clear that, by the time the highest court in the land had an opportunity to review the claims of some of the detainees, and Congress began to legislate on matters relating to the detention and trial of the suspects, any immediate threat had surely passed.  <br /><br />Yet, during the course of his Presidency, George W. Bush never really wavered in his belief that he had the authority to detain and to try terror suspects. There is precedent here, too, and it is one with which we will have to reckon in the future.  For when the next threat to the nation presents itself, we must hope that the situation does not become an excuse for the President to wield power unilaterally for as long as he likes, contrary to the sound and preferable processes for lawmaking that the framers established more than two hundred years ago.  <br /> <br /><br /><br /><em>Lawrence Friedman teaches constitutional law and state constitutional law and Victor Hansen teaches criminal law and criminal procedure at New England School of Law.  Their book, </em>The Case for Congress: Separation of Powers and the War on Terror<em>, will be published in 2009.</em><br />

Subramanian of the <a href="http://www.hnlu.ac.in/home/">Hidayatullah National Law University</a> in Raipur, India, says that recent UN Security Council endorsement of a law enforcement mechanism called a &quot;shipriders agreement&quot; represents a significant step forward in the new international fight against piracy off the coast of Somalia...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/somalipirates.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->M<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->aritime piracy is one of the oldest international crimes, and the world is now witnessing a new wave of pirate attacks, especially off the coast of Somalia. The ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) International Maritime Bureau reported 293 piracy incidents in 2008 in which 49 vessels were hijacked, 889 people were taken hostage, 32 crew members were injured and some were killed. Over 100 of these pirate attacks occurred off Somalia. These incidents have aggravated the political conflict in Somalia, which continues to pose a threat to international peace and security in the region. This situation presents key challenges to international law.  <br /><br /><strong>Law of the Sea</b><br /><br />The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is the chief source of international law concerned with public order at sea. Popularly known as the "constitution of the oceans," it codified the laws relating to territorial waters, sea lanes and resources of ocean. According to the Convention, every State has the right to claim the breadth of its territorial sea up to 12 nautical miles as measured from the shoreline, where its coastal sovereignty will extend. As piracy is an international crime, it is obvious that it can only be committed on the high seas. <br /><br />The Convention defines piracy as any illegal act of violence, detention, or depredation committed by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft against another on the high seas. As international law considers piracy <em>hostis humani generis</em> (an enemy of mankind), it is established as an offense of universal jurisdiction. Accordingly, all states are entitled to seize a pirate ship or aircraft and arrest the persons and seize the property on board and try the pirates according to their own laws. <br /><br />In 1988, to address "other forms" of violence at sea, the Rome Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (also known as the SUA Convention) and its Fixed Platforms Protocol were developed. The Convention  prohibits a broad range of acts with the aim of ensuring safe navigation and, to a limited extent, deals with the act of using the ship as a weapon against navigational safety. Terrorist attacks necessitated the passage of a Protocol to the SUA Convention in 2005 which, inter alia, criminalizes the use of a ship to further an act of terrorism. <br /><br /><strong>Legal Impediments</strong> <br /><br />Despite the fact that the international legal regime applicable to maritime piracy contains no gaping holes, the actual practice of states indicates that the law is inaccessible to the international community. Most countries are hesitant to enact the international legal provisions and to prosecute perpetrators. There are several reasons for this hesitancy. Chasing pirates into the territorial waters of a sovereign state would amount to the violation of international law of the sea. Moreover, even if they are captured on the high seas, the criminal justice system in Somalia, a possible jurisdiction, is in a state of collapse since the outbreak of civil war in 1991. Hence the prospect of trial of captured pirates in Somalia is very bleak. On the other hand, the countries which have the naval capabilities to carry out the arrest and seizure are also afraid of domestic political repercussions due to human rights concerns and possible claims of asylum. These factors have provided a perfect opportunity for the Somali pirates to intensify their attacks. <br /><br /><strong>International Response</strong> <br /><br />The United Nations Security Council has now considered this issue and, in Resolution 1846 (2008), has directed that for a period of 12 months, states and regional organizations cooperating with the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) may enter into territorial waters of Somalia and use all necessary means to repress acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea. Moreover, to sort out the issues associated with the jurisdiction, it called upon a host of states - including states which have ships registered to them, port and coastal states, states of the nationality of victims or perpetrator, and other states with relevant jurisdiction under international law and national legislation - to cooperate in determining jurisdiction and in the investigation and prosecution of pirates. <br /><br />The lack of judicial capacity and the limited naval capabilities in the region have nonetheless led the leading naval powers to hesitate in intervening. Concerns as to the future of captured pirates have meanwhile hindered well-coordinated global action. <br /><br />In this context the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has offered a breakthrough proposal called the "Shipriders Agreement". According to the proposal, approved last month by the Security Council in its <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9541.doc.htm">Resolution 1851</a> (2008), states and regional organizations fighting piracy are encouraged to conclude special agreements with countries willing to take custody of pirates in order to allow local law enforcement officials (shipriders) on board foreign vessels to pursue, arrest and prosecute the pirates. Shipriders agreements have, in the past, been successfully employed by states against narcotics transportation, protection of fishing resources and maritime environment, and in removing jurisdictional barriers to investigation and prosecution. <br /><br />The countries around Somalia and elsewhere should make full use of this innovative arrangement. With effective prosecution, maritime piracy could once again become a thing of the past. An even more lasting solution, however, would be to increase the criminal justice capacity of the states in the region and to implement the SUA Convention and the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (TOC Convention) and other relevant instruments to which they are  party in the hope of restoring public order at sea off the coast of Somalia. <br />    <br /><br /><em>S.R.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that President Barack Obama should follow up his executive order banning torture and inhumane interrogation by fulfilling treaty-based and customary international legal obligations to either initiate prosecution of or to extradite all persons - including high US officials - reasonably accused of having previously authorized, ordered, abetted, or perpetrated torture and other war crimes and/or crimes against humanity....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/paustbig.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->O<!-- odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->n January 22, 2009, President Barack Obama signed an Executive Order on<br /><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations/">Ensuring Lawful Interrogations</a>, mandating that all U.S. interrogations of persons comply, at a minimum, with the requirements under treaty-based and customary international law reflected in common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and, therefore, that all persons "shall in all circumstances be treated humanely."  The Order lists among its purposes the need "to promote the safe, lawful, and humane treatment of individuals in United States custody and of United States personnel who are detained in armed conflicts, to ensure compliance with the treaty obligations of the United States, including the Geneva Conventions, and to take care that the laws of the United States are faithfully executed."<br /><br /> Additionally, the Executive Order assures that all interrogations of any individual "in the custody or under the effective control of an officer, employee, or other agent of the United States Government, or detained within a facility owned, operated, or controlled by a department or agency of the United States, in any armed conflict," will be conducted in accordance with the <a href="http://www.army.mil/references/FM2-22.3.pdf">2006 U.S. Army Field Manual on intelligence collection</a>. The Field Manual also requires that common Article 3 will provide a minimum standard for treatment of human beings.  Importantly, the military manual - the product of what finally became a successful opposition by military lawyers to use of illegal interrogation tactics - lists specific tactics that must never be used, such as waterboarding, use of extreme cold (e.g., the cold-cell), use of dogs, and stripping persons naked and hooding, all tactics of torture, cruel and inhumane treatment that were authorized by President Bush for use during his admitted "program" of "tough" interrogation and secret detention or forced disappearance (which is itself a crime against humanity and war crime) and as part of the well-documented "common, unifying" plan to deny Geneva law protections and to use and attempt to justify serial and cascading criminality in the form of coercive interrogation.  In fact, last summer it was disclosed that such tactics had been addressed and expressly and/or tacitly approved and facilitated during several meetings of the National Security Council's Principals Committee in the White House during 2002 and 2003 that were attended by Dick Cheney, his lawyer David Addington, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, George Tenet, John Ashcroft, and others who facilitated their approval and use, including John Yoo.  Several lawyers even made a trip to Guantanamo in September 2002 to discuss use of SERE [Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape] tactics and some saw how they were being used against detainees being held in secret detention.<br /><br /> In this regard, President Obama's Order states: "Executive Order 13440 of July 20, 2007, is revoked.  All executive directives, orders, and regulations inconsistent with this order, including but not limited to those issued to or by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from September 11, 2001, to January 20, 2009, concerning detention or the interrogation of detained individuals, are revoked to the extent of their inconsistency with this order."  It would serve transparency and our democratic values to declassify all such directives, orders, and regulations with lawful interrogation tactics and assessments thereof blacked-out if need be, thus leaving for the public eye the unlawful tactics that had been authorized and abetted (since they are unlawful and should never be used again), most of which are known publicly anyway.<br /><br /> What President Obama has done is necessary to reassure the world that there is a new U.S. commitment to the rule of law, reaffirm that no one is above the law, and reclaim U.S. respect and integrity.  Importantly, what the President has done is necessary under the United States Constitution.  Our Constitution requires nothing less than that the President "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed," and it has been known since the Founding that such laws include treaty-based and customary international law, such as common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.  Indeed, every relevant judicial opinion since the beginning of the United States has recognized that the President and all within the Executive branch are bound by the laws of war, a point famously reaffirmed by President Lincoln's Attorney General in 1865 while addressing the need to prosecute war crimes and the lack of congressional power to limit the reach of the laws of war.  International laws that President Obama must faithfully execute during an armed conflict include common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions as well as all other treaty-based and customary laws of war, the Convention Against Torture, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (which also prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment in all circumstances, including in times of relative peace), and related customary international laws.  President Obama's executive order to replace unlawful authorizations and orders during the Bush Administration with the requirement that such laws be faithfully executed by all U.S. nationals and certain other persons covered by the Order is the constitutionally proper and necessary response.<br /> <br /> What should ultimately follow is presidential execution of treaty-based and customary international legal obligations to either initiate prosecution of or to extradite all persons who are reasonably accused of having authorized, ordered, abetted, or perpetrated war crimes and/or crimes against humanity.  For example, Article 146 of the 1949 Geneva Civilian Convention expressly and unavoidably requires that all Parties "search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, ... grave breaches [of the Convention] and shall bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before its own courts" for "effective penal sanctions" or, "if it prefers, ... hand such persons over for trial to another High Contracting Party."  The obligation is absolute and applies with respect to alleged perpetrators of any status.  As a party to the Geneva Conventions, the United States must either initiate prosecution or extradite to another state or, today, render an accused to the International Criminal Court.  "Grave breaches" of the Convention include "torture or inhuman treatment" and transfer of a non-prisoner of war from occupied territory.  Similarly, Article 7, paragraph 1, of the Convention Against Torture expressly and unavoidably requires that a Party to the treaty "under whose jurisdiction a person alleged to have committed ... [for example, torture or "complicity or participation in torture"] is found, shall ... if it does not extradite him, submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution."  There are no other alternatives. <br /> <br /> As documented in a recent draf
t law review article on "The Absolute Prohibition of Torture and Necessary and Appropriate Sanctions," [to be posted soon on SSRN at <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1331159">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1331159</a>] ultimately President Obama can restore the rule of law, bring an end to seven years of impunity, and restore American honor, integrity, and respect only by adherence to the express and unavoidable constitutional duty of the President of the United States to faithfully execute the laws, including relevant international laws requiring prosecution or extradition of criminal accused.  It is not a decision for committees, politics, and compromises, but of law.  It is not a decision that may be comfortable, but it is one that President Obama must make at this defining moment in our history that follows well-known serial and cascading criminality never before authorized by a President and Vice President.  It is a decision that must be made by President Obama as he begins to define his legacy. <br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

These steps will get the U.S. back on the road toward compliance with fundamental international law obligations &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a path we left so dramatically and publicly with another presidential order: President Bush's Military Order of November 13, 2001, "Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism."  <br /><br />President Obama's action, two days after his inauguration, is extremely important for the rule of law in the world.  We can certainly hope for similar actions during the next four years.  But can we hope for more?  Can we expect the United States to return to the more general and robust commitment to international law that our leaders displayed until the 1960s?  That, unfortunately, seems unlikely in the next four years.  International law has simply been denigrated for too long among America's foreign policy elite. But I may underestimate the President.  He may well have the wisdom to understand what so many of his predecessors did.  Complying with international law is the surest way to realize our most cherished aspirations and to recapture our standing in the world.  International law is the best means for promoting peace, prosperity, respect for human rights and protection of the natural environment. <br /><br />But only one day after President Obama signed the order respecting the rights of detainees, the C.I.A. once again used an unmanned Predator drone to attack Pakistan.  The media is reporting that the President approved the strike. (Richard A. Opel, Jr., &quot;Strikes in Pakistan Underscore Obama's Options&quot;, N.Y.Times.com, Jan. 24, 2009.) It is unclear whether these strikes have Pakistan's consent or Afghanistan's consent&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the territory from where they are launched.  Pakistan's president protested the latest attack and Afghanistan's president has said time and again that killing civilians is counter-productive in the struggle against terrorists.  And these attacks often result in the death of innocents.  Some estimate that the United States has killed as many as 100 civilians in the series of attacks on Pakistan that President Bush secretly authorized as long ago as 2007.  <br /><br />What explains the new President's two decisions: one to comply with international law and one to violate it? The President has received a huge amount of advice in recent months on the treatment of detainees; he has likely heard little or nothing about international law's restrictions on the use of force.  In researching <em>The Power and Purpose of International Law</em>, I looked into what lay behind the changes that took place in America with respect to general international law in the 1960s.  American leaders until that decade were well versed in international law and demonstrated great respect for it, if not perfect compliance.  By the 1960s, this knowledge and respect were demonstrably slipping away.  One reason for the change appears to lie with the influence on U.S. foreign policy of Hans Morgenthau and his students.   <br /><br />Morgenthau was a scholar of international law and international relations in Germany when he forced by the Nazis to seek refuge in the United States.  When he arrived, he turned decisively away from international law and toward promotion of the United States as the world's dominant power.  His own personal sense of having been controlled by powerful figures &#8212; his father, schoolyard bullies, teachers, external reviewers, government authorities, and university deans &#8212; may explain why he thought the ultimate goal of all men is the quest for power and that security lay only in having greater power than others.  He feared international law would hold the United States back.  In his highly influential textbook, <em>Politics Among Nations</em>, Morgenthau wrote an attack on international law basically arguing that international law's sanctions are too weak to command respect by the United States.  Morgenthau's thinking has had a profound impact in the United States.  He and his students launched the realist school of international relations scholarship that continues to hold a highly dismissive view of international law &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; most students of political science and international relations in the U.S. still read <em>Politics Among Nations</em> (now 60-year-old and in its seventh edition).  <br /><br />By the 1960s, realists dominated foreign policy circles.  Few legal scholars were answering their critique of international law.  Indeed, in U.S. law school by the 1960s, international law was no longer the prestige subject it had been.  Some scholars such as Myres McDougal at Yale and Louis Henkin at Columbia were trying to keep international law "policy relevant", but the law schools were caught up in the civil rights and women's movements.  The interesting aspect of international law was increasingly the area of human rights and not general international law.  A number of top law schools went for years without a prominent scholar teaching and publishing in public international law.  <br /><br />These developments in political science and law have resulted in a decline in respect for and even knowledge of general international law in this country.  By the 1990s with the end of the Cold War, a human rights revolution exploded on the international stage.  But its scholars and activists have backgrounds in political science or constitutional law.  <br /><br />President Obama studied international relations at Columbia University and law at Harvard when the intellectual emphases were on civil and human rights but not general international law.  Many of his new advisers in foreign policy are well known for their concern for human rights but are also associated with pressing for the use of military force even in violation of international law.  Indeed, it is understandable that any student of political science in the United States in recent decades would conclude that the best way to show American commitment to human rights is to be willing to use military force in response to human rights violations.<br /><br />International law, however, emphasizes the peaceful settlement of disputes and non-lethal means to promote human rights.  It is clear that in international law, peace is itself a human right and one essential to the flourishing of other human rights.  Killing in the name of human rights has inevitably been counter-productive in the long term.  Killing innocent civilians to end terrorism may also lead to greater hatred and interest in revenge that further fuels the problem of terrorism.<br /><br />Complying with international law across the board in areas of human rights, the environment, the economy and the use of force may sound like a radical change for America.  But it is change we should believe in.<br /><br /><br /><em>Mary Ellen O'Connell hold the Robert and Marion Short Chair in Law at the University of Notre Dame.

		<title>&#039;Advice and Consent&#039;: How the Senate Should Vet Obama Cabinet Picks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.williamgeorgeross.com/">William G. Ross</a> of Cumberland School of Law, Samford University, says that for various constitutional, political and practical reasons made all the more pressing by controversies surrounding a number of high-profile and now even withdrawn nominees, the US Senate should subject President Barack Obama&#39;s cabinet picks to a robust confirmation process that will help ensure that executive officials conform to rigorous standards of ability and character...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/williamrossnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he controversies that have developed over several of President Barack Obama's Cabinet nominees furnish an important reminder that the U.S. Senate's constitutional role in providing "Advice and Consent" in connection with the appointment of executive officers is no mere formality. The Senate should offer robust "Advice" and should not hesitate to withhold its "Consent" if it concludes that a nominee is deficient in qualifications or character, if potential conflicts of interest threaten a nominee's independence, or if the Senate has serious objections to a nominee's policy preferences. <br /><br /> The Senate has had no reason to question the professional qualifications of any of Obama's nominees, whose  resumes glitter with an abundance of the credentials that are regarded as the hallmarks of success in contemporary America. The nominees &#8212; ten of whom already have been confirmed -- include several members of Congress, governors,  a former Army chief of staff, and the first Nobel laureate ever to join a Cabinet, Energy Secretary Steven Chu. <br /><br />  The "best and the brightest," however, do not necessarily have the type of wisdom and courage that are at least as important as experience and technical competence in a high public official. It is ironic that the commanding professional profiles of several nominees, including Timothy Geithner (Treasury), Tom Daschle (Health and Human Services), Bill Richardson (Commerce), Eric Holder (Justice), and Hillary Clinton (Secretary of State) have created situations that have called into question their personal fitness for Cabinet posts.<br /><br /> Geithner and Daschle failed to report significant amounts of income that they derived as a result of their professional prominence. Geithner's unreported income came from the International Monetary Fund, while Daschle's was derived from a post-Senate career as a highly paid consultant.  Geithner's nomination also was clouded by the revelation that he employed a housekeeper whose immigration papers expired while she was working for him. Although most Cabinet nominees are confirmed with virtually unanimous votes, the Senate last week confirmed Geithner by the underwhelming margin of 60 to 34 because many senators, including three Democrats, believed that Geithner's omissions were inexcusably negligent, if not willful. Geithner's failure to pay overdue taxes until after his nomination was particularly troubling because Geithner will oversee the Internal Revenue Service. Daschle properly withdrew his name Tuesday in the wake of mounting criticism.<br /><br /> Many Americans who were disgusted by the cheap shots that some Republicans aimed at the Internal Revenue Service during recent years are naturally dismayed that the confirmation of Geithner and the defenses of Daschle by Democratic senators demonstrate that too many Democrats likewise have a cavalier attitude toward tax irregularities. As Republican Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming explained in voting against Geithner, "Nominees for positions that do not oversee tax reporting and collection have been forced to withdraw their nomination for more minor offenses." Democratic Senator Robert F. Byrd of West Virginia questioned whether Geithner ever would have paid the taxes if he had not been nominated for Treasury Secretary. <br /><br /> Many senators apparently were willing to overlook Geithner's tax and servant problems because they contended that Geithner's talents and experience were urgently needed at the Treasury Department during a time of economic crisis. One could argue, however, that economically troubled times require a greater than ordinary faith in the personal integrity of the Treasury Secretary. Much of the present economic turmoil has resulted from a lack of confidence in the wisdom and probity of public officials and the chief officers of major corporations. The appointment of a Treasury Secretary who, for whatever reason, has failed to report significant income in a timely manner is likely to further erode the confidence of citizens and markets in our faltering economic system. Similarly, the Senate should have rejected Daschle's nomination if Daschle had not withdrawn, unless Daschle could have presented a compelling explanation for his failure to pay all of his taxes in a timely manner.<br /><br /> Withdrawal of an embarrassing nomination is a way for the President and his nominee to avoid the humiliation of a rejection. The Senate has rejected only one per cent of the nine hundred Cabinet nominations it has considered during the past 220 years, but other nominations have been withdrawn.  New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, Obama's nominee for Commerce Secretary, withdrew last month in the wake of a grand jury investigation into alleged influence peddling in connection with state contracts.  Nancy Killefer, Obama's nominee to serve as the government's chief performance officer, withdrew on account of questions about the payroll on her household help.<br /><br /> An issue of character also clouded the nomination of Eric Holder, Obama's nominee for Attorney General. Some senators and commentators expressed misgivings about Holder's role in President Clinton's 2001 pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich, when Holder was deputy attorney general. When White House counsel solicited his opinion about the pardon, Holder replied, "Neutral, leaning toward favorable." The Senate confirmed Holder's nomination by a vote of 75 to 21, with the Rich issue presumably accounting for many or most of the negative votes. <br /><br /> Although Holder has expressed contrition for his failure to oppose a pardon that continues to generate widespread outrage, many of Holder's critics contend that Holder's failure to stand up to the Clinton Administration augurs poorly for his ability to exercise the kind of independence that is critically important in an attorney general. As <em>Washington Post</em> columnist Richard Cohen has pointed out, "any person is entitled to make a mistake. But no one is entitled to be attorney general. That's a post that ought to be reserved for a lawyer who appreciates that while he reports to the president, he is the people's lawyer." Cohen's remark echoes then - Senator Joseph R. Biden's admonition to Edwin Meese in 1985 that "you are...to become the people's lawyer more than you are to be the president's lawyer."<br /><br />Many Democrats may have felt, however, that professional independence did not need to be a major issue in Holder's confirmation insofar as they trust Obama to pursue wise policies that should not require a nay-saying Attorney General.<br /><br /> There is widespread agreement that the Senate should examine attorney general nominations with especially strict scrutiny because attorneys general are responsible for enforcing the law fairly on behalf of all American citizens, particularly persons who lack effective means of influencing the executive and legislative branches of government. The Senate also should scrutinize Attorney General nominees more carefully than others because the Justice Department is more intimately connected than are other executive departments with both the legislative and judicial branches of government.<br /><br /> Another controversy, involving potential conflict
s of interest, arose in connection with Hillary Clinton's nomination as secretary of state on account of William J. Clinton's widespread business interests and establishment of  foundations that have attracted substantial contributions from foreign governments. As Republican Senator Richard Lugar explained, "The core of the problem is that foreign governments and entities may perceive the Clinton Foundation as a means to gain favor with the secretary of state." Similarly, Republican Senator John Vitter of Louisiana warned that "President Clinton's business and foundation dealings are a multi-million dollar minefield of conflicts of interest. And that could produce explosions at any minute, particularly in the Middle East, where we least need them." <br /><br /> But while the potential for conflicts of interest may have been substantial, senators appear to have concluded the actual likelihood of conflicts of interest were too remote for rejection of a nominee who has a potent political constituency and considerable knowledge of foreign policy. The Senate approved her nomination by a vote of 98 to 2.<br /><br /> Concerns about ideology have stalled the confirmation of only one nominee, Representative Hilda Solis, Obama's nominee for Labor Secretary. <br /><br /> Solis has expressed reluctance to express an opinion about legislation that to abolish secret ballots in union elections, which unions believe would facilitate labor organization. Controversy over Solis's position on this issue appears to reflect deeper anxiety among conservatives that Solis's policies as secretary of labor would help to re-invigorate the American labor movement. <br /><br /> The degree to which senators may properly use ideology as a criteria in the Cabinet confirmation process is a subject of some controversy among senators and scholars. <br /><br /> Some have argued that the Senate should heavily defer to the President's choices because the President has a mandate from the people to select administrators who favor the President's policies.<br /><br /> The President's choices also may be entitled to deference to the extent that the President needs to have advisors with whom he is ideologically compatible and who can be trusted to faithfully execute the President's programs. The late Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington expressed the views of many senators in his own time and now when he observed forty years ago that "these are the President's men and he is entitled to have them, barring some flagrant error or abuse of his prerogatives in making his nominations." Jackson, a Democrat, voted to confirm Nixon's Cabinet nominees even though these men were not the type of persons he would have appointed if he had won any of his own presidential bids. Moreover, as Senator John H. Glenn once pointed out, " faith and trust in key subordinates can have an important bearing on the efficiency and effectiveness of government." <br /><br /> It is natural that many senators, particularly Democrats, are inclined to defer heavily to Obama's choices. Unlike Clinton and Bush Jr., Obama was elected with an absolute majority of the popular vote, and his election has generated goodwill and a sense of a fresh beginnings even among many persons who did not vote for him. <br /><br /> Senators should be mindful, however, of the late Senator Warren Magnuson's admonition that no one "is anointed simply because he is appointed."<br /><br /> Although the president's nominees are entitled to at least some deference under a "mandate" theory, American presidential elections never provide clear mandates for particular  policies. Party platforms long ago degenerated into empty rhetoric contrived to appease special interest groups, and many critics of Obama contend that he was even vaguer than most candidates about what he would do as President.<br /><br /> Moreover, senators, too, have a mandate from the people. Ideological issues are at least as important to voters in their selection of senators as they are in the election of a president.  As Senator Carl Levin once observed, "the President is entitled to someone in whom he has confidence, of course, but the Nation is also entitled to someone in whom it has confidence."<br /><br /> Furthermore, Cabinet members owe responsibilities not only to the President but also to Congress. As the constitutional scholar Louis Fisher has observed, "Department heads and their assistants are not mere staff support for the President. They are called upon to administer programs that Congress has enacted into law." Accordingly, Fisher has aptly argued that "to defer to the President on the principle that he has a right to select his own assistants makes a nullity of the Senate's advice-and-consent role."<br /><br /> The Senate clearly therefore has a duty to inquire into the political philosophies and policy preferences of nominees. Indeed, Biden, while serving as a senator, went so far during a Republican Administration in 1989 as to argue that "the burden is upon the nominee to establish his qualification for office and not vice versa." <br /><br /> In order to determine the ideological preferences and likely policies of nominees, senate committees have a duty to conduct wide-ranging hearings. As  Enzi explained in criticizing Solis for her reticence about the ballot legislation, the Senate has "the obligation to really get it down on paper what [the nominees'] beliefs are." <br /> <br /> The hearings on Geithner, however, failed to provide an exploration of how Geithner's views on important economic issues. Geithner testified before the Finance Committee only for a few hours and provided what many observers regarded as vague answers to questions about how he would address the nation's banking mess. <br /><br /> The Senate apparently rushed through its deliberations on Geithner because the Administration and many senators insisted that the treasury secretaryship should not remain vacant even for a few days during a time of economic crisis. But this argument ought to be turned  on its head. Since the treasury secretary will have a key role in efforts to restore the nation's financial stability, the Senate should have taken particular care in selecting this official. The haste with which Congress approved the Patriot Act in 2001 and the financial bailout last autumn should provide vivid reminders that the Senate ought to take its time in considering important issues. The recession is grim, but there is no emergency that required the immediate confirmation of a treasury secretary.<br /><br /> Hearings also provide an opportunity for senators to share their own views with the nominees and to conduct an inter-branch colloquy about important public issues. The hearings on Chu, for example, included a serious discussion of American energy policies. <br /> <br /> Geithner's nomination could have provided a useful opportunity for considering critical policy issues involving the economy, but senators failed to use the hearings for this purpose. In particular, too few senators expressed concern about the extent to which Geithner may have supported easy credit policies during his tenure as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The confirmation of Geithner could have provided a forum for debating the wisdom of trying to end the recession by employing the same louche monetary policies that caused the recession. Such a debate was never likely, however, since few senators of either party appear to have any serious interest in preventing inflation, discouraging feckless consumption, reducing the federal deficit, rewarding personal thrift, or relieving the distress of countless retirees whose incomes have plummeted in the wake of near-zero interest rates.  <br /><br /> Although the Geithner hearings also should have provided the occasion for discussion of the wisdom of the controversial bailout of financial institutions, which Geithner supported, such a discussion likewise was unlikely because most senators voted for the bailout. The failure of senators to question Geithner more closely about his economic views therefore may reflect fundamental defects in policy p
references of the senators more than any defect in the confirmation process itself.<br /> <br /> One reason why the Senate does not always conduct searching examinations into the opinions of a nominee is that the Senate is constrained by practical limitations on its time. Since any qualified nominee has a long record of public service, almost every nominee is bound to carry some kind of controversial baggage. In many instances, an exhaustive examination of a nominee would unduly protract the confirmation process if there is little likelihood that the Senate's investigation would turn up anything new that might cause the Senate to reject the nomination. The Senate, for example, easily could have spent the next four years delving into the intricacies of the Clintons' finances and the foreign policy records of President Clinton and Senator Clinton. <br /><br /> Moreover, if the Senate rejects a nominee on ideological grounds, it has no assurance that the President will appoint a more palatable candidate. As one senator observed in explaining his support for Geithner, "this is the best you can expect from this administration." Although the Senate may reject a nominee, there is no way that one hundred senators &#8212; or fifty-one &#8212; can propose a viable alternative.<br /><br /> Despite these constraints, the Senate should never act as a rubber stamp for the President. With the exception of its undue deference to Geithner, the Senate has been properly robust in its review of Obama's nominations. The withdrawal of Richardson, Daschle, and Killefer are encouraging signs that the nominees and the Administration recognized that their nominations probably faced tumultuous opposition from senators. The Senate should continue to carefully examine the remaining Cabinet nominees.<br /><br /> A robust confirmation process helps to ensure that executive officials conform to rigorous standards of ability and character. Vigorous and occasionally rambunctious confirmation proceedings also help to ensure that the political predilections of appointed officials do not stray too far from the political preferences of the voters who elected senators to advise the President about his nominees and to offer &#8212; or withhold &#8212; consent.<br /><br /><br /><em>William G.

Such a role for Obama lawyers would be an outrage and constitute an embarrassing embrace of international criminal conduct that the international community has demanded must result in absolutely no form of impunity.<br /><br /> Additionally, it would be professionally unethical for lawyers who are responsible for prosecution of war crimes on behalf of the United States -- and who, like President Obama and Attorney General Holder, are constitutionally required to faithfully execute the laws -- to defend former members of the government who are so reasonably accused of having authorized, abetted, or otherwise committed war crimes under customary and treaty-based international laws that are part of the laws of the United States. The clash of interests at stake could not be more sharply delineated. Adherence to professional ethics simply does not allow a lawyer to attempt to serve two clients who clearly have interests at stake that are diametrically opposed. Yoo and other accused should have their own lawyers and should not be feeding at the public trough eating taxpayer monies that are in serious need elsewhere.<br /><br /> Moreover, when a public official acts in violation of international criminal law, such person acts outside the scope of official duties. Every relevant judicial opinion since the dawn of the United States has recognized that the President and all members of the Executive branch are bound by the laws of war. As several federal courts have affirmed, international crimes simply cannot be lawful public, official, or sovereign acts, and they are not entitled to any form of immunity. The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg also rightly ruled that principles of immunity "cannot be applied to acts which are condemned as criminal under international law. The authors of these acts cannot shelter themselves behind their official positions" because their conduct is <em>ultra vires</em> and outside the competence of any government. <br /><br /> For this reason, the 1988 Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act (28 U.S.C. sec. 2679) which in subsection (b)(1) generally provides that the United States is to be substituted as a defendant and that claims are to proceed under the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. sec. 1346) if claims arise out of the wrongful act of a federal employee "acting within the scope of his official duties," should not apply to violations of international criminal law, since such violations are ultra vires, outside the scope of "official" duties, and beyond the lawful authority of any government. Additionally, the Supreme Court has often recognized that international law is a necessary background for interpretation of federal statutes. As evident in a 1781 Resolution of the Continental Congress, the Founders expected that "the author of ... injuries [that are "offenses against the law of nations"] should compensate the damage out of his private fortune." Justice Wilson affirmed this expectation in 1793 while recognizing that the state "should oblige [the international "criminal"] to repair the damage if reparation can be made." <br /><br />A contrary conclusion would amount to an acquiescence of international crime contrary to the rule of law and obligations of states under international law to end impunity recognized by the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly. The <em>de facto</em> substitution of U.S. taxpayers for those so clearly reasonably accused of international crime would be a double outrage, an unnecessary shame.<br /><br /> "In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by..." &#8212; well, we will have to see.<br /> <br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Jonathan Horowitz, Research Director at human rights and public interest investigation firm <a href="http://www.oneworldresearch.com">One World Research</a>, says that notwithstanding the pending closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison and all the publicity surrounding that, if the US government doesn&#39;t change how it collects information and what rights it gives to detainees, it will continue to hold suspects in Afghanistan and elsewhere without sufficient evidence...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/jonathanhorowitz.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->I<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->n early September 2008, a few days after I arrived in Kabul and retrieved my lost luggage from the airport, I sat down in an air-conditioned room at a guesthouse with Abdul Wahab and a high school teacher named Ghulam Sadeeq. Five years earlier, American forces had arrested Wahab's brother, Mohammad Zahir, in a night-raid at his home. The United States then shipped him off to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base on the southern shores of Cuba, accusing him of being a member of the Taliban and of having control of Taliban weaponry.<br /><br />I was focusing on Zahir's case because his lawyers, Dan Malone and Peter Ryan from Dechert in DC, hired my small Brooklyn-based investigation firm, One World Research, to do what the U.S. government should have done far earlier and with greater accuracy: determine which, if any, of the U.S. allegations against Mohammad Zahir and their other clients were true. <br /><br />The government's willingness to do this could have prevented the government from detaining and physically and mentally abusing so many innocent men. The reasons why the United States detained, and continues to detain, the wrong people in its global "war on terror" range from the understandable to the ridiculous. Here's a short list I came up with during three different trips I made to Afghanistan in 2008: <ul><li>the government's reliance on untrained translators who misinterpret what people say to them; the government's use of untrustworthy informants who manipulate the United States into detaining, or killing, rivals; profiteers and bounty hunters who provide the United States with false information and detainees in return for cash rewards; <br /><br /><li>the use of coercive and violent detention conditions that push detainees into providing misinformation just so the abuses can cease; detaining people because they are, or were, low-level members of the Taliban even though the Taliban forcibly conscripted people to fight; and<br /><br /><li>arresting innocent people who have the same, or similar, name as a person who is a legitimate threat.</ul>In times of war it's inevitable that innocent people will be mistakenly locked up. But for five years? Afghans I spoke with didn't blame the United States for accidentally detaining their relatives or for not knowing the intricacies of Afghanistan's people and culture. Afghanistan is, they admit, a complicated place. They did, however, blame the United States for not fact-checking their information and correcting their mistakes year after year.  Afghans didn't take kindly to the fact that poor intelligence led to prolonged detention and, by consequence, the collapse of a family business, physical and mental anguish for the detainee, or food not being put on the family's table. <br /><br />After landing in Kabul I called the people who I needed to speak to, such as relatives, friends, and former colleagues of the Guantanamo Bay detainees who Dan and Peter represented. To my amazement and pleasure, they were easy to reach and agreed at the drop of the hat to travel long distances to see me. I barely had the time to rest my knapsack and computer bag on my bed before I began preparing for my first interviews. <br /><br />It was my fifth or sixth interview when I spoke to Mohammad Zahir's brother, Abdul Wahab, and teacher Ghulam Sadeeq. I positioned the video-camera and checked the lighting and sound. With the video rolling, and with the assistance of a Pashtu speaking interpreter, Abdul Wahab began answering my questions about his brother. <br /><br />Abdul Wahab told me that his brother was, formally, a member of the Taliban, but that membership <em>per se</em> reflected little about a man's ideology, hatred of the United States, or links to Al-Qaeda. He described how the Taliban had forcibly conscripted Mohammad Zahir to be a cook; and he said that his brother wasn't a hardened fighter or ideologue. Afghan experts and other detainee family members also described this common practice&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;how the Taliban would demand a fee or, alternatively, conscript one member of a family to join the movement. <br /><br />When I interviewed Ghulam Sadeeq, a man who taught with Mohammad Zahir at the Mirza Khel High School, he explained that the school was non-religious, with a curriculum that included math, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, art, and languages. Sadeeq recalled how UNICEF and international military forces had provided pens, notebooks, and books to the school, as well as tents for children to study under. <br /><br />Mirza Khel High School was just the type of school that the Taliban were, and are, notorious for attacking. Sadeeq said that teachers at the school would receive threatening letters from the Taliban. "Count the last seconds of your life," one read. The more and more Sadeeq spoke the more and more I saw that his interview cast additional doubt on the U.S. allegations against Zahir. Why would a man who devotes himself to teaching join a group such as the Taliban that destroys schools?  <br /><br />More damning than the accusation that Mohammad Zahir was a Taliban cook, was the accusation that he was arrested with Taliban military documents in his house. Records from Guantanamo Bay show that Zahir admitted that these documents were discovered in his yard. But like many stories about Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay the truth is more complicated. Zahir explained to U.S. officials that the Taliban had passed through his village one rainy night when he was not at home and forcibly gave the documents to his wife for temporary safe keeping. Zahir said that when he returned home and discovered what happened he notified the governor, but the governor ignored him. So, Zahir hid the package in his yard where Americans later found them.<br /><br />To confirm this story, I asked Abdul Wahab if I could interview Zahir's wife. He refused. Asking to speak to a man's wife is a sensitive issue, especially since Zahir is from a very conservative part of Afghanistan. But Abdul Wahab agreed to ask Zahir's wife about the package of documents and then travel back to Kabul to tell me what she told him. <br /><br />A few days later, sitting again in front of the camera, Abdul Wahab told me, in his sister-in-law's words, a similar chain of events that supported her husband's claim, thus calling into question perhaps the strongest evidence the United States has against Mohammad Zahir:<blockquote>He was very angry and said, "Why did you accept this?" He took the documents to the governor. Haji Asadullah was the governor. Mohammad Zahir told him the Taliban has given the documents to my wife at my house &#8212; have a look at this! The governor told him, "These are useless and take them away," and Mohammad Zahir brought it back and buried it in the garden. He knew the Taliban might ask for it again. When the Americans surrounded the village, they discovered it from the garden.</blockquote>Another of Dechert's clients, Mohammad Rahim (not to be confused with a CIA detainee Mullah Mohammad Rahim who was captured in the summer of 2007 and later transferred to Guantanamo) is accused of, amongst other things, being a Taliban leader who went by the name of "Mullah Mo
hammad Rahim" and attended a meeting in a mountainous area in February 2003. Rahim was also accused and being a mujahideen foot soldier from 1985 to 1989. <br /><br />Rahim's cousin and neighbor, Haji Zakaria, told me that the accusations were ludicrous.  The mountainous area where Rahim supposedly was in February 2003, located between the towns on Daychopan and Mian Nasheen in Zabul Province, was impossible to reach during the brutal and snowy winters from their home in Ghazni Province. Besides, Zakaria said, he was with Rahim during daily prayers and meals during that winter. <br /><br />Mohammad Kareem, Rahim's brother, also pointed out that Rahim long suffered from eye and stomach problems which made it impossible for him to fight or train -- a claim that Rahim himself made some eight thousands miles away in Guantanamo Bay. There was another problem with the allegation: the United States funded and trained the mujahideen in the 1980s. Rahim's family commented, jokingly and despairingly, if Rahim was jailed for being a mujahideen foot soldier then Guantanamo Bay should also be filled with the U.S. officials who supported them.<br /><br />When I asked why he thought Rahim was arrested, Zakaria launched into one of the most commonly cited reasons for wrongful detentions in the U.S. war on terror. Zakaria described a land dispute between Rahim's family and another family who had people working with international military forces.  It was no coincidence, he said, that Rahim was captured after he undertook legal proceedings to settle the dispute and was about to win the claim.<br /><br />Prior to my September trip to Kabul, I had traveled to Afghanistan earlier in 2008 while working for Dan and Peter on a slightly different project.  The United States had returned several of their clients back to Afghanistan and they were being held in a wing of the Pul-i Charkhi prison known as "Block D" and investigated for domestic crimes.  Dan and Peter asked me to investigate what role, if any, the United States had in their continued detention and prosecution.<br /><br />Sandra L. Hodgkinson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs, says Washington doesn't have control over the Block D detention facility or the Afghan justice process. This seems true on the surface. When the U.S. government transfers detainees from Guantanamo Bay and the U.S.-controlled Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan to Block D they're re-interrogated by Afghan security agents. Then they are charged by Afghan prosecutors for violations of Afghan domestic laws and tried before three Afghan judges. In early 2008, Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai assembled a high-level committee tasked with determining which detainees should be investigated for breaking Afghan law and who should be released. The committee has leafed through over 500 paper files from Guantanamo Bay and Bagram and has recommended the release of over 150 men, including many former Guantanamo Bay detainees. <br /><br />Hodgkinson's claim that the United States has no involvement in post-Guantanamo and post-Bagram detention affairs in Afghanistan is, however, an overstatement. The United States has gone so far as to recommend that a detainee be prosecuted under a specific article of the Crimes against Internal and External Security Act of 1987, a law that was promulgated under the Soviet-installed Afghan government. And after I sat through two Block D trials and spoke to Afghan officials, defense lawyers, and detainees' family members, it's obvious that the interrogators, prosecutors, and judges rely heavily, if not almost solely, on the evidence that the U.S. hands over to Afghan officials with each detainee it transfers. An Afghan judge told me frankly, "The evidence is based on information we get from Coalition Forces [i.e., the United States] and we are sure that people who were arrested are arrested for something they did wrong and we are sure that the U.S. is not lying." <br /><br />To say that the U.S. evidence heavily influenced the Afghan justice system isn't to say that the U.S. evidence was solid, a point that Afghan defense lawyers and even Afghan prosecutors made clear to me. I had the opportunity to look at some of these files and saw how thin they were. They cast doubt not only on whether detainees should have been detained after Guantanamo, but on whether they should ever have been detained at all. <br /><br />The files contain biographical data, a photo of the detainee, allegations against the detainee, polygraph results, and transcripts of interrogations conducted at Bagram and/or Guantanamo Bay. And yet, the information missing from the files was unavoidably apparent. Sabar Lal, another one of Dan and Peter's clients, and a man who only goes by the name Nasrullah had the word "None" market next to the word "OFFENSE(S)" in the files. Their files named two witnesses, but had no "potential witnesses," "physical evidence," or "photographs." Fortunately for Sabar Lal and Nasirullah, both are free men today. But their freedom doesn't dilute the fact that they lived behind bars for several months in Afghanistan after having been detained for years at Guantanamo Bay on sparse, if not false, information. <br /><br />Abdul Razzaq Hekmati wasn't so lucky. He died of colorectal cancer on December 30, 2007 in Guantanamo Bay before his scheduled transfer back to Afghanistan. On a bone-chilling day in February with snow capped mountains in the distance I drove to the Block D detention facility where the head of the prison told me a room had been prepared for Hekmati to receive his cancer treatment. Later I reviewed Hekmati's file. It contained a report of an inconclusive polygraph test he took on August 23, 2003 at Guantanamo. His evidence file also noted that there was one witness but no other "potential witnesses," "physical evidence," or "photographs" to support his years of detention. <br /><br />                             <center>*          *          *</center><br />Approximately 800 people, including boys, have been detained in Guantanamo Bay since it opened its door in January 2002 to what Donald Rumsfeld referred to as the "worst of the worst." At the time, I was coaching eleven-year-old skiers in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York.  Today, many of those kids are starting their second semester of college, and about 250 detainees remain on the island. <br /><br />Guantanamo Bay has long been in the news, either as a place where detainees are stripped of their rights or as a necessary evil that allows the government to gather information without the annoyance of laws. But recently, the rule of law is seeing the light of day. When President Barack Obama arrived in the Oval Office, he issued orders to close Guantanamo and secret CIA prisons, suspend military commissions for 120 days, and end torture. Prior to this, a seminal 2008 Supreme Court decision granted Guantanamo Bay detainees the right to challenge their status as "enemy combatants" in federal courts. <br /><br />These events sparked human rights and civil rights groups, think tanks, political pundits, editorial pages, bloggers, and many others to ask questions and give even more advice. About 20 men at Guantanamo face criminal charges for their alleged close ties to Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and involvement in specific terrorist attacks, such as the September 11, 2001 attacks and the murder of U.S. service men aboard the USS Cole. Should they continue to be tried by post-9/11 military commissions, or is it better to put them before military tribunals, courts martial, national security courts, or federal courts? There are 80 or so detainees who the government regard as security risks and want to keep in custody, but it probably hasn't gathered enough evidence to justify their continued detention. When the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is closed, where should they be detained and how can the government justify their continued detention? There are an estimated 60 detainees who the United States no longer considers a threat, many of whom can't be sent home for fear of persecution. Should they be released onto
 U.S. soil? There are some 600 detainees held in the U.S.-controlled Bagram detention facility in Afghanistan.  Should they be subject to the 2008 Supreme Court decision, allowing them to challenge their detention before U.S. federal judges?<br /><br />After conducting my work in Kabul I've been pondering another question: How many of the 550 or so men who have been released were innocent? How many of the 250 or so who are still there innocent?<br /><br />On reflection, the work I and other investigators conducted in Afghanistan and other parts of the world makes me believe that the majority of people who have passed through Guantanamo Bay were held on spurious information. But, admittedly, it's tough to know how many exactly. That's because the United States didn't take seriously its responsibility to gather strong evidence against each person it detained.  In January this year the <em>Washington Post</em> ran an actually article entitled <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/24/AR2009012401702.html">Guantanamo Case Files in Disarray</a> that cast a bright light on the haphazard maintenance and organization of the evidence that different government agencies had against detainees. <br /><br />One way to reform these problems is to close Guantanamo Bay and allow our nation's respected federal courts to fairly exam the evidence against the detainees. Thanks to the Supreme Court, President Obama, and countless advocates, this is happening. Some federal judges have all but laughed the government out of the courtroom for the weak evidence it presented against detainees that were held for years on end. <br /><br />But these remedies for Guantanamo Bay only address symptoms of larger problems.  Today's discussions about Guantanamo Bay, as well as Bagram, are steeped in legal issues about what rights detainees have, or should have, and what rights the U.S. government has in holding them. But there remains the more discrete, but equally vital, issue of whether the new administration will improve how government agencies, such as the military, CIA, and FBI collect, share, corroborate, and organize battlefield intelligence. For me, this is the crux of the problem, and it's not going to disappear with the closing of Guantanamo Bay.<br /><br />There are already some 600 detainees at Bagram and the facility is undergoing a large expansion. As more troops head to Afghanistan, there will be an inevitable increase in the number of detainees. If the government doesn't change how it collects information and what rights it gives to its detainees there will continue to be, as there are in Guantanamo Bay, detainees who the U.S. will deem a credible threat even though they don't have sufficient evidence or intelligence to substantiate it. Perhaps granting the writ of habeas corpus to the Bagram detainees will be the only way to force the government to gather better information and evidence. Otherwise, we're back at square one.<br /><br />However it plays out, the fact that my investigation firm in three weeks punched gaping holes in the accusations against several detainees speaks volumes to the government's lazy and callous attitude towards ensuring it was detaining the right people&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;and not setting the wrong ones free. In short, there's no need for the United States to continue to set a poor example of what we already know: Providing people with the most basic rights and collecting quality information does little to hurt our national security. In fact, it ensures that innocent people are not wrongly detained and those who pose threats or committed crimes are not accidentally released.<br /><br /><br /><em>Jonathan Horowitz is the Research Director at One World Research, a U.S.-based human rights and public interest investigation firm (www.oneworldresearch.com).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/faculty_m_cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law says that instead of leaving the door open for the CIA to continue to engage in the rendition of terrorism suspects to other countries so long as the process is somehow handled &quot;humanely&quot;, the Obama administration should end renditions altogether and prosecute those who have ordered renditions since 2001...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/cohncolor.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>B</strong></font>inyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian residing in Britain, said he was tortured after being sent to Morocco and Afghanistan in 2002 by the U.S. government. Mohamed was transferred to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo in 2004 and all terrorism charges against him were dismissed last year. Mohamed was a victim of extraordinary rendition, in which a person is abducted without any legal proceedings and transferred to a foreign country for detention and interrogation, often tortured.<br /><br />Mohamed and four other plaintiffs are accusing Boeing subsidiary Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc. of flying them to other countries and secret CIA camps where they were tortured. In Mohamed's case, two British justices accused the Bush administration of pressuring the British government to block the release of evidence that was "relevant to allegations of torture" of Mohamed. <br /><br />Twenty-five lines edited out of the court documents included details about how Mohamed's genitals were sliced with a scalpel as well as other torture methods so extreme that waterboarding "is very far down the list of things they did," according to a British official quoted by the <em>Telegraph</em> (UK).<br /><br />The plaintiffs' complaint quotes a former Jeppesen employee as saying, "We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights &#8212; you know, the torture flights." A senior company official also apparently admitted the company transported people to countries where they would be tortured.<br /><br />Obama's Justice Department appeared before a three-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Monday in the <em>Jeppesen</em> lawsuit. But instead of making a clean break with the dark policies of the Bush years, the Obama administration claimed the same "state secrets" privilege that Bush used to block inquiry into his policies of torture and illegal surveillance. Claiming that the extraordinary rendition program is a state secret is disingenuous since it is has been extensively documented in the media.<br /><br />"This was an opportunity for the new administration to act on its condemnation of torture and rendition, but instead it has chosen to stay the course," said the ACLU's Ben Wizner, counsel for the five men. <br /><br />If the judges accept Obama&#39;s state secrets claim, these men will be denied their day in court and precluded from any recovery for the damages they suffered as a result of extraordinary rendition.<br /><br />Two and a half weeks before Obama's representative appeared in the <em>Jeppesen</em> case, the new President had signed Executive Order 13491. It established a special task force "to study and evaluate the practices of transferring individuals to other nations in order to ensure that such practices comply with the domestic laws, international obligations, and policies of the United States and do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control."<br /><br />This order prohibits extraordinary rendition. It also ensures humane treatment of persons in U.S. custody or control. But it doesn't specifically guarantee that prisoners the United States renders to other countries will be free from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment that doesn't amount to torture. It does, however, aim to ensure that our government's practices of transferring people to other countries complies with U.S. laws and policies, including our obligations under international law.<br /><br />One of those laws is the International Covenant on Civil Political Rights (ICCPR), a treaty the United States ratified in 1992. Article 7 of the ICCPR prohibits the States Parties from subjecting persons "to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment." The UN Human Rights Committee, which is the body that monitors the ICCPR, has interpreted that prohibition to forbid States Parties from exposing "individuals to the danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return to another country by way of their extradition, expulsion or refoulement."<br /><br />Order 13491 also mandates, "The CIA shall close as expeditiously as possible any detention facilities that it currently operates and shall not operate any such detention facility in the future." The order does not define "expeditiously" and the definitional section of the order says that the terms 'detention facilities' and 'detention facility' "do not refer to facilities used only to hold people on a short-term, transitory basis." Once again, "short term" and "transitory" are not defined.<br /><br />In his confirmation hearing, Attorney General Eric Holder categorically stated that the United States should not turn over an individual to a country where we have reason to believe he will be tortured. Leon Panetta, nominee for CIA director, went further last week and interpreted Order 13491 as forbidding "that kind of extraordinary rendition, where we send someone for the purposes of torture or for actions by another country that violate our human values."<br /><br />But alarmingly, Panetta appeared to champion the same standard used by the Bush administration, which reportedly engaged in extraordinary rendition 100 to 150 times as of March 2005. After September 11, 2001, President Bush issued a classified directive that expanded the CIA's authority to render terrorist suspects to other States. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said the CIA and the State Department received assurances that prisoners will be treated humanely. "I will seek the same kinds of assurances that they will not be treated inhumanely," Panetta told the senators.<br /><br />Gonzales had admitted, however, "We can't fully control what that country might do. We obviously expect a country to whom we have rendered a detainee to comply with their representations to us . . . If you're asking me, 'Does a country always comply?' I don't have an answer to that."<br /><br />The answer is no. Binyam Mohamed's case is apparently the tip of the iceberg. Maher Arar, a Canadian born in Syria, was apprehended by U.S. authorities in New York on September 26, 2002, and transported to Syria, where he was brutally tortured for months. Arar used an Arabic expression to describe the pain he experienced: "you forget the milk that you have been fed from the breast of your mother." The Canadian government later exonerated Arar of any terrorist ties. In another instance, thirteen CIA operatives were arrested in Italy for kidnapping an Egyptian, Abu Omar, in Milan and transporting him to Cairo where he was tortured. <br /><br />Panetta made clear that the CIA will continue to engage in rendition to detain and interrogate terrorism suspects and transfer them to other countries. "If we capture a high-value prisoner," he said, "I believe we have the right to hold that individual temporarily to be able to debrief that individual and make sure that individual is properly incarcerated." No clarification of how long is "temporarily" or what "debrief" would mean.<br /><br />When Sen. Christopher Bond (R-Mo.) asked about the Clinton administration's use of the CIA to transfer prisoners to countries where they were later executed, Panetta replied, "I thi
nk that is an appropriate use of rendition." Jane Mayer, columnist for the <em>New Yorker</em>, has documented numerous instances of extraordinary rendition during the Clinton administration, including cases in which suspects were executed in the country to which the United States had rendered them. Once when Richard Clarke, President Clinton's chief counter-terrorism adviser on the National Security Council, "proposed a snatch," Vice-President Al Gore said, "That's a no-brainer. Of course it's a violation of international law, that's why it's a covert action. The guy is a terrorist. Go grab his ass."<br /><br />There is a slippery slope between ordinary rendition and extraordinary rendition. "Rendition has to end," Michael Ratner, president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, recently told Amy Goodman on <em>Democracy Now!</em>: "Rendition is a violation of sovereignty. It's a kidnapping. It's force and violence." Ratner queried whether Cuba could enter the United States and take Luis Posada, the man responsible for blowing up a commercial Cuban airline in 1976 and killing 73 people. Or whether the United States could go down to Cuba and kidnap Assata Shakur, who escaped a murder charge in New Jersey. <br /><br />Moreover, "renditions for the most part weren't very productive," a former CIA official told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. After a prisoner was turned over to authorities in Egypt, Jordan or another country, the CIA had very little influence over how prisoners were treated and whether they were ultimately released.<br /><br />The U.S. government should disclose the identities, fate, and current whereabouts of all persons detained by the CIA or rendered to foreign custody by the CIA since 2001. Those who ordered renditions should be prosecuted. And the special task force should recommend, and Obama should agree to, an end to all renditions. <br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and president of the National Lawyers Guild.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="mailto:dwrist@pitt.edu">Wes Rist</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that if the African Union is successful in its bid to sway the UN Security Council to delay the ICC case against Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, not only will the incipient attempt to use international criminal sanctions as a tool for resolution of the Darfur conflict have failed, but the promise of truly international criminal responsibility will have suffered a significant blow at the hands of regional politics.....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wesrist.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he news from the 12th African Union Summit in Addis Ababa that the regional body will <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/african-union-to-seek-delay-of-bashir.php">seek to generate enough international support to delay</a> the International Criminal Court's <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">proposed indictment of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> is no surprise. Political leadership in Africa has been against ICC involvement in Darfur since <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8351.doc.htm">UN Security Council Resolution 1593</a> was passed in late March, 2005. But for the AU to take this kind of position could have broader implications and could represent the first step on a road to regionalism posing a significant challenge to the principles of international criminal responsibility. <br /><br />Bashir is only potentially before the ICC because of the UN Security Council's <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/breaking-news-us-allows-icc.php">historic decision</a> to refer the situation to the ICC under Article 13 (b) of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/EA9AEFF7-5752-4F84-BE94-0A655EB30E16/0/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a>. Under that provision, the ICC can exercise jurisdiction in a state not a party to the Statute only if the Security Council exercises its powers under Chapter VII of the UN Charter to refer the situation to the Office of the Prosecutor. The 2005 Resolution was historic not only because of the UN Security Council's decision to act, but also because both the United States, which under the Bush administration actively opposed the ICC, and China, which has <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/china-warns-icc-action-in-darfur-would.php">historically opposed</a> any UN intervention in Sudan, chose to abstain from the vote rather than exercise their veto power.<br /><br /> Ironically, the African Union seeks to use another aspect of the Rome Statute to prevent, or at least delay, any action by ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo in pursuing the investigation in Sudan. Article 16 of the Rome Statute allows the UN Security Council to delay, for a renewable 12 month period, an investigation or prosecution before the ICC pursuant to a Chapter VII resolution. The decision to pursue the political action of seeking an Article 16 deferral raises several interesting questions about both the ICC's ultimate authority and the role that regionalism has to play in international criminal law. The implication of Article 16&#39;s requirement that the Security Council "request" the deferral under Chapter VII implies that the pursuit of the investigation or prosecution would represent a "threat or breach of international peace and security." Since the only reason the ICC has jurisdiction over Sudan is because the Security Council had previously held that the same situation represented a "threat or breach" in and of itself, it seems difficult to believe that the Security Council would reverse that finding. But international law, and even international criminal law, is as much about international relations as it is the text of the UN Charter or the Rome Statute. Four years is a long time in global politics and the challenges raised by the AU against the ICC may carry enough political weight to give the Security Council pause. In an odd twist to proponents of international criminal responsibility, the veto power of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council may actually be used on their side for once. Any of the permanent members can prevent an Article 16 delay by simply choosing to veto the Resolution. Certainly U.S. advocates of the ICC have new reason to hope that the Obama Administration might choose to use that opportunity as a signal of the United States' change in attitude towards global accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity.<br /><br /> The challenges to the ICC's authority posed by Article 16 are blatant and are certainly well-discussed in international criminal law scholarship. The ability of a political organization to delay the justice offered by the ICC in favor of the "peace and security" that is the province of the UN Security Council raises questions of competing principles in international affairs and the ultimate independence of the ICC itself. Lengthy articles have been written on this subject, and I will not address them here. But the AU's proposal goes to the heart of what opponents of Article 16 have been warning since the compromise that included the provision in the Rome Statute was reached.<br /><br /> The allegations and implications arising from the AU's statement raise their own problems, however. AU officials "expressed concern" over the all-African docket the ICC currently boasts. Certainly, the single region nature of the Court's activities have been fodder for its opponents. And a more cynical individual might question Prosecutor Ocampo's release of a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-prosecutor-reviewing-options-for.php">report that he is reviewing options for ICC jurisdiction over Israeli actions in Gaza</a> on the same day as the AU's announcement as politically rather than substantively driven. But much of the language from Addis Ababa is troubling regardless of the makeup of the ICC's docket. AU Commission Chair (equivalent to the position of OAU Secretary General) Jean Ping expressed concern that the ICC was biased and failing to maintain judicial impartiality because of its lack of non-African cases. Mr. Ping raises valid points about the homogenous nature of the ICC's current case load which have absolutely no impact on whether or not President al-Bashir should actually be indicted for criminal violations under the Rome Statute.<br /><br /> The subtext here that should be troubling to proponents of international criminal law is that political attention has been shifted away from whether or not al-Bashir is a valid target of the ICC and onto a regional approach to the enforcement of international criminal law. The AU's position of advocating for a regional response to Darfur instead of taking advantage of the rare backbone shown by the UN Security Council in issuing Resolution 1593 could be a herald of a more regionally obstructive approach to international criminal law. The ICC is certainly still in its early stages of development - a toddler, if no longer an infant. And while the lack of non-African cases on its docket is of concern and the call for ICC involvement in Gaza may be a true test of its ability to address global impunity, that does not remove African situations from the ICC&#39;s valid jurisdiction.<br /><br /> Should the AU be successful in its bid to sway the UN Security Council to an Article 16 deferral, not only will the attempt to use international criminal sanctions as a tool for resolution of the Darfur conflict have failed, but the promise of truly international criminal responsibility will suffer a significant blow. The AU action will cement the possibility of political delay and obfuscation as a valid response to a threatened or ongoing ICC investigation firmly into the minds of other formal and informal regional groupings. Challenges to the ICC's jurisdiction when truth and reconciliation proceedings or even simply no
n-judicial resolutions to a conflict are proposed are already a part of the international criminal scholarship, and certainly are used by targets or opponents of the Court. Even should the ICC quickly expand its case load outside the African continent to refute the "Africa only" allegation, there are going to be other regional organizations, formal or <em>ad hoc</em>, which will see the Court's involvement as an intrusion and will latch on to the AU example in Sudan as a blueprint for opposition to ICC investigations or procedures. Certainly, in these situations, the smaller size of the Security Council generally and the veto power of its permanent members may serve to limit the repeat effectiveness of Article 16 deferrals, but once the genie is out of the bottle, it may be impossible to put him back in. The AU's bid to defer the UN Security Council approved investigation of Darfur is the first step on a road that could see regionalism as the ICC's greatest challenge to ending impunity for humanitarian violations. A truly international criminal law may yet be thwarted by regional politics.<br /><br /><br /><em>Wes Rist is an Adjunct Professor and Assistant Director of the Center for International Legal Education at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

Indeed, would the agricultural sector of any least-developed country (LDC) be helped by membership?<br /><br />Not surprisingly, these were the first questions posed after distinguished world trade scholar Dr. Melaku Geboye Desta* spoke about WTO agricultural initiatives last summer in Addis Ababa. Ethiopia is currently undergoing the long process of applying for accession to the WTO, so Melaku&#39;s presentation was of great relevance to the audience of Ethiopian government ministers. The answer Melaku gave was straightforward:  The WTO will help all of Ethiopia in the long run, but the results will not be immediate. He sought to leave no doubt that for Ethiopia, WTO membership is an important goal.<br /><br />While joining the WTO may not instantly result in sudden economic growth, development, or drastically-improved living standards, Melaku believes that significant change will come about indirectly because WTO membership will give Ethiopia a reason to modernize its antiquated commercial laws. WTO membership would require more transparency and predictability in Ethiopia&#39;s laws, and updating the code would send a message to the world that the country is a safe place for foreign businesses to expand. <br /><br />Melaku said that when it comes to world trade, agricultural goods have always been different from other products, a disparity understood since the time of Adam Smith, the father of modern economics. Even in today&#39;s age of globalization, many nations are reluctant to trade their agricultural goods. Melaku noted that when the WTO&#39;s predecessor &#8212; the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) &#8212; was originally formed in 1947, agriculture did not figure prominently in the agreement. The GATT committed nations to reducing their tariffs and subsidies for products, excluding agricultural commodities, the trade of which could not be agreed upon. Not until the Uruguay Round began in 1986 could member countries begin to commit to reducing the subsidies and quotas which create &quot;distorting&quot; barriers to agricultural trade.<br /><br />Understandably, the audience at Melaku&#39;s presentation was concerned by the obstacles still facing agricultural trade for developing countries in the WTO, pointing out reasons why agriculture may continue to be an obstacle when it comes to freeing trade. Ethiopia is a nation constantly plagued by food insecurity, leading many farmers to think that their people are put at risk unless the food they grow stays within the country&#39;s borders. Additionally, it is feared that if the nation becomes reliant on imported food, supplying countries could theoretically cut off shipments at any time. Attendees also pointed out that citizens in developed countries may have sentimental attachments to the nation&#39;s farms and vote for politicians who help the nation&#39;s farmers by maintaining subsidies and tariffs.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/camel2-733118.jpg<br />&quot;&gt;<img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 214px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/camel2-733118.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Despite these potential drawbacks, Melaku pointed out that the WTO could help Ethiopia to earn more revenue from trade in agricultural goods. Ethiopia has a comparative advantage because its farmers can produce goods for export at a much lower cost than developed nations, but its infrastructure and regulatory system must be improved for it to fully realize its potential. Other developing nations face similar internal supply constraints, but even when they address internal obstacles to exporting agricultural products, it remains difficult for them to fully benefit from their comparative advantage until the WTO resolves remaining issues surrounding agricultural trade.<br /><br />The completion of the Uruguay Round in 1993 produced the Agreement on Agriculture, a component of the WTO which went into effect in 1995. The Agreement consists of three &quot;pillars&quot;: market access, decreased export subsidies, and reduction of domestic support. As the Agreement on Agriculture states in its preamble, these three pillars drive toward &quot;establish[ing] a fair and market-oriented agricultural trading system.&quot; As trade ministers from WTO member states continue to seek agreement on how much to reduce their subsidies and tariffs, the benevolent goals of the WTO, including the Agreement on Agriculture, may yet prove a stronger force toward reducing world poverty through trade.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/house-701283.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/house-701278.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>WTO member states are currently engrossed in the so-called &quot;Doha Round&quot; of trade negotiations, and agriculture is a central subject. When the round began in 2001, the members drafted the Doha Ministerial Declaration, which made it the round&#39;s goal &quot;to place [developing countries&#39;] needs and interests at the heart&quot; of the negotiations so that all member countries&#39; people could &quot;benefit from the increased opportunities and welfare gains that the multilateral trading system generates.&quot;<br /><br />Despite the ambitious and benevolent goals to be achieved in the Doha Round of negotiations, they are incomplete, and developed countries are not yet able to commit to the extensive reductions in subsidies they had originally intended. It had been hoped that reducing tariffs on agricultural imports and reducing subsidy payments would allow countries like Ethiopia to better compete in the international marketplace. <br /><br /><br />* Dr. Melaku, who grew up in Ethiopia and earned his first degree in law at Addis Ababa University, now lectures at the University of Dundee, Scotland, as part of the faculty of the Centre for Energy, Petroleum, and Mineral Law and Policy.<br />

		<title>GUANTANAMO: Challenge and Change Require EU Response</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guest commentator Mike McNerney, Washington College of Law American University JD &#39;09, is a former US Air Force officer who recently visited the US base at Guantanamo Bay...<br /><br /><hr size="1"><br /><br /><a href="/dateline/uploaded_images/gtmo1%5B1%5D-%282%29-749613.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 4px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/gtmo1%5B1%5D-%282%29-749592.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:100%;"><strong>E</strong></span>uropean Union (EU) nations have been intensely debating whether to accept convicted and released Guantanamo detainees. Some countries have agreed to do so, while others refuse, and the situation is fraught with legal complexities because people can freely travel among EU nations. The pressure to make a legal determination is mounting as the United States begins the process of closing Guantanamo while struggling with the legal implications of an unstable military commission system.<br /><br />Recently, the National Institute of Military Justice (NIMJ) sent me to observe the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay. I joined the military in response to 9/11 and the NIMJ felt that my position as a law student and experience as a veteran would give me a unique perspective on the military commissions process.<br /><br />After seeing the commissions in action, I felt firsthand what I had previously understood on a purely intellectual level. It&#39;s a powerful experience to see these commissions in person and sit in the same room with the men who changed so many American lives. Everyone in the courtroom overflows with emotion.  Some rage at the unapologetic viciousness of the detainees, while some direct their frustration at the inadequacy of the commissions themselves.  The Obama Administration should take care to fix the commissions in order to assuage this anger.<br /><br />As Obama&#39;s top officials begin the difficult task of closing Guantanamo and reforming the military tribunal system, they should remain cognizant of four competing imperatives, each of which must be given its proper place if America is to regain its standing in the world while providing for the safety of its citizens.  The first of these issues is national security, which takes into consideration the protection of Americans at home and abroad.  The second is justice, which promises that the guilty will be tried and punished through a reasonable and impartial legal process.  The third is expediency, which is a necessity in bringing closure to both the victims and the perpetrators of terrorist acts.  The last is a stable legal structure built upon rules understood and adhered to by all parties.  The Bush Administration, rather than considering the necessity of each of these four elements, decided to focus almost exclusively on security and expediency.  Unfortunately, the Bush Administration&#39;s sincere desire to protect has not served us well and seems to have glossed over the imperative elements of justice and legal stability.<br /><br />In the wake of 9/11, the Bush Administration&#39;s desire to convict detainees quickly at the expense of establishing a durable legal structure yielded a disorganized system that has frequently broken down.  Lawyers are forced to argue based on unclear points of law and judges have almost no precedent to guide them in making their decisions.  Some of the conspirators in the 9/11 case were captured in 2002 and still aren&#39;t even at the point where they can enter pleas.<br /><br />Additionally, legalistic reasoning that allowed for detainee abuse outraged the nation and undermined the legitimacy of proceedings.  Now, in a dramatic overcompensation, military officials are so afraid of allegations of mistreatment that they fret over whether the seats on the detainees&#39; buses have soft enough cushions.  Allegations of torture have also harmed our position in the world as a just and humane society.  When we lose our moral authority, we lose our ability to prevent atrocities in the rest of the world, which makes us less secure as a nation.<br /><br />The Guantanamo detainees can see these deficiencies and exploit them.  They abuse the translators and make endless requests for irrelevant paperwork.  They follow current events and know precisely what to say to get their message into the media.  They also refuse to cooperate with their lawyers and know exactly how far to push the judge.  This stands in stark contrast to the parallel <em>habeas corpus</em> proceedings underway in federal court, where some have been very cooperative.<br /><br />The end result is often sad political theater rather than a legitimate legal process.  Many of the arguments and decisions rendered under the military tribunals appear geared toward trying cases in the court of public opinion rather than in a court of law.  Lawyers on both sides become frustrated and those frustrations can turn into animosity for opposing counsel.  Humanitarians who observe the detainees and the military personnel who guard them treat each other with uneasy suspicion because neither group trusts the political agenda of the other.<br /><br />The system of justice I witnessed at Guantanamo really doesn&#39;t work.  It also needlessly divides the American people.  While I hate to see these proceedings delayed yet again, the Obama Administration needs to re-think the current faulty process and come up with a system that makes sense.  This new system must better balance all four competing imperatives and carefully consider public opinion.  Additionally, the polarized advocates on both sides need to drop their most unrealistic demands and reach practical compromise.  If not, the American people may have to wait another eight years for justice.<br />

		<title>IRAQ: Bribery and the Rule of Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guest commentator Sara Burhan Abdullah, Pitt Law LL.M. &#39;08 and JD &#39;12, writes about an experience in her native Iraq...<br /><br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Iraq-Sara-750654.JPG"><img style="margin: 6px 10px 10px 6px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Iraq-Sara-750561.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:100%;"><strong>W</strong></span>hile living in Iraq, my husband Haider Hamoudi and I began working for the Iraqi Jessup moot court team. We instructed the team to apply for their passports, so that we could work with the American embassy. After the team began the passport application process in early October, I contacted the passport office every once in a while to ensure that everything was going well and that the team would remain on schedule. I called in November to see whether all the passports were ready. I noticed that some of the students had their passports, while others were still waiting, and was surprised by this result. I wondered why, if all the papers were submitted together, were some passports finished sooner than others?<br /><br />I questioned the students about how they got their passports so quickly. They openly admitted that they had bribed some of the employees at the passport office. Of course, only the wealthy students could afford to pay the money, so they were the only ones to get their passports back quickly. I told the students it was a crime to bribe a government official or employee; but no one paid any attention to what I said.<br /><br />Iraqi Penal Code Article 307(1) penalizes anyone who gives or accepts bribes in order to complete a job that is already an obligation of a government employee. The penalty for this crime is up to ten years in prison, and may include a fine. This rule of law presents an interesting contradiction when you talk to people from Iraq. On the one hand, they want the law to be upheld, much like Americans and people from other developed countries. On the other hand, although they want the law to be upheld, most people do not actually personally follow the law.<br /><br />Although Iraq has a legal system and a long history of legal education, the rule of law is seldom enforced and fails to function in everyday life. Some Iraqi laws are not enforced at all and are completely ignored by the judicial system. Furthermore, Iraq lacks sufficient separation of powers between the judicial system and other branches of government. The absence of both law enforcement and independent judicial power have resulted in a general mistrust of the judicial system among the general public.<br /><br />Everyone expects that corrupt practices such as bribery are necessary in order to process papers or applications quickly at government offices. Thus, people willingly pay bribes to get their work done, even though this means that work for poor people who are unable to afford bribes will be set aside. Of course, a person cannot go to a government office and openly bribe the official to have a passport completed in a week. There are people who indirectly arrange all the preparation for payment and getting papers processed.  Practices such as bribery are not only corrupt, but they infringe on the rights of people who cannot afford to pay. Furthermore, corrupt practices threaten the rights of everyone by placing money above the citizens&#39; rights and liberties.<br /><br />How can we eliminate practices such as bribery and penalize wrongdoers? The answer is not easy. There are more than just a handful of people involved in paying and receiving bribes - the problem is rooted in the entire governmental system. As long as bribery is socially acceptable, it will be difficult to change the system; it might take several generations to eliminate such entrenched corrupt practices.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.refintl.org/who-we-are/staff">Sean Mariano Garcia</a></strong> [Advocate, <a href="http://www.refintl.org/">Refugees International</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-urges-myanmar-to-end.php">mistreatment of the Rohingya</a> at home is increasingly impacting countries throughout Asia and a two-pronged approach is needed to adequately address their plight.  First, Myanmar&#39;s neighbors should begin a dialogue to improve the lives of the Rohingya inside their homeland.  This means moving towards citizenship rights and an end to harsh tactics used to encourage Rohingya to leave Myanmar.  <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/">ASEAN</a> should consider extending aid to the Rohingya as part of the effort to improve conditions for them inside Myanmar.  <br /> <br />The perfect environment for a conversation around the Rohingya is in the context of ASEAN +2 (Bangladesh and India being key regional players in this context). ASEAN is scheduled to discuss this very issue at a February summit, and it should commit itself to an action plan that engages Myanmar and host countries on providing solutions. Simply issuing condemnations of Thailand&#39;s recent behavior will not be enough.<br /> <br />Second, countries that host Rohingya populations should begin to provide for their well-being, beginning with legal residencies and access to health care, education and other vital services.  Until Myanmar recognizes the Rohingya as their own, the need for safe refuge remains vital for the protection of Rohingya refugees everywhere.&quot;<br />

		<title>Despite Oliver ruling to allow legal counsel for student athletes more reform at NCAA needed</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.salawus.com/bio.aspx?cid=24&dir=E"><strong>Timothy Liam Epstein</strong></a> [Chair, Sports Law Practice Group, <a href="http://www.salawus.com/">SmithAmundsen LLC</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/pdf/ncaa.pdf">Oliver opinion</a> [PDF file] is a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/ohio-court-enjoins-ncaa-rule.php">major victory</a> for student athletes who find the process of testing the market increasingly difficult without jeopardizing their amateur status, especially with recognition of third-party beneficiary status to the relationship between the NCAA and a member institution.  Surely the NCAA needs work, from the <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/!ut/p/vp/18_0_9D/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLN4s39vIBSYGZ7p76kRhiHggxb31fj_zcVP0A_YLc0IhyR0VFAKutbIs!/delta/base64xml/L0lDU0lKQ1RPN29na21BISEvb0VvUUFBSVFnakZJQUFRaENFSVFqR0VBLzRKRmlDbzBlaDFpY29uUVZHaGQtc0lRIS83XzZfN01WLzEzNzM3NjM!?WCM_PORTLET=PC_7_6_7MV_WCM&WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/NLI/About+the+NLI/">National Letter of Intent</a> to Bylaw 12.3.2.1 to Bylaw 19.7, but I would like to see more of the reform come from within the NCAA itself.  <br /><br />Member institutions like Oklahoma State University find themselves in awkward positions of having to comply with NCAA rules while protecting the interests of its student athletes, which in a case like <u>Oliver</u>, creates a potential conflict.  Furthermore, allowing student athletes to negotiate with professional teams without a lawyer, but not placing the same restriction on the professional team creates an unbalanced negotiation.  While Bylaw 12.3.2 provides for lawyer assistance in review of a proposed contract, not allowing the lawyer in the room during negotiations of the same contract can be unworkable (what if mom/dad/guardian is a lawyer?).  Keep in mind that the aforementioned contract lawyer must be compensated by the student athlete or his family.  Some argue that pro-sports counseling panels are an available tool for use during negotiations (see Bylaw 12.3.4), but these panels are reported as underused.  Finally, assuming the student athlete&#39;s allegations in the factual record to be true, the conduct of the Baratta&#39;s/Icon Sports speaks to the need for better agency regulation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong><a href="http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2006/09/about_this_blog.htm">Robert Amsterdam</a></strong></a> [Counsel for <a href="http://www.mbktrial.com/">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a>]: &quot;On January 27, 2009, Mikhail Khodorkovsky&#39;s defense team filed a stay motion to halt the unconscionable and illegal activities of prosecutors intent on <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-russia-oil-magnate-to-face.php">bringing fresh charges</a> against the imprisoned former CEO of Yukos Oil Company. The motion cataloged a series of abuses by Russian investigators and prosecutors in clear violation of both domestic and international law.<br /><br />The defense team underlined the authorities&#39; responsibility to recognize these abuses as irremediable, and to fulfill their legal obligation to halt the proceedings.<br /><br />As detailed throughout the motion, in the authorities&#39; haste and zeal to push forward with a new indictment, they have tortured, blackmailed, threatened and jailed potential witnesses; held secret trials; refused to admit any evidence that could prove Khodorkovsky&#39;s innocence; brushed aside requests for explanations of the allegations; harassed and disdainfully treated defense counsel making it difficult or impossible for them to do their jobs; conducted searches and seizures without court approval; ignored the presumption of innocence; slandered reputations; kept Khodorkovsky unapprised of critical procedural developments; concealed and manipulated key evidence; and isolated Khodorkovsky in the far reaches of Siberia.<br /><br />Clearly exploiting and abusing the Russian criminal justice system for political and mercantile ends, those behind the ongoing persecution of Khodorkovsky are not relenting in their efforts to sully his reputation, deny him any active role in Russian society, and legitimize the seizure of the Yukos Oil Company by state-backed individuals.<br /><br />As with efforts by the defense to submit exculpatory evidence and to call witnesses for interrogation, the stay motion has been unsuccessful. On February 16, the prosecutors finalized their indictment, which implausibly accuses Khodorkovsky of stealing the entire proceeds of oil production from Yukos subsidiaries over a six-year period. The case has been assigned to a Moscow court and a trial will commence within weeks.<br /><br />Khodorkovsky has been eligible to apply for parole since October 2007, having served more than half his sentence. When he applied for parole in August 2008, his request was rejected, ostensibly because he failed to show enthusiasm to learn how to operate sewing machines in the Siberian labor camp where he was previously being held.<br /><br />With Khodorkovsky eligible for parole after serving more than half his sentence, and lacking valid legal pretexts to keep him in prison, the prosecutors are intent on pushing forward with another show trial based once again on baseless, politically motivated charges. Beyond the outrageous behavior of the investigators and the prosecutor&#39;s office in breaking so many procedural rules, the new allegations themselves are legally void and factually erroneous, so much so that they should be a source of shame and embarrassment for those who drafted them.<br /><br />Interested observers worldwide should not limit themselves to calling for fair treatment in the pending trial, since this entails an implicit recognition of the ongoing investigatory processes to date as valid. The new indictment ought to be condemned from the start as inherently defective due to the undeniable violations on record to date.<br /><br />Khodorkovsky would like to believe that the Moscow court that hears his case will act impartially, as some Russian courts have acted in striking down unlawful disciplinary reprimands that prison officials tried to accumulate on Khodorkovsky&#39;s record in order to have a pretext to deny his parole.<br /><br />President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev has publicly spoken in favor of supporting the rule of law and ending what he calls &quot;legal nihilism&quot; in Russia. The treatment of Khodorkovsky this year will show whether this is rhetoric or reality.&quot;<br />

		<title>Obama Administration must define &#039;enemy combatant&#039; consistent with traditional laws of war</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/rona_g.aspx"><strong>Gabor Rona</strong></a> [International Legal Director, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.aspx">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;For some rule-of-law fans the toasting is over and it&#39;s already the morning after. The new administration&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/holder-orders-doj-review-of-us-state.php">recent decision</a> to continue the Bush line that torture victims&#39; claims should be dismissed in order to preserve unspecified &quot;state secrets&quot; was a shocker. But that&#39;s small change compared to what&#39;s on the horizon.  <br /> <br />President Obama has issued executive orders establishing task forces to study how to close the Guantanamo detention camp and to reassess the legal frameworks for the future detention of unspecified classes of persons (terrorists? fighters? security risks?) at home and abroad. These orders create a 180-day window for deciding what kind of a country we want to be. Will we respect the limits of wartime detention authority contained in the Geneva Conventions and only imprison people under a constitutional rubric of criminal responsibility? Or will we falsely convince ourselves that we can detain a broad spectrum of individuals by simply maintaining an elastic definition of &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2009/02/doj-urges-court-not-to-define-enemy.php">enemy combatant</a>&quot; or by legislating a domestic administrative detention scheme for those whom it might seem inconvenient to prosecute?  <br /> <br />But that 180-day clock is an illusion. In the meantime, litigation deadlines loom in Guantanamo habeas cases, in a challenge to detention in Afghanistan of individuals brought there from other countries, and in a U.S. Supreme Court case dealing with the power of the president to imprison a lawful U.S. resident as an &quot;enemy combatant.&quot;  All these cases require the Obama administration to lay its visions of detention authority on the line tout de suite. At the heart of the debate is the fate of the &quot;enemy combatant&quot; - not merely the persons designated as such, but the concept, which perverts fundamental principles of the laws of war.<br /> <br />&quot;Enemy combatant&quot; as a trigger for detention authority must be retired. It was born of a misguided, reverse-logic assumption that anyone with potential intelligence value should be detainable, and therefore, should be designated a &quot;combatant&quot; in order to justify the detention. (Thus, the Bush administration&#39;s now famous response to a hypothetical put to it back in 2004 by Judge Green in the &quot;In Re: Guantanamo&quot; cases: Yes, it&#39;s permissible to lock up a little old lady in Switzerland who innocently writes a check to a charity that, unbeknownst to her, turns out to be a front for al Qaeda). A related problem is the false assumption that any &quot;terrorist&quot; is an enemy combatant and that any non-state participant in hostilities against the United States is a terrorist.<br /> <br />The question of who may be detained should not be tied in domestic law to the term &quot;combatant.&quot;  In the laws of war, a combatant is an individual who is privileged to participate in hostilities and is therefore, always targetable and always detainable without criminal charge. Civilians who directly participate in hostilities without a legal privilege to do so may also be targeted and may also be detained without charge under applicable domestic law, but they do not thereby become &quot;combatants.&quot; They remain civilians. This much is clear from the distinction between who is a P0W, protected by the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e63bb/6fef854a3517b75ac125641e004a9e68">Third Geneva Convention</a> (members of the armed forces and associated militia) and who is a civilian protected by the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5">Fourth Geneva Convention</a> (pretty much any enemy national who is not a POW). Indeed, the Fourth Geneva Convention is clear that it covers individuals who engage in hostilities by: a) not excluding them from the definition of protected persons, and b) permitting the detaining authorities to withhold certain rights of the Fourth Convention to detainees who &quot;engage in activities hostile to the security of the state.&quot;  In short, a combatant is a combatant and a civilian is a civilian and never the twain shall meet. To expand the class of persons designated by domestic law and practice as &quot;combatants&quot; beyond this long-understood limitation in international law is a recipe for confusion, at least, and disaster, at most. Conflating the distinction between civilians and combatants - the most fundamental principle in the laws of war - places both civilians and combatants at unwarranted risk and thus, undermines the single most significant purpose served by laws of war: the protection of the civilian population.<br /> <br />The laws-of-war concept of &quot;combatancy&quot; as a talisman for detention authority is also underinclusive. It unduly constrains the scope of who may be detained.  Under the international laws of war applicable to international armed conflict (wars between states), namely, the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions and <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/93.htm">Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions</a>, civilians who pose a serious security threat, as well as combatants, are detainable. Since international law provides stand-alone detention authority in wars between states, there is no need in such cases for domestic law to authorize detention, let alone to pervert the definition of combatant in order to include civilians. <br /> <br />Some experts have proposed limiting detention authority to persons deemed to be &quot;directly participating in hostilities,&quot; which is the criteria for targeting in armed conflict. In international armed conflict, this would constrain the detention authority that the Fourth Geneva Convention provides, since &quot;direct participation in hostilities&quot; is narrower than &quot;serious threat to security.&quot; I guess a state could do that but why would it want to?  Indeed, the proponents of a &quot;direct participation in hostilities&quot; standard for detention are probably not even thinking of wars between states. They are thinking of non-international armed conflict, that is, wars between states and non-state armed groups. In these conflicts, unlike the case of international law applicable to international armed conflicts, detention authority does not exist in the applicable instruments of the international laws of war, namely, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/us/AP-Guantanamo-Geneva-Conventions.html">Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions</a> and <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/d67c3971bcff1c10c125641e0052b545">Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions</a>. The drafters of the Geneva Conventions assumed that detention authority in such conflicts would be supplied by domestic law. This is no accident of omission. Since non-state actors in non-international armed conflict possess no privilege of belligerency, their hostile conduct is per se criminal, and so, it is correctly assumed that domestic law is the proper legal framework for their detention, and if warranted, their prosecution.<br /> <br />As concerns potential detention within the United States, the substance and the territorial reach of criminal law has robustly responded to 9/11, making the need for additional detention authority questionable. As concerns future U.S. detention operations abroad, they may fall within the ambit of the Third or Fourth Geneva Conventions provisions applicable in international armed conflict, including in situations of occupation. In such cases, no extraneous detention authority is needed. <br /> <br />In other situations, be they non-international armed conflict or non-armed conflict, U.S. detention operations abroad must be seen as proxy detentions on behalf of the host state, whose domestic law must provide the basis for detention. This domestic law might be no more than a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. and the host state, if such a procedure satisfies domestic legal requirements. For example, the U.S. and Iraq are now moving toward compliance with this requirement per the terms of a new Status of Forces Agreement, by which the U.S. is to gradually turn its many thousands of detainees over to Iraqi authorities, operating under Iraqi law. The remaining caveat in such situations is that the law defining the scope of detention authority and the process due the detainee must comport with international human rights rules that guard against arbitrary detention. In non-international armed conflict battlefield situations, domestic authorities might wish to detain non-fighters as well as fighters. They may wish to do so pursuant to criminal prosecution or an administrative detention scheme. But in any case, the concept of &quot;combatant&quot; has no place in such detentions.<br /> <br />In short, any definition of enemy combatant that is broader than the meaning of that term under the laws of war is confusing and dangerous. Further, any definition that is broader than the combination of combatant and detainable civilian in the context of international armed conflict is an overreaction to a threat that is containable through application of traditional law-of-war, human rights and domestic legal frameworks. It is inconsistent with the understanding and application by all western democracies of long-standing principles and rules of international human rights and humanitarian law. It represents acquiescence in the proposition that, henceforth, the United States is always and everywhere at war and heralds a seismic shift in the meaning of liberty in America. <br /> <br />It is true that the Geneva Conventions did not foresee al Qaeda. But it does not follow that they, along with other complementary international legal frameworks, are inadequate to the task of dealing with 21st century conflicts and terrorist groups. For these reasons, detention authority should be tied not to a purpose-built definition of enemy combatant that is at odds with the meaning of that term in the laws of war, but rather, should be determined by application of traditional international laws-of-war and human rights constructs.&quot;<br />

However, for the first time since the region regained its devolved government in 1979-80, following the restoration of democracy in Spain, radical nationalist parties will not be among those choices: last Thursday the Constitutional Court of Spain confirmed an earlier Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/spain-court-bars-2-eta-linked-basque.php">ruling</a> which nullified the candidate lists submitted by <a href="http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/jurisprudencia/Stc2009/STC2009-20090212.html">Askatasuna</a> and <a href="http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/jurisprudencia/Stc2009/STC2009-20090212_01.html">Demokrazia 3 Milioi</a> (D3M).<br /><br />Under the terms of Section 44 of Spain&#39;s <a href="http://www.juntaelectoralcentral.es/portal/page/portal/JuntaElectoralCentral/JuntaElectoralCentral/NormElec/L_5_1985_LOREG_DEF_ENG.pdf">electoral law</a> [PDF file], as amended by the 2002 Political Parties Law, &quot;no candidates can be presented by groupings of electors who can be deemed practically a continuation of or succession to the activity of a political party that has been judicially pronounced illegal and dissolved or suspended,&quot; and both parties were banned on the grounds of being the successors of Batasuna, previously banned in 2003 because of its close links to the ETA terrorist group, which seeks independence for the Basque Country. Nonetheless, the Political Parties Law&#39;s provisions remain controversial, especially in the Basque Country - where five radical nationalist parties have already been banned - and a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/terrorism/rapporteur/docs/A.HRC.10.3.Add.2AEV.pdf">report</a> [PDF file] issued by the United Nations&#39; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms raises concerns that the broadly worded provisions of the law could be used against parties that peacefully pursue the same goals as a terrorist organization. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> expressed similar concerns when the law was enacted seven years ago.<br /><br />The Basque Country&#39;s party system has been characterized by the presence of several sizable nationalist parties in competition with Spain&#39;s nationwide parties. Since the re-establishment of democracy in 1977, the conservative Basque Nationalist Party (EAJ-PNV) has been the region&#39;s dominant political force, and the party - which wants the Basque Country to become a quasi-independent &quot;free associated state&quot; of Spain - has presided over every Basque government since 1980. However, while Basque nationalist parties have won an overall majority of seats in every regional election over the course of the last three decades, PNV has never held an absolute majority in the Basque Parliament (elected by <a href="http://electionresources.org/eus/">proportional representation</a>), and the party has usually ruled in coalition with other parties. Since 2001, the Basque Nationalist Party-led ruling alliance includes Basque Solidarity (EA; a 1986 PNV offshoot) and Ezker Batua (EB), the Basque counterpart of Spain&#39;s Communist-led United Left (IU). Meanwhile, successive radical nationalist parties have captured on average about 15% of the vote in Basque parliamentary elections, and the radical deputies&#39; absence from or abstention in the Basque legislature has often proved to be crucial, allowing the Basque Nationalist Party and its allies to secure a parliamentary majority.<br /><br />In response to the court ruling, D3M is calling on its followers to spoil their ballots, rather than support any of the other Basque nationalist parties taking part in the election. While some radical nationalists may turn to the small, left-wing Aralar party (which also advocates Basque independence but condemns ETA&#39;s violent methods), the nationalist parties could nonetheless fall short of a joint majority in the Basque Parliament for the first time since self-government was re-established three decades ago. A recent <a href="http://datos.cis.es/pdf/Es2784mar_A.pdf">opinion poll</a> [PDF file] carried out by Spain&#39;s Sociological Research Center (CIS) indicates that the region&#39;s main non-nationalist parties, the Basque Socialist Party-Basque Left (PSE-EE) - the Basque branch of Spain&#39;s ruling, center-left Socialist Party (PSOE) - and the right-of-center People&#39;s Party (PP; Spain&#39;s largest opposition party) may just win an overall parliamentary majority in the upcoming election; the poll also has PSE-EE just one to two seats behind PNV.<br /><br />That said, a coalition government of PSE-EE and PP is favored by few Basque voters, and regarded as rather unlikely because the two parties remain bitter rivals at the national level. According to the CIS poll, a narrow plurality of voters prefers a coalition of the Basque Socialists with the Basque Nationalist Party; the two parties previously formed coalition governments in the region from 1986 to 1990, and again from 1991 to 1998. Nonetheless, the poll indicates that as much as 43% of the Basque electorate remains undecided, and with as many as seven parties likely to attain parliamentary representation - EAJ-PNV, PSE-EE/PSOE, PP, EA, IU-EB, Aralar and (possibly) the non-nationalist, left-of-center Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD) - it remains difficult to predict what kind of government will emerge from the upcoming vote.&quot;<br />

The standard of human worth is now &quot;quality of life&quot; rather than human equality.  Those with diminished physical or mental abilities are seen as somehow less worthy of life.  Where does this end?  If Eluana could be starved simply because she had a low level of mental activity, what about the mentally handicapped or demented?  Many of the great tragedies in human history were predicated on a utilitarian &quot;ranking&quot; of human life.<br /><br />Western civilization is increasingly losing its historic understanding of human dignity, an understanding which has long been rooted in the Judeo-Christian western principles of human equality and the importance of preserving life and liberty.  In the <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/index.htm">Declaration of Independence</a>, the American Founders emphasized the &quot;self-evident&quot; truths that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; and all are endowed with the rights to &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;  Apparently those principles are no longer evident to many in the West.<br /><br />In the United States, we&#39;ve made great strides towards racial equality under the law and in the public consciousness.  We must not in turn ignore the equality of the old, young, and disabled.&quot;<br />

		<title>Pennsylvania judicial corruption underscores need for independent bench</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Neel Lalchandani</strong> [Staff Member, <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">The Constitution Project</a>]: &quot;Last week, two Pennsylvania judges <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pennsylvania-judges-plead-guilty-to.php">pled guilty</a> to charges including receiving $2.6 million in bribes from companies running private juvenile detention centers.  Although in their guilty plea, they did not admit that they agreed to the bribes in exchange for sentencing teenagers to those facilities, we know that since 2002, the judges sentenced more than 5,000 juveniles, with a number of them incarcerated despite their probation officers&#39; recommendations that they not serve time, and that these numbers were extraordinarily high compared to other areas of the state.  Aside from the tragic consequences suffered by the children who were the victims of the unconscionable actions of judges Mark Ciavarella Jr. and Michael Conahan, the actions of these two men raise serious concerns for those who value the essentia <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/Judicial_Independence_Principles.pdf">role that courts play</a> [PDF file] in our constitutional system.  They also illustrate the importance of ensuring adequate legal protections for individuals before a court. <br /><br />In about half of the cases before Judge Ciavarella, the juveniles waived their constitutional right to have an attorney represent them, apparently often without understanding the consequences of their actions.  Hearings often lasted only a minute or two.  Those who asked for a lawyer were told they might have to wait weeks, if not months, before one was appointed, and that they would be detained in the meantime.  Effective legal counsel would likely have resulted in fuller hearings and fairer sentences, and perhaps would have uncovered the judges&#39; scheme much earlier.  Indeed, the Constitution Project&#39;s <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/righttocounsel/index.cfm?categoryId=6">Right to Counsel Committee</a> is dedicated to ensuring that all people have access to effective legal representation in criminal matters, even if they cannot afford to hire a lawyer.  Lawyers for these juveniles could have made a world of difference.<br /><br />Although judicial corruption itself is rare, <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/Newsroom%20Guide-Updated-%202005.pdf">judicial independence</a> [PDF file] is, in many ways, on the decline in our country.  Courts are supposed to decide cases fairly and in accordance with the law and the facts, free from outside pressure.  Although in this case the judges&#39; improprieties resulted from bribes and not campaign contributions, the impact is similar.  In states with judicial elections, the need for state court judges and candidates to fundraise often casts a long shadow. The conflicts of interest presented when judges have to rule on cases involving their campaign contributions are obvious.  The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to address this question in its current term.<br /><br />Thus far, judges Conahan and Ciavarella have pled guilty to income tax evasion and &quot;honest service fraud&quot; charges, which means they took actions to benefit the business in which they had undisclosed financial interests.  We do not yet know whether there was a quid pro quo for incarceration in return for compensation, although a  <a href="http://www.timesleader.com/news/Class_action_lawsuit_filed_against_Ciavarella_Conahan_others_.html">class action lawsuit</a> by hundreds of victims may shed some light on this.  What we do know is that we must protect the integrity and independence of the judicial system, and the rights of those charged with criminal offenses.  Providing good legal representation to criminal defendants is an excellent place to start.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.khrp.org/content/view/315/140/"><strong>Kerim Yildiz</strong></a> and <strong><a href="http://www.khrp.org/content/view/315/140/">Saniye Karakas</a></strong> [Executive Director and Legal Assistant, <a href="http://www.khrp.org/">Kurdish Human Rights Project</a>]: &quot;Although it represents a concerning violation of international human rights standards, the decision to convict and <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/turkish-court-sentences-kurdish.php">sentence Aysel Tugluk</a>  comes as no surprise, as recently amended anti-terror laws have been used as a sword of Damocles for writers, journalists, activists, authors and particularly Kurdish politicians and human rights defenders in Turkey. People making statements, particularly regarding controversial subjects such as the Kurdish issue, have been threatened with judicial investigations and punishments.  <br /><br />Turkey has made significant progress in amending its judicial legislation to fulfill required standards of the European Union, including the ensuring of free and non-violent expressions of opinion. However, Turkey&#39;s legislative reforms do not guarantee respect for freedom of expression as the Turkish Penal Code still includes more than 30 provisions violating the right of freedom of expression.  In addition the anti-terror law and provisions in other codes continue to limit the free exchange of ideas. <br /><br />The continuing investigation and prosecution of Kurdish politicians for statements made in relation to the Kurdish issue and the rights of the Kurdish people in Turkey is another method to suppress the pro-Kurdish party (<a href="http://www.dtp.org.tr/">DTP</a>) and to criminalize their political activities. This is also part of the state&#39;s efforts to remove the parliamentary immunity of DTP MPs in order to reduce the number of DTP MPs in parliament, to limit their influence and prevent the peaceful solution of the Kurdish question.<br /><br />The decision of the Court is not in line with Turkey&#39;s international obligations under the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">ECHR</a>, <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">ICCPR</a> and <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm">ICERD</a> as Aysel Tugluk did not advocate the use of violence, armed resistance or an uprising in her speech - all of which are essential factors to be taken into consideration by the courts in Turkey. The courts in Turkey should also bear in mind that the right of freedom of expression as it is established in the case law of the European Court Human Rights also covers speech and opinions that may offend, shock or disturb the State.<br /><br />The court&#39;s decision also makes clear that changing the laws alone is not an effective way to guarantee free expression.  The interpretation of the laws by judicial mechanisms in Turkey is a major barrier to peaceful expression. Judicial approach or implementation of the law has often supported the official ideology of the state and any statements that do not conform to official ideology can easily be investigated as propaganda or bring charges of supporting a terrorist organization under the Turkish criminal legislation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lashawnbarber.com/about/"><strong>La Shawn Barber</strong></a> [Freelance writer and <a href="http://lashawnbarber.com/">blogger</a>]: &quot;U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder essentially called white Americans cowards <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/ag-holder-to-doj-us-still-faces-racial.php">for not talking enough about race</a>. Holder, who obviously didn&#39;t let anything prevent him from succeeding, believes the nation should have one of those honest &quot;dialogues&quot; on race. The question is, where does Mr. Holder think we should begin the dialogue? <br /> <br />Should we begin by discussing the atrociously high <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/papers/1996/08childrenfamilies_akerlof.aspx">out-of-wedlock birth rate</a> among black Americans? Studies have shown - and our own eyes can testify - that fatherlessness begets many things, all bad. Fatherless children are more likely to be poor, more likely to drop out of school, more likely to be parents as teenagers, and more likely to end up in juvenile detention and prison.<br /> <br />Or should we begin by discussing black parents&#39; responsibility to stress the value of education to their children and help them follow through with educational goals? The seemingly intractable academic achievement gap between blacks and everyone else won&#39;t be narrowed or closed by money or by blaming whites for the disparity. It begins in the home. A stable, two-parent home is the best family structure for children. Without it, children don&#39;t do as well.<br /> <br />Black leaders like Eric Holder ought to use their positions of power and influence to encourage people to examine <em>themselves</em> instead of calling Americans cowards and expecting the nation to solve problems that individuals <em>bring on themselves</em>.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.intlfinanciallaw.com/profile.html"><strong>William L. Richards, Jr., SJD</strong></a> [Attorney, <a href="http://www.intlfinanciallaw.com/">International Financial Law</a>]: &quot;The legislative effort to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/germany-cabinet-approves-bill-that.php">nationalize designated German financial institutions</a> has triggered terminology of expropriation of shareholder interest.  Perhaps it is a better characterization to suggest this is our first glimmer into the concepts that economists, bankers, and academics have tussled with for sometime now.  Who is the lender of last resort and how will it be implemented?<br /> <br />It is the first encounter of the <a href="http://www.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ355/choi/cur.htm">International Monetary System</a> with the expansion of global financial integration.  World economies from the emerging to the more developed have reaped the rewards that it provides.  Sophisticated economies have had tools at their beck and call in the past that enabled them to maintain nimbleness.  Could this be a first fracture in the European Community unification and the inability of autonomy to meld with individual public policy and financial solutions?<br /> <br />No country since World War II has proven themselves to be more fiscally responsible than Germany.  The unification of East Germany with West German has been a most admirable accomplishment.  Financial institutions are regulated and supervised, but the financial backlash of the present global de-leveraging has occasioned what appears from this historic development to be a hedge against systemic insolvency.  That is what the role of the lender of last resort is to be, a stop gap for precisely that.<br /> <br />The key to handling economic crisis is the ability to have a hands on command of a nation&#39;s currency and its coordination with its various public policies.  To legislate conversion of financial institutions in nationalization does not necessarily imply an expropriation, but rather quite a bold and responsible act of a government hobbled by its loss of direct ability to control its currency and monetary policy.&quot;<br />

		<title>Ohio court ruling enjoining NCAA ban on legal counsel is a victory for student atheletes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.hpmb.com/pages/attorneys/haberman.html"><strong>Paul Stuart Haberman</strong></a> [Associate, <a href="http://www.hpmb.com/">Heidell, Pittoni, Murphy &amp; Bach, LLP</a>]: &quot;A decision like the one <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/ohio-court-enjoins-ncaa-rule.php">recently handed down</a> by the Common Pleas Court of Erie County, Ohio in <a href="/pdf/ncaa.pdf">Oliver v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, et al.</a> [PDF file] was long overdue.  For many years, college athletes that dare seek the guiding hand of counsel in negotiation with professional sports teams have done so at their peril, as <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/wps/ncaa?ContentID=19">NCAA Bylaw</a> 12.3.2.1 states that &quot;[a] lawyer may not be present during discussions of a contract offer with a professional organization or have any direct contact (in person, by telephone, or by mail), with a professional sports organization on behalf of the individual.  A lawyer&#39;s presence during such discussion is considered representation by an agent.&quot;  NCAA athletes are not permitted to have agents, and risk being suspended from participation in their chosen intercollegiate sport for having them.  <br /><br />To the extent that a college athlete consults with an attorney about a professional contract, therefore, he must not only be able to exceptionally perform in his chosen sport, but he (and perhaps his parents) must also be able to successfully regurgitate each and every concern, proposed revision/addition, and negotiation point recommended by said attorney in his discussions with a professional team.  Anyone that has represented a single athlete in their legal career should appreciate the absurdity of this scenario.  Athletes know their chosen sport, but not necessarily the law and the nuances of negotiation.  That is why scores of attorneys throughout the country devote their practices to the representation of athletes, just as others do for the personally injured, business owners, and others who do not have a useful grasp on the law without the guidance of learned counsel.  Without someone at the negotiating table to interpret their professional contracts, athletes risk being buried in restrictive and unfair contract provisions and having their talents exploited by teams that may view them as little more than new cash cows. <br /> <br />The above is recognized in <u>Oliver</u>, as the Court held that allowing NCAA Bylaw 12.3.2.1 to stand opens the door for the continued &quot;exploitation of the student-athlete &#39;by professional and commercial enterprises[,]&#39;&quot; in contravention of the positive intentions of the NCAA to establish a clear demarcation line between amateur and professional athletes.  Even without this provision, the NCAA&#39;s Bylaws already provide several useful demarcation lines between amateurs and professionals, including defining a professional athlete as &quot;one who receives any kind of payment, directly or indirectly, for athletics participation except as permitted by the governing legislation of the association.&quot;  With the line drawn by these other provisions, it is sound policy to allow an attorney to actively participate in the negotiation of an amateur athlete&#39;s professional sports contract.  Indeed, most 18-to-21-year-old athletes would not know where to begin in reviewing, drafting, or negotiating options provisions, morals clauses, or annual compensation.  Most 30-year-old athletes would not either.  The athlete would, however, be held to the terms of his contract upon its execution in either instance.  For the most important contract that they have likely entered into in their young lives, therefore, NCAA Bylaw 12.3.2.1 is nothing short of an unconscionable handicap to an athlete&#39;s negotiating abilities.<br /><br />For those that disagree with the above, I invite you to have Mike Tyson or Rafael Nadal represent you at your next court appearance.  Let us know how that goes.  In the meantime, excuse me while I go advise Tiger Woods on how to improve his stroke.&quot;<br />

		<title>Rendition Revisited: Panetta and Obama Step into the Gray</title>

What has been less sure is how Panetta, once confirmed, will handle the transition away from the Bush Administration's most aggressive tactics against suspected terrorists.  <br /><br />When Panetta's nomination was announced, Senator Diane Feinstein, head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, grumbled at first that she would have preferred an intelligence insider.  (She did not have advance notice of the nomination.)  Even so, by the time of the hearings in early February, she as well as most Republicans supported Panetta.  Put in place were the characters for a staged performance.  In her opening statement, Feinstein laid down two markers which Panetta easily accepted: one, to keep Steve Kappes, an experienced intelligence officer, as the deputy director; two, to reduce the CIA's reliance on outside contractors to do the work of espionage and covert action.  Senator Kit Bond, the senior Republican on Committee, used much of his time at the hearings to debate Panetta about the CIA's practice of "extraordinary rendition."  Whether this practice continues and, if so, under what supervision will provide another interesting marker of how far the CIA will go in rejecting President Bush's national security agenda from the dark side. <br /><br />President Obama himself simplified Panetta's confirmation by answering a few questions about the CIA's program.  Through a series of executive orders on January 22, Obama made several things clear.  First, Guantanamo will be closed as a detention center within a year.  Second, the CIA's secret prisons will also be closed.  Third, the CIA will abide by the same standards for interrogation as the Department of Defense's Army Field Manual, no longer relying on a loophole in the 2006 Military Commissions Act for "enhanced" interrogation techniques.  Further, actions on the ground in Pakistan show that Obama supports Predator strikes&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;missiles fired from a drone aircraft&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;against suspected terrorists whose remote and hidden location make their capture especially difficult.  Thus, with so much of the CIA picture filled in, the Senators and Panetta used the confirmation hearings to focus on rendition, an apparently open area for development under the new administration. <br /><br />Panetta, early in the hearings, defined the Bush practice of rendition as transfers to torture.  No one, of course, could continue to favor that.  Yet when Senator Bond pressed Panetta, the CIA's new leader admitted that his assessment was based not on inside sources but on media accounts.  So, like a good professor, Panetta promised the Senate Committee to study more about rendition when he was read into the CIA's secret programs.  Bond, trying to convince Panetta that rendition is not always bad, noted that the practice also took place under the Clinton Administration.<br /><br />Senator Bond would have performed better, however, if he had been careful to offer his own definition of rendition: the state practice of transferring people without the formalities of extradition involving courts and foreign ministries.  American officials have used rendition to take control of suspects overseas, bringing them back to the United States to face criminal charges.  Call this rendition to American justice.  Plus, American officials have used rendition to transfer suspects to other countries either for interrogation or to face criminal charges.  Call this rendition to foreign justice.  There are actually legitimate reasons for such renditions.  Sometimes a foreign jurisdiction can perform a better interrogation because its interrogators are more fluent than American interrogators in the suspect's native tongue or because witnesses and other items of evidence are more available in the foreign jurisdiction.  Sometimes a foreign jurisdiction considers the suspect to be more of a threat than we do.  It is true that the Clinton Administration practiced fewer renditions than the Bush Administration.  But the Clinton Administration did not rule out renditions to foreign justice.  Michael Scheuer, who takes credit for launching the CIA's rendition program, and other former officials have admitted this in print and on panels. <br /><br />The Obama Administration should not be categorical about rendition.  The realistic question is not whether to conduct any renditions at all.  Who, after all, would oppose snatching Osama bin Laden in Pakistan to bring him back to the United States to stand trial? There are better questions for us.  Should we continue renditions to foreign justice?  If so, how useful are the receiving country's promises not to mistreat the suspect?  How effective is monitoring by the Red Cross or other groups after a suspect's transfer?  Should the CIA accept a change in law that would create a role for the judiciary to review the value of diplomatic assurances and post-transfer monitoring in renditions?  Along the lines of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, should a special rendition court conduct its proceedings in secret to protect diplomatic and intelligence interests related to renditions? <br /><br />Political posturing from both parties, while entertaining for confirmation hearings, does not produce reasonable answers to difficult questions about rendition.  Deeper thinking is needed.  For this reason, Panetta was wise to seek more time from the Senate, and Obama was wise to set up various task forces to make recommendations about our nation's counterterrorism policies.  Informed by Steve Kappes and other CIA professionals, Panetta and Obama will see that rendition cannot be swatted away by equating it, in all circumstances, with torture.  They are likely to conclude that it is one of those tactics, somewhere in the gray between war and the criminal justice system, which may be necessary to get bad guys off the street before they do us real harm.   <br /><br /><br /><em>Afsheen John Radsan, associate professor at William Mitchell College of Law, is a former federal prosecutor and was CIA assistant general counsel from 2002-2004.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/radsan.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<title>Judges Sentencing Children for Kickbacks: A Special Kind of Infamy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/harrisda">David Harris</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that in light of the damage done to the justice system, our collective belief in the rule of law, and to the persons and families involved, seven years imprisonment is not nearly enough punishment for two Pennsylvania judges who took kickbacks from a private company running detention facilities in return for giving children long sentences....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidharrisnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ast week, a story emerged from Luzerne County, in northwest Pennsylvania: Mark Ciavarella and Michael Conahan, two powerful local judges, pled guilty in federal court to corruption charges.  They had taken $2.6 million in kickbacks from a private company running detention facilities.  In return for the money, the judges kept the company's facilities brimming with inmates, and the local government paid the company a generous amount per incarcerated person.  Everyone involved got rich, and the taxpayers got robbed.<br /><br />But the worst part was not the obvious dishonesty and greed that motivated these judges to sell their robes, or even that they profited by incarcerating people who did not belong there.  The worst part was that these were detention centers for juveniles.  Ciavarella and Conahan filled these prisons with children.  They made money by taking kids guilty of minor crimes &#8212; setting up an online satire of an assistant principal, stealing a $4 bottle of nutmeg, getting into a fight with another kid &#8212;and putting them into these juvenile prisons.  The evidence so far indicates that Judge Ciavarella was two and a half times more likely to incarcerate kids than other judges in Pennsylvania were.  And he and Judge Conahan made money &#8212; lots of money &#8212; doing this.<br /><br />I am not na&Atilde;&macr;ve about public officials.  Growing up in Chicago, I saw my share of corruption.  It often seemed to me that our politicians, with their diamond pinky rings, should have two sets of clothes: one to dress in for city council meetings, and the other to wear to prison.  The legendary Chicago newspaper columnist Mike Royko often said that the city's Latin motto, Urbus in Horto ("City in a Garden") should actually be translated, "Where's Mine?"  This way of navigating the political world recently gave us Gov. Rod Blagojevich, the now-removed Illinois governor alleged to have tried to sell President Obama's vacated Senate seat.  (The governor who preceded Blagojevich is now in federal prison for an entirely different corruption scheme.)  <br /><br />But these two judges are not just run of the mill corrupt politicians. For any public official to sell his or her integrity constitutes a betrayal of the public, but judicial corruption is worse.  The courts are there to set things straight &#8212; to see that those who are injured by the carelessness of others get the compensation they deserve, and that the criminals who prey on the rest of us get what they have coming.  They must do all of this with fairness and equal justice.  Judges sit as the very embodiment of the rule of law &#8212; the idea that no man or woman is above the rules, and that they apply equally to everyone.   We know that our system isn't perfect &#8212; not every case comes out right, nor does every judge make every decision fairly.  But these cases are the exception: Americans can justifiably see our allegiance to the rule of law as one of the crown jewels of our democracy.  And the judiciary has largely lived up to its role as the keepers of this vital part of our constitutional government, year in and year out.  <br /><br />The idea of a judge selling his or her office does direct and damaging violence to this idea.  A judge who can be bought might seem no better than the lowest corrupt politician, but the judge with his hand out is worse.  The judge stands for fairness and justice, and is charged not with serving constituents (let alone himself) but with making sure the law functions as it should for all.  Corruption in this sphere is a cancer on the law itself, and when people see that a judge doesn't obey the law, this generates enormous disrespect for the legal system generally.  And that is a problem for the whole country.  <br /><br />Americans sometimes see the problem of judicial corruption as a concern for other countries.  We see reports of corrupt or weak judiciaries in Russia, Zimbabwe, Kenya or other nations, and we often say to ourselves: thank God that doesn't happen in the U.S.  Politicians may be corruptible everywhere, but at least here judges give us a straight call.  And for the most part, this is correct.  But we Americans should not be smug: judges are people, and people anywhere may succumb to the temptations of money, power, or political influence.  Just like our politicians, some of our judges have taken their turn at the trough.  In Chicago in the 1980s, Operation Greylord, a federal sting operations, took down 17 judges, 48 lawyers, and numerous deputy sheriffs, police officers, and court functionaries, for soliciting, taking, or receiving bribes, and for participating in other ways in a thoroughly corrupt system.  <br /><br />Taking money to influence their judicial duties, alone, would make the actions of Ciavarella and Conahan deeply disturbing, even in our jaded, Gov. Blagojevich-on-<em>The-Today-Show</em> era.  As a person who has devoted his entire professional life to learning, practicing, teaching, and trying to improve the law, I can only feel  disgust for them.  But like most people, my life is multifaceted.  I am a lawyer and a law professor, but I am something else too: I am a father to two teenagers, and an uncle to many other kids.  And when I think of what Ciavarella and Conahan did to these kids &#8212; selling their freedom for a few dollars, doing untold damage to them and their families &#8212; I feel deeply angry.  <br /><br />I've read that both Ciavarella and Conahan have entered into plea agreements that specify they will each receive 87 month sentences &#8212; a bit more than seven years in prison.  I generally feel that our system is too punitive, especially compared to other democracies around the world.  But in this instance, I don't think seven years is nearly enough for the harm they did to the system of justice, to our collective belief in the rule of law, to these children, and to their families.  I'm going to write to Judge Edwin Kosik of Federal District Court in Scranton, PA, who will decide their sentence.  I've never done anything like that before, but it seems to me this case calls for it.  I simply cannot be silent.<br /><br /><br /><em>David A.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.unlv.edu/faculty/nancy-rapoport.html">Nancy Rapoport</a> of the William S. Boyd School of Law, University of Nevada Las Vegas, says that the housing bailout provisions of the recently announced stimulus package not only do not go far enough to cover mortgage holders in need, but actually reward extreme risk-taking behavior, ironically penalizing homeowners who did the right thing and bought the amount of house that they could afford....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/nancyrapoportnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font> have a lot of sympathy for those who are caught in the middle of the mortgage crisis -- more sympathy that you might realize.  And, like many of us, I hope that the stimulus package actually does some good for our economy, although I doubt that there are any clear answers about how to fix an economy that's gone horribly wrong.  (Yes, some of the best minds in the country are working on this problem -- both inside and outside the administration; but the best that they can do is make educated guesses about what the best fixes will be.)  So far, what we know about the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2009/02/19/faq-who-qualifies-for-housing-bailout/">"mortgage fixes"</a> announced Wednesday is that it focuses on two sectors of distressed homeowners:  those who are already in default and those who are teetering on the edge of default.  <br /><br /> There is, however, a group that has been excluded from every one of the proposed rescues:  those homeowners who took out very boring (30-year fixed) mortgages on houses whose values have plummeted.  These homeowners sound a lot like the ones about whom Congress and the President are worrying, but there's a key difference:  the excluded group isn't in danger of default, has not stopped paying its bills (including its mortgages), and will not be rescued by any of the proposals to date.<br /><br /> The news loves to cover those people who took out interest-only mortgages, those who took out adjustable-rate mortgages where the first interest rate jump created a monthly mortgage bill that far exceeded the homeowner's to pay, or those who bought several houses as investment properties, or my favorite -- the NINJA mortgage (given to a borrower with no verifiable income, job, or assets).   There's plenty of blame to go around:  banks that may not have disclosed exactly how tricky these mortgage terms were; borrowers who bought much more house than they could afford; rating agencies that bought -- hook, line, and sinker -- the claim that securities based on risky loans would not carry a significant risk of default.  <br /><br /> But what of the banks that required downpayments in the 15-20% range, used conventional, fixed-rate mortgages and 15- to 30-year terms, and verified all of the borrowers' financial information before agreeing to lend the money?  And what of the homeowners who came up with those downpayments, demonstrated their credit-worthiness, and -- here is the key -- continue to hold jobs that allow them to pay their mortgages each month?  Their homes very likely are just as underwater as the homes down the block (the ones with the riskiest mortgages), but no one's talking about restructuring their mortgages.  The discussion of modifying the Bankruptcy Code to allow stripdown of first mortgages in chapter 13 cases won't apply to this group, which doesn't plan to file for bankruptcy protection at all.<br /><br /> It's an interesting group, this forgotten segment.  It's made of people who know that their mortgage payments aren't going to rebuild equity in their homes any time soon, because the value of their homes is too far gone to allow for equity in the foreseeable future.  It's made of people who see the "for sale" and "foreclosure" signs in their neighborhoods and who have read about "jingle mail" (mailing the keys to the bank and just walking away from their homes entirely).  <br /><br />My guess is that many of the people in this group feel a bit like chumps:  they're honoring their debts, at significant cost, because they are people who pay their debts if they possibly can -- even though walking away would be a lot easier.  (To be sure, this group is made of people with good credit scores who don't want to see those scores ruined by a foreclosure or a bankruptcy.)  <br /><br />This group is also key to the country's stimulus:  with jobs and assets, this group can still spend money, which -- if you believe the experts -- is a good thing to infuse into our economy.<br /><br />But what one thing can't this group do?  It can't refinance its homes to take advantage of any new lower interest rates or any new tax breaks.  Why?  Because this group -- like the borrowers with the risky mortgages -- has no equity in its homes and, in all likelihood, no ability to find another 15-20% down as part of the refinancing.   Take a simple example:  my own situation.  Eighteen months ago, we bought a house for $380,000 and put approximately 15% down.  As of today, our home is worth $267,500, according to Zillow.com, so there's no more equity in the house.  (Our home's value went down because other homes in our neighborhood are either going unsold or are foreclosed properties.)  It's possible that mortgage rates will go down as a result of the stimulus package, but we won't be able to take advantage of any refinancing.  The proposal itself only targets people whose outstanding mortgage balance doesn't exceed 105% of the home's value (for us, that would be $280,875 in home value, with just a hair over $300,000 still owed, so we don't qualify).  Because we're part of the group not covered by the plan, and because there's no equity left in the house to give a bank any incentive to give us a new mortgage -- and, most important, because we're not defaulting on any payments -- there's no incentive to bring our bank to the table to restructure our loan.  Why should our bank renegotiate?  We're paying our bills, and we have our jobs -- we're just underwater.  Congress hasn't said word one about forcing banks to take care of folks like us, and I doubt that it will (or that it can).<br /><br />Our group isn't super-rich (or even moderately rich), so there is a very real cost to us of having lost all of the equity in our homes.  From everything I've read, our group will be worse off over time than the groups who are getting bailed out.  Where's the bailout for people like us -- people who did the right thing and bought the amount of house that they could afford, only to find out that all of the risks that other people took has destroyed the value of their homes, too?<br /><br />Until the bailout takes care of my group, it's not really a bailout at all:  it's a reward for extreme risk-taking behavior -- behavior that went beyond the bounds of common sense.  And what lessons get learned when you reward bad risk-taking behavior?  That bad risks are really quite good risks, in the end.<br /><br /><br /><em>Nancy B.

Boyd School of Law, University of Nevada Las Vegas, says that until we recognize that smart people can and will do some very dumb and even crooked things, no amount of regulation will stop the financial shenanigans that are wrecking America&#39;s economy....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/nancyrapoportnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>N</strong></font>ot too long ago, I watched the movie <em>Weekend at Bernie's</em> (20th Century Fox 1989) for the umpteenth time, and it got me thinking about the similarities between that movie and our current financial crisis -- especially Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme.  In the movie, two young accountants who have discovered some financial <em>legerdemain</em>  have reported their discovery to their boss (Bernie).  Unfortunately, Bernie is smack-dab in the middle of the fraud.  The bad guys associated with Bernie want Bernie to kill the accountants, but Bernie gets killed instead.  The accountants spend the rest of the movie pretending that Bernie is still alive -- he even goes water-skiing, although he's dead -- because they believe that, as long as they're with a "live" Bernie, they'll be safe.<br /><br /> In both the movie and in real life, some modicum of due diligence could have discovered that the various Bernies in question weren't thriving, but it was more convenient for people to ignore the warning signs.  It didn't take much for people in the movie to talk themselves into believing that Bernie was still alive.  And we're going to discover, in the next few months, what kinds of clues there were about Bernie Madoff's enterprise.<br /><br /> Why don't people want to face facts?  What makes us so uncomfortable about acknowledging that many of our fancy financial ideas over the past few years were nothing more than smoke and mirrors, discoverable with just a little bit of forethought?  It's frightening to think that we apparently based the health of our entire economy on the ideas that housing prices would never decline, and that people without the ability to repay their mortgages should buy a house.  Granted, it took some seriously fancy financial two-stepping by the financial sector itself.  But we did; and now we're certainly paying the price.<br /><br /> I will always wonder what might cause a Bernie Madoff -- or a Peanut Corp. of America's Stewart Parnell -- to ignore the harms that their actions will invariably cause so many innocent people.  Madoff's Ponzi scheme has caused ripple effects not just to the very rich who invested with him but to numerous non-profits who were to be the beneficiaries of his gargantuan returns.  Parnell's decision to keep shipping his product in light of clear positive tests for contamination led to deaths and serious illnesses.  It's not that hard to foresee such obvious effects of fraud or malfeasance.  Is it just because Madoff, Stewart, and the like were harming unknown, faceless people that they proceeded with their destructive decisions?  (Madoff, though, knew many of his victims quite well, so it can't just be the facelessness of the victims that allows such knavery.)<br /><br /> And what of those who are supposed to guard us against these knaves?  If it's true that the SEC was warned about Madoff, was it just the understaffing of this agency that caused it to miss Madoff's scams?  After the tests came back positive for salmonella at Peanut Corp., why couldn't we just stop the company from putting its contaminated product into commerce?<br /><br /> More regulation isn't going to be the fix we'd like to have.  More staffing at agencies -- without giving people training in working smarter, not harder&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;isn't going to be the fix, either.  The fact is that, time after time, we've had warnings before crises, but we haven't picked up on them in time.  Why?<br /><br /> In large part, the problem lies in how we're wired.  Even very smart people can fool themselves pretty easily.  We can use whiz-bang mathematical models, but if those models are based on flawed assumptions, than we still find that "garbage in, garbage out."  It seems as if we've been throwing good money after bad with the TARP funds, by giving various sectors a massive cash infusion without the concomitant responsibility of using that cash to help garden-variety consumers.  (Where's the help for those who are underwater in their homes but are paying their mortgages nonetheless?)  In other words, we're correcting our recent errors by making all sorts of new ones.  <br /><br /> Social scientists know all about these cognitive errors.  They know about cognitive dissonance (talking ourselves out of believing that we've done anything morally wrong), social pressure (also known as "groupthink"), and the diffusion of responsibility ("someone else will take care of this"; "someone else will report the fraud"; someone else will fix this problem").  <br /><br /> It's time for the lawyers, regulators, and businesspeople to recognize that, even though they may actually be the smartest guys in the room,  they can't outwit human nature.  Until we recognize that smart people can and will do some very dumb things, we're going to repeat the mistakes that led to the current financial meltdown ad infinitum.  We're not going to stop any financial shenanigans solely by creating regulations.  Regulations help relatively honest people stay on the right side of the law, but they don't do much for smart crooks.  We need to understand that we're prone to thinking about complicated issues all wrong -- and that we need someone to call our attention to our faulty assumptions on a regular basis.  The more I think about how dumb smart people can be (even well-intentioned ones), the more I realize that what we really need is designated skeptics.  We need people whose jobs require them to question assumptions, even the most basic ones, and to slow down decisions.  We need people inside corporations telling presidents that their shareholders really don't need them to ship tainted food just to keep quarterly earnings looking good.  We need people inside rating agencies who don't call a disastrously bad idea something that's worthy for AAA treatment, just so the financial products can keep moving through the economy.  And we certainly don't need people who have made seriously flawed decisions being rewarded with short-term bonuses.  I'd rather reward the cynic, the doubter, the one who slows down "groupthink."  That person does us a whole heck of a lot more good.<br /><br />Weekend at Bernie's is fun entertainment, because it's fiction.  Watching our economy crater or people dying from poisoned food isn't fun at all.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Nancy B. Rapoport is the Gordon &amp; Silver Professor of Law at the William S.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Gail Davidson, Executive Director of <a href="http://www.lrwc.org/">Lawyers Rights Watch Canada</a>, says that Canada and the US are duty-bound to act immediately to ensure that Canadian Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr is released and repatriated, his rights are protected and violations of his rights are investigated and remedied, where appropriate, by criminal proceedings against the perpetrators....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/gaildavidson.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->O<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->mar Ahmed Khadr is a Canadian citizen, born on 19 September 1986 in Ottawa, Ontario.  He has been imprisoned by the U.S., first in Bagram and then in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay prison (GB), since July 27, 2002.   He is the only citizen of a Western country still imprisoned in GB. Australia, Belgium, Demark, France, Russia, Spain, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom have all secured the release and repatriation of nationals through diplomatic means. <br /><br />The Canadian government has, with knowledge of the facts and law, failed or refused to:<br /><br /><li>provide consular assistance to Khadr; or,<br /><li>exercise diplomatic means to secure his release and repatriation; or,<br /><li>attempt to prevent violations of his internationally protected rights; or,<br /><li>investigate violations against Khadr, prosecute suspects and punish perpetrators; or, <br /><li>accurately disclose Canadian involvement in Khadr's detention and treatment.<br /><br />If Omar Khadr were afforded the full protection of established international rights to which everyone is entitled, the law would prevent both further prosecution and continued detention. Further prosecutions before a properly constituted court, in the U.S. or in Canada, would end in a stay of proceedings or a dismissal of charges because of the irremediable harm caused to Khadr by prolonged violation of his internationally protected rights.  The reputed actions of U.S. officials to falsify (inculpatory) and withhold (exculpatory) evidence would also operate to prevent further prosecution and detention. While there is now no credible evidence of wrongdoing by Khadr, proof of wrongdoing against him continues to increase. <br /><br />The U.S. Supreme Court has confirmed on three occasions that the rights of GB prisoners are being violated.  The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) and the Federal Court of Canada (FCC) have both confirmed that Omar Khadr's rights are being violated. On May 28 2008 the SCC ruled unanimously that "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;the regime providing for the detention and trial of Mr. Khadr at the time of the CSIS interviews constituted a clear violation of fundamental human rights protected by international law." The SCC concluded that participation, by Canadian officials with the 'Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay process' was "contrary to Canada's binding international obligations."  On June 25, 2008, the FCC ruled,  "The practice described to the Canadian official in March 2004 [of steps taken by U.S. officials to prepare Khadr for a scheduled DFAIT interview] was, in my view, a breach of international human rights law respecting the treatment of detainees under UNCAT [CAT] and the 1949 Geneva Conventions.  Canada became implicated in the violation when the DFAIT official was provided with the redacted information and chose to proceed with the interview." <br /><br /><strong>Rights Violations</strong><br /><br />U.S. detention and treatment violates Khadr's rights to, inter alia: liberty, freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment; freedom from arbitrary detention; freedom from prosecution for ex post facto offences (offences created after the acts are alleged to have been committed); habeas corpus; due process; timely and confidential access to counsel of choice; trial before an independent and impartial tribunal; a fair trial and the right to be treated as a child. Many of these violations are themselves crimes under both international and Canadian law.  A few of the international instruments violated by U.S. detention and treatment of Khadr since July 2002 are: the Convention Against Torture (CAT), the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, The Paris Principles: Principles and Guidelines on Children Associated with Armed Forces or Armed Groups, the Hague Regulations of 1907, annexed to Hague Convention No. 4, the Geneva Conventions, the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights; the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.<br />  <br /><strong>Detention</strong> <br /><br />On July 27, 2002, at the age of 15, he was captured after a four-hour ground and air assault by U.S. forces on a compound in the village of Ayub Khey, Afghanistan and has been imprisoned since that time. The U.S. detained Khadr, first under the purported authority of the orders of then U.S. President Bush made November 13 2001 and February 2 2002, and, since October 2006, under the authority of the Military Commissions Act 2006 (MCA).  Khadr's detention is not sanctioned by any international law.  During his imprisonment, he has never been segregated from adults or otherwise been afforded the special treatment to which children are entitled by law.<br />   <br /><strong>Treatment</strong> <br /><br />Full details of Khadr's treatment at Bagram and GB are not yet known because of U.S. secrecy that has prevented proper review by courts and the public.  Available evidence indicates that Khadr has suffered physical and psychological injury as a result of prolonged and relentless exposure to torture and other intolerable and illegal treatment.  It is noteworthy that while at Bagram, Khadr was subjected to the 'interrogation techniques' of Sgt Clause: techniques that killed one Bagram prisoner and severely injured two others.  Manfred Nowak, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, has confirmed that prolonged sleep deprivation, such as used on Khadr at GB, is torture as defined and prohibited by CAT. <br /> <br /><strong>Charges</strong><br /><br />In November of 2005, more than three years after his arrival at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay, Khadr was charged, as an 'unprivileged belligerent' with: conspiracy, murder, attempted murder and aiding the enemy. U.S. claims that Khadr was the sole survivor of the U.S. attack and had been witnessed throwing a grenade that killed a member of the U.S. military have since been proven false.  Before the charges could be heard, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>, 548 U.S. 557 (2006) that the military commission process violated both the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice and Common Article 3 of the all four Geneva Conventions.  Following <em>Hamdan</em>, the MCA was enacted and in April 2007, Khadr was charged under the MCA, this time as an 'unlawful enemy combatant', 'without combatant immunity', with murder, attempted murder, providing material support to the enemy, conspiracy and spying.  The April 2007 charges were secretly withdrawn December 17 2008 and believed to have been re-laid January 13 2009. The categories of 'unprivileged belligerent' and 'unlawful enemy combatant' and 'person not enjoying combatant immunity' are arbitrarily determined labels not recognized in law.<br /><br />There has been no hearing of these charges due to a variety of factors: non-disclosure by the prosecution, leaked documents indicating falsification of evidence by the U.S. military, dismissal of the charges and sacking of the military 'Presiding Officer', Col. Peter C. Brownback originally assigned to hear the Khadr case. On June 4 2007 Brownback dismis
sed all charges against Khadr on the basis that there was no jurisdiction under the MCA to try the charges. That dismissal was overturned by a hastily convened Court of Military Commission Review. When the case reconvened in November 2007, Brownback ordered both the prosecution and the defense to disclose all the evidence they intended to rely on and refused to set a trial date until disclosure had been provided. On May 22 2008 Brownback threatened to suspend the proceedings if prosecutors failed to provide disclosure of: copies of the Detainee Management System records related to Khadr's treatment, investigators' notes of witness interviews and details of 'militants' killed in the July 2002 military assault.  On May 28 2008 Brownback was summarily removed from the Khadr case by the Pentagon. The MCA proceedings have been widely discredited as illegal and illegitimate. Former MCA prosecutor, Lt. Col. Darrel Vandeveld, recently declared that "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;it is impossible for anyone involved (the prosecutors) or caught up (the detainees) in the Commissions to harbor even the remotest hope that justice is an achievable goal" The MCA proceedings are now suspended until May 12, 2009 at the request of U.S.President Obama. <br /><br />The law requires Canadian and U.S. to take measures to effectively and immediately protect Khadr's rights and to prevent and punish violations against him. <br />  <br /><br /><em>Gail Davidson is the founder and Executive Director of Lawyers Rights Watch Canada and the Chair and co-founder of Lawyers Against the War.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Staffer Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;10, studied for a year in Singapore...<br /><br /><hr height="1"><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Esplanade-768421.jpg"><img style="margin: 4pt 4pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Esplanade-768001.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n the Western media, the tiny island nation of Singapore is typecast as conservative. In January, a man and woman attracted the attention of the international news media for taking a stroll through a busy pedestrian street in Singapore wearing nothing but flip-flops. The stroll ended in arrest. Invariably, foreign news sources remarked how shocking such an incident is in a country which has become famous for its strict criminal laws (e.g. it is illegal to sell chewing gum here) and harsh punishments. A common form of punishment is caning, where Singaporean men (and in 1994 an 18 year-old American named Michael Fay) are struck numerous times with a bamboo pole.<br /><br />Singapore&#39;s supposed conservatism and stern criminal justice system are part of its &quot;soft-authoritarian&quot; constitutional model where some personal and political freedoms are traded for economic growth and a high standard of living.  The flip side of Singapore&#39;s stern criminal justice is a country where crime is remarkably low and neighborhoods feel safe. When Singapore makes the foreign news, its transparent business laws, clean streets, rapid economic growth, and modern and high-tech appearance are often mentioned. Various regulations maintain this modern appearance &#8212; for example, cars of a certain age will not receive a license to be driven on the roads.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Merlion-705534.jpg"><img style="margin: 4pt 10px 10px 4pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 281px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Merlion-705480.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>More in-depth Western publications might mention Singapore&#39;s lack of &quot;liberal democracy.&quot; Singapore&#39;s government ministers &#8212; always from the People&#39;s Action Party (PAP) &#8212; will readily admit that there is no &quot;Western-style&quot; democracy. They explain that Singapore is not a Western nation, but rather an Asian nation, whose residents hold Asian values which may not necessarily align with Western thought.  Singapore is a &quot;Neo-Confucian&quot; state, where the parents are the leaders and know what is best for their children, the citizenry. The PAP &quot;manages&quot; democracy with a seemingly permanent and overwhelming parliamentary majority and an emasculated political opposition. This governing style is called soft-authoritarianism.<br /><br />For a Westerner, soft-authoritarianism may sound distasteful, but an engaged Singaporean will likely reply that outsiders do not know the struggles of that country. Under the rule of the PAP, Singapore evolved from a newly independent nation marred by homelessness and slums to the rich nation of today in four decades. There are more Ferraris and Lamborghinis on the streets than anywhere in the United States, except perhaps Beverly Hills.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Raffles-Hotel-740678.jpg"><img style="margin: 4pt 4pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Raffles-Hotel-739886.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Strong, centralized leadership is also supported because tiny Singapore (population 4.5 million) cannot help but perceive its vulnerability. With no agricultural hinterland and negligible natural resources, this densely populated island nation is completely dependent on imports, including water and food. Before World War II, Singapore was a British colony that was supposedly an impenetrable fortress. However, during the war it was quickly and easily overrun and occupied by the Japanese. The nation faced further instability when it won its independence from Britain, along with the other Malay colonies in 1963. Two years later, Singapore was summarily ejected from the unhappy Malay federation and unwillingly forced into independence from Malaysia. The federation was unstable at its base because of ethnic friction: Singapore&#39;s population is largely Chinese, while Malaysia&#39;s majority is made up of Malay.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about Singapore&#39;s modern soft-authoritarianism is that it is all done legally within a constitutional framework. Government corruption is near non-existent and it is consistently ranked as one of the top five least-corrupt countries in the world. The government is a meritocracy, and ministers earn salaries that are very high (so high, they don&#39;t need to steal). The judiciary disposes of cases with speed and efficiency, using night courts and information technology to improve accessibility. However, judges are paid handsomely and generally lack tenure, thus relying on the executive for reappointment. There is a notable pro-government bias in the judiciary, and there is only limited judicial review of the decisions made by government ministers. When the maintenance of public order demands, laws authorize the curtailment of individual liberties. Freedom of speech, for instance, is guaranteed in the constitution but is highly restricted through both formal and informal means. Meanwhile, the PAP is almost always able to win elections through favorable electoral laws and gerrymandering. Since independence, the PAP has never held less than a powerful majority in parliament.<br /><br />Singapore&#39;s older residents still remember the times of poverty and uncertainty. It is possible that younger Singaporeans who have known only a nation of first-world living standards may someday successfully agitate for liberal democracy. For now, however, the consensus remains that portions of freedom can be traded for a comfortable life. And honestly, even for this American, life in Singapore is not so bad at all.<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt;" size="2">Photo Credits: Christine Chen (photos of the Esplanade and Merlion Fountain), Eric Linge (photo of Raffles Hotel)<br /><br />Sources:<br /><br />Li-ann Thio, &quot;Rule of Law Within a Non-Liberal &acirc;&#8364;&#732;Communitarian Democracy: The Singapore Experience,&quot; in ed.

		<title>CAMBODIA: Khmer Rouge Trials Set Precedent for Justice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guest commentator Vicheka Lay, a legal consultant in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, reflects  on the Khmer Rouge trials...<br /><hr size="1"><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-4-%282%29-759093.jpg"><img style="margin: 4pt 4pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 259px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-4-%282%29-759090.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:100%;"><strong>I</strong></span>n February, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) began the trial of one of the Khmer Rouge&#39;s former leaders, Kaing Guek Eav, also known as &quot;Duch&quot;. Guek Eav allegedly committed a large number of human rights violations in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979 and is the first Khmer Rouge leader to be tried by the ECCC.<br /><br />Allegations of corruption and underfunding have plagued the ECCC since it was instituted, causing many people to question whether the ECCC trials will actually bring justice for the Cambodian people. Consequently, two public opinions have arisen. One group endorses the Khmer Rouge trials, because they believe that at least some justice may be served. Another group would like to eliminate the trials, largely due to the belief that the Cambodian people will never actually benefit from them. Since the court is just in its infancy, it is hard to speculate to what extent the Cambodian people will benefit from the trials. However, the process has at least unveiled the faces of leaders accused of committing the atrocities, and will attempt to hold them accountable for any international human rights laws they have violated.<br /><br />Duch faces numerous charges, including homicide and torture under Cambodian criminal law, crimes against humanity, and breaches of the Geneva Conventions. He will almost certainly face criminal penalties. By punishing violations of international law, the ECCC may achieve several goals. First, enforcing penalties will raise public awareness of those laws. Second, penalties will serve as a deterrent to people who might consider violating those laws in the future. Ultimately, the ECCC will create a trend toward penalizing international law violations, ensuring that justice will prevail in the future.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-1-%282%29-710150.jpg"><img style="margin: 4pt 10px 10px 4pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 266px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-1-%282%29-710128.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>It is true that the Cambodian people may not receive the justice they desire from the ECCC trials at present. However, perhaps the type of justice people seek is too narrowly defined. Many Cambodians focus on punitive justice in hopes of righting various wrongs committed in the past. These people are dissatisfied by the ECCC trials, which cannot fully redress past injustices allegedly committed by the Khmer Rouge.<br /><br />Although the ECCC trials are certainly punitive, it is more important that they will also set a precedent. Thus, the major benefit of the ECCC trials to the Cambodian people may not be justice for the past, but rather the establishment of a permanent and timeless justice for the future.<br /><br /><br /><em>The opinions expressed in this article are entirely those of the author and do not reflect the views of any entity with which the author may be affiliated.</em><br /><br />Photo credit: Dorothy Miller, University of Wisconsin School of Law, JD 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A serendipity of justice in Iraq</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.utah.edu/_personfiles/6622/CV/cv.pdf">Chibli Mallat</a> [Professor of Law and Politics of the Middle East, <a href="http://old2.law.utah.edu/">S.J. Quinney College of Law</a>]: &quot;Yesterday we encountered a strange moment of serendipity. Dr. Lateef Rashid, invited those of us working on the <a href="http://www.gjpi.org/">Global Justice Project: Iraq</a> to dinner with his colleague, the Minister of Justice, Dara Noureddin. Dr. Rashid, the Minister for Water, has one of the best reputations in Iraq for running his complex Ministry, not least because as a proud Kurd, he succeeded in getting the legendary Arab Marshes in the South of Iraq back to 80 percent of where they were before water was diverted to starve their inhabitants. <br /><br />The dinner was at Dr. Rashid&#39;s house, which was the former residence of Abd Hammoud, the personal secretary of Saddam Hussein. As it happens, yesterday Hammoud was sentenced by the Iraq High Criminal Tribunal (which sentenced Saddam Hussein to death in 2006) to life imprisonment for the execution of 42 Baghdad merchants in the summer of 1992. Tariq Aziz, the former regime&#39;s international visage, received <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iraq-court-sentences-top-saddam.php">a 15 year sentence</a>. The two half brothers of Saddam were sentenced to death, while the former Governor of the central bank was found not guilty.<br /><br />I had previously met Judge Dara Noureddin in Amsterdam in 2004 when preparations were afoot for the trial of the former Baathist leaders. I am sorry that the high hopes we expressed at the meeting were not fully realized, given the setbacks that followed, but at least one lesson was learned. For difficult cases like Lebanon, Sudan or Iraq, I believe it is better to have the trial carried out abroad, to prevent witnesses, judges and defense lawyers from being killed, as happened in Iraq during the two years of Saddam&#39;s trial. It is also better to shape the court into a mixed tribunal, to protect the local judges. From this Iraqi lesson, we derived the shape of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon which came into being on March 1st. Considering the continued risk on Lebanese judges who will sit on it, I wonder whether it should not have been totally composed of international judges.<br /><br />The Iraqi Minister of Justice&#39;s reputation was well known to me for having stood up to Saddam Hussein as a judge, and I asked him about the details yesterday. Here is the synopsis: Under the Baathist constitution, the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) issued orders which had an automatic legal status (some of which are even said to have been secret). An RCC order had been made in 1981 with respect to the dedication by the state of land to be distributed to military officers and other political grantees. In Baghdad, a special section of the Municipality had responsibility over this dedication and distribution. Some ten years later, a case came up before Judge Dara which involved land held jointly by a number of owners requesting its division amongst them by Judge Dare&#39;s property court. Not receiving an answer from the Municipality of Baghdad about this particular piece of real estate, Judge Dara ruled in favour of the petition of the joint owners. The decision was challenged by the municipality under the RCC order of 1981, but Dara rejected the challenge on the basis that the RCC order contradicted the new 1990 Iraqi Constitution which Saddam had just brought into being and which included the right to own private property. The decision was adopted as precedent, but it escaped the attention of Saddam Hussein until a decade later, when a similar case came up and he realized that his order was not being applied. He asked who had allowed his order to be set aside, and was informed of the Dara jurisprudence. The judge was arrested, detained for three months, then sentenced for two years. He stayed another eight months in prison.<br /><br />Dinner with a judge imprisoned by Saddam for standing up for basic rights under the Constitution, in the house of Abd Hammoud, personal secretary of Saddam Hussein and the <em>&eacute;minence grise</em> of the system, on the day of his sentencing. This was an unusual moment for justice. For Hammoud, yesterday may not be the end of his sentencing. As someone opposed to the death sentence, I drank to his health. My Iraqi hosts raised their glasses also, possibly not for the same reasons.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=2080"><strong>Jesse Reynolds</strong></a> [Policy Analyst, <a href="http://www.geneticsandsociety.org ">Center for Genetics and Society</a>]: &quot;President Obama&#39;s recent <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/obama-reverses-stem-cell-research-ban.php">removal of his predecessor&#39;s stem cell policy</a> is a welcome development. The Bush administration&#39;s restriction on the federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research was outdated and <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/116485/Majority-Americans-Likely-Support-Stem-Cell-Decision.aspx">increasingly unpopular</a>. While much of the media coverage of President Obama&#39;s announcement has focused on the research&#39;s potential and the political winners and losers, here are a few points that were overlooked:<br /><br />For years, embryonic stem cell research in the US has been conducted in a federal regulatory vacuum, and the debate has been characterized by exaggerated rhetoric about imminent cures. Obama <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/09/us/politics/09text-obama.html?_r=1">shifted the ground on both fronts</a>. He ordered the National Institutes of Health(NIH) to draw up guidelines, which hopefully will be enforceable and apply to both publicly and privately funded research. The President also clearly called for a prohibition on reproductive cloning, which remains legal in the US and <a href="http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=283">shares materials and methods with embryonic stem cell research</a>. Furthermore, his language was optimistic but cautious; he noted that cures may not come in our lifetimes. This is a big change from advocates&#39; over-the-top promises about Christopher Reeve&#39;s imminent mobility, personal biological repair kits on standby, and cures for all known maladies.<br /><br />Although the details of the new stem cell policy remain unclear, the change is not actually that dramatic. Obama&#39;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Removing-Barriers-to-Responsible-Scientific-Research-Involving-Human-Stem-Cells/">executive order</a> did not offer specifics; it passed that task to the NIH. Contrary to frequent misperceptions, it is not the case that the Bush administration banned embryonic stem cell research. <a href="http://stemcells.nih.gov/policy/2001policy.htm">Bush permitted federal funding</a> for this work, although he limited it to research with lines that already existed at the time of his policy&#39;s debut, August of 2001. As more stem cell lines were isolated, the older ones seemed inferior and the policy became even less tenable. President Obama has <a href="http://www.biopoliticaltimes.org/article.php?id=4220">previously voiced his support</a> for federal funding of work with all lines derived from embryos that were created but not used in fertility treatments, regardless of their date of creation. The actual derivation of lines - the step in which embryos are destroyed - has been and remains off-limits due to a <a href="http://www.dnapolicy.org/policy.international.php?action=detail&laws_id=36">long-standing annual appropriations rider</a>, one that&#39;s been adopted by Congresses and Presidents of both parties. Federal support of lines derived from embryos specifically created for research purposes remains prohibited as well.<br /><br />Notwithstanding some claims, the new stem cell policy does not replace an &quot;<a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org/press/StemCell.php">anti-science</a>&quot; one by &quot;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/07/us/politics/07stem.html">removing politics from science</a>&quot; and &quot;restoring scientific integrity.&quot; All along, the human embryo research debates have hinged on ethics. There was a consistent, albeit tenuous, moral logic to Bush&#39;s policy. Most Americans, including myself, disagreed with it. Government financial support for and ethical constraints on science should be socially - and thus politically - negotiated. Future debates about ethical and social oversight of science should take that lesson from the stem cell controversy.<br /><br />For more information, see our <a href="http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/downloads/200901_ESCR_FAQ.pdf">Stem Cell Research Frequently Asked Questions and Fact Sheet</a> [PDF].&quot;<br />

Pocatello Education Association</u> issued February 24, 2009.  MSLF had filed a friend of the court brief in support of the Idaho Secretary of State, Mr. Ysursa, at the Supreme Court arguing that the ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was in error.  The Supreme Court agreed by holding, &quot;Idaho is under no obligation to aid the unions in their political activities.  And the State&#39;s decision not to do so is not an abridgment of the unions&#39; speech; they are free to engage in such speech as they see fit.  They are simply barred from enlisting the State in that endeavor.&quot;<br /><br />The Ninth Circuit had concluded that the Idaho statute &quot;does not prohibit Plaintiffs from participating in political activities, but it...mak[es] the collection of funds for that purpose more difficult&quot; and thereby embraced the holding of the district court that the Idaho statute &quot;eliminates the easiest and least expensive way for unions to collect funds for political speech.&quot;  This the Ninth Circuit held Idaho could not do.  The Ninth Circuit fundamentally erred, however, by failing to recognize that &quot;the First Amendment does not guarantee a right to the least expensive means of expression.&quot;<br /><br />MSLF argued that, under the Ninth Circuit&#39;s ruling, unions could claim that engaging in political speech would be easier and less expensive if the government had the affirmative duty, not only to deduct monies from the payroll, but also to assist in organizing for, catering to, and cleaning up after union meetings during which its members exercised their First Amendment rights.  The notion that the First Amendment requires the government to make speech as easy as possible is preposterous when there are other reasonable, readily available means for engaging in expressive conduct.  MSLF is pleased the Supreme Court rejected that notion!&quot;<br />

		<title>Europe leads on ending death penalty with  Protocol 13 to European Convention on Human Rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.deathpenalty.org/article.php?list=type&type=10"><strong><a href="http://www.deathpenalty.org/article.php?id=201">Elizabeth Zitrin</a></strong></a> [Coordinator, <a href="http://www.deathpenalty.org/article.php?id=201">International Outreach and Communications Project</a>, <a href="http://deathpenalty.org/">Death Penalty.org</a>]: &quot;To the United States, Europe often represents our past.  Our social and cultural institutions are a large, diverse melting pot, but were built on a European base.  Our legal system and our democratic principles came across the Atlantic.  Now, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/italy-ratifies-provision-banning-death.php">Europe is guiding us</a> to our humanitarian future.<br /><br />Italy&#39;s abolitionist movement has pride of place in the international journey away from the barbarism of state killing.  On November 30, 1786, Pietro Leopoldo, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, signed the first recorded abolition by a State, the Leopoldina.  More than two centuries ago, by also abolishing torture, he put into practice what the United States is still learning, that the death penalty is torture - it is the greatest and ultimate violation of human rights and must - and will - be abolished.<br /><br />As we emerge from a period of American political life when torture was sanctioned at the highest levels of government, when federal prosecutors were ordered to seek the death penalty against their own professional judgment, when weapons were treated as the only way to communicate with other nations, we find guidance in human rights standards and goals established in Europe following the devastation of World War II.  For 60 years, the Council of Europe has worked to maintain respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law, as the foundations of a tolerant and civilized society, and the United States has been eager to regain our pride in our high moral standards.<br /><br />The death penalty in the United States is losing support for many reasons: it is a terrible waste of a huge amount of money, draining ever scarcer resources from plans and programs that can truly enhance our safety and better our lives - solving unsolved cases, improving forensic capabilities, providing community policing and hiring teachers, to name a few; it is not a deterrent and does not keep us safer; it is racially biased; it is biased against the poor; it convicts, imprisons and executes innocent people.  And it is cruel, inhuman and degrading, as our European friends have known for generations.<br /><br />Italy&#39;s adoption of <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/library/annexes/187E.pdf">Protocol 13</a> [PDF file], abolishing the last vestiges of its death penalty, is another example for us to follow into the future of the small world we all share, and which our country is rejoining as a leader once again.  In this new era, the US will follow a new strategy, as President Obama said, that balances with our military might all the other elements of our power, including &quot;the power of our moral example.&quot; &quot;What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility,&quot; he said at his inaugural.  &quot;We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.  Those ideals still light the world....&quot;<br /><br />The strength of moral leadership is being felt in the United States and throughout the world on the issue of the death penalty.  Death Penalty Focus serves on the Steering Committee of the <a href="http://www.worldcoalition.org/modules/accueil/">World Coalition Against the Death Penalty</a>, where abolitionist and retentionist nations work together toward universal abolition of the death penalty.  Life is winning.  World Day Against the Death Penalty, October 10, is also European Day Against the Death Penalty.  This year, the international focus is on Teaching Abolition.  We will be Teaching Abolition in high schools and law schools in the US and around the world.  Next year, the focus of the World Coalition will be on the US.  We are all in this together.  <br /><br />We are all in it together on November 30 each year, the anniversary of that first recorded abolition in Tuscany.  On that day of World Cities Against the Death Penalty in 2008, close to a Thousand cities around the world illuminated their monuments, symbolizing enlightenment, celebrating our theme, &quot;No Justice Without Life.&quot;&quot;<br />

		<title>ICC arrest warrant for Sudan&#039;s Al Bashir has both humanitarian and strategic consequences</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.jmu.edu/nelsoninstitute/director.htm"><strong>J. Peter Pham</strong></a> [Director, <a href="http://www.jmu.edu/nelsoninstitute/index.htm">Nelson Institute</a> for International and Public Affairs at <a href="http://www.jmu.edu/">James Madison University</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">decision</a> of Pre-Trial Chamber I of the International Criminal Court (ICC) this week to issue a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc639078.pdf">warrant of arrest</a> [PDF file] for Sudan&#39;s President Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including intentionally directing attacks on civilian populations in Darfur and pillaging towns and villages in the region, as well as acts of murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture, and rape, has divided the international community as well as many individuals and groups which ordinarily find common ground on issues of global justice.<br /><br />On the one side are those who applauded the ICC&#39;s first-ever indictment of a sitting head of state as a significant advance in realizing the vision of the tribunal&#39;s architects to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes which &quot;must not go unpunished&quot; as well as securing a measure of justice for the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa ethnic groups and other victims. On the other are those who contend that the Court&#39;s action will not only set back efforts to resolve Sudan&#39;s multiple conflicts, but will endanger the United Nations peacekeeping forces presently in the country as well as the humanitarian organizations relieving the suffering of the very peoples on whose behalf the ICC acted.<br /><br />While it is true that the Sudanese regime reacted to the ICC decision by immediately decreeing the expulsion of more than a dozen high-profile aid groups, including CARE, M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, Oxfam, and Save the Children, whether the ban is actually enforced remains to be seen. And, as I have argued in an <a href="http://worlddefensereview.com/pham030409.shtml">article</a> for a defense publication earlier this week, given the consistent backing that Al Bashir has received from the African Union - the regional organization is currently sending a  high-level delegation to the Security Council to join the Arab League in pleading for a suspension of the judicial proceedings under Article 16 of the <a href="http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/icc/statute/part-a.htm">Rome Statute of the ICC</a> - it is highly unlikely that Khartoum would risk alienating the no fewer than thirty African countries participating in the two UN missions in Sudan by attacking their blue-helmeted military and police personnel.<br /><br />The question, then, is what next? Of course, it is inconceivable that Al Bashir, who has held tightly to the reins of power since he seized them in a 1989 <em>coup d&#39;&eacute;tat</em> against Sudan&#39;s democratically-elected government, will simply turn himself in at The Hague anytime soon. However, cumulatively ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo&#39;s public <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/64FA6B33-05C3-4E9C-A672-3FA2B58CB2C9/277758/ICCOTPSummary20081704ENG.pdf">application</a> [PDF file]for a warrant last year and the Pre-Trial Chamber&#39;s decision this week to accede to his motion on all counts except the three concerning the crime of genocide where, Judge Anita U&Aring;&iexcl;acka dissenting, it found the evidence of the Sudanese ruler&#39;s specific intent (<em>dolus specialis</em>) insufficient, represents a major turning point that shifts the dynamics on the ground in Sudan and, ultimately, opens the way for the eventual execution of the arrest order.<br /><br />First, unless the legal proceedings in <em>Prosecutor v. Al Bashir</em> are suspended - an action that would take a resolution of the Security Council that seems highly unlikely given that all five permanent members would have to agree to it and, given the commitments it made with respect to the ICC in general and the Darfur prosecutions in particular <a href="http://www.askthecandidates.org/files/Obama_McCain_questionnaire.pdf">during the recent campaign</a> [PDF file], it would be politically difficult for the Obama administration to support such a measure - the Sudanese ruler will inevitably become progressively isolated. While the AU as an organization may not like the indictment, some thirty of its fifty-three members adhere to the ICC, constituting the largest regional bloc within the Assembly of States Parties, and bound under Article 89 of the Rome Statute to arrest and transfer those sought by the tribunal. Even though Sudan is not a signatory to the Statute, the Article 98 exception covering cases where &quot;a request for surrender or assistance...would require the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to State or diplomatic immunity&quot; would not be applicable if Al Bashir continues to travel abroad since the Darfur investigation was referred to the ICC by the Security Council acting under the authority of Chapter VII of the <a href="http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/pdf/uncharter.pdf">UN Charter</a> [PDF file]. Both Article 103 of the Charter and the constant jurisprudence of various international tribunals affirm that the obligation to cooperate when mandated by decisions of the Security Council such as the dispositive part of resolution 1593 takes precedent over any immunities under customary law which might otherwise exist. Thus, even if they are loath to actually detain a fellow leader, Africa&#39;s heads of state will not appreciate being put in an awkward position by their counterpart from Sudan. So, for want of willing hosts, Al Bashir can expect to be staying home more often than not.<br /><br />Second, while Al Bashir may momentarily be able to rally support among his core domestic constituencies by appealing to nationalism, his authority will weaken if he is increasingly marginalized internationally. Others within Sudan&#39;s ruling National Congress Party (NCP) and the military establishment may come to regard him as too much of a liability and, either by themselves or in tandem with influential rivals of Bashir within Khartoum&#39;s ruling Arab Islamist elite, like his former mentor Hassan Al Turabi, will move to push him aside in the same way the clique around Charles Taylor decided to turn on the Liberian leader and survive rather than to go down with him after his <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=afhF3nXfC%2bY%3d&tabid=159">indictment</a> by the Special Court for Sierra Leone was unsealed by prosecutor David M. Crane in 2003. Certainly there will be entrenched interests within the Sudanese political and economic power structures - including the People&#39;s Republic of China which has invested billions of dollars in the country and depends on it for nearly one-tenth of its petroleum imports - which will conclude that it is well-nigh impossible to maintain the investment climate that has hitherto delivered annual GDP growth rates near 10 percent while saddled with an indicted war criminal as head of state.<br /><br />Third, the arrest warrant accelerates the ongoing disintegration of the Sudanese state. Even before the prosecutor&#39;s move against Al Bashir last year, the <a href="http://www.unmis.org/English/cpa.htm">2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement</a> (CPA) which ended the decades of civil war between the Northern-dominated government in Khartoum and the peoples of South Sudan was faltering with almost every benchmark for implementation missed. There is now almost no reasonable expectation that the general elections, including that for the presidency, which are supposed to be held by July will actually take place. While some worry that a delay in the poll may complicate matters for the all-important self-determination referendum for South Sudan scheduled for 2011, a more realistic analysis would posit that the latter vote was never going to take place. No government in Khartoum can afford to allow South Sudan to actually exercise its option under the CPA and go its own way, taking with it some 90 percent of Sudan&#39;s proven oil reserves. Hence, when the election in July fails to take place, most South Sudanese are likely to draw their own conclusions and the regional government may well proceed to a unilateral declaration of independence without waiting two more years. Whether the secession takes place peacefully or a new north-south conflict erupts, the practical result will be the same: the rulers in Khartoum will be deprived of the very revenues which they have up to now used both to purchase the allegiance of supporters and to fuel their violent campaigns in the peripheral regions like Darfur, thus forcing whatever regime elements eventually succeed Al Bashir to seek a genuine settlement of Sudan&#39;s conflicts.<br /><br />Fourth, if only to escape the opprobrium which Al Bashir has brought on the Sudanese state, almost any future government in Khartoum will likely prove more cooperative with the ICC, especially with respect to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc279813.PDF">arrest warrant</a> [PDF file] issued by the court in 2007 for the current minister of state for humanitarian affairs, Ahmad Muhammad Harun, and <em>janjaweed</em> leader Ali Muhammad Al Abd-Al-Rahman, a.k.a. Ali Kushayb. In their decision regarding Al Bashir, the judges noted Sudan&#39;s systematic noncompliance since then and warned that the competent chamber &quot;may make a finding to that effect&quot; and &quot;refer the matter...to the Security Council.&quot; It goes without saying that such an Article 87 referral back to the Security Council would be the last thing any government trying to overcome the bitter legacy of the current regime would want and hence Khartoum might find it expedient to surrender Harun and Kushayb. The trial of these two mid-level figures would, in turn, not only contribute to the ICC&#39;s own progress as a working tribunal, but also to the further laying of the evidentiary groundwork for the eventual prosecution of those with even greater responsibility for the terrible crimes which have taken place in Darfur these past six years.  <br /><br />In short, while the judges who authorized the arrest warrant for Al Bashir may not have envisioned it in this perspective, theirs was not only a legal action with normative force, but also a strategic move with profound geopolitical implications. And because of the particular realities on the ground in Sudan, it might well prove that international human rights law and <em>realpolitik</em> converge in this case to give both Al Bashir and his victims their day in court.&quot;<br />

Nappen</a> [Attorney at Law]: &quot;It&#39;s said that God created man and woman, but it took Sam Colt to make them equal. Domestic violence is deplorable. Abusing any person, whether man or woman, is wrong. The problem is when the issue of <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/supreme-court-decides-gun-possession.php">domestic violence is used to promote an anti-gun agenda</a> to create a new lower threshold for disenfranchisement of individual gun rights. Traditionally, misdemeanor convictions have never been disqualifiers of civil rights. Only felony convictions caused a loss of civil rights, such as the right to vote, the right to hold public office, or the right to serve on a jury.<br /><br />If domestic violence offenses are serious enough to take away one&#39;s Constitutional Right to Keep and Bear Arms, then these offenses are serious enough to be felonies. The Hayes Court rationalizes the law by claiming Congress closed a &quot;loophole&quot; by its enactment. In reality, the bar for loss of civil rights was simply lowered. The Hayes Court stated as followed:<br /><br /><blockquote>&quot;Because many states classify domestic violence crimes as misdemeanors rather than felonies, many domestic violence offenders could not be prohibited from handgun possession under the original version of the Gun Control Act. In an effort to close this loophole, Congress passed the Lautenberg Amendment, prohibiting offenders who had been convicted of Misdemeanor Crimes of Domestic Violence from possessing handguns.&quot;</blockquote><br />This hardly is closing a loophole, but rather creating a noose to hang unsuspecting folks who plead guilty to misdemeanor offenses never knowing they would permanently forfeit their gun rights. The answer is to require the States to make domestic violence offenses felony level if the crimes are that serious. If the offenses are not that serious, then they are rightly misdemeanors and should not be disqualifiers.<br /><br />Both men and women can fall into the domestic violence loss of gun rights trap. The Second Amendment Sisters do not want to see gun rights eroded in the name of political correctness. If the offense is serious, make it a felony and prosecute to the fullest. If it is not that serious, then do not use it as an excuse for back door gun control.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.jtbf.org/index.php?submenu=About&src=gendocs&link=JTBFStaff&category=About"><strong>Paula Lucas</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.jtbf.org/">Just the Beginning Foundation</a>]: &quot;Pull out your cup, fill it full of whatever morning sip of activation you need and let&#39;s talk. <br /><br />The recent <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/obama-distances-himself-from-holder.php">comments made by Attorney General Holder</a> were rough - well intentioned and certainly based more upon fact than figment of imagination, but it&#39;s kind of like using a sheet of sandpaper to file a cracked nail - it would do the trick, but will it have the same outcome? Not likely. <br /><br />As Executive Director for Just The Beginning Foundation, a pipeline organization offering programs directly aimed at inspiring young students, supporting and assisting older students all with an eye towards increasing diversity in the legal profession and judiciary, I deal with issues of race every day. <br /><blockquote>FACT: Minorities are underrepresented in the legal profession. According to the 2000 census, less than 11% of all lawyers are minorities, while minorities account for over 30% of the country&#39;s population.  According to the US Census Department, the minority population will be close to 50% by 2050.</blockquote><br /><blockquote>FACT: Since the birth of the federal judiciary in 1789, US presidents have appointed more than 3,100 judges to the federal courts. But it was only in the last seventy-four years that 269 women and 257 persons of color; 151 African-Americans, 88 Latinos, 16 Asian Pacific Americans and 2 Native Americans were appointed to lifetime positions on the federal courts. Currently, there are approximately 240 women, 110 African-Americans, 69 Latinos, 10 Asian Pacific Americans and 1 Native American out of the 1286 judges currently serving on the federal bench.</blockquote><br /><blockquote>FACT: A number of States (Illinois being one) have enacted legislation specifically to address the disproportionate impact of drug laws on minority communities.</blockquote><br />Society as a whole benefits when all groups have adequate representation in the system that acts as the gatekeeper to justice in our country.  If one can find merit in that premise then most assuredly there is little offense in the notion that the legal profession needs to catch up.<br /><br />And as you get down to that final sip of your drink, just for a moment consider the multitude of other professions that are out there and imagine just how many have similar issues.<br /><br />The idea, the concept, the notion of race relations is a jagged nail. It can scratch and wound many, if not all of us, in some way or another.  But this is no reason to continue to place band aids on these wounds and simply wait for a healing. It&#39;s time to begin the process of pulling off the band aid, exposing and acknowledging the wound and encouraging a healing.  There is much work to be done. As individuals and organizations, it is our duty to arm ourselves with our respective files and continue this work. We do this by listening, sharing our own experiences, volunteering, mentoring and even just by reaching out to people and places we have never reached out to before. Through this we continue the process of smoothing out the jagged nail of race and race relations in this wonderful country of ours.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.steveemerson.com/about/"><strong>Steven Emerson</strong></a> [Founder, <a href="http://www.investigativeproject.com/">The Investigative Project on Terrorism</a>]: &quot;The University of Texas School of Law National Security Clinic, joined by several other advocacy organizations, has <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rights-groups-and-non-profit-advocates.php ">filed an amicus curiae brief</a> on behalf of KindHearts for Charitable Humanitarian Development, Inc. (KindHearts) in the US District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. KindHearts, an Islamic charity, is the plaintiff in the pending civil litigation in the case entitled <u>KindHearts for Charitable Development, Inc. v. Paulson et al</u>. The suit challenges the authority of the US Treasury Department, primarily via the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) to freeze KindHearts&#39; assets (and those of similar supposed charities) based upon an administrative process without judicial review or authority. OFAC froze KindHearts&#39; assets in 2006 as the government pursued what it described as further investigation into allegations showing KindHearts provided support to the terrorist organization Hamas. <br /><br />The case is pending litigation and essentially the amicus brief argues that Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) like KindHearts are really allies of the US Government in its counter-terrorism efforts and by OFAC&#39;s actions NPOs are discouraged and undermined in their ability to provide humanitarian aid. <br /><br />The final resolution of this matter will likely occur in the Federal court system. However, a summary of why OFAC is able to take such action against suspected or known supporters of terrorism may be instructive. OFAC&#39;s powers are rooted in the <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/publications/ieepa.pdf">International Emergency Economic Powers Act</a> (IEEPA) [PDF file], found at 50 US Code, Sections 1701-1707, which was codified in 1977. It authorizes the President to declare an &quot;unusual and extraordinary threat...to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.&quot; OFAC is authorized to take civil enforcement action, primarily in the form of proscribing transactions and freezing and seizing assets, of persons, organizations and countries that are believed to be operating against the security interests of the United States. Under IEEPA, the President can authorize the freeze of assets and block transactions by any individual, organization or country that is determined to be engaged in activities linked to the declared threat. If the US actually is attacked, the President can also confiscate the property of any country, organization or individual who assisted in carrying out the attack. OFAC is the arm that enforces such presidential orders. The threat declaration must be renewed by the President annually for it to remain in effect and the threat declaration can be terminated by a resolution of Congress. Reports concerning the threat declaration are required to be made to Congress. Such Presidential threat declarations under IEEPA related to international terrorism date to the Clinton Administration.<br /> <br />While IEEPA does not confer any specific judicial review process, subsection 1702(c) of the law allows for classified information involved in making a Presidential threat determination to be presented ex parte and in camera to a reviewing court. Such classified information submission must follow provisions found in the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18a/usc_sup_05_18_10_sq3.html">Classified Information Procedures Act</a> (CIPA). This subsection is important because it shows Congress anticipated judicial review of decisions and actions taken under IEEPA. In fact, several cases from the early 1980s did just that. Those cases included two Federal Circuit Court cases (<u>Chas. T. Main Int&#39;l v. Khuzestan Water &amp; Power Auth.</u> and <u>American Int&#39;l Group v. Islamic Republic of Iran</u>) and one before the Supreme Court (<a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/453/654/case.html">Dames &amp; Moore v. Regan</a>). Interestingly, all those cases recognized that Presidential authority under IEEPA is &quot;sweeping and broad.&quot; Statutorily and historically, IEEPA has anticipated and endured judicial review and such judicial review has upheld the President&#39;s authority in these matters. <br /><br />In further consideration of the administrative enforcement actions taken by OFAC under IEEPA against supposed Islamic charities such as KindHearts, it might also be instructive to look at the recently completed Holy Land Foundation (HLF) trial in Dallas. HLF was once the largest Islamic charity operating in the United States and was linked to numerous other Islamic &quot;charitable&quot; groups overseas. Its assets were frozen by OFAC in December 2001 after being designated a &quot;Specially Designated Global Terrorist&quot; (SDGT). The case was investigated simultaneously by the FBI, IRS and other agencies as a criminal matter. The Dallas trial resulted in convictions against all defendants, including the HLF itself, on 108 charges including material support for a terrorist organization (Hamas). <br /><br />The investigation and prosecution of HLF lasted more than a decade and received significant public scrutiny. The OFAC designation and seizure action against this Islamic charity ultimately was validated by the criminal trial. Presumably, OFAC would not take its enforcement actions without anticipating potential judicial review. Additionally, as demonstrated by the HLF case, OFAC has a positive record in properly identifying and placing sanctions against supposed Muslim &quot;charities&quot; linked to supporting Hamas. <br /><br />A potentially noteworthy item is that one of the organizations joining the ACLU in its amicus brief is the <a href="http://www.mpac.org/">Muslim Public Affairs Council</a> (MPAC). MPAC was founded in 1986 as the Political Action Committee of the Islamic Center of Southern California. In 1988 it changed its name to the Muslims Public Affairs Council and received 501c3 non-profit status. Since its inception, MPAC has often appeared to attempt to distract the public from issues pertaining to terrorism and Islamism, mainly by obfuscating the facts concerning terrorist attacks and government actions against terrorists and their financiers. <br /><br />Aggressive representation on behalf of litigants in a civil suit to achieve justice is laudable. Aggressive litigation to achieve the making of a political statement, particularly when that action may chip away at our country&#39;s security, is lamentable.&quot;<br />

		<title>China&#039;s new food safety law must provide courts with real enforcement authority</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marlerblog.com/promo/about/"><strong>Bill Marler</strong></a> [Managing Partner, <a href="http://www.marlerclark.com/">Marler Clark LLP, PS</a>]: &quot;China&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/china-legislature-approves-new-food.php">recently enacted</a> &quot;Food Safety Law&quot; is, at least on paper, a significant leap forward in terms of proactive food safety measures designed to prevent crises before they happen.  Provisions contained in the Law, such as creating a system to recall problem products, nationwide standards for allowable additives, and creating a schedule of fines for violators of the new provisions are certainly all steps in the right direction.  One is left to wonder, however, how effectively the measures will be enforced.<br /><br />Recent food-related health scares in China have erupted despite preexisting legal measures aimed at deterring manufacturers from adulterating their food products.  The <a href="http://gr.china-embassy.org/eng/kxjs/kjfg/t146182.htm">Product Quality Control Law</a>, enacted in 1993, in theory established a product liability legal scheme on par with laws in the United States.  The Quality Control Law, however, was of little use to the families of the nearly 300,000 infants sickened in the 2008 melamine-contaminated infant formula crisis due to the fact that Chinese courts simply refused to hear any of the filed cases.  Similarly, the 2007 criminal trial and subsequent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6286698.stm">execution of Zheng Xiaoyu</a>, the former director of the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration, appears to have done little to deter government corruption in food crises.  <br /><br />Despite these past failures, the new Food Safety Law provides a necessary bookend in the Chinese food safety scheme.  Just as the Product Quality Control Law was designed to react to product safety disasters, by allowing victims of such disasters some recourse against negligent manufacturers, the Food Safety Law aims to prevent food safety disasters before they happen.  Still, for the sake of the Chinese public, let&#39;s hope that the elephant in the room - Chinese courts&#39; lack of enforcement authority - is finally addressed and resolved with the enactment of the Food Safety Law.  The stakes are simply too high at this point for the government to generate false enforcement measures, aimed at restoring consumer confidence, and then go back to conducting business as usual.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.erenlaw.com/lawyers/vcomras.html"><strong>Victor Comras</strong></a> [Special Counsel, <a href="http://www.erenlaw.com/">Eren Law Firm</a>]: &quot;Classified information and court rooms usually just don&#39;t mesh. And, this factor is at the very heart of the continuing dilemma we face in using our judicial system to deal with terrorism and terrorists.  Terrorism cases pose very special investigative and court room challenges.  The objective in many of these cases is to identify and to stop the terrorists, and to prosecute them, even before they act.  And, when it comes to most financing-of-terrorism cases, the challenge is to be able to demonstrate a specific intent or <em>mens rea</em> even when the culprits employ well established charities and charitable works to mask their real intentions.  This often necessitates the use of sensitive intelligence gathering methods in addition to normal investigative procedures. But, the real difficulty arises when it comes to turning this classified information into evidence that can be used for the purposes of prosecution in open court.  And, when this is impossible, we have to seek to balance the protection of our sensitive intelligence sources and methods so essential to our national security with our deep felt commitment to due process, judicial fairness and justice, as well as to maintain accountability and to assure against abuse.<br /><br />It appears to me that U.S. District Court Chief Judge Vaughn Walker has done a truly remarkable job weighing and balancing these factors. His ruling in the Al-Haramain Oregon NSA wiretapping case, which was just <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/ninth-circuit-denies-government-appeal.php">upheld by a Ninth Circuit three-judge panel</a>, sets forth a set of procedures that may well become the template for the future handling of classified information in such cases. I leave to others to comment on the many legal intricacies involved in the ruling. For my part, I am content that the court found a way to allow limited, but essential access to classified information critically relevant to the merits of that case.<br /><br />The procedures set forth will allow the court, and, conditionally, one or a few of Al-Haramain&#39;s attorneys to review classified information that is determined by the judge to be critical to due process and fairness in the case. The classified information will be maintained in a secure facility, reviewed first by the judge who will also have the opportunity to consider <em>ex parte</em> the Justice Department&#39;s security concerns regarding the information to be viewed by specially designated opposing counsel(s).  Before obtaining such access, the designated opposing counsel(s) will first be required to obtain the requisite security clearances. For its part, the Justice Department has been ordered to facilitate the granting of such clearances in a timely fashion without lowering security clearance standards or rules against any further classified information dissemination.<br /><br />While the Judge&#39;s order makes it all sound quite straight forward, and we should certainly hope that turns out to be the case, there is still a real possibility that the process will be hung-up by the usual delays that are regularly encountered in obtaining sensitive intelligence security clearances. Perhaps some thought should be given to the establishment of special new procedures to establish a special Federal Bar of Attorneys pre-cleared and enabled to be available as co-counsel in cases involving (requiring) some access to classified information.  That would put such special defense counsel on equal footing with their prosecuting attorney brethren. After all, both are already equally considered to be duly appointed officers of the court. The burden would be on attorneys applying to membership to such a special Federal Bar not only to demonstrate their suitability for such clearances, but to front some of the costs that the clearance process regularly entails. These costs could then be passed on in the course of the usual fees charged to clients.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.becketfund.org/index.php/person/27.html">Angela Wu</a></strong> [Acting Executive Director, International Law Director, <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/index.php">The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty</a>]: &quot;The Supreme Court recently overturned Board of Immigration Appeals and Fifth Circuit rulings in <u>Negusie v. Holder</u> and found that victims of persecution who are forced to participate in persecution may be entitled to asylum.  Petitioner Daniel Girmai Negusie is an Eritrean-Ethiopian Christian who was forcibly conscripted into Eritrea&#39;s war against Ethiopia and forced to serve as a prison guard to tortured inmates.  He at times out of conscience attempted to aid some of those he guarded, for which he was punished.  The decision can be considered a victory for Negusie, who now has another chance at asylum.  However, the Court&#39;s decision <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-limits-standing-of.php">leaves to immigration authorities</a> the ultimate question of &quot;whether an alien who was compelled to assist in persecution can be eligible for asylum or withholding of removal&quot; under the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/propub/ProPubVAP.jsp?dockey=c9fef57852dc066cfe16a4cb816838a4">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> (INA).<br /><br />The Court&#39;s decision hinged on principles of statutory interpretation more than the equity of Negusie&#39;s situation.  The Court found that the BIA and Fifth Circuit erred in applying <u>Fedorenko</u>, which found that under a different statute, the <a href="http://tucnak.fsv.cuni.cz/~calda/Documents/1940s/Displaced%20Persons%20Act%20of%201948.html">Displaced Persons Act of 1948</a> (DPA), &quot;an individual&#39;s service as a concentration camp armed guard &#8212; whether voluntary or involuntary &#8212; made him ineligible&quot; for protection.  Because the BIA based its holdings on the (erroneous) belief <u>Fedorenko</u> bound the outcome of Negusie&#39;s case, the Court determined the BIA had in fact not interpreted the statute at all, as it should have in the first place.  Therefore the BIA&#39;s decision deserved no deference under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_U.S.A.,_Inc._v._Natural_Resources_Defense_Council,_Inc.#Importance">Chevron doctrine</a>, stating that courts should defer to administrative agencies in matters of statutory interpretation.  The Court reversed and remanded for the agency to &quot;interpret the statute, free from error.&quot;<br /><br />The question posed by Negusie &#8212; the culpability of those who participate in harming others under coercion &#8212; raises, as Justice Scalia puts it in a concurrence emphasizing that the BIA is free to interpret the persecution bar as having no exception &quot;so long as the choice to so is soundly reasoned&quot; and not based on <u>Federenko</u>, &quot;profound questions of moral philosophy and individual responsibility.&quot;<br /><br />In considering the substantive question before it, the BIA now must not only interpret the statute independent of <u>Federenko</u>&#39;s DPA-specific ruling, but has within its power the ability to define, if it recognizes a persecutor bar exception, the parameters of that exception.  In doing so, it should consider the realities of how authoritarian regimes exercise their persecution.<br /><br />The Becket Fund argued in its <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/files/779cd.pdf">amicus brief</a> [PDF File] that American asylum law should recognize and condemn the evil of forced participation in persecution of fellow prisoners.  The brief argued that forcing prisoners to persecute one another is a particular method authoritarian governments use to invade the sphere of conscience.  The Becket Fund&#39;s brief was joined by a diverse coalition including the American Islamic Congress, Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and United Sikhs.<br /><br />Historical examples of such targeted torture abound.  For example, the Romanian Communist government used Pitesti prison outside Bucharest for the violent reeducation of political and religious prisoners from 1949-1952.  Prisoners were compelled to confess their own crimes against the state and to betray others.  They were <a href="http://www.frederica.com/writings/abu-ghraib-and-pitesti.html">required</a> [source] to: <br /><br /><blockquote>blaspheme and renounce their deepest emotional ties and spiritual convictions: &quot;I lied when I said &#39;I believe in God.&#39; &quot;I lied when I said, &#39;I love my mother and my father.&#39;...Christians were compelled to participate in blasphemous versions of Romanian Orthodox liturgical rites: a parody baptism was performed as their heads were dunked in a bucket of urine and feces.</blockquote><br />But in the final phase of several stages of psychological torture,<br /><br /><blockquote>&quot;prisoners were required to prove their full conversion by torturing other prisoners, including their best friend....  This ingenious step insured that the spirit would be utterly broken, and that distrust and misery would make cooperation in an uprising much less likely.&quot;</blockquote><br />Coerced participation is itself a form of persecution aimed particularly at psychological devastation, as it carries with it the intuition of the victim&#39;s own spiritual failure, self-loathing, and despair, and should not be implicitly protected by a persecutor bar that recognizes no exception for duress.  Further, asylum law should be not only a judgment about the blameworthiness of the asylum applicant, but also a moral condemnation of the government the asylum applicant flees.  To recognize otherwise would create a particularly perverse incentive: authoritarian governments would see an advantage in setting religious believers to torture one another, since that would automatically disqualify them from gaining asylum in the United States.&quot;<br />

		<title>Italy&#039;s complete abolition of death penalty is evidence of  growing international trend</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong><a href="http://www.aclu.org/capital/general/10521res20040409.html#hill">Christopher Hill</a></strong></a> [State Strategies Coordinator for the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/capital/index.html">ACLU Capital Punishment Project</a>]: &quot;Italy&#39;s decision on March 3 to <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/italy-ratifies-provision-banning-death.php">completely abolish capital punishment</a> is yet more proof that the world is moving away from this ineffective and unjust system. There has not been an execution by a member of the Council of Europe in over 10 years, and 41 out of the 47 members of the Council of Europe have ratified <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/library/annexes/187E.pdf">Protocol No. 13</a> [PDF file] to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which outlaws the use of the death penalty. Like many nations of the world, these 41 European nations recognize that the death penalty is a violation of human rights.  <br /><br />The United States is increasingly coming to that same realization.  Although <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-penalty-policy-state">36 states</a> retain death penalty statutes, in many of the states these statutes are rarely used. According to the <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a>, 80 percent of the executions in the United States are in southern states. New Hampshire has not executed anyone since 1939. New Jersey reinstated the death penalty in 1982 and abolished it in 2007 without ever sending anyone to the death chamber. Pennsylvania and Connecticut have executed only inmates who volunteered for execution by waiving their appeals. There is genuine hope for abolition in several states such as Montana and New Mexico. And according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, there are fewer death sentences issued in the United States today than at any other time since capital punishment was reinstated in this country in 1976.  <br /><br />Although the United States has a long way to go to catch up with the rest of western civilized democracies, we are on the right course. When the Supreme Court of Nebraska ruled that its use of the electric chair was cruel and unusual punishment, <a href="http://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/publications/JudgesBio/connelly.htm">Judge William Connolly</a> wrote, &quot;[w]e recognize the temptation to make the prisoner suffer, just as the prisoner made an innocent victim suffer. But it is the hallmark of a civilized society that we punish cruelty without practicing it.&quot;  As more nations and more states continue to recognize that the death penalty is an enormous waste of resources and an unjust, unfair and inhumane system, it has become apparent that we are well on our way to ridding the world of this cruelty.&quot;<br />

		<title>UK Parliament should clarify law on traveling abroad for assisted suicide of family member</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jo Cartwright</strong> [Campaigns and Press Officer, <a href="http://www.dignityindying.org.uk">Dignity in Dying</a>]: &quot;We are pleased that <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-court-dismisses-appeal-to-clarify.php">Debbie Purdy&#39;s appeal</a> has gone some way to clarify the law for her.  The Appeals Court was able to go further than the High Court did in stating that the principles in the judgment <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/4208890/Assisted-suicide-law-does-not-need-to-change---DPP.html">given by the Director of Public Prosecutions</a> in the Daniel James case would also apply if Debbie were to go to Switzerland accompanied by her husband Omar, and therefore although this is not the full resolution Debbie was hoping for, she can be fairly sure that Omar wouldn&#39;t be prosecuted.  <br /><br />The Judgment goes on to make it clear that if someone like Omar were prosecuted for accompanying a loved one abroad to die, the courts are likely to dismiss the case or discharge them without a sentence, and question why the charge was made.  This is concerning as vulnerable people who may not wish to end their lives in Switzerland could be pressured by family members who would then be unlikely to face prosecution on their return.  We need a safeguarded approach to assisted dying in the UK. <br /> <br />It seems that the courts have gone as far as they can with this matter and now it is time for Parliament to fully engage with the issues and address the fact that this law isn&#39;t fit for its purpose.  If, as the judgment suggests, there&#39;s no public interest in prosecuting, then surely there must be a public interest in updating the law to remove the doubt.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Daniel R. Vice</strong> [Senior Attorney, <a href="http://www.bradycenter.org/">Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence</a>]: &quot;The Supreme Court in <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/supreme-court-decides-gun-possession.php">United States v. Hayes rejected arguments</a> by a convicted wife beater that federal law allowed him to possess firearms, upholding the broad federal ban on gun possession by convicted misdemeanor domestic abusers.  Justice Ginsburg&#39;s majority opinion stressed that &quot;[f]irearms and domestic strife are a potentially deadly combination nationwide,&quot; citing an amicus brief filed by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.<br /><br /><u>Hayes</u> was the first gun case since the Court ruled in <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/supreme/slip/554/07-290/opinion.pdf">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [PDF file] that the Second Amendment grants a right to possess handguns in the home for self-defense.  Yet neither the <u>Hayes</u> majority nor Justice Scalia&#39;s dissent even mentioned <u>Heller</u>, signaling that the Court recognized that there was no Second Amendment issue and that Justice Scalia meant what he said in <u>Heller</u> regarding the limited nature of the right.  Indeed, amicus groups had urged the Court to recognize misdemeanor abusers&#39; right to bear arms, yet the most Justice Scalia said in his <u>Hayes</u> dissent was that for law-abiding persons, there is &quot;nothing wrong with possessing a firearm.&quot;<br /><br />During oral argument, Justice Scalia mocked the seriousness of the charge against Hayes, stating that &quot;it&#39;s not that serious an offense.&quot;  Yet the Court&#39;s ruling recognizes that abusers like Hayes, who as the government stressed &quot;hit his wife all around the face until it swelled out, kicked her all around her body, kicked her in the ribs,&quot; pose a serious danger to the public if armed with a gun.  If Justice Scalia&#39;s view in <u>Hayes</u> had prevailed, tens of thousands of convicted abusers in nearly half the states would have been allowed to rearm themselves with firearms.  Thankfully, seven justices on the Court recognized &quot;Congress&#39; manifest purpose&quot; in keeping firearms away from dangerous abusers.&quot;<br />

		<title>Attorney General&#039;s frank conversation of race requires end to politically correct bullying tactics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.acri.org/jen_bio.html"><strong>Jennifer Gratz</strong></a> [Director of Research, <a href="http://www.acri.org/">American Civil Rights Institute</a>]: &quot;Attorney General Holder recently called the American people a &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2009/02/ag-holder-to-doj-us-still-faces-racial.php">nation of cowards</a>&quot; with respect to the issue of race.  For the most part, I agree with him but in, I suspect, a very different way than what he meant with his comment.  The civil rights establishment led by the likes of the Reverends Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), By Any Means Necessary (BAMN), the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center (BISC), American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)  and the Urban League &#8212; force people to be cowardly when it comes to race. Politicians, business owners and your average citizen, for the most part, all fear being unfairly labeled bigots and racists by these organizations.  The old civil rights establishment is deeply out of touch with what the general public thinks when it comes to race, discrimination, and affirmative action.  <br /> <br />I was nineteen years old when I chose to stand up and fight against racial discrimination.  In 1997 I filed a lawsuit against the University of Michigan for racial discrimination in their admission policy.  After the Supreme Court decided my case, <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/supreme/539/244.pdf">Gratz v. Bollinger</a> [PDF file], and a companion case, <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/supreme/539/306.pdf">Grutter v. Bollinger</a> [PDF file], I turned my attention to educating Americans about the harms of race preferences and then helping to give people the option to vote to end these discriminatory policies.  Throughout my battles, I have had numerous people of different political persuasions and occupations whisper their support in my ear for my efforts &#8212; only to sit on the sideline when we needed someone to stand up, or worse yet, join forces with my opposition, not because of principle, but because it was the politically correct, the politically expedient, thing to do.  <br /> <br />During the 2006 <a href="http://www.michigancivilrights.org/">Michigan Civil Rights Initiative</a> campaign, polls showed that Michigan voters were poised to defeat the initiative which would simply make it unconstitutional for the state to discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any group or individual on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public contracting, and public education.  Two days before the election public polls indicated that the initiative could be defeated by nearly 30 points.  My mentor and one of the Initiative&#39;s key advisors, Ward Connerly, often said that the public polls could not be trusted.  On election day the initiative passed with a 16 point margin.  Voters are fearful to even tell a pollster that they believe that &quot;affirmative action&quot; has become nothing more than discrimination &#8212; that says something!<br /> <br />I hope Attorney General Holder is sincere when he says that our nation needs a frank conversation about race.  However, until people can say what they believe without fear of being, unfairly, labeled a racist or having their business picketed because of their personal beliefs, I suspect people will continue to be guarded and politically correct rather than stand by their beliefs and principles.&quot;<br />

		<title>The Supreme Court and Al-Marri: No Virtue Now in Judicial Passivity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www1.law.wnec.edu/faculty/index.cfm?selection=doc.1187">Bruce Miller</a> of Western New England College School of Law says that despite the Obama administration&#39;s intent to criminally charge Ali Al-Marri in a US court, his challenge to his detention as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; continues to present a live case which the Supreme Court is obliged to adjudicate...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/brucemiller.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->O<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->n Friday, February 27th, the Obama administration announced its intention to charge Ali Al-Marri, a legal resident of the United States, with the crime of material support for terrorism. This decision will end, temporarily at least, Al-Marri's more than half-decade in military detention as an enemy combatant in the Navy Brig at Charleston, South Carolina.  Simultaneously, and predictably, the administration also moved to dismiss as moot Al-Marri's Supreme Court appeal of a Federal Court of Appeals decision upholding that detention, arguing that there is no longer a dispute between Al-Marri and the government.  The Court should quickly deny that motion and retain the appeal on its docket.<br /><br /> Although our government's military detention of Al-Marri is suspended for the duration of his criminal prosecution, his challenge to that detention nonetheless continues to present a live case, within the meaning of Article III of the Constitution, a case which the Court is obliged to adjudicate.  The mootness doctrine, famously included among the "passive virtues" described by Alexander Bickel nearly fifty years ago, is a judicially crafted instrument of prudence, which permits the Supreme Court to dismiss a case if the dispute between the parties that triggered it ceases to exist. Mootness, along with a small passel of kindred tools of judicial avoidance &#8212; the ripeness, generalized grievance, third party standing and prudential political question doctrines &#8212; allow the Supreme Court great leeway to control the timing and context for its exercise of the power and duty of Constitutional judicial review.  Professor Bickel defended these doctrines as enabling the Court to defer resolution, especially of "momentous" Constitutional issues, to a time when the political controversy surrounding them has abated, making a principled rather than expedient decision more likely. Consistent with this prudential, hence inherently discretionary, purpose, the mootness doctrine is limited by several important judge-made exceptions, many of which apply to Al-Marri's case.<br /><br /> The first of these exceptions excludes from dismissal as moot cases in which a plaintiff seeks relief from injuries which are "capable of repetition, yet evading review."  Though narrow in conception, because it applies only when the plaintiff him/herself faces a credible threat of being injured a second time, this exception perfectly captures Al-Marri's situation. He has already once been charged with federal crimes since his detention commenced in late 2001. These charges of credit card fraud and identity theft were dismissed with prejudice by the Justice Department in 2003 when Al-Marri's motion to suppress evidence against him secured from other detainees threatened to expose the Bush administration's interrogation methods to judicial scrutiny.  It was then that the Bush administration conveniently decided to designate Al-Marri an enemy combatant and transfer him to military custody.  Now, with Supreme Court review of that designation imminent, the Obama administration has determined to move Al-Marri back into the civilian jurisdiction of the Justice Department, again seeking to evade judicial review.  Is Al-Marri's designation as an enemy combatant capable of repetition?  Of course it is, unless the Obama administration is prepared to acknowledge that it has no statutory or Constitutional power to reclassify him as enemy combatant and again subject him to military detention if the new criminal case against him does not turn out to the administration's liking.<br /><br /> The second mootness exception applicable to Al-Marri's appeal is the voluntary cessation doctrine.  This exception protects from dismissal as moot challenges to policies which the government abandons in response to litigation but remains free to resume as soon as the pressure of possible judicial invalidation lifts.  In Al-Marri's case, the policy in question is the President's claim of authority indefinitely to detain without charge as enemy combatants legal resident aliens arrested in the United States who have never fought against with the United States in a foreign theatre of war. Even assuming the Obama administration has permanently abandoned this claim as to Al-Marri himself, there is no evidence, at least as yet, that it forswears this vast assertion of executive power as a general matter, or that it will not invoke it as to others if and when it deems such detention necessary or expedient. The Supreme Court has been leery of crediting far clearer evidence of official abandonment of a challenged practice than anything offered by the Obama administration with respect to the military detention policy at issue in Al-Marri. Fifteen years ago, in an opinion by Justice Thomas, the Court refused to dismiss as moot a challenge to a city's affirmative action ordinance for municipal contracts even though the ordinance had been repealed and supplanted by a successor policy after the Court had granted  certiorari. The consequences of a failure by the Supreme Court to apply  the voluntary cessation exception to mootness to Al-Marri's appeal, when the government has neither repealed nor replaced the policy under which he has been detained, are, potentially at least, momentous in the ways Professor Bickel may have envisioned. The Court of Appeals' opinion upholding the legality of Al-Marri's detention announced forthrightly that the authority of the President to detain legal resident aliens as enemy combatants applies equally to United States citizens.  So if the Obama administration has voluntarily ceased to apply this authority to Al-Marri, but remains free to reinvoke it whenever it sees fit, the result is a breathtakingly broad but judicially unexamined Presidential authority to subject anyone and everyone in the United States to indefinite military detention without trial.<br /><br /> The Bush administration similarly and successfully evaded an earlier challenge to its authority to impose indefinite military detention on an American citizen, Jose Padilla, by bringing criminal charges against him while his petition for certiorari was pending in the Supreme Court.  But in this respect, Al-Marri's situation is, like the affirmative action case noted above, different from Padilla's. The Supreme Court has already granted Al-Marri's petition, signaling its recognition of the importance of the issues presented by his case. Chief Justice Rehnquist recognized the significance of this distinction twenty years ago when he urged the Court to abandon the mootness doctrine altogether in cases already under review when the "mooting" events occur. The Chief Justice pointed out that the Court's "resources-the time spent preparing to decide the case by reading briefs, hearing oral arguments and conferring-are squandered in every case in which&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;we may not reach the question presented". Al-Marri's appeal provides a textbook example of the concerns which animated the late Chief Justice. Because of the extraordinary scope of the Court of Appeals' authorization of military detention, his case presents questions of the gravest significance for the future of civil liberties, literally, in the United States. The Court's investment in resolving them should n
ot now be thrown away.<br /> <br />            Seven and a half years have passed since the terrifying attacks of September 11. Al-Marri has been in American custody, without any realistic prospect for resolution of his fate, for all but three months of that time. A new President, one who has publicly opposed many of the detention policies of his predecessor, has been elected and inaugurated. Surely enough time has now elapsed to permit a principled, non-expedient, judicial assessment of the issues raised by his case.  The passive virtues of the mootness doctrine provide no support for the Obama administration's effort to prevent the Supreme Court from hearing Al-Marri's appeal. To the contrary, if the Court now opts for judicial passivity in the face of Al-Marri's treatment by our government, the chief result will instead be that the principle of military detention of American citizens and legal residents will continue, per Justice Jackson's dissent in Korematsu v. U.S., to "lie about like a loaded weapon ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need." <br />    <br /><br /><em>Bruce Miller is Professor of Law at Western New England College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.richmond.edu/faculty/tobias.htm">Saeed Malik</a>, a US citizen who is the younger brother of former Pakistan Supreme Bar Association president and lawyers&#39; movement leader Muneer Malik, says that the Obama Administration should support Pakistan&#39;s lawyers and civil society by pressing Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari to reinstate the country&#39;s ousted chief justice and fully restore the rule of law...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/saeedmalik.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->A<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end --> year ago I wrote that Pervez Musharraf&#39;s dictatorial rule over Pakistan was destined to end up in the dustbin of history. In a transparent process to clear the constitutional hurdles to his third term as president, Musharraf in November 2007 fired the Chief Justice of the country and suspended the constitution. This was an act so brazen that sixty of the Chief Justice&#39;s brethren on the benches of various Pakistani federal and provincial courts resigned in protest. The subsequent movement by Pakistan&#39;s lawyers to restore the independence of the judiciary is well known to everyone. <br /><br />The Bush Administration, in its characteristically short-sighted approach to foreign policy, turned a blind eye to Musharraf's massacre of the judiciary, abandoning the protesting lawyers and civil society. Forget the moral indefensibility of a stand that sides with those who muffle the voices of those seeking the rule of law; a popular and just movement is like a volcano and cannot be stopped. Musharraf clung to power for a few miserable months while American popularity in Pakistan fell to single digits.<br /><br />And here we are again! I have argued before that without a free and independent judiciary any experiment in democracy will quickly implode. The Bush Administration's model of hybrid democracy in Pakistan is in shambles again. In early 2008 elections were held in Pakistan and a new government was installed, but the judicial crisis was left to fester. Without an independent and credible judiciary, even an elected leader turns corrupt and dictatorial. Case in point: Pakistan's current president, Asif Ali Zardari. <br /><br />Mr. Zardari, after giving two written guarantees to restore the Chief Justice of Pakistan and his court, has stalled and reneged. Mr. Zardari's motives are transparent. He is afraid that an independent court will inconvenience him with personal and national accountability. As &quot;First Man&quot;, when his wife Benazir Bhutto was Pakistan&#39;s prime minister, Mr. Zardari was known as Mr. Ten Percent, for the gratuity he demanded of anyone who desired a government contract. Mr. Zardari, with Musharraf's help, was able to secure a blanket pardon for all criminal offenses registered against him, and Musharraf's Attorney General withdrew Pakistan as a plaintiff from money-laundering case pending against Zardari in Swiss courts. <br /><br />Mr. Zardari is on record saying that signed agreements must not be taken seriously because they merely reflect a 'political reality' and are not binding. This is not uncharacteristic of Mr. Zardari. For years, he had claimed that he was a university graduate (a requirement until late for holding elected office in Pakistan) from a certain school in England. When it was uncovered by the <em>New York Times</em> that the school Mr. Zardari claimed to have attended does not exist not did it ever, Mr. Zardari )after having accused the <em>Times</em> of lying) moved his rubber-stamp court to remove the graduation as a requirement for holding elected office. <br /><br />So what does this have to do with us? <br /><br />Firstly, the United States is the biggest donor of aid to Pakistan. It must qualify this aid with the requirement the government of Pakistan demonstrate its commitment to human rights and the aspirations of the people of Pakistan. The Obama Administration should not make the mistake of the Bush Administration. A decisive majority of Pakistanis ardently support the restoration of the Chief Justice. If the United States even passively undercuts the movement of Pakistan&#39;s civil society, as it has done in the past, it is promoting lawlessness and thus aiding the cause of the extremists. <br /><br />Secondly, although it may be expedient to deal with autocrats who make mince-meat of this thing called the judiciary, it is neither prudent nor in America&#39;s longer-term interests. Agreements cannot be made with Zardari alone. First Mr. Zardari does not believe in agreements being binding anyway. Second, the people of Pakistan must be stakeholders too. We will not make them stakeholders until we side with them in their war for justice.<br /><br />Pakistan&#39;s lawyers have now begun a long march, peacefully demonstrating in support of the rule of law. The government of Mr. Zardari has already started to throw people in prison. Will they not learn that when peaceful avenues are closed, the door of violence begins to loom as an option? <br />    <br /><br /><em>Saeed Malik is the younger brother of Muneer A. Malik, who was president of Pakistan&#39;s Supreme Court Bar Association in 2007 when the Lawyers Movement in Pakistan was first launched. A US citizen for more than 35 years, he is also founding partner &amp; chairman of the board of for Silicon Turnkey Solutions (www.sts-usa.com), based in California&#39;s Silicon Valley.</em><br />

His executive orders requiring the government to close Guantanamo within a year, comply with the Geneva conventions, and halt prosecutions by military commissions are hallmarks of that change. <br /><br />Even so, the orders still allow for the legalization of the Bush administration's policy of "preventive detention" and for trials lacking full constitutional safeguards. Proposals linger in Washington that would establish "national security courts" to supervise a new preventive detention system or to try terrorism suspects. We focus here on the threats posed by preventive detention.<br /><br />The proposed national security courts would oversee detainees whom the government may claim cannot be released, sent to another country, or prosecuted in regular federal courts. Without ever being required to prove its case, the government could use these courts to short-circuit constitutional guarantees and permanently detain individuals it deems dangerous.<br /> <br />Let's not overlook the fact that the federal criminal justice system provides all the tools necessary for effective and fair terrorism prosecution and for detention within well-developed, constitutional boundaries. The government can prosecute citizens and non-citizens alike in federal courts under far-reaching laws that criminalize support for terrorism, wherever and however it may happen.  <br /><br />National security court proponents claim the government needs a new tool for those it "knows" are terrorists but cannot prosecute because evidence may be inadmissible as obtained through illegal means, such as torture. Or, they fear that trials will disclose important intelligence information.<br /><br />First, the new administration should question the extent to which the prior administration knew all it claimed to know. A core part of our adversarial system of determining truth through full due process is putting the government to its proof. Our experience over the last eight years counsels against deferring to claims by the President or the intelligence agencies that they have "solid" information that justifies preventive detention. <br /><br />Second, the proper response to concerns about how to handle these difficult cases ought to be for the government either to develop admissible evidence or to send the detainees to the countries where they were seized or where they may be given due process. We should not detain anyone indefinitely without providing him a full and fair opportunity to defend himself. Already more than 500 of the men held at Guantanamo Bay have been determined not to be enemy combatants and were released to other countries. In the few pending Guantanamo cases that have gone to habeas corpus hearings, the courts have ordered nearly two dozen people released.<br /><br />Third, let's not get distracted by the straw man argument about "protecting sensitive intelligence." The federal courts have an excellent record of handling classified material. Indeed, the only leaks of classified information over the last 15 years, in more than a hundred international terrorism prosecutions, came from the executive branch, not federal criminal courts. <br /><br />Finally, we support punishing terrorists as severely as the law allows after a federal court holding a criminal trial finds them guilty. We agree that our Constitution and longstanding laws permit suspects properly charged with a crime to be imprisoned awaiting trial. What we cannot support, however, is the indefinite imprisonment of a person never charged with a criminal act, even if some new national security court were to "authorize" such detention.<br /><br />We and our colleagues on a bipartisan task force convened by the Constitution Project, which includes some of the nation's leading legal and policy experts, question how any system of preventive detention, however supervised, can be reconciled with the Constitution's basic guarantees of due process and the fundamental human rights central to who we are as a people. As the President advised in his inaugural address, "we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals."<br /><br />It is basic to American law that detention can only be permitted when government provides an accused the right to defend himself, to challenge the evidence, and to put the government to its proof in a court of law. It is what the Constitution demands. America is indeed exceptional, and this is a critical part of what makes us so. <br /><br /><br /><em>The Honorable David Skaggs (D-CO) represented Colorado's Second Congressional District from 1987 to 1999.

In 2008, a group of legislators drafted House Bill 5043, which is a two-pronged plan to broaden the reproductive rights of Filipinas. First, the bill seeks to inform women about contraception, birth spacing, and safe sexual practices. Secondly, it wants to ensure universal access to reproductive health care and information. The bill has yet to pass, but it represents a serious and significant effort to curtail the government&#39;s attempt to prevent the widespread use of artificial contraception throughout the country.<br /><br />In February 2000, former mayor of Manila Jose Atienza issued Executive Order 003 (EO), which affirmatively supported natural family planning. The EO sought to establish natural family planning centers to increase support for a pro-life culture. However, in reality this promotion of responsible parenthood as an ideal has become a <em>de facto</em> ban on all forms of artificial contraception.<br /><br />For almost a decade, most Filipina women in Manila have been unable to obtain contraception.  The sweeping effects of the EO are felt by millions of women because Manila is the second most populous city in the Philippines and is bordered by several smaller cities, creating a hub of more than 14 million people. Rural areas are also affected, possibly to an even greater degree.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/-Malakal-edited-787653.jpg"><img style="margin: 4pt 10px 10px 4pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/-Malakal-edited-787649.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>As a result of the EO, city health centers and hospitals no longer provide contraception in their facilities, and private and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have begun shutting down. For those able to purchase condoms or birth control pills, the transactions are done in secret. Health care workers constantly fear being harassed or threatened, and so many of them no longer even attempt to provide information about family planning or safe-sex practices.<br /><br />The effects of the EO are intensified and perpetuated by the strong conservative sentiment held by most current Filipinos. Almost 81% of the country is Roman Catholic, and morality and politics tend to intertwine.  President Gloria Arroyo has utilized the influence of religion to promote her conservate platform, which was also heavily funded by the Catholic Church.<br /><br />For many Westerners, this state of affairs seems unbelievable.  In fact, many Western organizations such as USAID and women&#39;s rights groups vehemently oppose the EO as a violation of human rights. Women&#39;s reproductive rights are still a hotly contested topic in the United States, but contraception has been legally accepted and is considered a normal part of the general culture.  Following the decision of <u>Griswold v. Connecticut</u> 44 years ago, the use of contraceptives became a protected fundamental privacy right in the US.<br /><br />However, even in the West, the concept of choice is often tied to a woman&#39;s ability to pay, and artificial contraception methods are sometimes only available to those with the necessary resources. In fact, relatively recent US legislation has impeded women&#39;s reproductive choice by barring the use of Medicaid funds to pay for reproductive health care. Likewise, economic issues certainly adversely impact lower-income Filipina women&#39;s access to birth control, even beyond the EO&#39;s influence.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">Passing House Bill 5043 or other similar legislation will involve a lengthy struggle.  The Catholic Church has openly opposed the bill, stating that it tends to promote abortion and pre-marital sexual relations.  Women within the country are torn between their faith and their desire to avoid the negative effects brought on by lack of access to birth control.  Advocacy for reproductive choice is stifled because the millions of people who adhere to their Catholic faith feel that such a bold move towards sexual freedom goes against the morality of the country.  However, a recent report called &quot;Imposing Misery&quot; portrays the lives of such women, who face economic, health, and personal struggles because of the many children they have been forced to bear.<br /><br />My mother, the oldest of seven siblings, grew up in an environment where contraception was not widely accepted or even available. Living in a rural suburb of Manila, few knew anything about family planning, and having many children was the norm. It was only by going to college and eventually moving to the US that my mother was able to learn that women had other options.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/island-in-the-south-pacific-edited-736539.jpg"><img style="margin: 4pt 4pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 236px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/island-in-the-south-pacific-edited-736535.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>It is overly simplistic to paint Filipino ways as oppressive, because there is also a strong Western sentiment in the country, enhanced by pop culture. There have long been strong cultural ties between the US and the Philippines, and the Philippines were a US commonwealth until 1946. Growing up half-American and half-Filipina, I experienced how closely the two cultures prize the same ideals. Nonetheless, the Philippines also have a strong Spanish and Catholic cultural heritage left over from colonial times. The Philippines is therefore a country that is progressive in many ways, but there are still millions of people who champion traditional Church values. Such an affinity for religion promotes the country&#39;s ideals of family, morality, and conservatism. However, the same moral concerns keep citizens from fully embracing a more progressive view towards women&#39;s sexuality.<br /><br />At this time, House Bill 5043 is still being debated in the House of Representatives, but the mere fact that it exists shows how far legislators have come in garnering support for reproductive rights. In order for the bill to be successful, legislators must balance conservative moral ideology while still promoting progressive freedoms. Such a task is daunting. Yet, it is imperative for Filipinas to understand that they are not forsaking their faith by seeking birth control.  Filipinas&#39; pursuit for reproductive equality is similar to the struggle of many other women, and in order for reproductive freedom to become a worldwide reality, the ideology that frames progressive women as going against morality and familial duty must change.<br /><br /><font size="2">Photo Credits: Thomas Carpenter, Pitt Law &#39;11<br /><br />Sources:<br /><br />&quot;Imposing Misery: The Impact of Manila&#39;s Contraception Ban on Women and Families,&quot; </font><font size="2">The Center for Reproductive Rights, June 1, 2009.

		<title>Supreme Court&#039;s review of Chapter 11 channeling injunctions may affect auto company reorganizations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.swiggartagin.com/lawyers.php?wea"><strong>Warren E. Agin</strong></a> [Partner &amp; Co-Founder, <a href="http://www.swiggartagin.com/">Swiggart &amp; Agin</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-hears-bankruptcy-court.php">Travelers Indemnity v. Bailey</a> case addresses a difficult question faced in numerous large <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/bankruptcycourts/bankruptcybasics/chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a> cases, whether a bankruptcy court has the power to issue a channeling injunction as part of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and, if it does, how do practitioners structure effective channeling injunctions. From a practical standpoint, when a Chapter 11 debtor faces potential liability from a large number of unknown creditors, but shares that liability with third parties, the optimal solution is often a global resolution in which the debtor and third parties pool resources to create a settlement fund. The debtor then uses this settlement fund to satisfy the claims as they come in. The channeling injunction is one of the tools that makes this strategy work. It provides the third parties, such as co-defendants or insurance carriers, with protection against claimants, forcing the claimants to look toward the settlement fund. But, does a bankruptcy court have jurisdiction over the dispute between the claimants and the third-party obligors? If not, the bankruptcy court lacks the power to issue channeling injunctions as part of a plan of reorganization.<br /><br />By facilitating both reorganization and claims payment, channeling injunctions are a good thing. But, the Supreme Court now needs to decide whether they work. Certainly, in the face of one or more Chapter 11 filings by auto manufacturers the issue is timely. Automobile reorganization cases will likely rely on channeling injunctions to address a number of issues. The Supreme Court&#39;s decision will have a significant effect on the course of these cases.&quot;<br />

		<title>Japanese anthem controversy reflects broader cultural battle over nation&#039;s past</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.csun.edu/~kh246690/">Keiko Hirata</a> [Assistant Professor, <a href="http://www.csun.edu/">California State University Northridge</a>]: &quot;In March 2009, the Tokyo District Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/japan-court-rejects-suit-challenging.php">rejected a lawsuit</a> filed by Japanese teachers who had been penalized for refusing to sing Kimigayo, the Japanese national anthem, at school ceremonies. The court rejected the teachers&#39; demand that their punishment be rescinded, ruling that the 2003 directives of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government ordering public school teachers to sing Kimigayo while facing the Hinomaru national flag at school ceremonies does not violate teachers&#39; freedom of thought and conscience guaranteed under Article 19 of the <a href="http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Japan/English/english-Constitution.html">Japanese Constitution</a> and that the penalties were thus legitimate.<br /><br />Kimigayo and Hinomaru have long been controversial symbols in Japan.  For many, they represent Japan&#39;s wartime militarism and imperialism.  From this perspective, Kimigayo is especially inappropriate for today&#39;s democratic Japan as its lyrics honor the emperor&#39;s long rein.  Many Japanese teachers, especially those in the Japan Teachers&#39; Union, resent having to face Hinomaru and sing Kimigayo at school ceremonies.  But, in 1996 the education ministry instructed public schools to raise the Hinomaru flag and to sing Kimigayo at school ceremonies. Many teachers continued to rebel at recognizing the flag and anthem and, in 1999, a high school principle in Hiroshima committed suicide, reportedly due to his agony over the refusal of teachers at his school to face Hinomaru and sing Kimigayo. To avoid future incidents like this, the Japanese government shortly thereafter passed the Law of National Flag and Anthem that gave official government recognition to Hinomaru and Kimigayo.  Thus the 2003 directives by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (that were contested in the above-mentioned legal case) reflected efforts by conservatives to legitimize Hinomaru and Kimigayo in the Japanese legal system.<br /><br />The institutionalization of Hinomaru and Kimigayo is indicative of a recent tilt towards conservatism in Japan and particularly within Japanese education.  For example, the education ministry recently deleted most references to the &quot;comfort women&quot; (sex slaves for the imperial Japanese army) from Japanese history textbooks. And, in 2007, the same ministry attempted to remove references in textbooks to the role of the Japanese military in forcing mass suicides in Okinawa in 1945 (The ministry later reinstated the references due to protests in Okinawa against the attempt).  The Japanese government, under the leadership of then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, also passed the Revised Fundamental Law of Education in 2006, which requires public schools to teach their students patriotism. <br /><br />It is unclear whether the current nationalist trend will continue.  With the sudden resignation of Prime Minister Abe in 2007, the conservative movement to build an utukushii kuni (beautiful country) that cherishes an unblemished notion of the nation&#39;s culture, tradition, and history has stumbled. Also, a high profile history revisionist group, Tsukurukai (Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform), is said to have weakened due to internal conflicts and splintering.  What is clear, however, is that Japan&#39;s educational system will continue to be a site of contention over diverse interpretations of Japan&#39;s past, whether in relationship to the flag, national anthem, or curriculum.&quot;<br />

		<title>Supreme Court strikes proper note in Rivera ruling that peremptory challenges remain a state law question</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Kent Scheidegger</strong> [Legal Director and General Counsel, <a href="http://www.cjlf.org/">Criminal Justice Legal Foundation</a>]: &quot;The rule against racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges is one of the very few constitutional rules of criminal procedure that applies equally to the defense and prosecution.  See <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-372.ZO.html">Georgia v. McCollum</a>. So what happens on appeal when a trial judge denies a defense challenge of a juror under <u>McCollum</u>, but the appellate court decides the challenge was valid?<br /><br />It is well established that in the reverse situation, when a juror is discriminatorily struck who should have been seated, the error is reversible per se. No &quot;harmless error&quot; analysis is allowed. What about a juror who is not challengeable for cause and meets the legal qualifications, but whom the defense should have been allowed to strike under the state-law peremptory challenge procedure? That is the question decided in  <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-dismisses-philip-morris.php">Rivera v. Illinois</a>, announced March 31. (In the particular case, there is considerable doubt whether the trial judge actually did err, as the Illinois Supreme Court found, or was actually correct. However, the state did not press that point, and the U.S. Supreme Court did not address it.)<br /><br />Justice Ginsburg wrote the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-9995.pdf">opinion for a unanimous court</a> [PDF file]. Her answer is that the &quot;harmless error&quot; question in a case such as this is not a federal question. &quot;Just as state law controls the existence and exercise of peremptory challenges, so state law determines the consequences of an erroneous denial of such a challenge.&quot; Her opinion goes on to reject the perennial attempt to transform an error of state law into a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<br /><br />The Court has once again affirmed the principle that &quot;A defendant is entitled to a fair trial, but not a perfect one, for there are no perfect trials.&quot; See <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/411/223/case.html">Brown v. United States</a>. Michael Rivera was a hit man for a violent gang. He gunned down an innocent teenage boy whom he mistook for a member of a rival gang. He was fairly tried, and the Court&#39;s decision means he will be justly punished.&quot;<br />

The nine aggravating factors that allowed for use of capital punishment under the old law will now make a defendant eligible for the sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, or, as one expert witness characterized it - &quot;death in prison.&quot; The new sentence applies only to crimes committed on or after July 1, 2009. The Governor declined to commute the death sentences of the two men on New Mexico&#39;s death row.  <br /><br />The New Mexico Coalition to Repeal the Death Penalty had worked with Representative Gail Chasey for 11 years to get the bill passed in the state legislature.  Finally, this year, the bill passed the House by a vote of 40-28 and the Senate by a vote of 24-18. In signing the bill into law, Governor Richardson said the decisive facts for him were the irreversible nature of an execution.  &quot;If the State is going to undertake this awesome responsibility, the system to impose this ultimate penalty must be perfect and can never be wrong.  But the reality is the system is not perfect &#8212; far from it.&quot; The Governor specifically noted that many innocent people had been sentenced to death, including four in New Mexico. In his signing statement, Governor Richardson said &quot;In a society which values individual life and liberty above all else, where justice and not vengeance is the singular guiding principle of our system of criminal law, the potential for wrongful conviction and, God forbid, execution of an innocent person stands as anathema to our very sensibilities as human beings.&quot; <br /><br />The bill to repeal the death penalty was part of a package of bills that aimed to put victims&#39; families first. The other two bills in this package would have allowed murder victims&#39; families time off from work to attend judicial proceedings and would have established a Murder Victim Family Services Fund to provide much-needed services and financial assistance to the families of murder victims. Unfortunately, these bills did not pass this year. However, Representative Chasey has said she will reintroduce the bills in the future and the New Mexico Coalition to Repeal the Death Penalty will fully support the passage of these important measures. &quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Timothy Spence</strong> [Press and Communications Manager, <a href="http://www.freemedia.at/cms/ipi/">International Press Institute</a>]: &quot;North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il is no stranger to ruthlessly muzzling press freedom at home to bury the truth about natural disasters, famine, economic despair and his regime&#39;s diplomatic tussles.<br /><br />But the apparent <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/north-korea-detains-two-us-journalists.php">capture of two American journalists</a> on March 17 by North Korean border guards may be more than just a routine assault on press freedom. As in Iran, which recently arrested an American reporter on charges of trying to buy a bottle of wine, the leaders of these countries seem to be using US journalists as pawns in their own power games with Washington.<br /><br />The two journalists detained for &quot;illegally intruding&quot; into North Korea across the Chinese border have been identified as Euna Lee and Laura Ling. They were apparently preparing a report for US-based Current TV on North Koreans who are seeking refuge in China in increasing numbers. Iranian authorities arrested Roxana Saberi, a free-lancer who has worked for NPR and Britain&#39;s BBC, in February.<br /><br />Journalists are neutral observers. They know no borders when it comes to gathering information and hunting down the truth. They should not be held as hostages in larger policy disputes &#8212; in these cases, perhaps to test the new US administration&#39;s stated willingness to use diplomatic means to end North Korean and Iranian atomic ambitions.&quot;<br />

		<title>Same-sex plaintiffs&#039; challenge to DoMA&#039;s constitutionality shows contempt for democracy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=by06b02"><strong>Christopher Gacek</strong></a> [Senior Fellow, <a href="http://www.frc.org/">Family Research Council</a>]: &quot;In reaction to the possibility that Hawaiian courts would mandate same-sex marriage for that state in the mid-1990s, Congress enacted the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act </a>(DoMA).  The vote in the US Senate was 85-14; in the US House of Representatives it was 342-67.  President Bill Clinton signed DoMA into law on September 21, 1996.  FRC supported the effort to enact DoMA. <br /><br />DoMA had two objectives: 1) to define &quot;marriage&quot; and &quot;spouse&quot; traditionally in federal law and for federal programs (see <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/1/7.html">1 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect;sect; 7</a>); and 2) to affirm the power of each state to make its own decision regarding acceptance or rejection of same-sex marriages with respect to the requirements of the Full Faith and Credit Clause (see <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1738C.html">28 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect; 1738C</a>).  For our purposes, we are concerned with DoMA&#39;s definition of marriage which reads as follows:<br /><br /><blockquote>In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word &quot;marriage&quot; means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word &quot;spouse&quot; refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.</blockquote><br />This language has not been amended since 1996.<br /><br />More than seven years after the passage of DoMA, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court overturned that state&#39;s long-standing, traditional definition of marriage in <u>Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health</u>.  Same-sex marriages became legal in Massachusetts on May 17, 2004.  The plaintiffs in the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/massachusetts-same-sex-couples-file.php">current federal case</a> are or were same-sex, married Massachusetts citizens who, for various reasons, do not qualify for certain federal benefits because they are or were not married under federal law.  <em>See</em> DoMA.  As noted in their complaint (p. 90), the plaintiffs seek to &quot;enjoin the defendants [U.S. agencies] from continuing to discriminate against the plaintiffs by treating them differently from similarly situated individuals who are married to persons of the opposite sex.&quot;<br /><br />The real question before us is whether the plaintiffs can find <em>federal</em> jurists who will overturn a perfectly sensible and clearly-written federal marriage statute in the same way this was accomplished in Massachusetts.  DoMA defined marriage in the manner it has been known in Western Civilization for thousands of years and which comports with obvious biological realities.  It is not remotely irrational or malicious.  Congress was acting reasonably when it enacted DoMA thereby providing a uniform marital definition for its numerous statutes and programs.  If <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/1/7.html">1 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect; 7</a> is overturned there will be several readily recognizable effects.<br /><br />First, the moral authority of the Courts in the United States will be further damaged.  Maintaining the rule of law and a republican form of government rests on the participants respecting our laws and the Constitution.  The sort of social-judicial engineering that would be required to obtain the outcome the plaintiffs seek demands nothing less than the exercise of raw judicial power.  If some of our fellow citizens wish to change the federal definition of marriage, they can accomplish this through our elected representatives in Congress.  To do otherwise shows little more than contempt for representative self-government and its expression in legislative majority rule.  <br /><br />Second, it is hard to imagine how declaring <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/1/7.html">1 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect; 7</a> unconstitutionally discriminatory would not lead eventually to the second part of DoMA being struck down.  Consequently, a victory by the plaintiffs would jeopardize the statutes and constitutional amendments of the forty-plus states that have rejected the recognition of foreign same-sex marriages.<br /><br />Third, assuming <em>arguendo</em> that state traditional marriage definitions can withstand constitutional scrutiny after a victory by these plaintiffs, a complex and unpredictable interaction between federal and state law may develop especially in mixed federal-state programs (<em>e.g</em>., those state programs that rely on some federal funding and which are subject to federal rules and guidelines).  Much would depend on how the federal courts invalidated DoMA.  What would the federal layering effect be on state marriage laws and policies?  A great deal of lengthy and expensive litigation would be bound to follow as these complex problems are sorted out.<br /><br />For these and other reasons we should all hope that the federal court in Massachusetts acts with proper restraint and dismisses these claims.&quot;<br />

		<title>Supreme Court should have reconsidered entire issue of involuntary union dues extraction in Ysursa ruling</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://community.pacificlegal.org/Document.Doc?id=34">Timothy Sandefur</a></strong> [Senior Staff Attorney, <a href="http://community.pacificlegal.org/Page.aspx?pid=183">Pacific Legal Foundation</a>]: &quot;Thirty years ago, in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/431/209/case.html">Abood v. Detroit Board of Education</a>, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution is not offended by state laws that take money directly from workers&#39; paychecks to subsidize the activities of unions. This is even true when the subsidies are taken from workers who have chosen not to join the union. The theory here is that non-members benefit from union activities, and if they did not pay for them, they would be &quot;free riders,&quot; unfairly obtaining benefits that union members paid for. The problem with this is that this theory would allow any organization to extract coerced subsidies on the theory that people benefit in some indirect way from their activities. And the free rider theory simply does not overcome the moral objection to forcing people to pay for services they did not ask for and may not want. Of course, unions could avoid the free rider problem by writing contracts that only cover their own members, but this would require them to compete with non-union labor.<br /><br />The Supreme Court has, however, drawn an important line in the coerced union fees cases: unions may not force non-members to subsidize political messages with which they disagree. Unfortunately, this line, while clear, is also easy to evade. Unions have often refused to disclose how much money they spend on political activities, which enables them to deduct most of the usual dues amount from workers&#39; paychecks even when they have chosen not to join the union.<br /><br />More importantly, unions often adopt unnecessarily complicated procedures that force workers to demand refunds of the portion of their money taken for political activities. These procedures can be so time-consuming and complicated, and the amount of money at stake so small, that workers often just give up rather than spend the time and incur the workplace hostility that goes with opposing the union. Two years ago, in the case of <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/551/05 1589/index.html"><span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/supreme/slip/551/05-1589/opinion.pdf">Davenport v. Washington Education Association</a></span></a> [PDF file], unions even argued that requiring them to ask permission before taking money from dissenting workers violated the union&#39;s free speech rights! The Supreme Court disagreed, rightly holding that the First Amendment does not give unions the right to money earned by others.<br /><br />In <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-869">Ysursa v. Pocatello Board of Education</a>, decided on February 24, the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/supreme-court-decides-gun-possession.php">Supreme Court reiterated</a> that point: unions have no First Amendment right to deduct money directly from the paychecks of workers. And yet the Court&#39;s decision also overlooks some important points that weaken its effectiveness in securing individual rights.<br /><br />In that case, the state of Idaho had passed a law that prohibited both public and private sector employers from withholding money from workers&#39; paychecks to support political activities, even if the worker <span style="font-style:italic;">wanted</span> the employer to make those deductions. In theory, this law prohibited deductions from going to any political activities, whether by a union or by the Republican party or by anyone else, but since unions are the only organizations that really employ these programs, it was clear that the law was aimed principally at unions. What&#39;s more, the state ended up conceding that it was unconstitutional to forbid <span style="font-style:italic;">private</span> sector employers from making these deductions. The question therefore was whether the state could forbid public sector employers - that is, city and county governments - from deducting money from paychecks to support political causes that everyone knows are primarily oriented around unions. Public employees could ask employers to withhold money to support charities like the United Way, but could not ask employers to withhold money to support a political organization.<br /><br />The union viewed this case as a kind of discrimination: although other institutions were allowed to participate in paycheck-deduction programs, union political activities were singled out and disallowed. This, the unions argued, violated the First Amendment. But to the state, on the other hand, this was simply a management decision by the state about how cities may organize the workplace, and it had nothing to do with the First Amendment.<br /><br />The Supreme Court decided, 7-2, in favor of the state. Opening the decision with a clear statement, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, &quot;The First Amendment prohibits government from &#39;abridging the freedom of speech;&#39; it does not confer an affirmative right to use government payroll mechanisms for the purpose of obtaining funds for expression.&quot; The Idaho law didn&#39;t restrict speech, it merely chose not to fund speech. And although the government does in some cases have to accommodate free speech by private individuals or groups, &quot;it is not required to assist others in funding the expression of particular ideas.&quot;<br /><br />While this is a gratifying acknowledgment, there are two problems with it. First, it does not really go far enough to make a significant difference in the lives of workers whose money is taken against their will to support labor unions. For decades now the Court has been reiterating that the First Amendment does not entitle unions to extract money from workers&#39; paychecks for political activities. But because unions are able to take money for other activities, and because they are not very scrupulous about reporting their expenses, unions can avoid this prohibition in practice. What&#39;s more, given that the Court still does not require that unions ask permission first, unions can still force dissenting workers to seek refunds - a procedure that effectively silences most dissent.<br /><br />Second, the Court&#39;s First Amendment reference doesn&#39;t really resolve the <u>Ysursa</u> case itself. This case is not a simple one of the state choosing not to subsidize speech - it&#39;s a case in which the state forbids workers who <span style="font-style:italic;">wish</span> to subsidize and <span style="font-style:italic;">choose</span> to subsidize speech <span style="font-style:italic;">in this way</span> from doing so, even though the state allows workers to subsidize other organizations, such as charities. As Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in his dissenting opinion, if the state&#39;s goal was to avoid the appearance of favoring one political side over another, then it should not at the same time allow workers to choose paycheck deductions to support charitable activities, which often are politically oriented also. &quot;Such deductions will often present a similar risk of creating an appearance of political involvement as deductions for covered political activities.&quot; This and other factors made it clear to Justice Stevens that the challenged law was &quot;not a limitation on a state-law entitlement that specifically benefits unions, but rather a union-specific exclusion from a generally available benefit.&quot; Indeed, other factors indicated that the statute was an attempt to target union political activity: the law was originally applicable to private employers also, which undermined the state&#39;s argument that the law was designed to ensure that the government maintained an image of political neutrality. And the statute appeared in the state&#39;s labor code, and included other provisions dealing specifically with unions. But there was a problem with Justice Stevens&#39; dissent, as Justice David Souter pointed out: the union had basically waived this viewpoint neutrality argument. Justice Souter believed the case should simply have been dismissed as improvidently granted.<br /><br />Although he said it in a different context, Justice Souter&#39;s opinion contained one line that very effectively summed up the problem with the <u>Ysursa</u> case: &quot;A decision that ignores the elephant in the room,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is a decision with diminished authority.&quot; That&#39;s surely true. But the elephant in the room in these cases is the fact that unions use paycheck deduction programs to force dissenting workers to subsidize their activities, political or not, without asking permission. Workers who disagree with the union or don&#39;t want to support it, are subject to delay, obstruction, harassment and intimidation when they try to assert their rights. Most dissenting workers simply give in and allow the union to take their money rather than make waves and incur hostility in the workplace. And this situation is made possible entirely by the intertwinement of government and labor unions - an intertwinement that is unjust and unconstitutional.<br /><br />The Supreme Court ought to reexamine the precedent that allows unions to extract money directly from workers without asking permission. There is already good reason for requiring unions to ask first. Many due process cases have made it clear that government may not take away a person&#39;s property without giving that person a hearing first, whenever possible. And the court has repeatedly said that it will not presume that an individual intends to waive a fundamental constitutional right without some explicit decision to do so. Moreover, legal history since the <u>Abood</u> decision has made clear how much unions abuse this power for their own ends. The real issue is not whether the Constitution <span style="font-style:italic;">entitles</span> unions to take money directly from workers and the real question is whether the Constitution <span style="font-style:italic;">allows</span> this procedure. That&#39;s the real elephant in the room. That power has made labor unions the leading exploiters of workers in the American economy today - not counting government itself. And until the Supreme Court finds that the Constitution forbids them from seizing workers&#39; money without permission, cases like <u>Ysursa</u> are going to continue to be a problem.<br /><br />The Court should separate unions and government, and forbid union leaders or business managers to enrich themselves through government intervention. Unions, like every other business or community organization, ought to be subjected to the fair and beneficial process of competition and voluntary consent. That alone can secure the rights of individuals and ensure that neither side in the debate between unions and management is subsidizing its expression at the expense of the opposition.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Alim Seytoff</strong> [General Secretary, <a href="http://www.uyghuramerican.org/">Uyghur American Association</a>]: &quot;If the United States chooses to <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/uighur-guantanamo-detainees-may-be.php">accept the Uyghur detainees</a> and resettle them in the US, the only thing China can do is to loudly protest such a decision by the Obama Administration. China will use its state-controlled media to attack the US, claiming that &quot;the U.S. is maintaining a double-standard in the global war against terror&quot; - a claim which is really nonsense. The Chinese Foreign Minister may also call in the US Ambassador to China and express China&#39;s strong disappointment over this decision and ask for an official explanation (the US Ambassador should not be too concerned with such a protest). That is pretty much all China can do. The Chinese outcry may last for a few weeks, then it will gradually fade away.<br /><br />When the United States transferred five Uyghur detainees to Albania in May 2006, China loudly protested the decision and later sent a delegation to Tirana to pressure the Albanian government. The Chinese delegation may have threatened the Albanian government with retaliation, but in the end, China was able to do nothing. The five Uyghurs continued to live in Albania even after Chinese threats. One of them later went to Sweden and sought asylum. Others are still living there in peace.<br /><br />The key reason why the Chinese government is aggressively lobbying and threatening mostly Western governments from taking these Uyghur detainees is it fears that, in addition to the US government, freedom-loving people in Western democracies will find out that these Uyghur detainees are not terrorists as the Chinese government has always been claiming, but ordinary peaceful people who were severely persecuted by the Chinese government. As a result, people in the West will become more aware of the detainees tragic situation, as well as the plight of the Uyghur people under China&#39;s authoritarian rule. Knowledge of both of these situations will bring about the realization that the Uyghur situation is almost exactly the same as the situation in Tibet. Then, the Chinese government&#39;s argument that it is fighting against terrorism from so-called East Turkestan forces will simply collapse.<br /><br />Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, the Chinese government has been presenting itself to the world as a victim of Uyghur terrorism. However, the release of Uyghur detainees into the Western world will prove that the real victims of 9/11 in China are the Uyghurs, and the Chinese government is actually the brutal evildoer. This may most likely shift Western public opinion in favor of Uyghurs&#39; peaceful struggle for their human rights, just as in the Tibetan struggle. This is the last thing the Chinese government wants to see happen. That is why it is vehemently opposing any Western government, especially the US government, that considers accepting these Uyghur detainees. In short, the Chinese government&#39;s ugly face of six decades of systematic, severe and widespread human rights violations against the Uyghur people will be exposed to the whole Western world, despite Chinese leaders&#39; best efforts to project an image of benevolence and good governance.&quot;<br />

		<title>Obama Administration signals more limited use of presidential signing statements</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Daniel Schuman</strong> [Director of Communications and Counsel, <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">The Constitution Project</a>]: &quot;On March 11, 2009, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/obama-proposes-limits-on-presidential.php">President Obama issued</a> his first <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Statement-from-the-President-on-the-signing-of-HR-1105/">presidential signing statement</a> - a formal expression of his views regarding legislation that he has just signed into law - identifying five areas in an omnibus appropriations act that he will decline to enforce because of &quot;well-founded constitutional objections.&quot; How similar is President Obama&#39;s view of his constitutional role to that of his predecessor?<br /><br />Presidents have used <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/Signing_Statements_Memo_from_Covington_&_Burling.pdf">signing statements</a> [PDF file] throughout American history to thank supporters, provide reasons for signing a bill, or to express satisfaction or displeasure with legislation passed by Congress. In recent years, presidents have used signing statements in an (unsuccessful) attempt to influence how courts interpret legislation by declaring their views on the intent, purpose, and scope of the legislation. However, only infrequently have presidents challenged or denied effect to legislation they consider unconstitutional. Prior to 2001, presidents issued statements containing 575 constitutional objections to legislation; President George W. Bush <a href="http://www.acslaw.org/files/Signing Statement Chart - Neil Kinkopf and Peter Shane.pdf">issued more than 1,000</a>, [PDF file] often with only perfunctory or vague justifications, and frequently based upon a broad assertion of the &quot;unitary executive&quot; theory. <br /><br />The Constitution Project&#39;s Liberty and Security Committee issued a &quot;<a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/Statement_on_Presidential_Signing_Statement.pdf">Statement on Presidential Signing Statements</a>&quot; [PDF file] that explained the separation of powers issue at stake. &quot;By signing a particular bill into law, but then issuing a signing statement that declares that he will not give effect to it, or to a provision of it, the President is effectively vetoing the law without affording Congress the opportunity to override the veto, as the Constitution requires.&quot; Thus, the president is asserting the unilateral power to repeal and amend legislation, and is displacing the judiciary as the final expositor of the Constitution.<br /><br />President Obama has not claimed &quot;unitary executive&quot; powers as did President Bush, and on March 9, President Obama promulgated his own <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Memorandum-on-Presidential-Signing-Statements/">policy</a> on presidential signing statements. President Obama directed all executive branch departments and agencies to &quot;seek the advice of the Attorney General before relying on signing statements issued prior to the date of this memorandum as the basis for disregarding, or otherwise refusing to comply with, any provision of a statute.&quot;  <br /><br />He also announced that he would continue to use signing statements, but in a seemingly more limited fashion, addressing &quot;constitutional concerns only when it is appropriate to do so as a means of discharging my constitutional responsibilities.&quot; He went on to say that &quot;[signing statements] serve a legitimate function in our system, at least when based on well-founded constitutional objections. In appropriately limited circumstances, they represent an exercise of the President&#39;s constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and they promote a healthy dialogue between the executive branch and the Congress.&quot;<br /><br />In narrowing the occasions upon which he would seek to exercise this claimed power, President Obama declared his intention to follow four principles, as summarized below:<br /><br />1. Inform the Congress of the administration&#39;s constitutional concerns about pending legislation.<br /><br />2. Construe legislation passed by Congress as presumptively constitutional, and only use &quot;well-founded&quot; methods of constitutional interpretation as the basis for finding that legislation is not constitutional.<br /><br />3. Provide enough specificity to make clear the nature and basis of any constitutional objection asserted.<br /><br />4. Construe a statutory provision in a manner that avoids a constitutional problem only if that construction is a legitimate one.<br /><br />While not condemning all signing statements, the Constitution Project called upon Congress in 2006 to &quot;make unmistakably clear the link between a President&#39;s <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/Statement_on_Presidential_Signing_Statement.pdf">inappropriate use of signing statements</a> [PDF file] and the costs of doing so.&quot; The American Bar Association, also in 2006, took an even <a href="http://www.abanet.org/op/signingstatements/aba_final_signing_statements_recommendation-report_7-24-06.pdf">narrower view</a> [PDF file], recommending that &quot;the President...confine any signing statements to his views regarding the meaning, purpose and significance of bills presented by Congress, and if he believes that all or part of a bill is unconstitutional, to veto the bill in accordance with Article I, &Acirc;&sect; 7 of the Constitution of the United States, which directs him to approve or disapprove each bill in its entirety.&quot;<br /><br />The Constitution Project welcomes President Obama&#39;s willingness to be more transparent and to limit the occasions when he will use signing statements. However, while not explicitly saying so, he left open the possibility that he may, in some circumstances, continue the practice of using signing statements to indicate that he will not enforce duly-enacted laws because of his constitutional objections, rather than vetoing a bill and providing Congress with the opportunity to amend the legislation or override the veto. <br /><br />To allow the president to choose which laws to apply undermines our Constitution and the freedoms that depend upon it. In the <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/Mickey_Edwards_Judiciary_Testimony_House_Judiciary_Committee_January_31_20071.pdf">words</a> [PDF file] of former Representative Mickey Edwards (R-OK), &quot;Presidential signing statements may not sound like such a big deal, but they are declarations of the right of a President to be above the law, and that is a path that, once taken, will prove ultimately fatal to our democracy.&quot;<br />

		<title>Fifth Circuit gives overly narrow reading to church-state precedent in &#034;moment of silence&#034; case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Alex Luchenitser</strong> [Senior Litigation Counsel, <a href="http://www.au.org/site/PageServer">Americans United for Separation of Church and State</a>]: &quot;Last week, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/fifth-circuit-rules-texas-school-moment.php">upheld an amendment</a> to a Texas law that provides for a moment of silence in the public schools.  The amendment changed the law by enumerating &quot;pray&quot; as one of the activities that students could engage in during the moment of silence.<br /><br />The Fifth Circuit&#39;s ruling is troubling because of the narrow reading it gives to Supreme Court church-state precedents.  The Supreme Court has held that government conduct is unconstitutional if its primary purpose is to advance religion.  The principle issue in the case was whether the amendment to the Texas law satisfied this test.<br /><br />The Fifth Circuit decided that the purpose of the whole amendment was what mattered, not the purpose of the enumeration of &quot;pray&quot; as a moment-of-silence activity.  The amendment made a number of other changes, including requiring students to recite the pledges of allegiance to the US and Texas flags, and making the moment-of-silence mandatory instead of optional.<br /><br />Relying on those changes, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the amendment&#39;s primary purposes were legitimate and secular: fostering patriotism, and providing a period for thoughtful contemplation.  But those changes were not related to the addition of &quot;pray,&quot; and those purposes do not explain why the legislature specifically chose to enumerate &quot;pray.&quot;<br /><br />Rather, there was considerable evidence in the legislative history that &quot;pray&quot; was added in order to promote prayer in schools.  Indeed, another Texas statute had already given students a right to pray during the moment of silence, so the enumeration of &quot;pray&quot; in the amendment was quite unnecessary.  But the Fifth Circuit was not persuaded by these facts, concluding that the Texas legislature&#39;s action was unconstitutional only if a religious purpose &quot;permeated&quot; the entire amendment.<br /><br />It is easy to see how the Fifth Circuit&#39;s view of the law could eviscerate the constitutional requirement that legislatures not act with a religious purpose.  In order to get away with passing a law that has a religious objective, all legislatures will need to do is include other provisions in the same legislation that have a non-religious purpose.&quot;<br />

		<title>Overzealous Campaign Disclosure Laws Can Stifle Debate and Endanger Private Citizens</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Erik Stanley</strong> [Senior Legal Counsel, <a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/main/default.aspx">Alliance Defense Fund</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-hears-campaign-finance.php">Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission</a> case is pending for decision before the US Supreme Court, and the case raises some serious constitutional questions.  ADF filed a <a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/UserDocs/CitizensUnitedAmicus.pdf">friend-of-the-court brief</a> focusing on one specific - and highly important - portion of the case.<br /><br />The primary issue in the case is whether a film, <em>Hillary: The Movie</em>, is an &quot;electioneering communication&quot; in violation of the <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pages/bcra/bcra_update.shtml">Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act</a> (BCRA).  A subsidiary issue in the case is related to section 201 of the BCRA.  That section requires any corporation that expends more than $10,000 on an &quot;electioneering communication&quot; to report those expenditures to the FEC and to disclose the identities of donors who contributed more than $1,000.  ADF argues in its brief that the reporting and disclosure requirements of section 201 are unconstitutional.  And the reason is not what those who believe in &quot;vast, right-wing conspiracies&quot; might think.<br /><br />ADF has been intimately involved in the ongoing battle to protect marriage in California.  As a part of that battle, ADF witnessed the destructive impact of overzealous disclosure laws.  During the 2008 election cycle, California voters approved Proposition 8 protecting marriage as the union of one man and one woman.  California&#39;s election laws require a proposition campaign committee to report and disclose the identity of any donor who contributed more than $100 to a proposition campaign.  Opponents of the campaign took great advantage of this, and after voters approved Proposition 8, a backlash ensued against those who supported the campaign.<br /><br />As the ADF brief filed in the <u>Citizens United</u> case explains, &quot;Supporters of Proposition 8 have been subjected to threatening and harassing phone calls, e-mails, and postcards.  Some of the phone calls and e-mails have been accompanied by death threats.&quot;  The brief quoted one such e-mail, sent to a church, that stated, &quot;Consider yourself lucky.  If I had a gun I would have gunned you down along with each and every other supporter....I&#39;ve also got a little surprise for Pasor [sic] Franklin and his congregation of lowlife&#39;s [sic] in the coming future....He will be meeting his maker sooner than expected....If you thought 9/11 was bad, you haven&#39;t seen anything yet.&quot;<br /><br />Beyond e-mails and death threats, churches received envelopes containing a suspicious white, powdery substance; individuals who contributed a small amount in support of Proposition 8 were forced to resign from their jobs; businesses were targeted for harassment and picketing; churches have been vandalized, spray-painted with epithets such as &quot;PROP H8TE&quot;; and one group conducting a prayer walk was physically assaulted.  All of these individuals gave very small amounts to support Proposition 8 but nonetheless have been subjected to retaliation and violent censorship.  Perhaps most worrisome to Proposition 8 supporters is a Web site that contains a Google map pinpointing their homes.<br /><br />The ADF brief points out that electoral discourse cannot occur under such conditions.  Compelled disclosure laws such as California&#39;s and section 201 of the BCRA stifle debate, censor electoral discourse, and do not accomplish any important governmental interest.  Indeed, some of the supporters of Proposition 8 have testified in court that they will likely not support another ballot initiative in the future if their names will be disclosed to the public.  In its brief, ADF urges the court to take into account these recent acts as a result of compelled disclosure laws like section 201 and requests that the court find section 201 unconstitutional.  Electoral discourse should be robust and free and not stifled and censored by such laws.&quot;<br />

Eickemeyer</a> [Shareholder, <a href="http://www.vedderprice.com/">Vedder Price P.C.</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/sec-charges-madoff-accountant-with.php">indictment</a> if Mr. Friehling is hardly unexpected, as is the accompanying civil action by the SEC. The conduct alleged in the complaint certainly goes beyond poor auditing - in essence, Mr. Friehling is alleged to have done virtually no auditing at all. Mr. Friehling also allegedly issued independent auditor&#39;s reports on Madoff&#39;s investment company while not being independent and while telling the <a href="http://www.aicpa.org/">American Institute of Certified Public Accountants</a> (AICPA) that he did not perform audits. It is hard to imagine a set of facts better suited for a criminal prosecution against an accountant.<br /><br />Mr. Friehling&#39;s case may be unique given his long history with Madoff and his ability - if he was truly doing audits - to gain access to the internal workings of Madoff&#39;s company. However, other auditors may face civil liability based on their audits of funds or other entities who invested client moneys with Madoff. Some suits have already been filed alleging that auditors should not have readily accepted brokerage statements from Madoff&#39;s company on their face and should have investigated further to discover whether Madoff was really investing money in the ways he claimed.<br /><br />While few accountants are likely to face prosecution as Mr. Friehling does, widespread acceptance of the theories of liability already asserted against auditors in the Madoff-related civil suits, and against accountants who recommended investments with Madoff to their clients, could have a devastating impact on the accounting profession.&quot;<br />

A German rampager killed 16, an Alabama man killed 10 people, a man killed five people at a birthday party in Miami, in the North of Ireland three people have been killed and many more wounded in a new wave of political violence, and in Mexico the war between heavily armed drug gangs and police and security forces grinds on.<br /> <br />What is to be done? In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/germany-chancellor-urges-stricter-gun.php">calling for stricter enforcement of a set of gun control laws</a> already deemed some of the strongest in the world. This should serve as a wakeup call to policy makers in the United States where gun control laws are a patchwork of strict to lax. Depending on the state, a would-be gun-buyer can trade cash for guns over a card table at a flea market, or be subjected to a background check, a seven-day waiting period, and a one-gun-a-month policy. Savvy gun buyers exploit the differences in state laws, forge documents, set up straw purchasers and circumvent the law in countless other creative and malicious ways. There are so many guns being bought this way, that the Mexican ambassador to the United States <a href="http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/daily/all_headlines/112331.php">estimates</a> that 2,000 &quot;Made in the USA&quot; guns cross the border every day. <br /> <br />Stronger, more uniform laws that are strictly enforced will shrink the loopholes through which angry people walk to grab guns and make mayhem.<br /><br />The &quot;<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmentii">right to bear arms</a>&quot; is protected by our Constitution but it cannot be interpreted as the right buy an assault rifle to mow people down in a mega-church parking lot. Allowing the Pastor to pack heat is not an adequate response.  <br /> <br />President Barack Obama has his hands full with the economy, the budget and foreign policy flare-ups from Pakistan to Madagascar, but we live in a country where 30,000 Americans are killed and another 70,000 are wounded every year by gun violence, where rampages like the ones that took ten lives in Alabama or five in Miami are commonplace and we are in critical need of leadership on this issue.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.ij.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=608&Itemid=165">Steve Simpson</a></strong> [Senior Attorney, <a href="http://www.ij.org/">Institute for Justice</a>]: &quot;In the case of <u>Citizens United v. FEC</u>, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-hears-campaign-finance.php">confronted the inescapable logic</a> of the campaign finance laws: if the government can ban a broadcast advertisement that is paid for by a corporation, then it can ban movies and even books as well. In fact, during the argument, Justice Samuel Alito asked the government whether the ban on corporate funding of advertisements would logically apply to a book that called for the election or defeat of a politician, and the government said that it would.<br /><br />When the government is taking the position that it can ban books because they are financed by corporations, it is time to scrap the campaign finance laws. This is America. We don&#39;t ban books here.<br /><br />The government argued it is not actually banning advertisements or movies or books, but is only preventing corporations from paying for them with corporate treasury funds. But saying a corporation can&#39;t spend &quot;treasury funds&quot; on speech is like saying you can&#39;t spend money from your bank account on speech. It is a distinction without a difference. The fact is, it takes money - sometimes even corporate money - to get speech heard. If the government can regulate the manner in which we make our speech effective, it can prevent us from speaking.<br /><br />The Court also briefly addressed the disclosure laws that would require those who financed the creation of &quot;Hillary: The Movie&quot; to disclose their names and addresses on a government website. The government&#39;s position is that donors should be able to maintain their privacy only if they can show evidence of past harassment. But, as Justice Roberts pointed out, by the time a speaker can show harassment, the harm has already been done.<br /><br />Disclosure laws destroy the right to privacy and anonymity and often lead to harassment of those who choose to join with others, rather than to speak out on their own. If we take the rights of association and privacy seriously, then the burden should be on the government to show that disclosure is necessary to prevent harm.&quot;<br /><br /><em>The Institute for Justice filed an <a href="http://www.ij.org/images/pdf_folder/amicus_briefs/08-205tsacinstituteforjustice.pdf">amicus brief</a> on behalf of Citizens United.</em><br />

		<title>Obama Administration&#039;s detention authority must incorporate law of non-international armed conflict</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/rona_g.aspx"><strong>Gabor Rona</strong></a> [International Legal Director, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.aspx">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;Last Friday, the Obama administration for the first time articulated in court <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/obama-doj-drops-enemy-combatant.php">its vision of authority</a> to detain persons who are now being held at Guantanamo.  The government&#39;s brief in the <u>In Re: Guantanamo Bay Detainee</u> Litigation case in the District Court of the District of Columbia notes that this is only about Guantanamo - that detention policy going forward is the subject of a distinct process pursuant to an executive order of January 22, 2009. But the brief has significance beyond Guantanamo since it sets out a general view of detention authority for all persons suspected of association with the 9/11 plot, the Taliban or al Qaeda. There is much to be disappointed about for those who had the audacity to hope for a sea change from Bush administration policies. But before launching into criticism of the brief, let&#39;s take a look at what it has changed:<br /> <br />1. <u>Bush view</u>: The president, as Commander-in-Chief, has absolute and unfettered power to determine who may be detained, with or without criminal charge, trial or judicial review (The Supreme Court in 2008 clipped the wings of the Bush administration on this claim in the <u>Boumediene</u> case, which applies the constitutional right of habeas corpus review to Guantanamo detainees). The Bush administration also claimed authority to detain under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (&quot;AUMF&quot;), <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS22357.pdf">Pub. L. 107-40, 115 Stat. 224 </a>(2001) [PDF file].<br /> <br />1. <u>Obama view</u>: The president&#39;s detention authority is conferred by Congress, in this case, per the AUMF.<br /> <br /> <br />2. <u>Bush view</u>: The president has the authority to detain persons that the president determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, and persons who harbored those responsible for those attacks.  The president also has the authority to detain persons who were part of, or <em>supported</em>, Taliban or al-Qaida forces or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act, or has directly supported hostilities, in aid of such enemy armed forces.<br /> <br />2. <u>Obama view</u>:  The president has the authority to detain persons that the president determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, and persons who harbored those responsible for those attacks.  The President has the authority to detain persons who were part of, or <em>substantially supported</em>, Taliban or al-Qaida forces or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act, or has directly supported hostilities, in aid of such enemy armed forces.<br /> <br />(Hint to save you eye strain: the word &quot;substantially&quot; does not appear in the Bush view).<br /> <br /> <br />3. <u>Bush view</u>: The detainees are &quot;enemy combatants&quot; in a &quot;global war on terror.&quot;<br /> <br />3. <u>Obama view</u>: The term enemy combatant is being retired. Apparently, so is the term &quot;war on terror.&quot;<br /> <br /> <br />4. <u>Bush view</u>: &quot;We&#39;re right and will not budge.&quot;<br /> <br />4. <u>Obama view</u>: &quot;We may yet further modify our position.&quot;<br /> <br /><br />Also, let&#39;s not neglect what significant changes in detainee policy have been percolating since Inauguration Day 2009:<br /> <br />1. Guantanamo will close.<br /> <br />2. Military commission trials have been suspended and may or may not resume in a pre-existing or different form.<br /> <br />3. Bush administration visions of unfettered executive authority to determine how detainees will be treated/interrogated (and definitions of torture that exclude torture) have been rendered inoperative by an Obama executive order (although both Congress, in the <a href="http://www.milnet.com/House/HR-6166-Military%20Commisions%20Act%20of%202006/Detainee%20Treatment%20Act%20of%202005.html">Detainee Treatment Act</a> and the Supreme Court, through the <u>Hamdan</u> decision, have also previously weighed in against the Bush administration on these issues).<br /> <br />4. No more &quot;black sites&quot; or secret detention. All detainees will henceforth be entitled to, and places of detention will be subject to, visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross.<br /> <br />5. The Obama administration has agreed to vacate an awful, fractured 4th Circuit decision in the <u>al-Marri</u> case that supported the Bush administration&#39;s view of authority to indefinitely detain as an &quot;enemy combatant,&quot; without charge or trial, a legal resident in the US who was never alleged to have directly participated in hostilities against the United States. (But the Obama administration has not renounced the power to detain such persons without charge under the AUMF).<br /> <br />In its brief filed Friday, the new administration hews closely to its predecessor&#39;s erroneous views on the scope and sources of detention authority; albeit with somewhat more sophisticated arguments than those we&#39;ve heard before. For example, the brief cites <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/542/507/case.html">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a> for the proposition that detention authority is &quot;informed by principles of the laws of war.&quot; The <u>Hamdi</u> court did address whether a person captured on a battlefield can be detained under the laws of war.  Hamdi, however, was captured in an international armed conflict between two states - the US and Afghanistan - a type of conflict for which the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions explicitly provide detention authority. It is true that the international phase of the conflict was over by the time Hamdi was decided, suggesting that the court meant to apply the laws of non-international armed conflict to Hamdi&#39;s detention. But the court never addressed the international/non-international armed conflict distinction, despite the fact that the Geneva Conventions articulate detention authority only for international armed conflict.  There is, in fact, no such authority in the laws of war that apply in conflicts between a state and a non-state armed group (namely in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/us/AP-Guantanamo-Geneva-Conventions.html">Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions</a> and their <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/d67c3971bcff1c10c125641e0052b545">Additional Protocol II</a>) even if that armed group is of transnational scope. <br /> <br />The reason for this distinction is sound. In state-to-state armed conflict, combatants have a privilege of belligerency, meaning they cannot be prosecuted under domestic criminal law for mere participation in hostilities, so their detention must be governed by other law, namely the international law of international armed conflict. Non-state fighters, however, are the hallmark of non-international armed conflict and they have no privilege of belligerency. They are mere criminals under applicable domestic law and so, there is no need for the laws of war to supply detention authority in such conflicts. If they are to be detained, whether or not for criminal trial, it must be pursuant to domestic law.<br /> <br />So now we see why the administration offered only that detention authority is &quot;<em>informed</em> by principles of the laws of war&quot; and could not say that it was &quot;<em>provided</em> by the laws of war.&quot; It then went on to suggest that the laws of war applicable to &quot;our current, novel type of armed conflict against armed groups such as al-Qaida and the Taliban&quot; are &quot;less-well codified&quot; than the rules of international armed conflict. Not so oddly, given its intention to manufacture detention authority from a branch of law in which it does not exist, the brief does not dare mention this type of armed conflict by name: non-international armed conflict. Likewise, the brief does not admit that detention authority in such conflicts derives from domestic law. Instead, and probably because the AUMF is silent on the matter of detention, the brief claims that &quot;(p)rinciples derived from law-of-war rules governing international armed conflicts, therefore, must inform the interpretation of the detention authority Congress has authorized for the current armed conflict.&quot; This is wrong. There is no need to analogize from international armed conflict rules to get to detention authority in non-international armed conflict. Rather, it is necessary to look to domestic law.<br /> <br />The claim that non-international armed conflict detention authority must be grounded in domestic law, rather than be presumed to exist as per international law, is not a mere technical distinction without a difference. The principle of legality and prohibition of arbitrary detention are reflected in the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, to which the US is a party.  Article 9.1 says &quot;(n)o one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.&quot; The grounds and procedures for detention are well established in the law of international armed conflict and are absent from the law of non-international armed conflict. Therefore, compliance with Article 9.1 requires that those grounds and procedures be established in domestic law.<br /> <br />The brief notes that &quot;(p)etitioners have sought to restrict the United States&#39; authority to detain armed groups by urging that all such forces must be treated as civilians, and that, as a consequence, the United States can detain only those &#39;directly participating in hostilities.&#39;&quot;  The government is correct that this argument should be rejected since &quot;direct participation&quot; determines who may be targeted, not who may be detained and because &quot;law-of-war principles do not limit the United States&#39; detention authority to this limited category of individuals.&quot; Indeed, in international armed conflict, the Geneva Conventions explicitly provide detention authority over civilians who constitute a serious security threat, but may not have participated in hostilities. By making this argument, petitioners have provided the government with an easy target. But just because the petitioners are wrong, it doesn&#39;t mean the government is right to suggest that detention authority in non-international armed conflict should be presumed by analogy to international armed conflict rules.<br /> <br />President Obama recently said that henceforth, US detention policies and practices will be consistent with our international legal obligations. Our courts are obligated to require no less. The District Court of the District of Columbia should reject the government&#39;s recently stated vision of detention authority. Good law is also good policy. And they would both be served with the following framework for detention policy going forward:<br /> <br />1. For persons detained from within or brought to the US, it is difficult to imagine that anyone who fits the Obama administration&#39;s criteria for detention without charge or trial (virtually identical to the Bush administration&#39;s definition of enemy combatant) cannot be convicted of material support for terrorism, at the least.  Those who can be prosecuted should be prosecuted in the normal course of the American federal criminal justice system. Those who will not be prosecuted should be repatriated or released to a third country, where they may or may not be subject to further proceedings, with the caveat that they not be transferred to any country where they face a substantial risk of torture or abuse. Yes, there may be a few individuals falling through the cracks because the material support law did not have extraterritorial reach at the time of their detention (it does now), and there are no other crimes with which to charge them either because there is no evidence to support additional charges, or the evidence is tainted because it was obtained through coercion. First, we don&#39;t know that anyone fitting that description exists. Second, if someone does fall into that category, is that reason to construct an entirely new architecture of questionable legality?<br /> <br />2. Persons detained abroad in either non-international armed conflict or non-armed conflict circumstances are subject to, and entitled to the protections of, that country&#39;s domestic laws. For instance, Afghanistan has been the site of a non-international armed conflict since 2002, when the Karzai government came into power. The US may, as a proxy for the Afghan government, detain people there only pursuant to Afghan law which meets international human rights law standards. To do otherwise is to violate its own international human rights treaty obligations. <br /> <br />3. Persons detained in international armed conflict at home or abroad may be detained under the authority of the 3d and 4th Geneva Conventions.<br /> <br />So much time and energy has been spent ruminating over how complicated it all is, how unique the circumstances are and how inadequate the laws are. Many of the resulting recommendations are designed to solve non-existent problems or they merely exacerbate existing ones. Equal time devoted to understanding the content and complementary application of international humanitarian law, human rights law and domestic law would pay great dividends in the service of both national security and liberty interests.&quot;<br />

We cannot survive long without water.  We need water for food production, for hygiene, for industry, for recreation.  Yet, as Americans, rarely do we give the slightest pause to this vital resource, because we have access to sufficient clean water to surpass all of our needs.  <br /><br />But for almost a billion people worldwide, water is constantly on their mind.  For almost 15% of the world's population, water does not give life but acts as a silent killer. Without access to safe and sufficient water, the equivalent of four jumbo jets full of children die everyday of water-related illnesses. Yet, hardly a word is written about these deaths.  With 2.5 billion people in the world without access to proper sanitation, there seems no end to the parents having to bury children due to preventable waterborne disease.   <br /><br />Latest projections released by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) indicate that the number of people living without sufficient access to clean water will quadruple by 2030.  In the face of this mounting crisis, increasing global access to water and sanitation is an issue of great concern for maintaining peace and security around the world.  Last month, Senators Richard J. Durbin, Bob Corker and Patty Murray, and Representatives Earl Blumenauer and Donald Payne introduced bills to place water at the forefront of United States development priorities, with the express goal to increase the number of people throughout the world with sustainable access to clean water and sanitation by 100 million people by 2015. <br /><br />Simultaneous to the introduction of the bill, the 5th World Water Forum was held in Istanbul, Turkey as a multi-stakeholder discussion focused on bridging divides in reaching policies to address the water crisis.  At the conclusion of the Forum on March 22, UN World Water Day, ministers and officials from over 100 countries released a statement recognizing that access to water and sanitation is a "basic human need."<br /><br />The use of the word need rather than right in the statement has drawn criticism as a rejection of the human right to water in favor of the less influential recognition of water as a basic need, and the United States has been identified as the source of this language.  However, this Ministerial Statement should not be characterized as a death knell for the right to water, nor should the United States be seen as the executioner.  Instead, last week marks an important and positive shift in the role of the United States in these discussions.  The United States is present, attentive and involved in discussions related to water in a way that it has not been before.<br /><br />The United States has historically been a leader on human rights in the world and it has the opportunity to be a leader once more on an issue that will be the greatest human rights concern of this and future generations.  The right to access clean water and sanitation must be promoted by the United States within its own borders and in its policies abroad.  It is not only sound economic policy, as investing in access to water and sanitation yields almost 8 times the economic benefit as initial capital investment, nor is it only sound national security policy, but it is also a policy consistent with the promotion of the rights upon which the country is founded.  Access to water and sanitation is a fundamental human right of all people that should never be questioned and to which the United States must do its part to help realize.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Amanda M.

Since the birth of Pakistan in 1947, the Supreme Court has been the most acquiescent branch of the government.  The Court has frequently supported military and civilian strongmen, legitimizing constitutional subversions and perpetuating the power-grip of the Establishment. The Court's dubious history has generated an unprincipled jurisprudence of expediency.<br /><br /><strong>Holding the Establishment Accountable</strong><br /><br />Defying this history, Chief Justice Chaudhry has come to represent judicial independence and constitutional boldness in holding the Establishment accountable. Unfortunately, Chaudhry gained this heroic stature with less than clean hands.  In 1999, Chaudhry swore to uphold the Military Order which overthrew a democratically elected government. In 2000, Chaudhry - sitting as a Supreme Court Justice - legitimized Pervez Musharraf's military coup and the concomitant constitutional subversion. Though controversial and tainted, Chaudhry nonetheless communicates a credible belief that the Supreme Court can be free and people-friendly.<br /><br />Before dismissal, Chief Justice Chaudhry rendered a number of disquieting decisions. These decisions challenged the Establishment's economic and foreign policies derived from avarice and cowardice. In foreign affairs, for example, the Establishment has been a cowardly ally of foreign intelligence agencies. During the Musharraf regime, which had made a compact with the Bush-Cheney administration to prosecute a lawless war on terror, the constitutional rights and freedoms of Pakistani citizens were severely compromised. Hundreds of Pakistanis disappeared with no trace &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a crime that domestic and foreign intelligence agencies jointly perpetrated in hunting down real and imagined terrorists. By demanding accountability for the missing persons, the Chaudhry Court refused to reduce constitutional rights and liberties to seasonal goodies available only in good times.<br /><br />After reinstatement, Chief Justice Chaudhry must continue to hold the Establishment accountable. This accountability is particularly critical amidst the hype of terrorism. The Supreme Court led by Chaudhry cannot presume that the democratically-elected government holds a valid license to compromise constitutional rights and freedoms to fight terrorism. No government may lawfully commit torture, engage in extra-judicial killings, and allow foreign agents to abduct persons with or without the connivance of domestic intelligence agencies. Even deportations and extraditions of "terrorists" must require due process of law.  The Chaudhry Court must protect Pakistani citizens from the Establishment's crass utilitarian calculus under which constitutional rights are often forfeited as a quid pro quo for receiving foreign aid. The Chaudhry Court must establish a clear principle that no foreign policy can trump constitutional due process or fundamental rights and freedoms.<br /><br /><strong>Avoiding Political Questions</strong><br /><br />In holding the Establishment accountable, however, the Chaudhry Court must observe what is known as the political question doctrine, which "forbids the courts from hearing cases that would require them to rule on mattes not fit for judicial determination." Disputes between the Executive and the Parliament for the most part fall under the political question doctrine. Since Presidential powers under the Pakistan Constitution are unsettled and subject of controversy, the Court need not enter this political minefield. Let political forces settle whether the Prime Minister or the President should exercise the key constitutional powers, including the power to appoint the Chief of the Army Staff. It is not for the Chaudhry Court to shape the power structure of the federal government. Even the popular mantra of "Parliamentary Sovereignty" must not tempt the Court to hear political disputes. The Court is less free and is viewed as politicized when it aligns itself with one political ideology against the other or with one branch of the government against the other. The Court must avoid any tilt toward the President, the Prime Minister, or the Parliament.<br /><br /><strong>Judicial Corruption and Incompetence</strong><br /><br />While maintaining its constitution-based neutrality toward other branches of the government, the Chaudhry Court must nonetheless fix its own house, that is, the judiciary itself. A popular perception permeates Pakistan that judges are corrupt. Judges take bribes. They decide cases on the basis of beneficial contacts that litigants offer rather than on merit. To eradicate corruption, the law and order approach will not work. Judicial ethics and anti-bribery laws are necessary but insufficient. The Supreme Court, as the supervising court, must obtain respectable salaries for judges so that they can maintain an honorable standard of living. Lower courts judges, burdened with the most cases and closer to the people, need special protection. In the class-based Pakistan, their standard of living is often ignored. The judiciary will be unable to gain respectability unless judges across the board receive respectable compensation.<br /><br />In addition to corruption, incompetence is the other big problem that plagues the judiciary. Part of the incompetence comes from a lack of continuing education for judges. The bench experience is insufficient for judges to remain well-informed. Even in the United States and Canada, where the judiciary is well-developed, educating judges is a new phenomenon. For years, continuing experience rather than continuing education was deemed sufficient for judicial competence. It is now apparent that judges turn overly myopic and even mechanical when they receive no fresh educational insights into the art and science of dispute resolution. In this regard, the Supreme Court should consider establishing permanent educational bonds between the judiciary and the academy. Furthermore, the Court may also consider establishing transnational judicial contacts so that Pakistani judges can benefit from judicial training in more developed countries.<br /><br /><strong>Affordable Justice</strong><br /><br />Finally, the Pakistan Supreme Court, under the leadership of Chief Justice Chaudhry, must find ways to provide affordable justice to the poor people of Pakistan. Overly complicated procedures inherited from the nineteenth-century common law need massive revision. Rules of evidence need changes for a more efficient litigation. Alternative dispute resolution methods derived from Islamic law may be infused to mitigate adversarial procedures. These reforms are not easy. But the Chaudhry Court can set in motion a process that would study issues and provide solutions to fix the currently inefficient, even dysfunctional, litigation model.<br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan is professor of law at Washburn University School of Law in Topeka, Kansas, and the author of the book, <em>A Theor

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/visitors/fellowslist">Saira Mohamed</a> of Columbia Law School says any decision by the UN Security Council to stop the International Criminal Court&#39;s proceedings against Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir by using its power under Article 16 of the Rome Statute would render the ICC a mere bargaining chip and would only worsen the situation in Darfur...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/sairamohamed.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->O<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->n March 4, 2009, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant against Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the President of Sudan.  Bashir, the first sitting head of state indicted by the Court, is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur, the western region of Sudan where an estimated 300,000 people have been killed and more than 2.7 million have been forced from their homes as a result of six years of violence. <br /><br />The issuance of the warrant has inspired intense debate about whether criminal proceedings against Bashir would bring even more violence and conflict to Darfur and destroy any hope of peace.  Faced with the prospect of heightened suffering in Darfur and throughout Sudan, advocates, nongovernmental organizations, and policymakers &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; including both allies and opponents of the Government of Sudan &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; have called for the UN Security Council to stop the Court by using its power under Article 16 of the Rome Statute, which allows the Council to order the suspension of ICC proceedings in a case for up to one year, with the option to renew the suspension an unlimited number of times.<br /><br />Using this option to suspend proceedings in the case of Bashir may well fall within the authority of the Security Council, but it would be an inadvisable use of its power.  Employing Article 16 in this manner would render the ICC a mere bargaining chip, which not only would worsen the situation in Darfur, but also would vitiate any power the fledgling Court might have to secure accountability and deter future crimes. <br /><br /><strong>The ICC's Darfur Proceedings</strong><br /><br />The history of ICC involvement in Sudan is one of inaction and defiance on the part of Khartoum.  Following the Security Council's initial referral of the situation in Darfur to the Court in 2005, ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo launched a case against Ahmad Mohammed Haroun, the Sudanese Minister of State for the Interior, and Ali Kushayb, a leader of the janjaweed militia.  Neither individual has yet been turned over to the Court; instead, the Government of Sudan brazenly promoted Haroun, who by then had taken on a new position blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced Darfuris as State Minister for Humanitarian Affairs, to lead a national committee to investigate human rights abuses in Darfur. <br /><br />Last July, when Moreno-Ocampo announced his pursuit of Bashir, Khartoum predictably stepped up its defiance.  Playing to the fears held by many Sudan watchers, Sudanese officials began to make explicit and implicit threats regarding the dangers peacekeepers, humanitarian workers, and civilians both in Darfur and throughout the country would face if the warrant was issued. <br /><br />At the same time, the Government of Sudan rallied its allies to pressure the Security Council to exercise its power under Article 16.  Within days, the Arab League, African Union, Organization of the Islamic Conference, and Non-Aligned Movement were all warning of the threat to peace posed by the Bashir case and calling for immediate suspension of proceedings.  The pleas for Security Council action have only escalated now that the warrant has been issued and the "warnings" have started to come true:  The same day that Bashir became a fugitive from justice in the eyes of the ICC, the Government of Sudan expelled thirteen humanitarian groups that provide food, clean water, and health care to the people of Darfur. <br /><br /><strong>The History and Purpose of Article 16</strong><br /><br />The Security Council's power to defer ICC proceedings was one of the most controversial issues during the negotiation of the Rome Statute.  The drafters struggled to find a balance between recognition of the Security Council's primacy over international peace and security and the Court's independence.  Initially, the International Law Commission (ILC) proposed that jurisdiction over any matter already before the Security Council should be eliminated unless the Council agreed otherwise.  This would have given the Security Council complete control over the Court's jurisdiction; to prevent the ICC from addressing a situation, a Permanent Member would need only add it to the Council's agenda and then veto any resolution to permit the Court to investigate it.  <br /><br />The drafters rejected this formulation and chose instead to structure the Court-Council relationship so that it would be difficult for the Council to defer a prosecution or investigation.  Instead of requiring Council permission for the Court to act, the drafters opted to require Council action to stop the Court from acting.  In the final version of Article 16, the Security Council must adopt a resolution, with nine votes in favor and no vetoes, to defer ICC proceedings.  Moreover, it must act under Chapter VII, which requires the Council to determine that it is taking steps to "maintain or restore international peace and security" in the face of a "threat to the peace" or a "breach of the peace."  The drafters of the Rome Statute thus turned the original ILC proposal on its head and set up a system in which Council intervention in ICC cases would be the exception, not the default.  <br /><br /><strong>Instrumentalizing International Justice</strong><br /><br /> Based on the text, it would be difficult to argue that an exercise of Article 16 by the Security Council would be unlawful.  Although the existence in Darfur of any peace to be threatened is debatable, the Council conceivably could make a determination that ICC proceedings against Bashir constitute a threat to peace and that deferral of those proceedings would maintain or restore it.  Nonetheless, such a use of Article 16 would fail to make any progress toward actual peace in Darfur.  It would only entrench the climate of impunity that has pervaded Sudan for decades and do damage to the Court in the process. <br /> <br />Article 16 should be reserved to protect the fragile moves of warring parties toward peace and stability&acirc;&#8364;&#8221; not to convince a government to comply with the obligations it already has.  While commentators and diplomats urge that an Article 16 suspension would not be a free pass for Bashir because the Council could condition the suspension on any array of requirements, they fail to recognize that Khartoum is already legally required to cooperate with the ICC and to comply with its obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law.  Putting an Article 16 suspension on the table merely allows Khartoum to treat these legal obligations as bargaining chips.  The Government of Sudan's intransigence and violence do not change this situation into one that the drafters of Article 16 envisioned.<br /><br /> Moreover, deferral of ICC proceedings against Bashir risks reducing the fledgling court itself to a tool used to secure political concessions.  The ICC occupies a unique position in the scheme of international governance.  Unlike the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the ICC has an open-ended mandate over crimes committed in conflicts that are ongoing, not merely those in which the fighting has ended.  As a result, the Court operates amid political peace processes
and on-the-ground crisis management.  To see these tracks as competing, rather than coordinating, is to see justice as the enemy of peace.<br />  <br />But in fact, justice is an integral part of peace; without accountability, atrocities continue without cost, and peace becomes more remote.  Before the Government of Sudan waged war in Darfur, it honed its techniques of burning villages and killing civilians in southern Sudan, where the land and people were ravaged without one condemnation by the Security Council throughout the 1990s.  At that time, there was no international court to try the perpetrators of those crimes, and Khartoum was left to redeploy its brutal tactics in Darfur.  The same mistake must not be made again &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and now that the ICC can hold perpetrators of international crimes accountable, the same mistake need not be made again.<br /><br />Using Article 16 to convince the Government of Sudan to stop attacking its people will reward Khartoum for its criminal policies.  This poses not only a danger to the people of Darfur, who will continue to suffer, but also to the ICC and to all efforts at international justice, which will be seen as nothing more than political tools to convince criminal leaders to come to the negotiating table.  And once it becomes clear that justice is merely political, its power to compel any action at all will evaporate.<br /><br />But the costs of instrumentalizing international justice are far greater than simply milking the threat of prosecution of all effectiveness.  Justice is more than a tool; it is distinct from economic sanctions or diplomatic isolation.  Justice is an end in itself.  To suspend ICC action at this time, when the threat to peace triggered by the warrant results solely from the deliberate actions of the defendant, when there is no peace process to protect, and when Bashir continues to orchestrate attacks against civilians, would serve only to strengthen the climate of impunity that has reigned in Darfur, to ignore the suffering of victims, and to further erode the rule of law in Sudan.<br /><br /><br /><em>Saira Mohamed is the James Milligan Fellow at Columbia Law School.

Global attention was focused on these events in November 2008 with the seizure of the crude carrier <em>Sirius Star</em> some 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombassa, Kenya. An estimated USD$3m cash ransom was eventually delivered to the Somali pirates on board the vessel on 16 January 2009. In response to these events the European Union launched 'Operation Atlanta' in late 2008 under which a coordinated attempt was made to effectively establish a 'counter-piracy' international naval fleet operating under a UN mandate. Non-EU countries which have also offered support have included Russia, Malaysia, India, Iran, China, Turkey, South Korea, and Singapore. In total the Bahrain-based 'Combined Task Force' now patrolling an area that includes the Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Red Sea and the northern Indian Ocean now includes 20 contributing nations. <br /><br /> On 13 March, and in a significant shift away from its past 'rear-area support' policy toward international enforcement operations, Japan issued an executive order allowing for two Maritime Self-Defence Force (MSDF) destroyers &#8212; the <em>Samidare</em> and <em>Sazanami</em>  - to be dispatched to the Gulf of Aden to join the Task Force. Japan's decision to take 'maritime police action' at the front line was in response to the growing international and domestic pressure for protecting its own maritime commercial interests. But the executive order in accordance with Article 82 of the Self-Defence Forces (SDF) Act was issued without addressing the legal issues surrounding the counter-piracy operation. Japan's MSDF will have to battle not only with pirates but also with operational uncertainty. The executive order under the current SDF Act only permits the use of lethal weapons in legitimate self-defence and for avoiding imminent dangers. Accordingly, the MSDF mission cannot come to the aid of foreign vessels under pirate attack and use lethal force, as such action would be beyond the currently authorised Japanese limits of legitimate self-defence.<br /> <br />These developments highlight the challenge Japan faces in international enforcement and peacekeeping operations. Japan has gained a notorious reputation through the SDF's overseas peacekeeping operations where it has taken a restrictive approach to the use of weapons in self-defence, as illustrated in its deployments in Cambodia, East Timor, the Golan Heights and Iraq. On this occasion, however, Japan appears to be ready to take a more liberal approach, as seen in the draft bill submitted by the Cabinet in mid-March, which enables MSDF personnel to protect foreign vessels and authorises the reasonable use of weapons against pirate vessels if they approach or follow merchant ships or obstruct their navigation. The bill remains under consideration in the Diet. Although the leading opposition party is still yet to clarify its position, the bill has reportedly received wide public support in Japan. Once the bill is passed, it is expected that Japan will be able to perform the most effective operation ever in the history of SDF overseas missions. <br /><br />Nevertheless, dangers will remain for the MSDF destroyers. One fear is that any revised rules of engagement may in fact permit an excessive use of force, intentionally or accidentally killing pirates or endangering their life. This has been dramatically highlighted by exercises which the MSDF have conducted en route to the area of operations during which an understanding has been gained of the dynamics of firing machine gun volleys into open water and the risks that arise from ricochets from the water's surface. In situations where nobody else is observing the scene, an unmonitored policing-type operation could easily amount to an extra-judicial killing. These are operational issues which have already arisen for other countries. British Royal Marines controversially shot and killed two Somali pirates in December 2008. The MSDF will therefore need to ensure they are operating under clear rules of engagement and exercise extreme caution if the use of defensive or lethal force becomes necessary. <br /><br /> Another legal and political challenge is the treatment of pirates once they have been arrested or captured at sea. Whilst the intervention of the Security Council through Resolutions 1816 (2008) and 1846 (2008) has gone some way to resolve these jurisdictional loopholes, there remain gaps which are compounded by a lack of political will on the part of some members of the international community to engage in law enforcement. The current situation in Somalia is unique and this goes some way towards explaining how the Security Council was able to go so far with its 2008 initiatives, including authorising limited law enforcement powers by the Combined Task Force within Somali territory. Nevertheless, all countries need to have the capacity under international law to prosecute persons who perpetrate acts of violence against foreign ships in all settings. To that end, innovative legal responses are required. <br /><br />Japan's position on this issue is yet to be determined. The MSDF destroyers are also carrying coast guard personnel on board so that they can arrest pirates for crimes under Japanese law. This is an interesting departure from other countries' practice in their counter-piracy operations. In January the US and UK reached agreements with Kenya allowing for the transfer of suspected pirates to Kenya for trial, whilst the EU reached a similar agreement earlier this month. It remains to be seen if Japan adopts the same practice or makes efforts to return the captives to Japan out of consideration for the protection of their constitutionally protected human rights.<br /> <br />That Japan has chosen to take such a proactive approach towards this issue of international and Japanese maritime security is a significant step in its rehabilitation as a global power capable of responsibly exercising limited military force. It raises sensitive issues of international and Japanese law, but perhaps most importantly this maritime police operation may set the touchstone for Japan's ability to engage in international security issues and to meet the legal challenges that its robust peacekeeping and enforcement operations would encounter. <br /><br /><br /><em>Dr Hitoshi Nasu and Professor Donald R.

		<title>ISRAEL: A Broad View of Standing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wendy Doernberg, Pitt Law &#39;11, studied Israeli law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and lived in Jerusalem for 6 months...<br /><br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Israel-SC-pic-1-769972.jpg"><img style="margin: 4pt 4pt 10px 10px; float: right; width: 290px; cursor: pointer; height: 220px;" alt="Symbol of Law flowing from Justice in the Israeli Supreme Court" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Israel-SC-pic-1-769968.jpg" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">U</span></span>nlike the United States, Israel has yet to adopt a formal written constitution. Even some of the laws which form the basis for governmental decisions came into being only relatively recently. I learned while studying in Jerusalem that the lack of a written constitution has had a major impact on judicial decisions, particularly within Israel&#39;s doctrines concerning the right of standing (<span style="font-style: italic;">zchuyat ha&#39;amidah) </span>for petitioners to the Supreme Court. The American right of standing takes into account a limited judiciary, federalism and separation of powers. However, in Israel, this right was expanded to take into account its internal and external pressures.<br /><br />The Basic Law of Israel concerning the judiciary was not passed until 1984. The Supreme Court can hear issues not within the jurisdiction of other courts that need to be heard for the sake of justice. Even though the Supreme Court has certain enumerated instances of jurisdiction, the Basic Law specifically says that these enumerated instances do not limit the ability to decide other matters.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Israel-Pic-2-708535.jpg"><img style="margin: 4pt 10px 10px 4pt; float: left; width: 283px; cursor: pointer; height: 214px;" alt="Entrance to Supreme Court Chamber" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Israel-Pic-2-708533.jpg" border="0" /></a>The Israeli Supreme Court was cautious to expand standing at first. However, even in an early case, <u>Leon v. Gubernik</u> (1949), the Court recognized that the separation of powers &quot;is no longer so rigid and immutable as it was when once formulated by Montesquieu.&quot; In 1988, <u>Ressler v. Minister of Defense</u> represented a departure from a line of conservative case law, and significantly expanded the right of standing. <u>Ressler</u> concerned an attorney&#39;s challenge to Yeshiva students&#39; exemption from mandatory military service. It is particularly interesting because Justice Barak reviewed the difference between the role of the Supreme Court in the United States and that of the Supreme Court in Israel. He explained that while the United States&#39; view of standing grew out of a constitutional provision, Israel&#39;s concept has no statutory anchor. While the US approach aims to maintain governmental legitimacy, Israel&#39;s focuses more on individual rights, meaning that petitioners must only show a &quot;reasonable likelihood of prejudice to a legal right.&quot; This right could even include the interest against government corruption that is of &quot;salient constitutional character,&quot; dealing with defects in administrative action or issues directly concerning the rule of law.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/israel-pic-3-743990.jpg"><img style="margin: 4pt 4pt 10px 10px; float: right; width: 276px; cursor: pointer; height: 207px;" alt="View from the Supreme Court" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/israel-pic-3-743988.jpg" border="0" /></a>This broad view has been applied in a number of Israeli Supreme Court cases which would probably be dismissed for lack of standing in the US Supreme Court. One such case (<u>Shiran</u>) challenged the broadcasting authority because, according to the petitioners, a television special on the history of Zionism did not include enough information about Jews from Arab countries. Another case (<u>Barzilai</u>) raised a direct challenge against the President of Israel&#39;s decision to pardon security officials who had killed suspected terrorists before criminal conviction. In another matter (<u>Shulamit</u>), petitioners argued that they had an interest in the &quot;fortification of the rule of law&quot; and challenged the Minister of Justice&#39;s refusal to extradite a suspected murderer to France in violation of an extradition treaty. Many challenges have been brought against the legality of the security fence and its various sections.<br /><br />The lack of a formal written constitution has allowed Israel the flexibility to develop a standing doctrine which provides a broad basis for judicial review and intervention. The broad view of standing allows for interference by the judiciary in matters concerning the executive and legislative branches of government and provides a powerful mechanism for Israel to address some of the legal issues that arise from the continuous challenges facing the country. It will be interesting to see if Israel&#39;s broad standing doctrine continues to serve it well as it develops over time.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Photo Credits: Wendy Doernberg, Pitt Law &#39;11</span><br />

		<title>France legislature&#039;s rejection of internet anti-piracy bill thwarts corporate interests</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Zimmermann</strong> [Co-founder and spokesperson, <a href="http://www.laquadrature.net/en">La Quadrature du Net</a>]: &quot;A controversial bill dealing with online filesharing was <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/france-parliament-defeats-controversial.php">rejected by the French National Assembly</a> in a very surprising move last week, at the final vote of the emergency procedure in which it was considered, (which means only one lecture in each room. such a last minute rejection happened for the last time in 1983). This law faced strong opposition coming from members of all the political parties, driven by a formidable and wide citizen movement lead from the Internet by La Quadrature du Net and others. The law is nonsensical, inapplicable and dangerous for numerous reasons: It allows for parallel administrative justice where innocents will be sanctioned based on immaterial proofs, private police of the network in the hands of corporate actors, and its Article 5 opens very disturbing doors to generalized filtering of content. <br /><br />The French law &quot;Cr&eacute;ation et Internet&quot; (or HADOPI) allows the entertainment industries to make people police themselves on the internet,in order to collect proofs of alleged copyright infringements. These private actors transmit those immaterial proofs, unverifiable and impossible to oppose, to a newly created adminitrative authority, the HADOPI. It then engages procedures in which alleged counterfeiters are menaced then sanctioned by up to 12 months of disconnection from Internet access (during which the connection still has to be paid, and no reconnection is possible on any other operator). Citizens cannot oppose such accusations by claiming their innocence before the sanction is ordered, and have no material way of doing so.<br /><br />This scheme will inevitably end up sanctioning innocent people, as the factors for error are multiple (private actors making up the police, sanctions based only on immaterial proofs, many factors for an IP address to be used against a user&#39;s will, etc.).<br /><br />But beyond this, the core principles that are the basis for this law are wrong. It is based on the fact that filesharing is the most important cause for the decline of recorded music sales (when the French cinema has its record year for ticket sales and investment in 2008!) which is wrong. Many serious studies, the most recent being lead by the governments of Canada and the Netherlands, show in fact that the whole cultural economy benefits from filesharing, and that people who share the most are people who spend the most for cultural products. This law can thus only be a bad solution to the wrong problem.<br /><br />In the context of the current economical crisis, such a law, obviously designed to please the illusions of entertainment industries that still think they can prolong their business models based on selling copies, seems futile and archaic. Add to this that any 12 year old kid can already circumvent it in many easy ways.<br /><br />Yet, as president Sarkozy was personnally commited to passing this law since he was elected, there are high chances that, as announced a few minutes after the rejection, it will be presented again to the parliament and passed &quot;en force&quot; with a locked down majority. In that case, the Constitutional Council will have the opportunity to invalidate any of the multiple points that are contrary to the most fundamental principles of a due trial, protection of privacy, and separation of powers, thus hopefully neutralizing the more harmful aspects of the legislation.<br /><br />HADOPI is just one illustration of a growing global will towards increased control over the internet, to suit corporate and political interests in France and elsewhere in the world.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Frank Smyth</strong> [Journalist Security Coordinator, <a href="http://www.cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>]: &quot;There is nothing that repressive regimes like more than pointing the finger at someone else. Nearly four years ago, after journalists including Judith Miller then of The New York Times were jailed for refusing to reveal sources in response to federal subpoenas, senior government officials in other nations <a href="http://cpj.org/2005/06/us-sends-wrong-message-to-the-world.php">from Venezuela to Cameroon</a> tried to justify their crackdowns against the press by pointing to the journalists behind bars in the United States.<br /><br />If a <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/house-committee-approves-journalism.php">bill passed last Monday</a> by the US House of Representatives manages to become law, journalists in this nation not only stand a better chance of staying out of jail. But despots and their cronies around the world will likely have less US journalists behind bars to point to try and deflect attention from themselves.<br /><br />The Free Flow of Information Act of 2009 was introduced by Reps. Mike Pence (R-IN) and Adam Schiff (D-CA).  Also known as the &quot;shield bill,&quot; the legislation would provide a qualified privilege for journalists with exceptions for national security, the prevention of death or bodily harm, or information that is deemed essential in a criminal case or critical in a civil suit, <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/newsitems/index.php?i=10682">reports</a> the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.<br /><br />The bill has its critics. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/gen/39218prs20090331.html?s_src=RSS">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, for one, argues that its <a href="http://www.mikepence.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Daniel_Pearl_Freedom_of_the_Press_Act_of_2009.pdf">current language</a> [PDF file] is too narrow and would not protect bloggers and others who may provide news without necessarily earning a living from it; The Free Flow of Information Act defines a journalist as someone who regularly gathers information and who earns a substantial portion of their livelihood from doing so.<br /><br />But a broad <a href="http://www.naa.org/PressCenter/SearchPressReleases/2009/MEDIA-COALITION-APPLAUDS-REINTRODUCTION-OF-FEDERAL-SHIELD-BILL.aspx">coalition of media organizations </a>and groups including the Committee to Protect Journalists, the RCFP and the ACLU all back the bill nonetheless. &quot;This is not about protecting reporters,&quot; <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0209/18764.html">said</a> Rep. Mike Pence (R-IN). &quot;It is about protecting the public&#39;s right to know.&quot;&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jcomm.uoregon.edu/faculty-staff/youm"><strong>Kyu Ho Youm</strong></a> [Jonathan Marshall First Amendment Chair, School of Journalism and Communication, <a href="http://uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon</a>]: &quot;A Korean judge&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/south-korea-court-clears-blogger-of.php">acquittal of the blogger</a> Park Dae-sung (aka &quot;Minerva&quot;) in Seoul is a welcome development in freedom of speech and the press in Korea, one of the most-wired nations in the world.<br /><br />There should have been no charges against Park.  Few doubt that the government&#39;s claim that he has violated the telecommunication law was politically motivated.<br /><br />Many discerning Koreans have been dismayed with their government&#39;s foolhardy pursuit of the flimsy charges against Park.  This is all the more true, given that the conservative administration of President Lee Myung-bak should have known better.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Korean court&#39;s decision against the government showcases that Korea is a rule-of-law nation.  The court&#39;s interpretation of the applicable law is more prosaic than inspiring.  And the opinion is less than reader-friendly.  Nonetheless, the Korean court considered the value of Park&#39;s well-intentioned blogging to Korean society while rejecting the government&#39;s overly sweeping arguments.<br /><br />The court opinion in the <u>Minerva</u> case is significant to free speech in general and Internet communication in particular because it is refreshingly sensitive and sensible.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cato.org/people/patrick-michaels"><strong>Patrick J. Michaels</strong></a> [Senior Fellow in Environmental Studies, <a href="http://www.cato.org/">Cato Institute</a>; Professor of Environmental Sciences, <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a>]: &quot;When the US Environmental Protection Agency <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/epa-announces-proposed-findings-for.php">determined</a> that carbon dioxide and other &quot;greenhouse&quot; gases &quot;endanger public health and welfare,&quot;  they virtually guaranteed that the Executive Branch will be responsible for promulgating and enforcing mandatory reductions in the use of fossil fuels, without the advice and consent of Congress.<br /><br />When EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson announced the finding, she also said that the Obama Administration preferred that greenhouse-gas emissions be regulated by Congress.  But, in reality, the EPA&#39;s finding gives Congress a very good excuse to <em>not</em> pass an enormously expensive cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases.  <br /><br />Global warming legislation will soon be introduced in the House.  Current proposals mandate per-capita carbon dioxide emissions in 2050 - just 40 years from today - to be what they were in 1867.  This may pass the House, but the Senate is likely to punt this hot potato back to the EPA.  Absent legislation, the EPA <em>will</em> act.<br /><br />Why such certainty?  The Obama Administration is top-heavy with climate change radicals, including Presidential Science Advisor John Holdren, Energy Secretary Chu and Climate Czarina Carol Browner.  Even if Obama wants to go slow (he doesn&#39;t, but he <em>is</em> politic), there will be just too much pressure - of his own creation - that will throw caution to the wind.<br /><br />Not that anything we do will have much of an effect on global temperature.  Between 2000  and 2006, US total carbon dioxide emissions were virtually constant, rising a mere 0.7%.  China&#39;s rose 103%, and by 2006 had passed us in emissions volume.<br /><br />If the US had decided to emit zero carbon dioxide in 2000, the Chinese would have made up for our total and then some by next year.  Do they have the same incentive to reduce emissions?  No, they would rather export Chery automobiles.<br /><br />The Administration&#39;s response to this dilemma was floated by Secretary Chu last month: tarrifs.  These have a way of leading to trade wars, which have a historical way of leading to real wars.  <br /><br />Don&#39;t you think our legislators are breathing a sigh of relief after EPA&#39;s findings?&quot;<br />

		<title>Wrangling over Khadr&#039;s counsel shows discretionary power of military judges</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.court-martial.com/about_us.htm"><strong>Philip D. Cave</strong></a> [<a href="http://www.court-martial.com">Philip D. Cave Law Offices</a>]: &quot;The Military Commissions have been insufficiently transparent over the years, and this has lead to a great deal of skepticism and mistrust from the public.  As I and colleagues have counseled elsewhere, we should be careful of litigation by media.  (Disclosure, I know and have worked with all three - Colonel Masciola, Colonel Parrish, and LCDR Kuebler - and respect them.)  Only they and the other defense counsel know the facts.  More might become clear if and when Judge Parrish&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/khadr-lawyer-reinstated-by-military.php">order</a> becomes public.<br /><br />My prism is 30 years of military law practice under the UCMJ. Were this scenario to arise in a court-martial, Judge Parrish would be right in that he makes a trial level decision on who represents Khadr.<br /><br />Under UCMJ practice an accused can ask for new counsel or counsel can seek to withdraw.  The prosecution can move to deny the client&#39;s representation.  A prosecution motion to recuse has been done in courts-martial when the attorney is disbarred or not licensed to practice law; or where the attorney has a conflict of interest by representing a co-accused or a prosecution witness.  Fairly recently the appellate courts have addressed the issue of a civilian attorney whose fee was paid by one of the prosecution witnesses; where there is a question that the attorney violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode05a/usc_sup_05_5_10_sq3.html">Ethics in Government Act</a>, (18 US Code &Acirc;&sect;207(a)(2)), see <a href="http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2005Term/04-0336.pdf">United States v. Rhoades</a> [PDF file], 65 M.J. 393 (C.A.A.F. 2008); or where the military attorney was concurrently serving as a prosecutor in unrelated cases, see <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/455/252/case.html">United States v. Lee</a>, 66 M.J. 387 (C.A.A.F. 2008).<br /><br />It is the client or the military judge who decides if the attorney must be released or the attorney-client relationship severed.  When such an issue arises it is addressed in open court and on the record.  The <a href="http://afcca.law.af.mil/">Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals</a> has said that, there are only three ways an existing attorney-client relationship can be severed: consent of the accused, a judicial order, or other good cause.  See <a href="http://openjurist.org/97/f3d/1449/united-states-v-hardy">United States v. Hardy</a>, 44 M.J. 507 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 1996).  In <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/487/533/case.html">United States v. Murray</a>, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 61, 42 C.M.R. 253 (1970), the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), held that administrative convenience did not justify severance of an attorney-client relationship.  I&#39;m not convinced that a supervisor&#39;s disagreement with case and trial strategy is sufficient reason to sever an existing relationship.  (Note that the Military Commission rules of professional responsibility mimic those for military and civilian lawyers practicing in a court-martial under the UCMJ.)<br /><br />Rule for Military Commissions 505(d)(B) seems to partially support Judge Parrish&#39;s approach.<blockquote><br />(B) After formation of attorney-client relationship. After an attorney-client relationship has been formed between the accused and detailed defense counsel or associate or assistant defense counsel, an authority competent to detail such counsel may excuse or change such counsel only:<br /><br />(i) Upon request of the accused or application for withdrawal by such counsel under R.M.C. 506(b); or<br /> <br />(ii) For other good cause shown on the record.<br /></blockquote><br />Rules 505 or 506 do not address the current scenario - only a client&#39;s request to change counsel or counsel&#39;s request to withdraw.  It would seem proper therefore to advert to the Rules for Courts-Martial and UCMJ practice as a suitable analogy, framework, or guide-post as I have laid out above.<br /><br />The military judge usually will query the accused about his counsel desires on the record when a counsel &quot;conflict&quot; issue comes up.  The judge would probably readvise, as he did at the start of the trial, the accused about what his counsel rights are.  The judge will have the accused acknowledge his understanding.  The judge will then query if he desires to retain counsel or seek new counsel.  Should it be the counsel who are seeking to withdraw, they will be asked to state their reasons.  The accused will be asked if he consents.  It would seem that the judge could do this sua sponte under the circumstances here, or at the request of Khadr and his counsel.  I am unaware of any similar situation in a court-martial under the UCMJ, but it&#39;s always possible it has happened.&quot;<br />

		<title>UN fact-finding investigation into war crimes in Gaza is warranted and necessary</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Will Youmans</strong> [Fellow, <a href="http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/ht/d/sp/i/223/pid/223">Palestine Center</a>]: &quot;The announcement by the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) of the formation of a <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/un-rights-council-names-south-africa.php">UN fact-finding mission</a> to investigate alleged war crimes during the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip earlier this year is both warranted and necessary.  The appointment of the eminent jurist, South African judge Richard Goldstone, the chief UN prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, came after a widespread call for the United Nations to take seriously the allegations about, as well as the applicability of international law to, Israel&#39;s actions.<br /><br />The inquiry will also look into possible war crimes committed by Hamas and other Palestinian parties that intentionally targeted civilians.  The UN Human Rights Council president Martin Uhomoibhi said the fact-finding mission would deal <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h7Rrw6IAyaGk7jpNm5Kh7DSJlcqw">with all violations</a>.&quot; While high-profile rocket attacks on Israeli communities left little question of direct targeting, the Israeli blockade on media access to Gaza along with the government&#39;s insistence to be taking every step necessary to avoid civilian casualties denied outside observers the opportunity to evaluate Israel&#39;s conduct.  <br /><br />Specifically, an investigation will have to look into whether Israel met its obligations under international law.  One of the primary treaties governing the laws of war and military occupation is the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/92.htm">Fourth Geneva Convention</a>.  It protects civilians in times of war and under any military occupation by a foreign power.  Article 3 expressly forbids violence to life and person, hostage-taking, outrages upon personal dignity and denying people of certain aspects of fair trials.<br /><br />In the months since the cessation of the attack, numerous allegations of Israeli misconduct emerged. An impartial, fact-finding investigation is justified by the gravity of the allegations, the high proportion of civilian casualties, and the failure of the Israeli government to seriously investigate them.   Despite Israel&#39;s opposition to the investigation, the international community&#39;s credibility depends on decisive action. There are too many documented instances that could constitute prima facie violations for the international body to not investigate.  <br /><br />The fact-finding mission will be looking into a conflict that left behind a considerable number of civilians.  According to the Israeli military&#39;s estimates, they killed 1166 Palestinians, 709 (60%) of whom were &quot;terror operatives.&quot;   If the remaining 40% were civilians, this implies a 3 to 2 ratio of militant to civilian deaths. While there is no numerical trigger, such a proportion should necessarily raise questions into the extent by which the military avoided civilian casualties.  The United Nations special rapporteur, Richard Falk, relayed different estimates in a report to the UNGA: Of the 1434 Palestinians killed, 960 (67%) were civilians, including 121 women and 288 children.<br /><br />For Falk, the question of proportionality is not the central question.  His report states, &quot;recourse to force was not legally justified given the circumstances and diplomatic alternatives available, and was potentially a crime against peace.&quot;  It calls for an &quot;expert inquiry&quot; that also considers appropriate accountability.  This should not be a controversial expectation.  Even one critic who accused Falk of downplaying Israel&#39;s self-defense argument agreed that it &quot;<a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=3041">should be investigated thoroughly</a>.&quot;<br /><br />While Palestinian accounts are bountiful, the release of soldier&#39;s testimonies made such an investigation requisite.  A leading Israeli newspaper, Ha&#39;aretz, <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1072040.html">published the personal stories</a> of a group of Israeli fighters who graduated from the Yitzhak Rabin pre-military preparatory course at Oranim Academic College in Tivon.  In summary, the report announced, &quot;Israeli forces killed Palestinian civilians under permissive rules of engagement and intentionally destroyed their property.&quot;  An Israeli military investigation closed on the subject, finding no criminal activities and dismissing the soldiers&#39; stories in the news reports as &quot;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7972490.stm">hearsay</a>.&quot;  <br /><br />In a New York Times oped, George Bisharat <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/04/opinion/04bisharat.html?_r=3">outlined six possible areas</a> of war crimes.  He argued that Israel deliberately attacked civilian targets.  This is only permissible when it makes &quot;an effective contribution to military action.&quot;  Israeli military officials described a strategy of a generalized attack on non-military institutions.  One general said, &quot;We are hitting not only terrorists and launchers, but also the whole Hamas government and all its wings.&quot; Israeli military spokeswoman, Maj. Avital Leibovich, declared &quot;anything affiliated with Hamas&quot; as &quot;a legitimate target.&quot; <br /><br />Bisharat listed sites the Israeli military destroyed or damaged: &quot;mosques, hospitals, factories, schools, a key sewage plant, institutions like the parliament, the main ministries, the central prison and police stations, and thousands of houses.&quot;<br /><br />There is more evidence of broad destruction of residential areas.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) released <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/palestine-video-260109?opendocument">videos</a> exposing the extent of the damage.  According to the ICRC, patches of the Gaza &quot;were wiped out, leaving the people who lived there without homes.&quot;  They found that &quot;10,000 houses have been partially or completely ruined because of the Israeli operation.&quot;  <br /><br />There is also strong evidence that Israel directly targeted specially protected classes of persons, medical workers and police.<br /><br />A team of five international medical experts sponsored by the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human Rights and the Palestinian Medical Relief Society interviewed 44civilians and health workers in Gaza.  Their <a href="http://www.phr.org.il/phr/article.asp?articleid=708&catid=54&pcat=-1&lang=ENG">report</a> presents evidence that Israeli troops attacked Palestinian medical workers to prevent them from helping wounded people.  The team gathered &quot;individual cases in which soldiers had been within seeing, hearing and speaking distance of their victims for significant stretches of time&quot; and had &quot;denied wounded people access to lifesaving medical care, or even shot at civilians at short range.&quot;  <br /><br />This corroborated earlier <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2009/01/08-6">ICRC accusations</a> that Israel intentionally delayed ambulances and denied them safe access in at least one instance. In a statement, ICRC said it believes &quot;the Israeli military failed to meet its obligation under international humanitarian law to care for and evacuated the wounded.&quot;  However, Dominik Stillhart, ICRC deputy director of operations, said this was for the ICC, not the ICRC, to adjudicate.  The ICC, however, lacks jurisdiction since Israel is not a ratified signatory to the Rome Statute.  The ICC could gain jurisdiction if the case were referred by the UN Security Council.  Without a proper, formal and fair investigation, it is impossible for any such case to proceed.<br /><br />Professor John Dugard, the former U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and visiting distinguished professor of law at Duke University, <a href="http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/ht/display/ContentDetails/i/5240/pid/897">spoke recently</a> at the Palestine Center.  He described the &quot;opening salvo,&quot; in which Israel killed fifteen policemen as a potential transgression of international law.  He said, &quot;Israelis view policemen as militants whereas in fact policemen are, under international law, classified as civilians.&quot;  Professor Dugard has visited Gaza twice each year since 2001 and previously &quot;witnessed evidence of horrendous bombings and killings and house destructions.&quot;  &quot;But,&quot; he added, &quot;the most recent attack surpassed all the others.&quot;<br /><br />A National Lawyers Guild delegation to Gaza issued a detailed <a href="http://www.nlg.org/NLGGazaDelegationReport.pdf">report</a> [PDF file] suggesting violations of the following areas of international law:  the principle of distinction, the principle of proportionality, the obligation to provide medical care and the prohibition on attacking medical facilities and personnel.<br /><br />The UN team must also consider Israeli policies since the offensive as well. Prior to the hostilities, during, and since, Israel has maintained a blockade of Gaza.  By systematically denying food and medicines to the civilians, Israel is undermining prohibitions against collective punishment, such as Article 33 of the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/92.htm">Fourth Geneva Convention</a>. The embargo banned such staples as lentils, tea and pasta, as noted by two American Congressmen who visited Gaza.  Falk named the embargo as a &quot;massive violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.&quot; <br /><br />The UN Human Rights Council president Martin Uhomoibhi elaborated on the rationale for the inquiry. &quot;The ultimate purpose of the council,&quot; he said, &quot;will not be served if that mandate does not allow for the establishment of an independent and impartial fact-finding mission...that would gain the credibility of all sides.&quot;  Given the United Nations&#39; role as the leading institution embodying international law, there are simply too many serious allegations of war crimes violations to not instigate such an investigation.&quot;<br />

		<title>Thai courts&#039; use of legal double standards encourages extralegal means by opposition</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://ratchasima.net/">Awzar Thi</a></strong> [Member, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>, Hong Kong]: &quot;At a meeting of lawyers and jurists in Hong Kong this week a participant from Thailand identified the key issue for her country&#39;s legal system as political control of the judiciary. Her statement was remarkable not because it revealed something that other participants didn&#39;t already know, but because just a few years ago few professionals from Thailand willingly admitted that their laws and courts operate according to double standards. Now, few can deny it.<br /><br />The double standards have been all too apparent this month. Following protests that forced leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and partner countries to flee from a summit venue in Pattaya, the incumbent prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, imposed a state of emergency as blockades and violence spread in Bangkok. The army deployed. A court promptly <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/thailand-court-issues-arrest-warrants.php">issued arrest warrants</a> for the red-shirted demonstrators&#39; leaders. Some were quickly rounded up and detained, while others went into hiding.<br /><br />By contrast, the yellow shirts that took over Government House and two international airports for an extended period last year were allowed to stay put until the government was forced out through a court ruling on a narrow question under the army-imposed 2007 Constitution. No soldiers came to eject them. The legal process took weeks to move against the organizers. When the new prime minister was questioned on the authorities&#39; inactivity he disingenuously said that it was a matter for the police, not him. The criminal inquiries have been repeatedly postponed and at no time have the yellow shirts&#39; leaders been held in custody. One of them, businessman Sondhi Limthongkul, last week survived a shooting attack on his car.<br /><br />Although the ousted Thaksin Shinawatra regime undermined the work of the upper courts, it was the 2006 military coup that brought them back firmly and openly under executive control. The coup leaders shut down a senior court, appointed a tribunal in its stead, had it go after the former premier, declared themselves immune from prosecution and proclaimed all their orders lawful. After voters re-elected Thaksin allies to the lower house of parliament (top judges are now responsible for the upper), it took two absurd legal cases against successive prime ministers for the coup-makers to finally get a government after their own heart, rather than one that the electorate wanted. The judges responsible for the verdicts included men who owed their jobs to the generals.<br /><br />The double legal standards in the handling of rival political camps have done nothing to diminish the likelihood of further bloodshed and uncertainty in the near future. On the contrary, the obvious differences in how the yellow shirts and red shirts have been treated will only encourage government opponents to resort to increasingly extralegal means to get their way. Both sides and their backers have the aptitude and means for violence. Thanks to the politicizing of Thailand&#39;s courts, now they have more appetite for it too.&quot;<br />

		<title>EPA finding on greenhouse gases paves way for costly regulation by bureaucrats</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.aei.org/scholars/scholarID.112/scholar.asp"><strong>Kenneth P. Green</strong></a> [Resident Scholar, <a href="http://www.aei.org/">American Enterprise Institute</a>]: &quot;The EPA&#39;s issuance of an <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/epa-announces-proposed-findings-for.php">endangerment finding</a> for the greenhouse gases was inevitable, given the 2007 decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-1120.pdf">Mass. v. EPA</a> [PDF file], and the stated intention of the Obama Administration to move ahead in compliance with the court&#39;s order. The endangerment finding opens up several potential pathways to greenhouse gas control.<br /><br />First, EPA could continue as it has with other criteria pollutants under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/">Clean Air Act</a>, and control greenhouse gases through regulation of large emitters and automobiles. Virtually every economist agrees that this is the worst possible way that the United States could choose to control greenhouse gas emissions.<br /><br />Requiring Best Available Control Technology would be virtually certain to raise the costs of energy, goods, services, and transportation, while simultaneously adding additional barriers to the creation, maintenance, and updating of energy intensive industries and businesses. This in turn would cause significant economic contraction and job loss. As these are regulations, not cap-and-trade or a carbon tax, no revenue stream would be available to use in mitigating the harm to energy users, and the impacts of high prices would fall disproportionately on women, minorities, and the poor. Naturally, this process would be heavily litigious, as were the 1997 revisions of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/">National Ambient Air Quality Standards</a>, which were held up in court for about 8 years after they were approved by the Administrator of the EPA.<br /><br />Some suggest that the EPA&#39;s endangerment finding will prod Congress into enacting cap-and-trade legislation, in which Congress will enjoin EPA from regulating greenhouse gases under the clean air act. As we have written <a href="http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.26286/pub_detail.asp">here</a> this would be almost as bad an option as having EPA continue with regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. But there is reason to doubt that Congress will enact cap-and-trade, as EPA&#39;s endangerment finding gives them a way to avoid Congressional (Democrat) responsibility for the inevitably negative consequences of cap-and-trade. Congress might well choose to simply say &quot;there&#39;s no reason for cap-and-trade legislation now that EPA is going to handle greenhouse gas controls,&quot; effectively shielding themselves from the political consequences of a party-line enactment of economically damaging climate legislation. It would not be the first time that Congress has passed responsibility onto unelected (and largely unanswerable) bureaucrats who can always be trotted out and castigated in hearings when prices climb, industries relocate, and product diversity in the market shrinks as a result of regulatory proliferation.<br /><br />All in all, EPA&#39;s endangerment finding adds another element of uncertainty into what US climate policy will be, who will design it, who will implement it, and how it will affect the economic well-being of Americans and American business. The Obama administration seemingly took an approach of flinging everything they had at the wall of greenhouse gas controls, hoping something would stick. What stuck is widely considered to be the single worst approach to regulating greenhouse gases that could be envisioned for the United States economy.&quot;<br />

		<title>Supreme Court&#039;s decision in Pyett collective bargaining case will have little real world effect</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.employmentblawg.com/about_blawgme/"><strong>George Lenard</strong></a> [Managing Parner, <a href="http://www.hdfh.com/index.asp">Harris Dowell Fisher &amp; Harris, LC</a>]: &quot;In the academic world, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-decides-labor-epa.php">this case</a> will be a law professor&#39;s pleasure and a law student&#39;s nightmare.  It presents interesting conflicting precedents and policies. Justice Thomas&#39;s majority opinion seems to make sense on first reading, but then so do the dissents - typical disagreements from the Supremes. At least there are no concurrences muddying the waters.<br /> <br />It would be fun to micro-analyze all the threads of argument and reread all the cited cases and think for hours about who was really right and about what points, who was more intellectually dishonest and about what points, etc. Heck, it&#39;d be fun to do that for every labor and employment Supreme Court case that comes out. But I&#39;m a practicing lawyer and haven&#39;t the time. Another fun game to play would be to look for the questions a case left open, which of course can be seen as opportunities for further litigation, not to mention great subjects for law journal notes or articles.  Again, that&#39;s not my thing these days. <br /> <br />What I tend to do is read a new decision very quickly and then think more broadly about what its impact will be in the everyday world - how it will affect the actions of employers, employees, unions, their attorneys, and trial court judges. What I have found over years of doing this is that relatively few Supreme Court decisions wind up having as much everyday impact as we might expect when they are announced. And I don&#39;t always find it easy to predict which ones will be among the few with major impact. <br /> <br />My guess is that this one will get buried in the books quite quickly, with little lasting real-world impact (though it will likely be added to all the labor law and employment law casebooks in order to torture - I mean challenge - law students, and will generate its share of law journal commentary). <br /> <br />To begin with, only a small percentage of today&#39;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  I suspect a relatively small percentage of these agreements include the kind of express reference in the arbitration clause to statutory claims that I believe was key to the outcome here.  So the immediate applicability is quite narrow, in terms of the percentage of the workforce - and percentage of statutory discrimination claims - that are directly affected.<br /> <br />Of course, this case might encourage some employers and unions to seek to add such express language to their contracts.  But both sides have reason to prefer not to do so, as well as reasons to consider doing so.  <br /> <br />Those management employment lawyers who are huge fans of arbitration, and have been encouraging clients for years to make individual employees sign arbitration agreements, will no doubt see this decision as a major victory for employers and will encourage clients to push for this type of language at the bargaining table. I have never been in that category.  I have been leery of expanded arbitration of employment claims because there are a number of significant negatives to such arbitration, not the least of which is losing two additional opportunities to win: summary judgment and appeal (appeal from arbitration being technically available, but normally worthless).<br /> <br />Employers may not want to agree to arbitration of discrimination claims because it may encourage and facilitate more employees to pursue such claims, albeit in a less costly forum. In the collective bargaining context, if labor-management relations deteriorate, or if they have a long history of hostility, the grievance arbitration process becomes as much about the union creating annoyance and cost for the employer and demonstrating power to employees as about the pursuit of just resolution of legitimate disputes.  In this view, drastic expansion of the coverage of the arbitration clause amounts to handing the union a new weapon.  On the other hand, in a properly managed company, the great majority of discrimination claims disappear following an appropriate response to an agency investigation, which can probably be prepared less expensively than an arbitration.<br /> <br />For their part, unions may not be interested in arbitration of statutory discrimination claims because the possibility of such arbitration may entangle them in too many situations in which the primary conflict is between the respective interests of members rather than between the membership as a whole (or substantial parts thereof) on the one hand and the employer on the other, raising the specter of duty of fair representation claims. <br /> <br />I have a hard time imagining the issue being of enough value to either party to be worth bargaining hard for, or trading economic contract items for, if the other side is opposed to making the change.<br /> <br />So, in practical terms, we are left with the question of whether future collective bargaining negotiations will yield a significant trend of including statutory claims in the arbitration clauses of more contracts, now that their legal status has been clarified.  I&#39;m skeptical, given that I see much bigger fish to fry as unions and employers struggle to cope with current major economic challenges. <br /> <br />If my skepticism is proven correct, this case will be another example of the Court having chosen to grant certiorari on a case that it found interesting and challenging, but that had little lasting significance.&quot;<br />

		<title>Pakistan&#039;s acceptance of Sharia law in Swat Valley signals weakness to militants</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Baseer Naveed</strong> [Senior researcher, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>]: &quot;The government of Pakistan has surrendered before the Islamic militants and the Taliban by entering into an unconstitutional agreement with the Islamic militants operating in the country.  On April 13, 2009, Pakistan&#39;s National Assembly and President <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/pakistan-president-signs-legislation-to.php">implemented an Islamic code of practice</a>, known as the Nizam-e-Adl Regulation (NAR).  The resolution, passed without any debate in the assembly, is an attempt by the government to purchase peace in the Swat valley, a region in the northern-western part of the country, that shares a boundary with Afghanistan.<br /><br />Prior to this, the government had signed an agreement with the Tehreek-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi (TNSM) on February 17, 2009.  The agreement signed between the government of Pakistan and the TNSM outlines the implementation of Sharia law in the region. When Pakistan&#39;s President, Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, decided to present the resolution to the country&#39;s parliament, the Taliban and the Muslim militant organizations operating in the country threatened the parliamentarians.  The militant organizations stated that anyone in the national assembly who opposes the resolution would be declared an apostate and a non-Muslim.  One political party, the MQM, who has opposed the NAR, was declared as anti-Islamic party by the head of the TNSM.<br /><br />The agreement signed between the government of Pakistan and the TNSM in February was known as the Malakand Accord.  The Malakand Accord calls for the withdrawal of the Pakistan army from the Swat valley, the release all Taliban prisoners, the withdrawal of criminal cases registered against Taliban leaders and members, and the imposition of Sharia law in Malakand Agency.  The Malakand Accord was meant to cover the Malakand Agency, which is a region that encompasses more than one-third of the NWFP.<br /><br />In order to force the government to implement the Nizam-e-Adl, the Muslim militants abducted and killed more than 400 security personnel, including army men, during this year.  In addition, a large area of the valley came under Muslim militancy and many people lost their lives. It is estimated that more than 350 schools were destroyed. Women are not allowed to go outside their residence without a male companion who is related to the woman by blood. A girl found to be accompanying her father-in-law was flogged in public by the Muslim militants. More than 500 lawyers are prohibited from going to the court. The militants have displaced more than 250,000 persons from their homeland.<br /><br />The head of TNSM, Maulana Soofi Mohammad, along with 30 of his henchmen were convicted on April 24, 2002 for inciting people to cross over into Afghanistan to fight against the US forces and for violating state restrictions.  Mohammad was sentenced to a ten year term of imprisonment, but has been out of prison since 2005. His son in law, Maulana Fazlullah, is the head of the Pakistani Taliban. Fazlullah has refused to agree to the peace deal until the whole country is Talibanised. The government of Pakistan has denied that the Taliban has anything to do with the Swat negotiations. The government claims that its negotiations are with the TNSM.<br /><br />After the NAR was passed in the national assembly, the bomb blasts and suicide attacks on security personnel have increased. More than 50 people, the majority of them security personnel, were killed in NWFP. In addition, the Taliban has assumed control of a vast area in the neighboring city of Buneer. According to media reports, the Taliban is grabbing private property and is recruiting youth into their army. In another city, Bannu, the Taliban destroyed a girls&#39; school. The people of Bannu are migrating to other parts of the country, particularly to Karachi, the capital of the Sindh province.<br /><br />It is difficult to assume that there would be any peace in the North West Frontier Province as the militants will continue to implement their own system of law in the presence of Nizam-e-Adl. Mohammad, the head of the TNSM, has announced that with the signing of the Nizam-e-Adl, the judges of the civilian courts are non-functional and their appointments redundant. Mohammad has further declared that only those having knowledge of Shari&#39;ah law and practices would be allowed to adjudicate matters.<br /><br />In a press conference held on April 15, Mohammad said that the Qazi courts (Islamic courts) would dispose of cases in line with Sharia. By referring to Sharia, Mohammad was referring to the Taliban&#39;s interpretation of Sharia. He said, that their verdicts could not be challenged in the High Court or at the Supreme Court. He claimed that Darul Qaza (higher courts) should be set up at the divisional level as a final court.<br /><br />On the other hand, Mr. Muslim Khan, the spokesperson of the Pakistani Taliban, in an interview to Reuters, said that the Pakistani Taliban will not lay down their arms in the northwestern valley as part of a deal that included the introduction of Sharia law.  Instead, Mr. Khan stated that they will spread their activities to new areas. Mr. Khan stated that, &quot;Sharia doesn&#39;t permit us to lay down arms, if a government, either in Pakistan or in Afghanistan, continues anti-Muslim policies... Taliban laying down arms is out of question.&quot; Khan further said &quot;...we will push into new areas...when we achieve our goal at one place we move further to other areas.&quot;<br /><br />It is a clear indication that the Muslim fundamentalist groups operating in Pakistan will continue their efforts to change the country into a fundamentalist Muslim state run by the militants. The NAR was possible only because of pressure from the military of Pakistan.  Pakistan&#39;s military is scared to enter into the area where more than 1500 army personnel were killed during the previous five year effort to curb the militancy of fundamentalist groups. Many members of the National Assembly tried to oppose the NAR regulation in the National Assembly. However, the government dissuaded them with the argument that such an act of surrender is required to prevent Islamabad, the capital of country, from falling into the hands of the Taliban. The opposing members were asked to abstain from voting and were forced to be absent.<br /><br />The government of Pakistan and the members of the National Assembly have passed the regulation and have proved that they are weak before the militants, who challenge the writ of the state. The government has surrendered before the threats of the non-state actors, who have taken-up arms, and has allowed the population to be held hostage by these militants in the name of a particular Muslim sect.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.fakhravar.com/Biography.html"><strong>Amir A. Fakhravar</strong></a> [Director of International Affairs, <a href="http://futurefreeiran.com/">Council for a Democratic Iran</a>]: &quot;&quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MChlT0GvFPM">Iran, a Nation of Bloggers</a>&quot; is the name of a short animated film that I saw a few days ago. In only 100 seconds, Mr. Aaron pointed out a subject that has remained out of sight amid the commotions over Iran&#39;s nuclear program - the power of the Iranian youth and the bloggers of today&#39;s Iran.  On March 18, 2009, the news of the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/imprisoned-iran-blogger-commits-suicide.php">killing of a young blogger</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sycN8S_GzGM&feature=related">Omid Reza MirSayafi</a>, in the infamous Evin prison resonated throughout the world media.<br /><br />The courts in Iran had sentenced him to two years in prison and had convicted him for &quot;insulting Ayatollah Khomeini and Ayatollah Khamenei.&quot;  The death of MirSayafi drew the world&#39;s attention to Iranian bloggers.  His body was buried the following day so as to prevent any kind of post mortem medical examination. Words of support and praise for the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic and the government plus the usual words of contempt for the regime&#39;s opposition groups were then printed in his <a href="http://rooznegaar.blogfa.com/">weblog</a>.<br /> <br />Now, the question is when did blogging start in Iran and when did it reach its height.  In April 2000, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during a public speech in Tehran&#39;s Mossala, ordered the closing down the publications that criticized his policies. He named them &quot;the enemy&#39;s headquarters&quot;! Thus, 100 publications were shut down immediately, thousands of weblogs popped up and replaced them.<br /><br />In February of 2000, the Financial Times published an in-depth article on the Iranian bloggers.  According to the article, the main reason young Iranians turn to writing in weblogs is a combination of the lack of freedom of speech and the staggering unemployment rate that has given this generation all the time in the world to contemplate different issues. The statistics are baffling.  Iran has a population of 70 million, of which 15 million are subscribed to Internet providers.  But the number of web log writers is amazingly high. According to &quot;Reporters without Borders&quot; that ranks countries in relation to freedom of press, Iran stands at number 166 out of 169, with only Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea lagging behind.  On the other hand, Iran ranks very high in having the most bloggers, second only to China.<br /> <br />In today&#39;s Iran, there are more than 3 million bloggers and this number increases every day. Young Iranians, who face many hindrances from the government, even in the most private aspects of their personal lives, break all forbidden barriers on their weblogs and write about everything you can imagine. Blogging in Iran is both a means for emotional release for reducing social, political, cultural and financial pressures and a relatively safe podium for criticizing the government&#39;s policies. On the other side, many of the regime&#39;s supporters create their own weblogs, supporting the regime, in an effort to offset the effects of the opposition&#39;s web logs and this is one of their tools in confronting the youth that seeks freedom.<br /> <br />In Iran, the connection speed has been reduced to the lowest level possible so that access to the free world will become all the more difficult for the young generation.  The government regularly filters anti-government weblogs along with websites such as Facebook, YouTube and any website that contains what they consider &quot;pornographic contents.&quot;  This includes many fashion websites. It is virtually impossible for the government to completely cut off access to the Internet for doing so will cause huge problems, not to mention the fact that there are numerous applications of the Internet that they are using themselves. In addition, the current leadership&#39;s young children who are the main proponents of their revolutionary fathers ironically pay more attention to and engage the modern world. <br /> <br />The most famous internet servers that are inconspicuously controlled by the secret service are &quot;Blogfa&quot; and &quot;Persian Blog.&quot; Each contains over a million weblogs.  &quot;Blogfa&quot; started its operations through Canadian servers in December 2004 and has been the preferred site by far since 2005. It is the largest provider of weblogs among all Iranian sites. Of course, there are rumors that the 30 year old director of &quot;Blogfa&quot;, Alireza Shirazi, is under pressure from the secret service for his cooperation in identifying anti-government bloggers. <br /> <br />Nahid Kalhor, a 23 year old biology major in Qum University and one of the leaders of the &quot;Confederation of Iranian Students&quot;, was arrested in June 2008 through this very cooperation of the management of &quot;Blogfa&quot; with the secret service in providing them with her personal information that was cached in her weblog.  The &quot;Confederation of Iranian Students&quot; is the biggest student group opposing the clerics&#39; regime and is active throughout the world. Weblogs are the main means of communication between members and the leadership.  Nahid&#39;s weblog titled &quot;<a href="http://www.freedomisnotfree.blogfa.com/">Freedom is not Free</a>&quot; is being controlled by the secret service since her arrest.  With the <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE13/090/2008/en/a838dd6a-482d-11dd-a377-f5461cc8d4de/mde130902008eng.html">support of Amnesty International</a>, Nahid was temporarily released from prison and disappeared a few days later.  To date, no one knows of her whereabouts.<br /> <br />For a few years now, millions of young bloggers have brought forth a big dilemma for the mullahs of how to suppress the weblogs and, now, the death of a blogger in prison marks a new wave of violent reaction against the bloggers by the Islamic Republic.  However, the speed with which Iranian weblogs are growing raises the hope and prospect that, with the help of weblogs and satellite media, the young generation will have the means for establishing a &quot;free and democratic Iran&quot; in a revolution yet to come.&quot;<br />

		<title>Piracy off the Horn of Africa underscores need for restored order in Somalia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dr. Gentian Zyberi</strong> [Lecturer on International Law of Human Rights, Netherlands Institute of Human Rights, <a href="http://www.uu.nl/NL/faculteiten/rebo/organisatie/departementen/departementrechtsgeleerdheid/Pages/default.aspx">Utrecht School of Law</a>]: &quot;Piracy is not a new phenomenon. It has existed for probably as long as sailing itself. While it was largely believed to be something of the past, it has made a notorious comeback in the last decade or so. Piracy is a domestic crime, besides being a crime under the law of nations attracting universal jurisdiction. From the kidnapping of Julius Caesar in 75 B.C. to nowadays piracy has been rather disruptive at times, especially with regard to commercial shipping and freedom of navigation. Obviously, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/us-coast-guard-chief-calls-for.php">in the case at hand</a>, Somalia&#39;s extreme poverty and the lack of an effective central government make it an ideal breeding ground for piracy.<br /><br />The US, together with France, Britain and other European nations have co-authored UN resolutions authorizing the use of force to combat Somali pirates. And France, Britain, Germany, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands have all contributed ships alongside the US to the Combined Task Force, whose mission includes preventing piracy off the Horn of Africa. The Russian Federation, China, India and Japan have also sent their warships in that area. However, despite their presence there have already been 74 attacks and 15 hijackings in 2009, compared with 111 attacks last year. And there are more than 200 international sailors currently being held captive on the seas. A sizeable international armada of warships is policing the waters off the coast of Somalia. But is that enough to stop piracy off the Horn of Africa?<br /><br />The Transitional Government of Somalia in a letter to the President of the Council - requested international assistance in its efforts to address the acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships off the coast of Somalia. In a Chapter VII Resolution, unanimously adopted, the Security Council decided that the States cooperating with the country&#39;s transitional government would be allowed, for a period of six months, to enter the territorial waters of Somalia and use &quot;all necessary means&quot; to repress acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea, in a manner consistent with relevant provisions of international law. Further, <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9344.doc.htm">Resolution 1816</a> (2008) of June 2, 2008 called upon States to cooperate in determining jurisdiction, and in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for acts of piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia, consistent with applicable international law including international human rights law (See also Resolutions 1814 (2008), 1838 (2008), 1844 (2008),  1846 (2008) and 1851 (2008)). The situation in Somalia was addressed in a more comprehensive way by the Security Council in <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,UNSC,,,497839f92,0.html">Resolution 1863</a> (2009) of January 16, 2009. Among others, in this resolution the Security Council expressed its intent to establish a United Nations Peacekeeping Operation in Somalia as a follow-on force to AMISOM, subject to a further decision of the Security Council by June 1, 2009.<br /><br />Seemingly, the 21st century&#39;s threats to peace and security are more likely to come from failed states and their desperate young men, rather than modern militaries boasting flotillas of warships, formations of tanks and fleets of aircraft. It is to be hoped that a comprehensive effort of the international community, based on the political solution to the crisis in Somalia resulting in the end of armed confrontation between warring factions, along with economic assistance and UN and African peace-keeping forces on the ground, will finally bring Somalia back to its feet and put an end to piracy. Until then, unfortunately, acts of piracy will continue unabated in that part of the world.&quot;<br />

		<title>Tokyo court&#039;s ruling on anthem controversy impinges on freedom of thought in Japanese public schools</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ayami Toda</strong> [member, <a href="http://niben.jp/english/index.html">Daini Tokyo Bar Association</a>]: &quot;The Tokyo District Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/japan-court-rejects-suit-challenging.php">rejected</a> the teachers&#39; demands simply on the ground that as public officers, they should obey the order which was given regarding their official duties, even while it said that to order all the teachers, without exception, to sing &quot;Kimigayo&quot; (which means &quot;His Majesty&#39;s Reign&quot;) while standing and facing the national flag may cause infringement of the teachers&#39; freedom of thought and conscience. <br /><br />In this case, the plaintiffs argued that: <br /><br />1. Teachers should provide students with various values on the national anthem and the flag and empower them to choose their own thoughts for the development of their personalities; <br /><br />2. Teachers themselves, who are responsible for such education, should be guaranteed their own freedom of thoughts and conscience; and<br /><br />3. Education Law stipulates that the administrative power should not take unjust control of education.<br /><br />However, the court only emphasized the necessity of singing the national anthem at the school ceremonies, but totally lacked any understanding of the necessity of developing the children&#39;s freedom of thought in the course of public school education or the guarantee of teachers&#39; freedom of thought and conscience. This ruling should be noted as a problematic one that allows the infringement of freedom of thoughts and conscience in Japanese public schools.&quot;<br />

		<title>Conviction of Peru&#039;s former President Fujimori is part of growing international justice movement</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Andrew Hudson</strong> [Senior Associate, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/defenders/hr_defenders.aspx">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/peru-ex-president-fujimori-convicted-of.php">conviction</a> of former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori for serious human rights violations is groundbreaking on a number of levels.<br /><br />First, not only was a former head of state found guilty of crimes against humanity, but his conviction came at the hands of a court is his own nation. The Peruvian Court displayed remarkable independence, capability and determination in a country where authoritarianism had reigned until quite recently.<br /><br />Second, Fujimori&#39;s conviction has enormous precedential and deterrent value, demonstrating that even heads of state can be convicted for human rights crimes. Hopefully the decision paves the way for prosecutions in other Latin American countries, such as Guatemala, where impunity reigns and prosecutors have failed to investigate high-level figures for culpability in atrocities. The decision must have concerned President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, against whom an arrest warrant has been issued by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and former President of Chad, Hissen Habre, who is awaiting trial in Senegal.<br /><br />Third, the conviction arguably only came about because of the inter-American system on human rights, demonstrating its enormous value. In a pioneering decision in 2001, known as the <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/IACHR/2001/5.html">Barrios Altos case</a>, the Inter-American Court on Human Rights struck down the amnesty law that Peru had passed and which had prevented prosecution for the crimes committed by Fujimori. For the first time an international court held that amnesties for serious human rights violations breach international law because &quot;they violate non-derogable rights recognized by international human rights law.&quot; It prompted now-extensive legal jurisprudence that amnesties are impermissible for serious human rights violations. It also provided Peruvian prosecutors with an extremely useful judgment to prove Fujimori&#39;s culpability. Prosecutors chose the Barrios Altos massacre as one of the emblematic violations upon which to rest their successful prosecution of Fujimori.<br /><br />Fourth, the case demonstrates the increasing willingness of third-party nations to arrest and extradite former heads of state. In 2005, having fled Peru, Fujimori attempted to return, thinking he could again achieve success in elections. However, he was arrested in Chile en-route to Peru and extradited in 2007. Fujimori&#39;s decision to return to Peru was a spectacular political miscalculation. Future heads of state accused of mass atrocity are unlikely to make the same mistake.<br /><br />Fujimori&#39;s landmark conviction is a step forward for international justice and part of a growing international movement to hold former heads of state accountable for serious human rights violations.&quot;<br />

The <a href="http://72.3.233.244/pdfs/safefree/olc_08012002_bybee.pdf">second Bybee memo</a> was apparently a "cover" memo to memorialize "previous oral advice" in July 2002 regarding use of "ten ["SERE"] techniques" for interrogation and to assuage evident concern that persons who authorize, facilitate, or use them might be prosecuted under the torture statute.<br /><br /> The advice was manifestly erroneous with respect to use of at least two interrogation tactics, waterboarding and the "box."  The Bybee memo admitted and necessarily warned that waterboarding "produces the perception of 'suffocation and incipient panic'" and "constitutes a threat of imminent death."  Furthermore, persons undergoing SERE training are aware of "precautions," the memo notes, but the waterboarded detainee in CIA control will not be aware of "precautions" while admittedly experiencing "incipient panic" and the "threat of imminent death."<br /><br /> Additionally, the Bybee memo admitted and necessarily warned that placing a human being in a "small confinement box" "without light" for "two hours" can cause pain and mental harm, but argued that it would not cause "substantial" physical pain, "substantial" interference with the individual's cognitive abilities, or "fundamentally" alter his personality.  Along with the "box," there was to be an "introduction of an insect" that foreseeably can cause "trepidation" (i.e., dread or even terror) in a person who was admittedly expected "to have a fear of insects."<br /><br /> The memo was clearly designed to facilitate use of waterboarding and use of the "box" and a fear-enhancing insect during interrogation and expressly noted their unavoidable and probable effects.  As such, the second Bybee memo is another smoking gun.  It documents knowledge of the factual quality of international crime and provides clear evidence of criminal responsibility, not merely with respect to those who authorized and used these techniques, but also with respect to those who were aware of the fact that their memo would facilitate the proposed use of such forms of ill-treatment and what would be their actual and probable effects.  As noted in a new article, <a href="/pdf/paustfinal.pdf">The Absolute Prohibition of Torture</a>, criminal complicity can occur when a memo writer is aware that his or her conduct can or will facilitate conduct of a direct perpetrator.  The person who aids and abets need not know that the conduct of the direct perpetrator is criminal or whether it does in fact constitute "torture" or some other widely-known criminally proscribed conduct such as cruel or inhumane treatment.  As international criminal tribunals have affirmed, it suffices that an accused was aware of the relevant factual circumstances and "need not have known that his or her act ... amounted to an 'inhumane act' either in the legal or moral sense." <br /><br /> The advice in the second Bybee memo was also facially erroneous, shoddy, and seriously unprofessional.  It was facially erroneous because (1) physical pain that is "severe" within the definition of torture (addressing "severe physical or mental pain or suffering") manifestly need not occur over "a protracted period of time;" (2) physical "suffering" that is "severe" manifestly need not occur over "a protracted period of time;" and (3) mental harm that is "severe" within the definition of torture need not "disrupt profoundly" or "fundamentally" change a person's personality.  As noted in my new article, advice that is manifestly in error can provide no cover.<br /><br /> The advice was shoddy and unprofessional in several respects.  First, the advice was memorialized in connection with a request from CIA to use waterboarding, the "box" and a fear-enhancing insect, and other tactics for interrogation of a detainee held outside the United States.  The CIA "asked ... whether certain proposed conduct would violate" the torture statute.  It must have been clear to a professional, however, that the torture statute would not pose the only legal obstacle to use of the tactics the CIA had in mind and that far more than torture is criminally proscribed.  For example, torture, cruel, and inhumane treatment are proscribed under two sets of federal statutes that allow prosecution of relevant customary and treaty-based laws of war, but there was no attention to such legislation or to any laws of war in the second Bybee memo.  Torture, cruel, and inhumane treatment are also proscribed under the Convention Against Torture, and foreign states and international tribunals can prosecute such conduct, but there was no attention to any international agreement, customary international law in any relevant form, or the clear possibility of prosecution in foreign and international fora.  There was merely a facially improper reading of one U.S. federal statute.  Such advice, in view of clearly relevant law criminally proscribing cruel and inhumane treatment as well as torture and the CIA's request to use certain tactics abroad where foreign jurisdiction pertains, was at best shoddy and seriously unprofessional.  <br /><br /> Second, instead of using computer-assisted research to identify, for example, whether waterboarding, the water cure, or related forms of induced suffocation are "torture" (much less cruel or inhumane treatment), the Bybee memo states that it was "drawing upon" a few cases decided under the Torture Victims Protection Act.  Several easily discoverable federal and state court cases documented in my new article make clear that waterboarding is a form of "torture."  Moreover, easily discoverable U.S. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices of various countries published by the U.S. Department of State and available on-line prior to the second Bybee memo and for years thereafter make clear that waterboarding is known by the Executive to be a form of "torture."  Additionally, federal cases addressing cruel treatment in violation of the Eighth Amendment clearly demonstrate that use of waterboarding would also constitute cruel treatment.  Discoverable cases and Executive Country Reports on Human Rights also demonstrate that a "threat of imminent death" constitutes torture. <br /> <br /> Since the second Bybee memo only addressed possible cover with respect to one federal statute that addresses torture, it was clearly in no way a shield with respect to possible criminal liability under two forms of legislation allowing prosecution of war crimes, which include not merely torture but also cruel or inhumane treatment.  Since relevant federal and state court cases and Executive Country Reports were easily discoverable by a lawyer (and the Bybee memo was a lawyer to lawyer memo!), I assume that the memo can in no way provide cover to a lawyer in the Bush Administration.  Additionally, the Bybee memo was clearly in no way a potential shield with respect to violations of various treaty-based and customary international law prosecutable in foreign courts that
can exercise universal jurisdiction over international crime or in the International Criminal Court.  <br /><br /> Far from providing real cover, the newly disclosed smoking gun provides further evidence of serial criminality and demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt why a memo writer is reasonably accused of complicity whether or not he knew that certain conduct would be "torture."<br /> <br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/faculty_m_cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law says that President Obama&#39;s expressed intent to immunize CIA employees who violated US laws banning torture and cruel treatment while interrogating prisoners breaches the President's constitutional duty to &quot;take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed&quot; and warrants the appointment of a special independent prosecutor by Congress to do what the law requires...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/cohncolor.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n response to a Freedom of Information Act request by the ACLU, President Obama has released four Bush-era memos that describe unimaginably brutal techniques and provide "legal" justification for clearly illegal acts of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In the face of monumental pressure from the CIA to keep them secret, Obama demonstrated great courage in deciding to make the grotesque memos public. At the same time, however, in an attempt to pacify the intelligence establishment, Obama said, "it is our intention to assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice that they will not be subject to prosecution." He guaranteed free legal representation for CIA employees investigated by Congress or international tribunals, and indemnification for any financial judgments rendered against them.<br /><br />Obama's intent to immunize those who violated our laws banning torture and cruel treatment violates the President's constitutional duty to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."<br /><br /><strong>The memos</strong><br /><br />The memo dated August 1, 2002 was signed by Jay Bybee, and the other three memos, dated May 10, 2005, were signed by Stephen Bradbury.<br /><br />In startlingly clinical and dispassionate terms, the authors of the newly-released torture memos describe and then rationalize why the devastating techniques the CIA sought to employ on human beings do not violate the Torture Statute (18 U.S.C. sec. 2340). <br /><br />The memos justify 10 techniques, including banging heads into walls 30 times in a row, prolonged nudity, repeated facial and abdominal slapping, dietary manipulation, and dousing with cold water as low as 41 degrees. They allow shackling in a standing position for 180 hours, sleep deprivation for 11 days, confinement of people in small dark boxes with insects for hours, and waterboarding to create the perception they are drowning. Moreover, the memos permit many of these techniques to be used in combination for a 30-day period. They find that none of these techniques constitute torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.<br /><br />Waterboarding, admittedly the most serious of the methods, is designed, according to Bybee, to induce the perception of "suffocation and incipient panic, i.e. the perception of drowning." But although Bybee finds that "the use of the waterboard constitutes a threat of imminent death," he accepts the CIA's claim that it does "not anticipate that any prolonged mental harm would result from the use of the waterboard." As psychologist Jeffrey Kaye points out, the CIA and the Justice Department "ignored a wealth of other published information" that indicates dissociative symptoms, changes greater than those in patients undergoing heart surgery, and drops in testosterone to castration levels after acute stress associated with techniques that the memos sanction. <br /><br />The Torture Statute punishes conduct, or conspiracy to engage in conduct, specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering. "Severe mental pain or suffering" means the prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from either the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering, or from the threat of imminent death.<br /><br />Bybee asserts that "if a defendant acts with the good faith belief that his actions will not cause such suffering, he has not acted with specific intent." He makes the novel claim that the presence of personnel with medical training who can stop the interrogation if medically necessary "indicates that it is not your intent to cause severe physical pain." <br /><br />Now a federal judge with lifetime appointment, Bybee concludes that waterboarding does not constitute torture under the Torture Statute. However, he writes, "we cannot predict with confidence whether a court would agree with this conclusion."<br /><br />The Bush administration claimed it only used waterboarding three times. But a footnote in one of Bradbury's memos says waterboarding was utilized "with far greater frequency than initially indicated" with "large volumes of water" rather than small quantities as required by the CIA's rules.<br /><br />Bybee's memo explains why the 10 techniques could be used on Abu Zubaydah, who was considered to be a top Al Qaeda operative. "Zubaydah does not have any pre-existing mental conditions or problems that would make him likely to suffer prolonged mental harm from [the CIA's] proposed interrogation methods," the CIA told Bybee. But Zubaydah was a low-ranking Al Qaeda operative, according to leading FBI counter-terrorism expert Dan Coleman, who advised a top FBI official, "This guy is insane, certifiable, split personality." This was reported by Ron Suskind in his book, <em>The One Percent Doctrine</em>.<br /><br />The CIA's request to confine Zubaydah in a cramped box with an insect was granted by Bybee, who told the CIA it could place a harmless insect in the box and tell Zubaydah that it will sting him but it won't kill him. Even though the CIA knew that Zubaydah had an irrational fear of insects, Bybee found there would be no threat of severe physical pain or suffering if it followed this procedure. <br /><br />Another noxious aspect of these memos is the use of medical professionals to enable the torture and cruel treatment. They are on hand to monitor the victims to make sure they come close to death, but don't actually die. But the medical personnel may well allow the abuse to cause severe physical pain and do nothing to stop it until the victim reaches the point of impending death. One of Bradbury's memos requires that a physician be on duty during waterboarding to perform a tracheotomy in case the victim doesn't recover after being returned to an upright position.<br /><br />Employing a standard used to measure due process violations, Bradbury concluded that "the CIA interrogation techniques, with their careful screening procedures and medical monitoring, do not 'shock the conscience,'" and thus were not cruel, inhuman or degrading. It is difficult to imagine how the techniques described above would fail to shock the conscience of any human being.<br /><br /><strong>Obama's refusal to faithfully execute the law</strong><br /><br />The Constitution requires the President to enforce the law against both the petty thief who stole salmon from the market and the CIA agent who tortured or abused a prisoner. <br /><br />Our law prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and requires that those who subject people to such treatment be prosecuted. The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment compels us to refer all torture cases for prosecution or extradite the suspect to a country that will undertake a criminal investigation. The Geneva Conventions proclaim an "obligation" to bring those who have committed torture and cruel treatment before our "own courts." The Torture Convention and the Geneva Conventions are both part of U.S. law under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which says, "all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Two federal statutes &#8212;
 the Torture Statute and the War Crimes Act (torture is a war crime) - provide for life imprisonment and even the death penalty if the victim dies from torture.<br /><br />Obama has made a political calculation to seek amnesty for the CIA torturers. He expressed his "intention" to protect people who relied in good faith on Justice Department advice. However, good faith reliance on superior orders was rejected as a defense at Nuremberg and in Lt. Calley's Vietnam-era trial for the My Lai Massacre. The Torture Convention provides unequivocally, "An order from a superior officer or a public authority may not be invoked as a justification for torture." <br /><br />There is evidence that the CIA was using the illegal techniques as early as April 2002, three to four months before the August memo was written. That would eliminate "good faith" reliance on Justice Department advice as a "defense" to prosecution. And Obama did not say he favored amnesty for those who set the policy &#8212; which would include Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, Powell, Ashcroft and Gonzales who comprised the Principals Committee that authorized the torture and Bush who approved of it. Nor did Obama include in his intended amnesty the lawyers &#8212; like Yoo, Bybee, Bradbury, Addington and Haynes - whose opinions under girded the policy.<br /><br />But the decision about whether and who to prosecute is up to the Attorney General, Eric Holder. If Holder continues to carry out Obama's political agenda by resisting investigations and prosecution, Congress can, and should, authorize the appointment of a special independent prosecutor to do what the law requires. <br /><br />The Watergate scandal led to the enactment of the Ethics in Government Act. Three years after Richard Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment, President Carter asked Congress to pass a law authorizing the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute unlawful acts by high government officials. The bill empowered the attorney general to conduct a preliminary 90-day investigation when serious allegations arose involving a high government official. <br /><br />Under the act, the attorney general could drop the investigation if he determined it was unsupported by the evidence. But if he found some merit to the charges, he was required to apply to a three-judge panel of federal court judges who would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate, prosecute, and issue a report. This procedure was used to appoint Kenneth Starr, whose witch hunt led to Bill Clinton&#39;s impeachment. In reaction, Congress allowed the independent counsel statute to expire by its own terms in 1999. It's time for the people to demand that Congress enact an independent counsel statute.<br /><br /><strong>Universal jurisdiction</strong><br /><br />What happens if the United States government refuses to prosecute those who ordered, justified and carried out the torture and abuse? Other countries will launch criminal investigations of U.S. nationals under universal jurisdiction (see <a href="http://marjoriecohn.com/2009/04/spain-investigates-what-america-should.html">Spain Investigates What America Should</a>). <br /><br />Indeed prosecutors in Spain decided to file criminal charges against Yoo, Bybee, Gonzales, Haynes, Addington and Feith for torture. But in a rare move, Candido Conde-Pumpido, Spain's attorney general, overruled the prosecutors' decision, saying the case had "no merit" because the six men were not present when the abuse took place and it was up to the United States to prosecute.<br /><br />Universal jurisdiction is used to prosecute foreign nationals when their own country refuses to prosecute. Adoph Eichmann, often called "the architect of the Holocaust," was tried, convicted and executed by Israel for crimes unconnected to Israel. He orchestrated the deportations but was not necessarily present at the gas chambers when millions were murdered.<br /><br />Curiously, Conde-Pumpido's decision followed discussions between the U.S. and Spanish governments in which the Obama administration strongly suggested that charges against the six would be "inconvenient," according to Scott Horton of Harpers. Apparently and unfortunately, Obama is following the same tack Bush took by pressuring countries to back down on universal jurisdiction prosecutions. <br /><br />The Spanish case is not dead, however. Judge Baltasar Garzon, who issued the arrest warrant for Augusto Pinochet in 1998, still has the power to determine whether the case will proceed.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is up to Obama to fulfill his constitutional duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed. As he seems inclined to shirk that duty, it is up to us to pressure him, and Congress to hold accountable, those who violate our laws. Obama said that "nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past." He is wrong. There is more to gain from upholding the rule of law. It will make future leaders think twice before they authorize the cruel, illegal treatment of other human beings.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and president of the National Lawyers Guild.

Published reports suggest that a battle is roiling in the highest levels of the government about publicly releasing those memos as well as the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility's allegedly scathing review of the lawyering of the memos&#39; key architects.  It is also reported that the nominations of Dawn Johnsen to head the Office of Legal Counsel and Dean Harold Hongju Koh to be the United States Department of State Legal Adviser are being threatened or held hostage by members of the Senate who are strongly resisting the release of the memos and the review, threatening to "go nuclear."<br /><br />Enough is enough.  It is long past time for citizens to go nuclear on the shucking and jiving by the political class about the release of these memos and this OPR review.  We can guess what they say from the published reports and it is awful.  But, even if it is awful, it is high time that the public no longer be kept in the dark about these key documents of our national embarrassment from the torture policy hatched in late 2001.  After all, these things were said to have been done in our name.<br /><br />If what is reported is true, these memos and review will show us how high-level civilians did authorize the horrendous torture that we have seen discussed for nigh on 5 years now.  These documents will point fingers high up.  These documents will name names high up.  They will force all to answer one question, "What did you do when these things were coming up to avert this long national nightmare?" that started in the late fall 2001 when plans to torture were hatched and implemented.<br /><br />Also, it is beyond the pale that persons outside the government who spoke up forcefully and in a principled manner against the torture policies should now be held up in their confirmation hearings by apologists for torture.  Will these torture enthusiasts whispering in the corridors of power please desist from lengthening this American agony?  The dithering has been so atrocious that the Spanish are ahead of us in opening a criminal investigation into the doings of these high-level lawyers.  Is America so craven at this point?<br /><br />The question is whether the political class will trust the ordinary American citizen with this knowledge or keep trying to run out the clock so only in a distant future, when we are all dead, will the truth be known.  I, as one citizen, want to know NOW.  Let the chips fall where they may.  Enough is enough.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

Reflecting the Obama administration's "new era of engagement," the decision is a welcome reversal of Bush policy.  US participation in the Council holds great promise for the reinvigorated promotion and protection of human rights at the UN.   <br /><br />From its naissance in 2006, the Council was consistently criticized by the Bush administration.  In many respects, the criticism was justified.  Several countries with poor human rights records, including China, Cuba and Saudi Arabia, remain on the forty-seven member Council.  Meetings often feature politicized bluster instead of earnest dialogue on human rights issues.  And the Council has repeatedly and selectively targeted Israel, while failing to address violations in other parts of the world, including the practices of brutal regimes in North Korea and Zimbabwe. <br /><br />But like its predecessor, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council&#39;s failures often cloud its tremendous potential.  The Commission, which first met in 1946, had numerous achievements over its sixty-year history.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the foundational human rights treaties known as the international bill of rights are products of the Commission's work.  Yet the Commission was scrapped in 2006, after decades of autocratic states voting together to block scrutiny of their human rights records.  Criticism and frustration crescendoed when Sudan, in the midst of the genocide in Darfur, was re-elected to the Commission in 2004.  By the end of its run, as described by former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the Commission "cast a shadow on the reputation of the United Nations system as a whole."  <br /><br />As a result, in 2006, the UN General Assembly overhauled the Commission and created the Council by a near-unanimous vote.  Even with new membership standards and other changes targeting the Commission's flaws, the US was one of four countries to vote against the Council's creation.    <br /><br />Three years later, the Obama administration has recognized that US membership is critical and is rightfully turning the page.  As the only global intergovernmental human rights body, the Council offers an indispensable forum for constructive dialogue on human rights issues.  Part of what makes it valuable, however, is that unlike judicial and quasi-judicial human rights bodies in the international system, the Council is an inclusive, participatory forum.  As such, non-complying countries will inevitably continue to seek membership and obstruct the promotion and protection of human rights.  Yet, as a participatory institution, the Council's credibility and authority cannot be adopted or declared.  Nor can it be dogmatically imposed.  Rather, key stakeholders must work actively to build the Council to a position of strength.  The onus is thus on the US and other like-minded states to engage in the debate and to ensure that the Council is a credible force for human rights.    <br /><br />But equally crucial to the Council's credibility and truly universal human rights progress is the continued inclusion of diverse countries and perspectives.  The human rights movement has long been plagued by widespread perception that it consists of Western values being imposed by Western countries.  Although some believe that human rights stem from natural law&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;law that exists as part of nature and requires no codification&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the movement is ultimately an ideological struggle that requires sustained diplomatic engagement.  <br /><br />The Council's innovative Universal Periodic Review ("UPR") process&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;involving a quadrennial review of every UN member state's human rights compliance&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;offers a tremendous opportunity for such engagement.  Unlike the reviews performed in other UN bodies, the UPR is a state-driven process.  Other relevant stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations ("NGOs"), play only a limited role.  Although this premise is often cited as an inherent weakness of the UPR, it should instead be viewed as an invaluable opportunity for intergovernmental dialogue and diplomatic pressure where necessary.  While independent human rights experts and NGOs are well-suited to providing findings and serving as watchdogs, in the end it is only state and intergovernmental actors who are able to speak from positions of strength.  <br /><br />US leadership in the Council could galvanize the UPR process as a meaningful forum for constructive, diplomatic engagement on human rights issues.  Diplomatic engagement can have numerous positive effects, even if countries with poor human rights record remain on the Council, or if no instant resolution is reached with non-complying countries.  Engagement establishes the Council as a forum for future constructive dialogue, shows solidarity with human rights reformers within the country at-issue, and causes most countries, even those denying any violation, to acknowledge the existence and import of international human rights.  In the initial years of the UPR, fear of tu quoque criticism&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;arguments that the reviewing country is also guilty of violations&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;has often led to superficial and ineffectual reviews.  But where reviewing states have been open to discussion and willing to talk about difficult issues, reviews have been productive.  If the US leads the Council to consistently confront difficult issues, the UPR process can live up to its promise and serve a useful purpose in promoting human rights and US interests worldwide.  <br /><br />US presence on the Council is also critical to the development of issues at the vanguard of human rights law.  A prime example is the recent Council examination of the relationship between climate change and human rights.  As the Council continues to grapple with other emergent issues, both the US and the human rights movement would benefit from an active US role.  <br /><br />Nevertheless, even if the US wins a seat in May, instant transformation of the Council should not be expected.  As with other rights movements, global human rights progress will continue to be imperfect and incremental.  There will continue to be debate, disagreement and setbacks.  And where failures at the Council occur, countries, not the institution, will continue to be primarily responsible.  But it is the US, long-regarded as the leader of the human rights movement, which remains in the best position to engage its diplomatic and moral authority to encourage collective promotion of international human rights.  <br /><br />Despite innumerable setbacks, the human rights movement has made great strides since WWII, with much credit due to the UN.  Several comprehensive UN human rights treaties have achieved near-universal ratification and issues are more than ever viewed through a human rights paradigm.  Yet, for continued human rights progress to occur at the UN, the Council will need strong political and diplomatic leadership.  US membership, as part of a new era of US engagement at the UN, would be a welcome development for the continued progress of international human rights.   <br /><br /><br /><em>No

		<title>The Obama Lobbying Directive: Steps in the Right Direction</title>

A denial of the First Amendment rights to speak and petition! Or so the American League of Lobbyists and the American Civil Liberties Union (among others) would have us believe. There is no question that this is an entirely new kind of restriction in the increasingly regulated world of federal lobbying. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that many (though not all) lobbyists are agape at this challenge to their accustomed way of doing business. But, fortunately, novelty does not delineate the boundaries of constitutionality. In fact, the constitutional assertions made against the new Obama directive have little to support them and, as a policy matter, the restrictions imposed make perfect sense. But first a little background.<br /><br />Since the Jack Abramoff scandals of 2004-2006, lobbyists have been on the defensive as Congress has imposed more stringent disclosure obligations with regard to lobbying campaigns and lobbyist fundraising and tightened post-employment rules for former officials turned lobbyists (among other changes wrought by the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007). After a presidential campaign where both candidates appeared to concede the potential baneful influence of lobbyists on how the government operates, one of President Obama's first acts was an executive order to extend and strengthen the then-existing restrictions on former lobbyists occupying high level positions in the executive branch and on those officials when they leave office. But the revolving door has not been shut by Congress or the President (nor is it likely to be shut for a variety of reasons) and, for better or for ill, lobbyists retain the right to raise large sums of money to support candidates for public office. Prior "comradeship" with governmental officials earlier in a professional career and a history of political fundraising remain powerful bases (even if not expressly invoked) on which to gain access to Washington officials and construct arguments on a client's behalf--despite the fact that such factors are hardly relevant to the merits of the governmental decisions sought to be influenced. And, it is submitted, the persuasive power of those associations and fundraising is likely to be particularly strong in a personal meeting or telephone call with an official, more so than in a letter sent to the official. And that is the point of the Obama directive. In fact, the President's memorandum incorporates one further feature to filter out inappropriate attempts at influence: any written lobbyist communication relating to a particular project must be posted by the agency that receives it on the Internet; that posting itself should discourage attempts to invoke, implicitly or explicitly, arguments and factors that do not bear on the merits of the application.<br /><br />It should also be noted in this connection that the President secured a commitment from Congress not to insert special interest earmarks in the stimulus package. Congress obliged and sent the massive stimulus package back to the Administration to be doled out. Meanwhile, lobbying firms became excited with the prospects of winning earmarks from their friends and former colleagues in the executive agencies charged with distributing the funds; clients arrived at their doors and lobby shops increased their staffs, waiting for the moment to seek earmarks. These were the developments that prompted the President's latest directive.<br /><br />In approaching the constitutional arguments raised, the manner in which the directive seeks to achieve its goal must be considered. Lobbyists are permitted to write agency officials anytime in support of their client's application for the public's money; they are even permitted to appear in person before agency officials to argue issues of policy relating to the disbursement of stimulus funds.  They can fully brief their clients prior to meetings or telephone calls with agency officials on legal, political and any other matters possibly relevant to the particular application; and they can follow up meetings with additional missives to agency officials that provide amplifying or clarifying information and arguments that may have been omitted by clients at the meetings (clients must take good notes&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;but that is hardly a terrific burden). However, when it comes to the specifics of a particular proposal--the specifics as to which presumably the client is at least as, and hopefully more, competent than the lobbyist to address--and a meeting or conference call with government officials considering the proposal, the lobbyist's client must speak for itself and on its own. In the context of the entire directive, that would not seem to be a tremendous hardship&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;certainly not one sufficient to establish a violation of the Constitution since the persons most affected by the governments' action are offered the opportunity to make their case in person.<br /> <br />Of course Obama's is not the perfect system. For example, the president of The Southern Company may have raised tons of money for Democratic candidates; he or she may know wagonloads of agency officials personally from prior work in the government or with the government. Nevertheless, he or she can be present at a meeting with executive branch officials seeking funding for a particular alternative energy project. The Obama directive cannot altogether eliminate the phenomenon of "influence peddling" nor can it change the Washington culture in one fell swoop. But it can possibly improve things by small incremental steps, particularly those that strike at the heart of the culture of influence as it has come to exist within the Beltway. <br /><br />So where is the First Amendment in all of this? Well, the fact of the matter is that, while that provision guarantees the right to speak and to petition government officials, it imposes no corresponding duty on those officials (or anyone for that matter) to listen, let alone to consider what is said&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;with one important exception, in the case of judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is in the latter types of instances where the Supreme Court has confronted claims that there is a right to representation, generally by an attorney, claims that are not always upheld, but gain substance from challenges posed to layman by the complexities of legal proceedings whose workings may best be understood by attorneys. But when it comes to petitioning Congress and the executive branch outside of that context, there is no Supreme Court precedent that establishes more than a right to ask, not the right to be listened to and considered. And, when reduced to its essentials, all the Obama directive says is this: "we will listen to both lobbyist and client, but we will listen to the lobbyist on non-policy issues relevant to specific proposals only when they correspond in writing, at ar
ms length, so to speak, in such a fashion as to filter out, as far as feasible, the inappropriate influence of the revolving door and fundraising clout." If the government has no obligation to consider what is said to it, surely it can agree to listen and consider subject to whatever reasonable conditions it may impose. The carefully nuanced limitations on lobbyists imposed by the Obama directive, in light of the purposes of that directive to ensure merit-based decisions on the disbursement of public funds, certainly meet that reasonableness test.<br />  <br />    <br /><br /><em>William V.

Cambodian lawyers must be aware of the latest developments in legal scholarship to understand recent changes in international laws and treaties, whether or not Cambodia is bound by them.<br /><br />Cambodian lawyers&#39; participation in the global market is limited to some extent by language barriers, but as an attorney in Cambodia, I&#39;ve observed that Cambodian lawyers are not even able to take advantage of increased global business opportunities in our own country. Although multi-million-dollar joint ventures, corporations, and banking opportunities have been starting up in the Kingdom of Cambodia, their legal services are usually referred to more sophisticated high-profile law firms in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, or Malaysia. For example, when Shinhan Bank recently needed assistance on complex legal cases, including a substantial loan for the development and construction of a major mining project, they were referred outside of the Cambodian legal profession to a sophisticated regional firm, Allen Arthur Robinson.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-5-758652.bmp"><img style="margin: 4pt 10px 10px 4pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 237px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-5-758633.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>Cambodian law firms and attorneys are viewed as being less-sophisticated and less knowledgeable and are therefore less likely to be trusted. Attorneys often lack a basic understanding of international business, financial operations, and trade, and are therefore unable to address many legal issues and challenges arising in today&#39;s global economy..  Some lawyers struggle with drafting contracts, an area of practice which involves not only legal issues in other nations, but the ability to strategize and assess risks surrounding those legal issues.<br /><br />There are many skills that have become necessary in today&#39;s sophisticated international legal market, and those skills have become necessary in order to fully participate in Cambodian business opportunities as well. To be successful, lawyers have to understand the laws of other jurisdictions and international trade patterns, adapt to a more competitive working environment, and integrate more sophisticated legal tools to more effectively address issues which might arise abroad. In order to make their legal practices sustainable, Cambodian practitioners must continuously enhance their lawyering skills and develop a sophisticated understanding of democratic marketplaces.<br /><br />It is not an easy task for Cambodian legal professionals to catch up on all these skills. However, to survive in today&#39;s &quot;always-on-the-go&quot; legal market, acquiring sophisticated international lawyering skills is a must.<br /><br /><em>* The opinions expressed in this article are entirely those of the author and do not reflect the views of any entity with which the author may be affiliated.</em><br /><br /><font size="2">Photo credits: Dorothy Miller, University of Wisconsin School of Law, JD 2011</font><br />

Nor will it be easy to know who are the winners and who are the losers as the debate and its resolution play out.  Discussion of the legal issues is well underway and the moral issues are also heatedly debated in the evening news.  Then there is the political issue:  Is the Obama Administration&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/white-house-opposes-independent-truth.php">handling of the issue</a> motivated by political concerns?<br /><br />But there is a fourth issue that is now moving onto center stage.  This issue might best be described as practical concerns associated with the &quot;harsh&quot; interrogation techniques used by the CIA:  First, did these interrogation techniques (waterboarding) yield valuable intelligence that, in fact, saved American lives, and that could not have been obtained by other means?  Second, will full and public disclosure of these techniques hurt the security of America by undermining American intelligence collection efforts in the future?   These two questions are briefly addressed in the following paragraphs.   <br /><br />To date, there are only limited details available to answer the first question.  One dramatic example comes from the report of the interrogation of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (mastermind of the 9/11 terrorist attacks). According to the report, under waterboarding, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed gave up details on a &quot;Second Wave&quot; attack using East Asian terrorists to crash a hijacked airliner into a building in Los Angeles.  This operation was interrupted as a direct result of intelligence obtained during his waterboarding interrogation.  Another example is provided by a former CIA officer who handled the interrogation of Abu Zubaida, high-ranking member of Al-Qaida and close associate of Osama Bin Ladin.  According to the Report, after being &quot;defiant and uncooperative&quot; during his initial months of interrogation, Zubaida was subjected to waterboarding and &quot;broke down in about 35 seconds,&quot; providing information that is credited with thwarting several planned Al-Qaida attacks.  Between 2001 and 2003, there were a total of three terrorists subjected to waterboarding:  In addition to Khalikd Sheikh Mohammed and Abu Zubaida, the third and final terrorist to be subjected to CIA waterboarding was Rahim Al-Nashiri, head of Al-Qaeda operations in the Persian Gulf and suspected mastermind behind the attack on the USS Cole. The results of his waterboarding remain classified.  Aside from the above examples, four former CIA Directors have all attested to the value of the intelligence obtained under the CIA&#39;s highly restrictive enhanced interrogation program.                                                                                                                                            <br />The second question, much less well understood by the general public, has to do with the potential impact a detailed public airing of the CIA&#39;s enhanced interrogation techniques could have on the future of American intelligence.  There has been some professional speculation over the impact of telling the enemy what they can expect down the line if they are captured, thus, terrorists and other potential enemies can train their own on how to resist anticipated interrogation techniques.  Certainly, the intelligence that came from NSA&#39;s interceptions of Al-Qaeda cell phone communications immediately after 9/11 was exceedingly valuable in assessing the threat and planning countermeasures; this valuable source of intelligence was abruptly and permanently lost when that intelligence technique was made public in the American Press shortly after 9/11, clearly dealing a serious blow to American intelligence capabilities against Al-Qaeda.  Whether or not telling the terrorists that the CIA&#39;s interrogation threats and related psychological techniques are largely bluffs, will probably not single-handedly render our country&#39;s intelligence capability ineffective.  However, there is another, far more serious hidden threat inextricably woven into any public airing of the CIA&#39;s modus operandi surrounding the identification, tracking, capture, housing, and interrogation of foreign terrorists.  That threat is the inevitable exposure of foreign intelligence services that were directly or indirectly involved in any part of that sequence of events that eventually led to the interrogation.  <br /><br />Following the terrorists attacks of 9/11, the common cry that went up across Capitol Hill and the country was, &quot;Why didn&#39;t we have better intelligence?&quot;  &quot;Why didn&#39;t we connect the dots and prevent what happened on 9/11?&quot;  After agonizing reviews and enough embarrassment to go around, it was eventually acknowledged that, indeed, our overseas intelligence collection capabilities were inadequate, particularly in the terrorism arena.  New initiatives were launched to energize our collection efforts against the terrorist target.  Renewed energy was put into improving or developing new liaison relationships with both friendly and not-so-friendly foreign intelligence services.  This was particularly important in the Middle-East where countries were bluntly told to choose with which side of terrorism they wished to be aligned.  Given the lack of on-the-ground intelligence from this part of the world, these liaison relationships quickly proved extremely valuable in a number of ways, the details of which are better left undisclosed.  However, the value of these enhanced liaison relationships, and in some cases, new relationships with foreign intelligence services opened doors previously closed to American intelligence and have played a significant role in America&#39;s intelligence capabilities, particularly against Al-Qaeda, but also against the broader terrorist target.  <br /><br />It is these relationships that stand to be lost with the public airing of the CIA&#39;s enhanced interrogation program - a program developed and designed specifically for the terrorist target.  Every foreign intelligence service that has cooperated with American intelligence against the terrorist target, at any point along the way, will come to realize that the US Government cannot protect its own secrets, much less guarantee confidentiality to those who work with them in their own countries.   If not out of practical considerations, then domestic political pressure will force both friendly and not-so-friendly foreign intelligence services to rethink the consequences of cooperating with American intelligence.  In the struggle against terrorists, this will be a very costly loss.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/about/staff"><strong>Melanie Sloan</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a>]: &quot;President Obama&#39;s March 20th memorandum aimed at &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2009/04/us-lobbyist-groups-protest-restrictions.php">Ensuring Transparency of Registered Lobbyist Communications</a>,&quot; will not achieve its intended purpose and is an ill-advised restriction on speech.<br /><br />The memo prohibits registered lobbyists from participating in any oral communications, whether in-person or telephonic, with any official in the executive branch concerning any particular project, application, or applicant for funding under the Recovery Act.  This restriction is not, however, imposed on others, who are permitted to communicate with administration officials without even any lesser form of restriction.<br /><br />Most importantly, banning lobbyists from in-person and telephonic communications will not advance the stated purpose of ensuring public transparency and accountability and avoiding improper influence or pressure in the decision-making process.  For example, non-lobbyists employed by potential recipients of Recovery Act funds, who are permitted oral contact with executive branch officials, may well have contributed significant funds to the presidential campaign or to the campaigns of members of Congress who sit on the committees with oversight jurisdiction over the Department of Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the expenditure of Recovery Act funds.  They may hold positions of enormous power in the business world and have influence in Washington far beyond that of the average registered lobbyist.  Also, nothing in this memorandum prevents a member of Congress from attempting to influence a funding decision, such as recently occurred with OneUnited Bank.  Banning lobbyists from engaging in oral communications, but not bank vice presidents, corporate directors, and others who might seek to influence decision makers is unlikely to result in any real public benefit.    <br /><br />Instead of increasing the transparency and accountability, this prohibition will encourage participation by people who are not required to register and abide by the rules set forth in the stringent regulations that govern lobbyists, thereby decreasing transparency and accountability.  Moreover, it will also discourage accurate reporting under the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/Lobbying/Lobby_Disclosure_Act/TOC.htm">Lobbying Disclosure Act</a> - especially for those who are on the cusp for meeting the definitional requirement of a &quot;registered lobbyist.&quot;<br /><br />Second, lobbying is a constitutionally protected activity.  The right to petition the government equally is one of the main tenets of our country&#39;s founding principles.  To state that one class of individuals may not participate in the same manner as all others is clearly a violation and discriminates against an entire group.<br /><br />A better alternative would be to require disclosure of any and all communications with executive branch officials regarding a particular project, application, or applicant for funding.  The name and business affiliation of the individual who engages in an oral communication about such a matter, the name of the official contacted, the date of the contact, and the subject of the contact could all be publicly available, perhaps on the Treasury Department&#39;s website.  Such a transparent process would diminish the possibility of improper contacts while not unnecessarily singling out and punishing registered lobbyists to no apparent benefit.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/staff.xml"><strong>Christopher Holton</strong></a> [Vice President for Administration, Marketing &amp; Development, <a href="http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/index.xml">Center for Security Policy</a>]: &quot;The imposition of <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/somalia-parliament-votes-to-adopt.php">Sharia in Somalia</a> will not bring about stability, unless of course by stability one means the kind of &quot;stability&quot; that came about when the Taliban ascended to power in Afghanistan at the turn of the century. Like Somalia, Afghanistan was also a failed state at the time with warring factions locked in a years-long struggle. But the Taliban brought Sharia with them along with a whole new series of troubles for Afghanistan. The same is likely to be true in Somalia, where, incidentally, Al Qaeda appears to be setting up a new stronghold.<br /><br />The blooming of Sharia is not only an undesirable outcome, it is also the early warning sign of more trouble ahead. Sharia is always followed by violence and oppression. Violence is sometimes quelled through oppression (such as in Saudi Arabia) and in other places (such as Afghanistan) violence remains.<br /><br />Sharia is the main goal of jihadists, such as Al Qaeda, and any deal to allow it in Somalia will almost assuredly benefit the growing Al Qaeda influence there. We have already seen the havoc that Al Qaeda can cause from inside a failed state. In my opinion, the growing influence of Al Qaeda in Somalia and the specter of Sharia arising at the same time is no coincidence because it is Al Qaeda which will benefit the most.<br /><br />Here is some of what Al Qaeda has to say about Sharia...<br /><br />From Osama Bin Laden:<br /><br />&quot;Regarding which shared understandings, exactly, is it possible that we agree with the immoral West?...What commonalities, if our foundations contradict, rendering useless the shared extremities - if they even exist? For practically everything valued by the immoral West is condemned under Sharia law. As for this atmosphere of shared understandings, what evidence is there for Muslims to strive for this? What did the Prophet, the Companions after him, and the righteous forebears do? Did they wage jihad against the infidels, attacking them all over the earth, in order to place them under the suzerainty of Islam in great humility and submission? Or did they send messages to discover &quot;shared understandings&quot; between themselves and the infidels in order that they may reach an understanding whereby universal peace, security, and natural relations would spread - in such a satanic manner as this? The Sharia provides a true and just path, securing Muslims, and providing peace to the world.<br /><br />...Offensive Jihadis (are) an established and basic tenet of this religion. It is a religious duty rejected only by the most deluded. So how can they call off this religious obligation [Offensive Jihad], while imploring the West to understandings and talks &quot;under the umbrella of justice, morality, and rights?&quot; The essence of all this comes from right inside the halls of the United Nations, instead of the Divine foundations that are built upon hating the infidels, repudiating them with tongue and teeth till they embrace Islam or pay the jizya [tribute] with willing submission and humility.... Muslims, and especially the learned among them, should spread Sharia Law to the world - that and nothing else. Not laws under the &quot;umbrella of justice, morality, and rights&quot; as understood by the masses. No, the Sharia of Islam is the foundation.<br /><br />They say that our Sharia does not impose our particular beliefs upon others; this is a false assertion. For it is, in fact, part of our religion to impose our particular beliefs upon others.<br /><br />Thus whoever refuses the principle of terror[ism] against the enemy also refuses the commandment of Allah the Exalted, the Most High, and His Sharia.&quot;<br /><br />And from Ayman al-Zawahiri:<br /><br />&quot;The Sharia has forbidden us from taking infidels as confidants, inducting them into our secrets.<br /><br />The Sharia forbids us from appointing infidels to important posts.<br /><br />The Sharia forbids us from adopting or praising the beliefs and views of the infidels.<br /><br />The Sharia forbids us from assisting infidels against Muslims; even the one who is coerced has no excuse to fight under the banner of the infidels.<br /><br />The Sharia commands us to battle infidels. As for waging jihad against those infidels who have usurped the lands of Islam, this is a duty considered second only to faith, by ulemaic consensus.<br /><br />The Sharia does not accept the excuses made by the hypocrites - that they befriend the infidels because they fear the vicissitudes of time.<br /><br />We are duty bound by the Sharia to help Muslims overcome infidels.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tamara Taraciuk Broner</strong> [Researcher, Americas Division, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;Mexican President Felipe Calder&oacute;n has relied heavily on the armed forces to fight drug-related violence and organized crime.  The need to improve public security is clear. Mexico is facing violent turf battles among powerful drug cartels, an influx of sophisticated weapons, and a large number of kidnappings and executions in several states. <br /><br />While engaging in law enforcement activities, Mexico&#39;s armed forces have committed serious <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/rights-group-urges-mexico-to-hold.php">human rights violations</a>, including enforced disappearances, killings, torture, rapes, and arbitrary detentions.  Such horrific crimes destroy public trust, undermining rather than furthering efforts to curb drug-related violence and improve public security.  <br /><br />An important reason such abuses continue is that, in practice, Mexico allows military officers involved in law enforcement activities to commit human rights violations with impunity.  It tolerates the military investigating itself through a system that lacks basic safeguards to ensure independence and impartiality.  <br /><br />Human Rights Watch issued a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/04/28/uniform-impunity">report</a> last week that describes 17 cases involving egregious crimes by soldiers against more than 70 victims, including several cases from 2007 and 2008. None of the military investigations of army abuses analyzed in the report has led to a criminal conviction for even a single soldier on human rights violations. The only civilian investigation into any of these cases led to convictions of four soldiers. <br /><br />The military invokes the Code of Military Justice and a strained constitutional interpretation to justify exerting jurisdiction over the cases. Civilian prosecutors have typically accepted the military&#39;s jurisdiction grab. But this outcome is not prescribed by Mexico&#39;s Constitution and is in inconsistent with a recent binding Supreme Court decision. And international law is clear that serious human rights abuses must be subject to effective, independent investigation and prosecution, standards that the Mexican military justice system manifestly does not meet. <br /><br />The Calder&oacute;n administration should ensure that serious military abuses against civilians are prosecuted by civilian officials in civilian courts.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=722235"><strong>Jernej Letnar &Auml;&#338;erni&Auml;</strong></a> [Researcher, <a href="http://pravniinstitut.si/index_en.html">Institute for European, Constitutional, International Law and Law of Economics</a>]: &quot;The US government published in February 2009 its decision that it will not renew its contract with the private security corporation formerly known as <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/blackwater-security-firm-ends-baghdad.php">Blackwater Worldwide</a>. Such a decision comes as no surprise given the allegations of killing 17 civilians by Blackwater guards, coupled with the Iraqi government&#39;s refusal to extend Blackwater&#39;s operating license. This case, however, opens again a number of  conundrums relating to legal accountability for corporations and its employees for human rights violations. In short, how do we provide effective legal remedies to victims for human rights violations by or involving corporations? This comment therefore briefly explores the weaknesses of the current framework for corporate accountability for human rights.<br /><br />The international human rights regime is comprised of only complementary national legal systems. Beyond international human rights regimes, an important role is played by national legal systems and national courts. It appears that where corporations and their employees interfere with the human rights of individuals, complaint mechanisms are required to be employed to provide remedies for allegations. Judicial mechanisms, non-judicial mechanisms and internal corporate monitoring mechanisms can contribute to the effective responses to human rights violations by or involving corporations.<br /><br />Lack of access to the legal orders is still the major obstacle to the enjoyment of individual human rights. The regulatory framework for corporate responsibility on the international level remains unclear. John Ruggie, the UN Special Representative for Business and Human Rights <a href="http://www.reports-and-materials.org/Ruggie-report-7-Apr-2008.pdf">recognizes</a> [PDF file] that &quot;judicial mechanisms are often under-equipped to provide effective remedies for victims of corporate abuse.&quot; Enforcement of human rights functions best within the national legal order. Under the current normative framework, the best effective protection for human rights in relation to corporate conduct is for victims to rely on civil and criminal remedies in national legal orders. Although, human rights law insists on domestic human rights protection, this alone hardly seems a desirable stopping place. The current state of regulation is neither advancing the cause of protection and promotion of human rights, nor of the operation of an effective normative framework. A far more agreeable compromise would foster a normative framework which advances the promotion and protection of human rights and prevents human rights violations by or involving corporations. <br /><br />Domestic remedies for redressing violations by or involving corporations must be therefore improved. National legal orders should introduce domestic legal mechanisms to redress the damage resulting from human rights violations by or involving corporations. It appears that corporations must be regulated by their home states, mainly developed countries. This is because large numbers of corporations operate in developing countries and also due to the institutional framework for regulating corporations. In this regard, a fully fledged set of judicial mechanisms and remedies should be established or improved. The international human rights regime should, however, offer a clear set of minimum standards on the human rights obligations of corporations. In sum, the construction of stronger international and national human rights regimes is needed to regulate the activities of corporations.&quot;<br />

		<title>Private contractors in overseas combat zones face legal and psychological risks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Maggie Botes</strong> [General Manager, <a href="http://www.icaonline.us">International Contractors Association</a>]: &quot;The International Contractors Association has a Code of Conduct to which all our members subscribe. It promotes integrity and professional conduct, and supports accountability for any misconduct or crime. With this said, our view is that any government or <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/us-military-contractor-gets-probation.php">private contractor who commits a crime</a> should be held accountable for their actions. However, legal communities and the general public should realise that herewith lays a web of unanswered and unresolved complexities. Contractor liability could potentially become a political and humanitarian nightmare to the USA and the Western world at large.<br /> <br />One needs to consider the following interwoven facts: (1)civilian contractors are appointed by private companies to provide support services mostly for governmental contracts in foreign countries; (2)many civilian contractors appointed by private American companies are residents of a third country; and (3) lastly these contractors work in extremely volatile and dangerous situations indirectly for the United States government. The use of contractors is a direct result of the need for support personnel when there are just not enough soldiers to provide manpower to support fighting troops. It therefore makes a lot of financial sense to have a civilian contractor pumping gas, providing food or personal safety to US officials, employees and VIPs who work in dangerous environments abroad, and rather use the country&#39;s soldiers to do what they are trained to do. Billions of dollars are saved because the government does not have the financial burden of providing long term employment, subsidized housing and other services, as well as &quot;life-long&quot; veteran benefits. Pay the contractors for their time, and cut them loose when the job is done. Sounds simple enough.<br /> <br />Contractor accountability and the enforcement thereof should ultimately rest in the judiciary, of course referring to the US judiciary &#8212; only if the contractor is an American resident.  As it stands, the US law is not swayed by popular opinion, race, religion or beliefs.  The same cannot be said of the Middle Eastern laws where most contractors work. Now consider this; the American contractor, <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/us-military-contractor-gets-probation.php">who pleaded guilty</a> in February to voluntary manslaughter for the 2008 shooting of an Afghan detainee, was sentenced in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to five years probation and a $12,500 fine. If this was a New Zealander or Chilean contractor working on a US government contract, according to provisions of the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/dss/meja/">Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act</a> the contractor would have been delivered to the authorities of Afghanistan and he would have been charged under Afghan laws, and possibly given the death penalty to be carried out within 30 days. Is it any less than only fair to hold contractors accountable under the laws of the country which they are serving? We realize herein lays complex legal issues, but the question should be asked. <br /><br />The US law as it applies to soldiers working in a warzone, makes provision for PTSD (or battle fatigue as it is also known). ICA initiated a joined <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122322515/abstract">independent study</a> with a Canadian researcher, Dr. Anthony Feinstein, Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, to study the effects and occurrence of PTSD amongst contractors. We presented preliminary data suggesting that a significant minority of contractors working in conflict zones, particularly Iraq, are experiencing psychological problems. These data also confirm that little is in place pre-deployment to educate contractors on the psychological risks they will face. Furthermore, very few contractors returning from a war zone will receive psychological help. These are stark figures and point to the magnitude of the problems faced by contractors and by association, the organizations that employ them. In the long term, the same applies also to the home communities they live and work in beyond the contracted job. Is it in any way &quot;just&quot; to ignore this and simply &quot;pass the buck?&quot; What are the ultimate responsibilities of the governments and private companies in Western countries that employ civilian contractors to work in conflict areas?&quot;<br />

		<title>Ninth Circuit misreads statute in Ileto case granting near immunity to gun industry</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dennis A. Henigan</strong> [Vice President for Law and Policy, <a href="http://www.bradycenter.org/">Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence</a>]: &quot;Do the gun lobby&#39;s bumper sticker slogans work in the courts?  The Ninth Circuit&#39;s recent 2-1 <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/ninth-circuit-upholds-dismissal-of-suit.php">decision</a> in <u>Ileto v. Glock, Inc</u>., suggests the answer may be &quot;yes.&quot;<br /><br />The majority found that the federal <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s397enr.txt.pdf">Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act</a> [PDF file] requires dismissal of the lawsuit against a gun manufacturer brought by the victims of a 2001 Jewish Community Center shooting.  After reading the Court&#39;s opinion, I was struck by the gap between what Congress said it was doing in enacting that statute, and how the statute was applied by the <u>Ileto</u> majority.  I have a special perspective on the issue because, as a lawyer at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, I have litigated numerous lawsuits against the gun industry (although I was not involved in <u>Ileto</u>).  My Brady colleagues and I also were involved in every aspect of the battle in Congress leading to the Commerce in Arms Act.  <br /><br />During the legislative contest, we often heard this analogy from the gun industry:  &quot;You can&#39;t sue the manufacturer of a firearm, any more than you can sue Budweiser when someone gets involved in a drunk-driving accident.&quot;  If this means that gun manufacturers should not be liable simply because someone misuses a gun to harm an innocent person, few would disagree.  The problem with the analogy is that the lawsuits the industry was complaining about generally did not allege that a gun&#39;s harmful misuse by a criminal or other dangerous person is a sufficient reason to hold the manufacturer or seller of a gun legally accountable.  Rather, they charged negligent or illegal conduct by manufacturers and sellers that put guns in the hands of dangerous people and enable their misuse.  Moreover, the legislative history of the Commerce in Arms Act shows that Congress, in enacting the statute, thought it was barring only lawsuits that were equivalent to holding Budweiser liable simply because &quot;someone gets involved in a drunk-driving accident.&quot;<br /><br />Judge Berzon&#39;s opinion, dissenting in part in <u>Ileto</u>, gives an excellent account of the legislative history, showing that Congress was concerned about a narrow class of lawsuits against the gun industry which were based on the principle of vicarious liability under which a gun manufacturer or seller was liable for the wrongful act of the person who did the shooting.  Judge Berzon correctly distinguishes vicarious liability from the liability preserved by the Commerce in Arms Act whuch involves liability of manufacturers and sellers for their own conduct, not the conduct of third parties.  His opinion cites, for instance, the statement of the Senate sponsor, Senator Larry Craig (R-Id):  &quot;[This bill] does not prevent [gun manufacturers and sellers] from being sued for their own misconduct.  This bill only stops one extremely narrow category of lawsuits[:]  lawsuits that attempt to force the gun industry to pay for the crimes of third parties over whom they have no control.&quot;  Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama), another key proponent of the bill, said it was directed at suits seeking &quot;to blame...violent, illegal acts by criminals, on manufacturers of guns, because they manufactured the gun....&quot;  In other words, liability comparable to holding Budweiser responsible for drunk driving.<br /><br />In my new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lethal-Logic-Exploding-Paralyze-American/dp/1597973564/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242670376&sr=8-1">Lethal Logic: Exploding the Myths that Paralyze American Gun Policy</a>, I cite the Budweiser analogy as one of the simple, effective, but misleading slogans that has functioned to frustrate progress toward curbing the carnage of American gun violence, which takes over 30,000 lives every year.  Relying on internal industry documents uncovered in litigation against the industry, as well as the sworn testimony of industry whistleblowers, <em>Lethal Logic</em> describes the irresponsible, and sometimes illegal, conduct of the gun industry that fuels the illegal market and ensures a steady supply of lethal weaponry to criminals.  <br /><br />While lobbying for the Commerce in Arms, the industry assured Congress it was not seeking broad immunity from liability and Congress believed it.  It is tragic that some courts, like the Ninth Circuit panel in <u>Ileto</u>, have misread the statute to insulate the gun industry from its own deadly misconduct.&quot;<br />

		<title>Supreme Court reaffirms privacy interest in content of vehicles with Gant decision</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>David L. McColgin</strong> [Supervisory Assistant Federal Defender (Appeals), <a href="http://www.paefd.org/">Federal Community Defender Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania</a>]: &quot;<a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-542.pdf">Arizona v. Gant</a> [PDF file] is one of the most significant pro-Fourth Amendment decisions in decades.  Overturning the settled law in federal and most state courts, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-decides-iran-compensation.php">ruled</a> that police may no longer automatically search the passenger compartment of a car incident to the arrest of one of the car&#39;s occupants.  Instead, police may search the passenger compartment only if the arrestee is unsecured and &quot;within reaching distance of the vehicle,&quot; or if &quot;it is reasonable to believe the car contains evidence of the offense of arrest.&quot;  In so ruling, the Court reaffirmed that people do have a Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the contents of their cars.<br /> <br /><u>Gant</u> is big news because it reverses the trend toward limiting Fourth Amendment privacy interests when a search involves a vehicle.  Four decades ago, in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/395/752/case.html">Chimel v. California</a>, the Supreme Court ruled that police may search incident to arrest only the area within the arrestee&#39;s &quot;immediate control&quot; - the area within which the person could grab a weapon or evidence.  But in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/453/454/case.html">New York v. Belton</a>, the Court carved out a large exception from this rule for car stops, holding that police could always search the passenger compartment of a car incident to the arrest of an occupant.  This ruling was based on the notion that any privacy interest in the contents of a car is at best a limited one.<br /> <br /><u>Belton&#39;s</u> bright-line rule completely untethered car searches from the reasoning of <u>Chimel</u>.  Police across the country were trained that upon arresting the occupant of a car, they could place the arrestee handcuffed inside a police car, and then conduct a full-scale search of the passenger compartment, even though the arrestee could not possibly reach anything inside the car that was stopped.  Recently, the Court broadened the <u>Belton</u> rule in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/271/414/case.html">Thornton v. United States</a>, applying the rule even when the arrestee had already walked away from the car. <br /><br />Justice Stevens&#39; majority opinion in <u>Gant</u> restores the privacy interests motorists have in their vehicles under the Fourth Amendment. While noting that the privacy interest in a car is less than that in a home, <u>Gant</u> makes clear that the former is &quot;nonetheless deserving of constitutional protection,&quot; especially since the searches authorized by <u>Belton</u> included personal effects such as purses and briefcases in the passenger compartment.  The &quot;central concern underlying the Fourth Amendment,&quot; Justice Stevens explains, is &quot;the concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a person&#39;s private effects.&quot;<br /> <br />Although Justice Stevens asserts that the Court has not actually reversed <u>Belton</u> and <u>Thornton</u> and only narrowed their scope, Justice Alito&#39;s view in dissent is more accurate.  As Justice Alito writes, &quot;there can be no doubt&quot; that <u>Gant</u> overrules both decisions.  Police across the country now will have to be retrained that they can search the passenger compartment of a car only if (1) the arrestee is uncuffed and within reaching distance of the car, or (2) the police have reason to believe there is evidence of the offense of arrest in the car.<br />The most curious aspect of <u>Gant</u> is the inclusion of the second ground for a search.  As Justice Stevens himself notes, this second ground actually has nothing to do with the rule of <u>Chimel</u> (which is encapsulated in the first ground).  Instead, it appears to have been added so as to bring in Justice Scalia&#39;s fifth vote to make a majority.  Only Justice Scalia is an advocate for this ground.  As he explains in his concurrence, although he disagrees with the first ground and the application of <u>Chimel</u> to car searches, with the addition of the second ground he joined the majority to avoid a 4-1-4 split decision.  This leaves the second ground with little support on the Court, and virtually no definition.  It is unclear exactly what standard police must meet in order to have &quot;reason to believe&quot; that evidence of the offense of arrest will be found in the car.  Is this standard somewhere in between &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; and &quot;probable cause?&quot;  Only time (and lots of litigation) will tell.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://china.hrw.org/profile/sophie_richardson"><strong>Sophie Richardson</strong></a> [Asia Advocacy Director, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;The Chinese government&#39;s secrecy in handling unrest in Tibet since the March 2008 protests erupted in Lhasa was highlighted again on April 8, 2009, when a simple dispatch from the official news agency Xinhua reported that four Tibetans accused of arson in three different incidents had been <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/china-court-sentences-two-tibetans-to.php">sentenced to death</a>.  Two of them, Tenzin Phuntsog and Gangtsu (some Tibetans use a single name), received a two-year reprieve, which typically means that their sentences will be commuted to a life term at the end of the two year period. <br /><br />But the two other, Losang Gyaltse and Loyar, now face the prospect of imminent execution.  And, in keeping with the last year&#39;s practices, almost nothing is known of the circumstances under which they were tried. We do not know whether they were adequately represented by a defense counsel of their choice, whether they had an opportunity to challenge the evidence introduced against them, or whether the defense could produce their own witnesses during the procedures. Such violations of basic due process rights are chronic in Tibet.<br /><br />This secrecy is particularly hard to justify for a number of reasons, not least that under Chinese law all trials are supposed to be open.  One would have expected the presence of domestic or international observers, not to mention relatives.  Yet, absolutely no information has been forthcoming from the proceedings, leaving many fundamental questions about these important cases unanswered. <br /><br />And what about the oft-repeated claim by the Chinese government that the Dalai Lama &quot;clique&quot; had masterminded the violence in Lhasa? Premier Wen Jiabao himself had stated at a press conference in March 2008 that China had &quot;ample evidence&quot; of this.  One would have expected the trials to be a great opportunity to shed some light onto the still opaque set of circumstances that led to the violence on March 14-15, 2008. If there had been such a &quot;plan,&quot; why has none of that &quot;ample evidence&quot; been produced in an open court?  And why was it that the police withdrew from Lhasa during key times, effectively permitting the violence to escalate?  We still do not know.<br /><br />Following a 2006 reform, the Supreme People&#39;s Court (SPC) in Beijing has been <a href="http://www.chinareview.info/pages/legal.htm">reinstated as the ultimate arbiter</a> on all death penalty decisions. In theory, Losang Gyaltse&#39;s and Loyang&#39;s death sentences should now be making their way to the SPC to be vetted. But there is little to be expected from the review in highly politically sensitive cases, because the initial verdicts were most likely determined by the Party authorities through its Political and Legal Committee, that wields authority over all judicial institutions in China.  These authorities are therefore unlikely to change their minds as a result of the additional layer of review.  <br /><br />A recent Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/03/09/china-hundreds-tibetan-detainees-and-prisoners-unaccounted">report</a> on the aftermath of the 2008 Tibetan protests, based on extensive analysis of official Chinese accounts and court documents, concluded that the judicial system was &quot;so highly politicized as to preclude any possibility of protesters being judged fairly.&quot;  The report also showed that by the Chinese government&#39;s own count there had been thousands of arbitrary arrests and more than 100 trials pushed through the judicial system.  Almost nothing is known about these trials, including such basic information as the name of the people sentenced, the charges under which they were tried, and where they are serving their sentence.<br /><br />The government claims that all the Tibetans sentenced, including those receiving the death penalty, have been tried according to law. If that is in fact the case, then the Chinese government has little to hide. Secrecy about the proceedings, on the other hand, suggests that the government recognizes that these trials are so summary as to be incapable of withstanding public and international scrutiny.&quot;<br />

Leading the charge has been former Vice President Dick Cheney, who complained that Obama had not released "the memos that showed the success of the [interrogation] effort."  <br /><br /> Numerous commentators have agreed that any debate about the efficacy of particular interrogation techniques should consider whether those techniques resulted in the discovery of actionable intelligence.  The argument made by President Obama and his top aides that the interrogation methods approved in the torture memos undermined American values and produced unreliable information would, as Scott Shane, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/us/politics/23detain.html?_r=1&ref=us">writing</a> in the <em>New York Times</em>, has noted "be far trickier if the C.I.A. methods were demonstrated to have been crucial in disrupting major plots."  <br /><br />But the conclusion does not necessarily follow that, even if the government were to reveal information about the results of its interrogation efforts, that information would justify the use of waterboarding and other controversial interrogation techniques. This is so for at least four reasons. First, defenders of the Bush administration's use of harsh interrogation methods operated on the belief that essentially all aspects of terrorist plotting amounted to a "ticking bomb" scenario.  But it cannot be the case that every situation presents such a scenario.  Further, if agents of the United States government had the time to waterboard a detainee more than one hundred times, it is unlikely any bomb was ticking.  And, apparently, according to information that has been reported, the most controversial techniques were used repeatedly over time in the belief that the information revealed on the last day of the interrogation was as reliable as that revealed on the first&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;an empirically suspect proposition. <br /><br /> The second reason why the release of information about the so-called success of harsh interrogation would not demonstrate its validity and utility is that, even if these interrogations did result in the discovery of actionable intelligence, as former Vice President Cheney and others claim, we have no way to determine whether we would have got better &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; or more reliable &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; information more quickly using less harsh techniques.  Indeed, the public is ill-equipped to evaluate governmental claims that the information we learned using harsh interrogation techniques was useful in any particular circumstance.  Consider that, even at this point in time, there is, at a minimum, strong disagreement among experts about how best to obtain information from an individual that is reliable and, therefore, useful.  As early as 2002, the F.B.I. declined to participate in the C.I.A. interrogation program because of questions about methods, and former F.B.I. supervisory special agent Ali Soufan, also writing in the <em>New York Times</em>, has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/opinion/23soufan.html?ref=opinion">stated</a> that the use of traditional interrogation methods actually had produced actionable intelligence in multiple instances.  As he put it: "traditional interrogation techniques are successful in identifying operatives, uncovering plots and saving lives."  <br /><br />Third, whether the information about the results of harsh interrogations produced actionable intelligence obscures what was most fundamentally wrong with the interrogation programs: the use of these techniques had the effect of eroding our moral authority to fight terrorism, as well as our ability to maintain discipline over our own forces, and it had a corrupting effect on those who were called on to implement these techniques.  In its report on the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody, the Sentate Armed Services Committee thoroughly documented how the policies, procedures and attitudes developed for interrogations conducted at Guantanamo and C.I.A. black sites made their way to Iraq and Afghanistan.  The consequence was the abuse and torture of detaines at the hands of United States military men and women.  Further, as President Obama, Defense Secretary Gates, and a number of senior military leaders seem to understand, the shadow of Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and C.I.A. black sites have made our efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere that much more difficult: the Bush/Cheney-era policies have provided a rallying point for Islamic extremists throughout the Middle East and complicated our efforts to fight insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan, all at the cost of the lives of American service members.   <br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the release of the information that former Vice President Cheney claims will demonstrate the effectiveness of the programs would do nothing to establish the legality of these programs.  We have seen in the most recently released memoranda on interrogations from the Bush/Cheney-era that the pervasive attitude in the Office of Legal Counsel and in the administration was that ends justify means.  This attitude served as the underlying motivation for poorly reasoned and inadequately considered legal opinions.  This attitude explains why, when comparing the treatment of the detainees in C.I.A. control to the training that U.S. forces receive, the legal opinions failed to consider the cumulative and repeated effect that these techniques could have on the detainees.  It also explains why the legal opinions failed to take into consideration that U.S. forces undergoing training knew that at some relatively short point in time, their training would come to an end, and thus, they would not likely suffer lasting psychological impact from the training.  The same cannot be said for the high-value detainees being held by the United States.   <br /><br />In short, these flawed legal opinions failed to consider how interrogation could amount to torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment, in violation if U.S. law.  The release of the results of our use of harsh interrogaton methods would not make these methods legal. If we have learned nothing else from this sad chapter in our history, we must come to understand that once we decide to go down the road to officially sanctioned cruelty, either out of frustration, desperation, fear, or a mistaken belief that ends justify means, the lasting and damaging consequences of those actions will likely be beyond our control.  It seems that the former Vice President has not learned this lesson, but that does not mean we cannot learn from these mistakes.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen

		<title>The Man Who Knew Too Much? A Convenient Suicide in a  Libyan Prison</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says the claimed &quot;suicide&quot; in a Libyan prison of al-Qaeda operative Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi is too convenient for too many people who have besmirched American honor in a perversion of rule of law that came from panic and improvisation.....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavisnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ittle noted thusfar by the newspapers of record in the United States, Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, the al-Qaeda operative tortured for the United States by the Egyptian secret police,  died in a Libyan prison this past weekend of what has been called a "suicide."  <br /><br />For those who only vaguely remember al-Libi's name, al-Libi is the al-Qaeda person picked up at an al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan and extraordinarily rendered to Egypt to be tortured at the United States behest.  Al-Libi is the one reported to have linked al-Qaeda to Saddam Hussein in a false confession that was the result of this torture that Saddam Hussein was training al-Qaeda in bomb making, poisons, and deadly gases.  President Bush used this "evidence" in a speech on October 7, 2002 in Cincinnati in his push to get Congressional approval of the resolution authorizing the President to go to war in Iraq.  Al-Libi later disavowed that "evidence," but by then we were in Iraq.  When the al-Libi torture was revealed, the comment was made that the people at the highest levels of the U.S. government (Condi Rice and Dick Cheney) did not doublecheck this "evidence" but took it at face value.  Why?  Because, this false confession was consistent with their vision of the world.<br /><br />As former Vice-President Cheney continues his "torture apology tour" asserting that "torture works" in the way the French General Massu defended the torture he ran in Algeria during the Algerian War (nothing new under the sun for anyone with a memory), it is clear that the al-Libi case is a difficult one for these apologists for torture.  Al-Libi's false confession that was exploited as propaganda to lead us into the Iraq War confirms to us that torture works only in the sense that it breaks the person tortured.  As has been repeated so many times, a person tortured will say anything to get the torture to stop.  Tying al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein in a false confession was al-Libi's way to stop the pain.<br /><br />But to have al-Libi say that in giving evidence in a criminal prosecution would be terribly inconvenient for many present and former operatives and members of the United States government.  After all, al-Libi's words found their way into former Secretary of State's Colin Powell's infamous presentation to the United Nations in the run up to the Iraq War.<br /><br />In what had happened in his body and mind, al-Libi truly was the "man who knew too much."  That is why it is totally appropriate that Human Rights Watch has called for an investigation into the circumstances of his "suicide" in a Libyan prison.  It is clear that having al-Libi truly disappeared is too convenient for too many people who have besmirched American honor in a perversion of rule of law that came from panic and improvisation.<br /><br />Let us fully investigate how good old Muammar Gaddhafi got al-Libi into his prison system from CIA detention and what were the circumstances of al-Libi's death.  It smells of the "car accident&quot; or &quot;fell out the jail window" type of deaths that dissidents have had in other countries in Africa.  Except this time, the person is an encumbrance from lawless leaders of America, not some tin-pot dictatorship.<br /><br />If we insist, they will prosecute these lawless leaders.  We need to insist.  I am tired of the dithering and I am tired of these thinly veiled efforts to make evidence disappear and people disappear to hide their tracks.  Bring light.  Bring light and let the chips fall where they may.<br /><br />Let us be clear.  At 53 years of age, I simply never imagined I would have to write these kinds of things to Americans about torture by our government in my life.  Torture under guise of "we do it to our soldiers in training" is torture.  That torture is not just waterboarding, but the full panoply of actions that we are learning has been done to people in our names.  Bring al-Qahtani out of his hole in Gitmo and let us see the before and after footage on him in case you doubt he was tortured. Moreover, an alleged common law defense of necessity as recently suggested by an author here would at best be very narrow.  It is not the kind of broad necessity doctrine that would have the effect of making torture legal because someone can argue necessity.  It does not work that way.   Moreover, our treaty law would trump mere common law and thus such a defense.<br /><br />They are grasping at straws (but they are powerful).  Please stop the nonsense by high-level civilians and generals desperate to avoid prosecution.  It is time they take the fall and not the grunts who did their bidding. Keep our honor clean.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice&#39;s latest statements on waterboarding indicate her complicity in unlawful interrogation, and that she and others in the &quot;inner circle&quot; of the Bush administration should be held legally accountable under the international treaties to which the US is a party....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/paustbig.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->D<!-- odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->id Condoleezza Rice, as former head of the National Security Council, approve the manifestly illegal tactic of waterboarding?  A recently de-classified <a href="http://intelligence.senate.gov/pdfs/olcopinion.pdf">report</a> of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence states that "[o]n July 17, 2002, according to CIA records, the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) [Tenet] met with the National Security Adviser [Rice], who advised that the CIA could proceed with its proposed interrogation of Abu Zubaydah.  This advice ... was subject to a determination of legality by OLC."  The report adds that on July 26th (a week before the infamous second Bybee memo that <a href="/forumy/2009/04/second-bybee-memo-smoking-gun.php">provides its own evidence of complicity</a>), "OLC orally advised the CIA that the Attorney General [Ashcroft] had concluded ... that use of waterboarding was lawful."  ABC News also reported in 2005 that "current and former CIA officers [stated that] there was a presidential finding, signed in 2002, by President Bush, Condoleezza Rice and then-Attorney General John Ashcroft approving" waterboarding.  Instead of taking the fall for Bush's nefarious behavior, Rice <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijEED_iviTA&feature=related">declared at Stanford University</a> in April 2009 and in the <a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com/cgi-bin/?p=1030140">Stanford Daily</a>: "I didn't authorize anything.  I conveyed the authorization of the administration to the agency, that they had a policy authorization, subject to the Justice Department's clearance."  Was her latest statement an admission of guilt?  <br /><br /> Whether or not she advised that CIA could proceed with waterboarding or conveyed the authorization of the President to proceed with waterboarding and whether or not she signed the 2002 presidential finding, she has admitted that she intended to engage in conduct that would knowingly facilitate the use of waterboarding if OLC would also approve.  As such, she is reasonably accused of complicity or aiding and abetting waterboarding whether or not she actually approved its use on another person on July 17th or later in 2002 and 2003 during several meetings addressing waterboarding and other tactics.<br />  <br /> Criminal complicity can occur when a person is aware that his or her conduct can or will assist or facilitate conduct of a direct perpetrator.  The person who aids and abets need not know that the conduct of the direct perpetrator is criminal or whether it does in fact constitute "torture" or some other widely-known and unavoidably criminal conduct such as cruel or inhumane treatment.  As international criminal tribunals have affirmed, it suffices that an accused was aware of the relevant factual circumstances and that even a direct perpetrator "need not have known that his or her act ... amounted to an 'inhumane act' either in the legal or moral sense."  Furthermore, all acts of assistance, by words or acts and omissions, that lend encouragement or support will also suffice if the accused knows or is aware that such conduct can or will facilitate the use of what happens to be an illegal tactic.  <br /><br /> In context, her recent statement is unavoidably an admission of what the tribunals recognize as the "factual quality" of the crime &#8212; in this case, the factual quality of aiding and abetting waterboarding.  She has admitted that she engaged in conduct (the conveyance of a policy authorization of President Bush to engage in waterboarding) that, at the time, she must clearly have known or been aware can or will facilitate use of waterboarding.  It does not matter whether she knew the law, that waterboarding is criminally proscribed, or that waterboarding is torture or cruel and inhumane.<br /><br /> Perhaps what Rice had in mind while fingering Bush and pointing to his authorization of waterboarding was a defense of superior orders.  She remarked: "The President [who clearly could not be mistaken for a lawyer] instructed us that nothing we would do would be outside our obligations, legal obligations, under the Convention Against Torture" and, she claims, "if it was authorized by the President, it did not violate our obligations under the Convention."  Quite clearly, however, the President cannot lawfully authorize a violation of a treaty and, in view of an express and unavoidable constitutional mandate under Article II, Section 3, the President must faithfully execute the laws.  Under international and U.S. domestic law, there would be no defense if her claim is merely that anything the President authorizes is lawful.  That didn't work for German accused at Nuremberg and it won't work here or in Spain.<br /><br /> Superior orders?  The test is whether the order or authorization approved conduct that is manifestly or clearly conduct that is unlawful, such as torture or cruel or inhumane treatment.  Is waterboarding manifestly torture or cruel or inhumane?  That's the real issue and, as documented in <a href="/pdf/paustfinal.pdf">The Absolute Prohibition of Torture</a>, since several federal and state court cases and U.S. Executive Country Reports on Human Rights Practices of other countries had already expressly recognized that waterboarding, the water cure and other forms of induced suffocation are a method of "torture," it is obvious that waterboarding is manifestly and clearly unlawful.  Importantly also, they are clearly cruel and clearly inhumane.  Indeed, what person would not recognize the inhumane effects of waterboarding that was not part of voluntary training that will end, but part of a planned process of coercive interrogation involving pain and an inducement of suffocation that, as the second Bybee memo expressly warns, creates "incipient panic" and an imminent threat of death?<br /><br /> There is also possible criminal responsibility to explore with respect to her conduct during several meetings of the National Security Council's Principals Committee in the White House from 2002 to 2003, during which waterboarding and other unlawful tactics were addressed and expressly and/or tacitly approved or abetted &#8212; meetings at which it has been reported Rice, Cheney, Addington, Rumsfeld, Tenet, Ashcroft, John Yoo and others were often in attendance.  The meetings raise issues not merely of accomplice liability, but also of liability of co-conspirators and what international criminal tribunals recognize as participation in a joint criminal enterprise.  The meetings were clearly a major part of what is now the Bush legacy of serial and cascading criminality.<br /><br /> Remarkably, it is John Yoo who has been more honest than any other person who attended such meetings when admitting in a book that there was a "common, unifying" plan devised by an "inner circle" to deny Geneva law protections and engage in secret detention and "coercive" interrogation despite recognition that Geneva law "bars 'any form of coercion.'"<br /><br /> Under the Convention Against Torture, the Obama Administration has an obligation, "if it does not extradite..., [to] submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution."  Under the Geneva Civilian Convention, with respect to torture and inhumane tr
eatment as well as unlawful transfer of non-POWs out of occupied territory the Administration has a similar duty in the alternative to "bring such persons before its own courts" or extradite to another state.  These treaty-based duties are absolute.  They also reflect customary international law <em>aut dedere aut judicare</em> (hand over or adjudicate) with respect to any violation of customary international criminal law, and such violations implicate universal jurisdiction or the competence of any state to prosecute and provide civil sanctions.  More importantly for this nation at this critical moment in our history, we must insist that no one is above the law and that the Executive must faithfully execute the laws.<br /><br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

King, Jr., the youngest American prosecutor at the 1945-46 Nuremberg trials. King, himself a past contributor to JURIST&#39;s <em>Forum</em>, died May 9 at the age of 89...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidcranenew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he spirit of Nuremberg lives!  My friend and mentor thumped the table vigorously despite his age, his eyes blazing fiercely as he gazed into the audience at the end of his keynote speech at the First Annual International Humanitarian Law Dialogs at the Chautauqua Institution in August of 2007.  The audience rose as one, giving him a standing ovation, many with tears in their eyes, including me.<br /><br />I had introduced Henry King prior to this momentous address.  Before me were all of the living current and former Chief Prosecutors of the world's international tribunals and courts.  We are a small fraternity of just a dozen or so men and women who have taken up the call of Henry King and Robert H. Jackson who, among many other courageous souls there in Nuremberg in 1945-46, began a subtle process of international criminal justice which has blossomed into the legal mechanism by which mankind now faces down impunity.  Known as the Nuremberg Principles, these guidelines allowed for the steady development of jurisprudence that is international criminal law today.<br /><br />As I stated in that introduction, Henry King was an American lawyer, a professional who stepped forward throughout his long legal career to seek justice, to represent clients zealously before the law, and to teach generations of new lawyers about the law's majesty.  I recall Henry telling me what a chance he took when he left his law firm in New York as a twenty-six year old associate and recent Yale Law School graduate, to travel to Germany and into the unknown challenges to be faced regarding a new idea, the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, mankind's first true attempt to hold accountable those who committed mass atrocity.  <br /><br />Many counseled Henry not to go, that he would forever damage his prospects for a successful legal career.  But off he went. For many months he worked quietly behind the scenes, developing the cases that would see the conviction of the top Nazi war criminals for international crimes, an historic first. This was the measure of the man and the beginning of his legacy. After returning he would successfully practice law for many decades, as a commercial lawyer, professor, and as a leader in the American Bar Association. <br /><br />Years ago, chatting over dinner, Henry talked about how hard it was at Nuremberg, not only to do the legal work, but just to get up and go to the Palace of Justice day in and day out to face the factual horrors of the Holocaust.  Nuremberg was largely destroyed, so the amenities of living were spare if not missing all together.  At the time I was the Chief Prosecutor for the international war crimes tribunal in West Africa, called the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and I was struggling to handle the horrors of that atrocity and maintain a focus.  I asked Henry how he handled the day-to-day grind of developing a legal case with so much death and destruction around. He put his hand on my arm, looked me in the eyes, and with a slight smile told me, "around two scotches" before dinner.  We both laughed, relaxed, and with those words I was able to go back and with the mirth and wisdom of my friend ringing in my ears, face down the beast of impunity there in West Africa.  What he meant in those words was for me to hold on to your humanity, to your family, to your friends.  The business of international criminal law is physically and emotionally draining, only through the love of family, friends, and life can one get through the horror.<br /><br />Henry King's ability to say the right words - words that inspired, words that mattered - were legend.  Later in his life, as a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, students would flock to his classes to listen, learn, and to understand that only through the law is mankind anchored and centered.  I have chatted with those students. When when you mention Henry King their eyes glitter with the excitement of having learned from a true giant in our profession.  What a rare privilege it must have been for them.<br /><br />Henry King's legacy lives on in all of us - American lawyers - who daily use the law as a tool to make our society better.  For those of us who work in the field of international criminal law, Henry's legacy, the Nuremberg legacy, is reflected in the <em>ad hoc</em> tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, and the International Criminal Court, the world's permanent tribute to all those brave men and women, like Henry T. King, Jr. who toiled bravely among the ruins at Nuremberg to seek justice.  Henry, you were right &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the spirit of Nuremberg lives!<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God</span>. <br /><br />Farewell my dear friend, and thank you for your life and example.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

In the context of American interrogation practices and treatment of both terrorist detainees and enemy combatant detainees, false allegations of "torture" have been regularly raised by a wide variety of individuals and interest groups, the latest round of concern being the recently released Bush Department of Justice "CIA" memorandums.  In short, if the memos authorized techniques which constitute torture, then the rule of law is absolute &#8212; those who approved, those who authorized, and those who committed the acts must be prosecuted in a court of law.  On the other hand, if the interrogation practices authorized did not constitute torture, then there is no need to prosecute (or to engage in the endless political grandstanding).  <br /><br />     Recognizing that not every alleged incident of mistreatment necessarily satisfies the legal definition of torture, it is imperative that one view such allegations with a clear understanding of the applicable legal standards set out in law and judicial precedent.  In this manner, claims of illegal interrogation practices can be properly measured as falling above or below a particular legal threshold. Only then can one hope to set aside the worn-out rhetoric by such groups as Amnesty International, who call the Guantanamo detention facility the "gulag of our time." <br /> <br /> The 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture, and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Torture Convention) is the primary international agreement governing torture and lesser forms of coercion known as "ill-treatment."  All nations must abide by the provisions and prosecute anyone who ordered or carried out torture. Article 2 of the Torture Convention absolutely excludes the notion of exceptional circumstances to serve as an excuse to the prohibition of torture. "No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification for torture."  <br /><br />     Nevertheless, the accused on trial for torture is certainly able to argue the common law doctrine of  "necessity" at his trial &#8212; the defendant committed an evil (torture) to prevent a greater evil (mass murder).  If the jury accepts this defense, the defendant will be found not guilty.<br /><br /> According to the Torture Convention, for torture to exist the following criteria must be present: (1) the act must be intentional; (2) it must be performed by a State agent; (3) the act must cause severe pain or suffering to body or mind; and (4) it must be accomplished with the intent to gain information or a confession. <br /> <br />     In the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition, we generally look to authoritative judicial decisions to define key terms in treaty and legislation.  Perhaps the leading international case in the realm of defining "severe pain or suffering" in the context of interrogation practices comes from the often cited European Court of Human Rights ruling, <em>Ireland v. United Kingdom</em>. By an overwhelming majority vote, the <em>Ireland</em> court found certain interrogation practices of British authorities to interrogate suspected terrorism in Northern Ireland to be "inhuman and degrading," i.e., ill-treatment, but not severe enough to rise to the level of torture. According to the Court, the finding of ill-treatment rather than torture "derives principally from a difference in the intensity of the suffering inflicted." In <em>Ireland</em>, the Court considered the use of five investigative measures known as "the five techniques" which were practiced by British authorities for periods of "four or five" days pending or during interrogation sessions.<ul><li>Wall-standing: Forcing the detainee to stand for some period of hours in a stress position described as "spread-eagled against the wall, with their fingers put high above their head against the wall, the legs spread apart and the feet back, causing them to stand on their toes with the weight of the body mainly on the fingers." Wall-standing was practiced for up to 30 hours with occasional periods for rest.<br /><br /><li>Hooding: Placing a dark hood over the head of the detainee and keeping it on for prolonged periods of time.<br /><br /><li>Subjection to noise: Holding the detainee in a room where there was a continuous loud and hissing noise.<br /><br /><li>Deprivation of Sleep: Depriving detainee of sleep for prolonged periods of time.<br /><br /><li>Deprivation of Food and Drink: Reducing the food and drink to suspects pending interrogations.</ul>     Considering the level of interrogation standards set out in the <em>Ireland</em> case, the conclusion is clear.  Even the worst of the CIA techniques that were authorized &#8212; waterboarding - would not constitute torture (the CIA method is similar to what we have done hundreds and hundreds of times to our own military special operations soldiers in military training courses on escape and survival).   <br /><br /><br /><em>Jeffrey F.

He has served as an expert advisor to government on the military commissions process.  Addicott also served as the senior legal advisor to the U.S. Army Special Forces.</em><br />

Markets rise and fall largely on perception - the perception of an economy&#39;s strength, a banking system&#39;s integrity, a company&#39;s relative worth.  Lately, our markets have been falling.  Perception is similarly key to the success of America&#39;s foreign policy.  The perception after 9/11 that we were the victims of an unprovoked attack garnered sympathy and support from around the world.  But that perception changed after the illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003.  Suddenly, the U.S. was viewed as only interested in advancing its own cause in its own way and the rest of the world, including our allies, could go fly a kite.<br /> <br />The military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba became emblematic of this latter perception and in many ways cemented it.  Widely viewed as a &quot;legal black hole&quot; into which those captured in the global war on terror were dumped, the legal process afforded detainees at Gitmo was far less than that required by the Constitution, the Geneva Conventions, or regular military law.  Military commissions established by executive order effectively stripped away a defendant&#39;s right to challenge his detention, introduce or rebut reliable evidence, call witnesses or even consult with legal counsel of his own choice.  President Obama railed against this injustice as a Senator and cheered the Supreme Court when it consistently rebuked President Bush&#39;s repeated attempts to legitimize his treatment of detainees.<br /> <br />Once in the White House, President Obama ordered the closure of the detention facility by January 2010 along with a review of all pending cases and procedures.  Everyone anticipated that this was the beginning of the end.  That perception, perhaps a projection of wishful thinking in retrospect, appears to have been ill-founded.  Consequently, the President&#39;s recently-announced decision to fix the military commission process in Gitmo instead of dumping it altogether was shocking.  Especially in light of how the world and our allies view the entire tangled mess.<br /> <br />The whole point of the President&#39;s goodwill tours abroad has been to repair America&#39;s image.  Again and again, we have been told to expect nothing substantive from these trips because their main purpose is to restore the world&#39;s faith that the oldest democracy had not in fact lost its moorings but had returned to the family of nations that treat people with dignity, no matter what their national origin may be.  Now, to resurrect the flawed military commissions of Gitmo is to simply throw that entire effort out the window.  No matter what reforms are put in place to advance the rights of defendants, and there are many that could be so crafted, Gitmo is still Gitmo.  Because of that inescapable fact, perceptions of injustice and cruelty are equally inescapable.  An Article III federal court, with all the accompanying defense rights, could be located there, and if it&#39;s renamed a military commission and put at Gitmo it wouldn&#39;t make a dime&#39;s worth of difference.  America&#39;s reputation as a defender of human rights and the rule of law would remain tarnished by association.<br /> <br />True, there are prickly logistical and diplomatic issues with returning detainees to their countries of origin or third states.  Truer still, no one can politically stomach the prospect of terrorist suspects, no matter how innocent they are, being released into the U.S.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that Gitmo is the only answer.  The Geneva Conventions require that states afford the same legal process to detainees that they afford to their own troops - the underlying theory being that each state will treat its own troops with a certain minimum level of decency.  America&#39;s Uniform Code of Military Justice is the envy of militaries around the world and widely regarded as providing the best and most flexible legal process for armed forces anywhere.  <br /> <br />President Obama can easily use this mandate and this process to solve this problem.  Both the detention facility <em>and</em> the military commissions at Gitmo need to be closed down.  No good can ever come from retaining them - whatever their ultimate form.  He doesn&#39;t have to ship detainees to Ft. Leavenworth for this to happen.  They can be returned to U.S. military bases in Afghanistan - the battlefield that generated most of the 241 current detainees in the first place.  Holding on to Gitmo would be analogous to the U.S. retaining prison authority over Abu Ghraib after the prisoner abuse scandals of 2005.  The Bush Administration had the good sense to drop that hot potato immediately.  Let&#39;s hope the Obama Administration follows suit on Gitmo.  The President was elected on the promise of change.  He must not let that perception of change be undermined so quickly.<br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that the US Supreme Court&#39;s ruling in <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</em> suggests that the Court may be trying to set up a system wherein lower level officials can be held criminally liable for carrying out orders administered to them by higher ranking officials who, in turn, will be let off scot-free..... <br /><hr size="1"><br /><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavisnew.jpg" align="left" vspace="2" hspace="0"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" width="5" height="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" width="1" height="1"></td></tr></tbody></table> <font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>here is an old military adage that there are "different spanks for different ranks."<br /><br />It appears that the 5-4 Supreme Court majority in <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</em>, decided Monday, went out of its way to suggest that the adage also applies to so-called <em>Bivens</em> claims - civil constitutional claims for mistreatment by allegedly lawless public servants (<font style="font-style: italic;">Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents</font>, 403 U. S. 388 (1971)). Those of us who seek the criminal prosecution of high-level US civilians or military generals for torture and cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment can only hope that another slim majority of the court does not go down the same path in criminal prosecutions under the Federal Criminal Code or the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The effect of that would be to say that the uniformed soldiers who did the bidding of the high-level civilians and military generals may be court-martialed, serve time, and be dishonorably discharged, but that the high-level civilians who orchestrated such crimes are somehow above the law.<br /><br />In the months following 9/11, Javaid Iqbal was arrested on criminal charges and detained by federal officials under restrictive conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York in the Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit (ADMAX SHU), which was deplored by the Inspector General in a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/0306/press.pdf">2003 Department of Justice report</a>.  Iqbal pleaded guilty to various criminal charges relating to false documentation (but not to any terrorism charges), served time, and was ultimately deported to his home in Pakistan.  During the pendency of this, Iqbal filed a <em>Bivens</em> claim against several federal officials including former Attorney General John Ashcroft and current Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Robert Mueller. He alleged that they had designated Iqbal a person "of high interest" on account of his race, religion, or national origin, in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments. He also alleged that the FBI, under Mueller's direction, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men as part of its September 11th investigation. Furthermore, he alleged that Ashcroft, Mueller, and others knowingly, willfully and maliciously agreed to subject Iqbal to harsh conditions of confinement as a matter of policy, solely on account of the factors prohibited by the first and fifth amendments and without asserting any legitimate penalogical interest. Finally, he alleged that Ashcroft was the policy's "principal architect" and Mueller was "instrumental" in its adoption and execution.<br /><br />The federal officials asserted "qualified immunity", which was rejected by the District Court.  The officials then appealed, asserting the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Collateral_order_doctrine">collateral order doctrine</a>. The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that Twombly's "flexible plausibility standard", which obligates a pleader to amplify a claim with factual allegations where necessary to render it plausible, was inapplicable in the context of petitioners' appeal.  The Second Circuit held that Iqbal's complaint was adequate to allege petitioners' personal involvement in discriminatory decisions which, if true, violated clearly established constitutional law.<br /><br />Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority (Roberts, Alito, Thomas, and Scalia) stated that Iqbal's account of his prison ordeal could, if proven, demonstrate unconstitutional misconduct by some governmental actors. But the majority went on to state that the allegations and pleadings with respect to these actors were not before the Court today. Rather, the majority viewed that the case as turning on a narrower question: did Iqbal, as the plaintiff in the District Court, plead factual matter that, if taken as true, states a claim that Ashcroft and Mueller and others deprived him of his clearly established constitutional rights? The majority held that respondent's pleadings are insufficient.<br /><br />To get there, the Court first determined the Second Circuit had subject matter jurisdiction because the District Court decision denying a Government officer's claim of qualified immunity can fall within the narrow class of appealable orders despite "the absence of a final judgment " (<font style="font-style: italic;">Mitchell v. Forsyth</font>, 472 U. S. 511, 530 (1985)). This was said to be so because qualified immunity &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; which shields Government officials "from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights," (<font style="font-style: italic;">Harlow v. Fitzgerald</font>, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982)) &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; is both a defense to liability and a limited "entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation" ( <font style="font-style: italic;">Mitchell</font>, <em>supra</em>, 472 U. S., at 526). Provided it "turns on an issue of law," <font style="font-style: italic;">id</font>., at 530, a district-court order denying qualified immunity "'conclusively determine[s]'" that the defendant must bear the burdens of discovery is "conceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff's claim" and would prove "effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment."<br /><br />Turning to the <em>Bivens</em> claim, the majority noted that in the limited settings where <em>Bivens</em> does apply, the implied cause of action is the "federal analog to suits brought against state officials under Revised Statute &Acirc;&#167;1979, 42 U. S. C. &Acirc;&#167;1983" (<font style="font-style: italic;">Hartman v. Moore</font>, 547 U. S., at 254, n. 2. Cf. <font style="font-style: italic;">Wilson v. Layne</font>, 526 U. S. 603, 609 (1999)). Based on the rules established by precedent, Iqbal correctly conceded that Government officials may not be held liable for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of <em>respondeat superior</em> (Iqbal Brief 46 ("[I]t is undisputed that supervisory Bivens liability cannot be established solely on a theory of respondeat superior"). See <font style="font-style: italic;">Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs.</font>, 436 U. S. 658, 691 (1978) (finding no vicarious liability for a municipal "person" under 42 U. S. C. &Acirc;&#167;1983); see also <font style="font-style: italic;">Dunlop v. Munroe</font>, 7 Cranch 242, 269 (1812) (a federal official's liability "will only result from his own neglect in not properly superintending the discharge" of his subordinates' duties); <font style="font-style: italic;">Robertson v. Sichel</font>, 127 U. S. 507, 515&#8212;516 (1888) ("A public officer or agent is not responsible for the misfeasances or position wrongs, or for the nonfeasances, or negligences, or omissions of duty, of the subagents or servants or other persons properly employed by or under him, in the discharge of his official duties").) Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to <em>Bivens</em> and &Acirc;&#167;1983 suits, the majority stated that a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, through the official's own individual actions, ha
s violated the Constitution.<br /><br />The key to the majority's thinking is in a passage which states:<blockquote>[Iqbal] argues that, under a theory of "supervisory liability," petitioners can be liable for "knowledge and acquiescence in their subordinates' use of discriminatory criteria to make classification decisions among detainees." Iqbal Brief 45&#8212;46. That is to say,respondent believes a supervisor's mere knowledge of his subordinate's discriminatory purpose amounts to the supervisor's violating the Constitution. We reject this argument. Respondent's conception of "supervisory liability" is inconsistent with his accurate stipulation that petitioners may not be held accountable for the misdeeds of their agents. In a &Acirc;&#167;1983 suit or a <em>Bivens</em> action&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;where masters do not answer for the torts of their servants&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the term "supervisory liability" is a misnomer. Absent vicarious liability, each Government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct. In the context of determining whether there is a violation of clearly established right to overcome qualified immunity, purpose rather than knowledge is required to impose Bivens liability on the subordinate for unconstitutional discrimination; the same holds true for an official charged with violations arising from his or her superintendent responsibilities.</blockquote>Having rejected the presentation of "supervisory liability" of Iqbal, the majority analyzed Iqbal's complaint under the two-pronged <em>Twombly</em> test and stated that:<blockquote>Under <em>Twombly</em>'s construction of Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we conclude that respondent's complaint has not "nudged [his] claims" of invidious discrimination across the line from conceivable to plausible.</blockquote>Justice Souter in his dissent joined by Breyer, Ginsburg and Stevens stated:<blockquote>According to the majority, because Iqbal concededly cannot recover on a theory of respondeat superior, it follows that he cannot recover under any theory of supervisory liability... The majority says that in a Bivens action, "where masters do not answer for the torts of their servants... the term 'supervisory liability' is a misnomer," and that "[a]bsent vicarious liability, each Government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct." Ibid. Lest there be any mistake, in these words the majority is not narrowing the scope of supervisory liability; it is eliminating Bivens supervisory liability entirely. The nature of a supervisory liability theory is that the supervisor may be liable, under certain conditions, for the wrongdoing of his subordinates, and it is this very principle that the majority rejects.</blockquote>In this sense, on remand, some lower level governmental officials may be liable to Iqbal for his treatment (different spank) but not Ashcroft and Mueller who were their bosses (different rank). <br /><br />The majority appears to be sending a signal to the courts below that it seeks to limit "supervisory liability" (at least in <em>Bivens</em>-type cases), thus protecting higher-up officials from facing personal liability for actions done with their approval by their subordinates. If this view of higher-up responsibility were to leach over to the criminal and military law settings in the lower courts and military court-martials, the effect is clear:  lower level uniformed and non-uniformed persons may be criminally prosecuted or court-martialed while the higher-ups who set the policy get off scot-free.<br /><br />Truly different spanks for different ranks. More prosaically, the Supreme Court seems to be suggesting that the other military adage "shit rolls down hill" is going to be applied also in this arena.<br /><br />The one saving grace for this situation is that the relevant federal criminal statutes and Uniform Code of Military Justice, by their terms, may provide a broader space for higher-up liability than does the <em>Bivens</em> constitutional action. However, it is possible that those low-level persons below who argue that they tortured within the "scope of employment" may continue to be unsuccessful in avoiding conviction while those arguing they "only set policy" on the torture may be found to be able to successfully assert what can only be a constitutional protection.<br /><br />The problem lies in the power of the higher-ups in their positions to blur the distinctions in a manner that the lower level person is not capable of blurring.  The key issue would be whether the statutory and constitutional framework is clear. If the framework is not clear, the higher-ups are more likely to be able to seek protection. It is in this kind of view that we can understand the purposes of the torture memos even better. These memos were an effort to seek to completely blur the statutory and constitutional framework not only to permit torture but, in a kind of double whammy, to also provide a constitutional defense to those at the top who organized the torture.  Such high-level civilians or generals would seek to argue that the statutory and constitutional framework was not "clear enough" for them to be guilty.<br /><br />When we get to the stage of criminal prosecution of these high-level civilians and generals for torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment, we shouldn&#39;t tolerate this line of argument &#8212; even if the Supreme Court is so willing to turn a blind eye to lawlessness at the instigation of high-level civilians. The point must be made in any case how clear and limpid the law is in the relevant statutes on the basis of which these individuals are being charged to deter the "I didn't know." kind of argument. Ironically, the use of false narrative and shoddy legal analysis in the torture memos may in fact help such prosecution because of the improbable nature of the analysis and conclusions in those memos and &#8212; most importantly &#8212; the contemporaneous severe criticism of these analyses by other lawyers privy in the former Administration. In this regard, the efforts of the military Judge Advocate Generals, Alberto Mora, other lawyers in the Department of Justice who dissented, Phillip Zelikow and William Taft at State, were all truly noble efforts to ensure that the rule of law is preserved in a time of lawlessness.  The attempts to stifle these lawyers&#39; dissents should be part of any evaluation of high-level claims of innocence.<br /><br />Beyond a reasonable doubt, I do not buy the &quot;different spanks for different ranks&quot; approach.  It is an attempt to enshrine a misfeasance/malfeasance distinction based on rank that may have served high-level persons on other occasions, but should not prevail in the face of both statutory and treaty obligations on torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment. The international law for dereliction of duty holds a leader liable for his own wrongdoing or fault because the leader is expected to take reasonable corrective action upon learning (or, where viewed objectively, the leader should have learned) of wrongdoing by subordinates.  According to the international legal standard, the leader&#39;s wrongdoing need not be purposeful, as the Court held Monday; it is enough if the leader knows or should have known that subordinates are doing wrong and the leader takes no reasonable corrective action.  We add the &quot;should have known" criminal negligence type liability so that the leader is not able to point to his or her own dereliction in failing to become informed as an excuse and the leader must try to keep informed (thanks to Professor Jordan Paust for assistance on these points of leader liability).<br /><br />In asserting the concept of <em>refluat stercus</em> in a recent article, I attempted to broaden our thinking beyond strict command responsibility or <em>respondeat superior</em> to capture the broader set of possibilities in domestic law in order to vindicate the international legal obligations we have with regard to torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment
. The Supreme Court majority's effort attempts to try to narrow, in advance of criminal cases, the playing field for decision making. I will have none of that.  Our courts should make sure that we do not allow persons we have entrusted with public official status to use the levers of that protected status or agency law to protect themselves in that public structure from criminal liability for their actions. My colleague has written precisely to this point in an earlier <a href="/forumy/2009/05/rice-waterboarding-and-accountability.php">JURIST op-ed</a>.<br /><br />We will see whether, in a future proceeding before the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts and those in the majority will seek to make "context" arguments on the serious international crime of torture to try to absolve high-level civilians or military generals of criminal liability for their acts in orchestrating the policy of torture for which some of the lower-level persons who did their bidding have been convicted. For now, we should look at <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</em> as a warning to Americans that our Supreme Court may be trying to set up "different spanks for different ranks." We fought a revolution to end that kind of privilege of class. Maybe the originalists need to go back and read Thomas Paine and others to remember that no one is above the law.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that former Vice President Dick Cheney&#39;s statements about his direct involvement in the authorization of unlawful interrogation tactics such as waterboarding are clear evidence of complicity in international crime, if not also participation in a criminal conspiracy, and use of those tactics cannot be legally excused by any alleged doctrine of &quot;necessity&quot;....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/paustbig.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->F<!-- odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->ormer Vice-President Dick Cheney is chatting about his role in assuring approval and use of manifestly unlawful interrogation tactics such as waterboarding during the eight-year Bush Administration.  According to Cheney, he has "[n]o regrets" that he was directly involved in the approval of severe interrogation methods, including waterboarding, and he has admitted that he was involved in helping to get the process cleared by President Bush.  Although Bush delegated national security matters to Cheney in the early years and all such matters went through him, Cheney <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/11/cheney.attacks/index.html">stated</a> that "this was a presidential decision" "and the decision went to the President.  He signed off on it." <br /><br /> On September 16, 2001, Cheney publicly declared that "[a] lot of what needs to be done ... ["on the dark side"] will have to be done quietly, ... using ... methods that are available to our intelligence agencies ... to use any means at our disposal, basically, to achieve our objective."  He added: "we" "have the kind of treatment of these individuals that we believe they deserve."  For the next two years, many of his preferences were effectuated by his top lawyer, David Addington.  Moreover, it has been reported that Cheney attended meetings of the National Security Council's Principals Committee in the White House Situation Room during 2002 and 2003, at which specific tactics such as waterboarding and the "cold cell" were addressed and expressly and/or tacitly approved and abetted.  It has also been reported that during this time there was "live feed" or "real time" viewing of parts of actual interrogations, including that of al Qahtani at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.<br /><br /> According to the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), SERE (&quot;survival, evasion, resistance, escape&quot;) tactics were being used against detainees at Guantanamo in September 2002 and that, during October 2002, military intelligence interrogators "used military dogs in an aggressive manner to intimidate" al Qahtani.  In November 2002, FBI Deputy Assistant Director Harrington <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/al-qahtani-v.-bush,-al-qahtani-v.-gates">reported</a> that al Qahtani had exhibited symptoms of "extreme psychological trauma." Around the third week in November, he was subjected to what was known as the "First Special Interrogation Plan," a plan to use tactics later detailed in an 84-page log describing their use during a six-week period.  CCR reported that among several tactics used were: threats against his family, forced nudity and sexual humiliation, threats and attacks by dogs, beatings, and the cold-cell or exposure to low temperatures for prolonged times. <br />    <br /> Each of these tactics is patently illegal under the laws of war, human rights law, and the Convention Against Torture, among other relevant international legal proscriptions and requirements.  As my article <a href="/pdf/paustfinal.pdf">The Absolute Prohibition of Torture</a> documents, death threats, use of dogs to create intense fear, beatings, the cold cell or a related inducement of hypothermia, and waterboarding are each manifest forms of "torture" that are absolutely prohibited under all circumstances and regardless of the status of the victim.  In fact, there are 29 U.S. judicial opinions and 7 U.S. executive Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, among other cases and materials, recognizing that waterboarding and related inducements of suffocation are "torture."  If they were not torture, they would also be absolutely prohibited as cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, along with the other tactics mentioned.<br /><br /> Cheney's direct involvement is clear evidence of complicity in international crime, if not also participation in a criminal conspiracy.  As documented in my article, criminal complicity can occur when a person is aware that his or her conduct can or will assist or facilitate conduct of a direct perpetrator, such as use of waterboarding, the cold cell, and dogs to instill intense fear.  He does not need to know that these are criminal or even "torture."  In any event, it has been reported that when Cheney found out that a CIA Inspector General&#39;s report warned that several such tactics were criminal, he became irate and ordered the Inspector General to his office. As the treaty creating the International Criminal Court also declares while reflecting customary law, "a mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime ... shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility."  (Rome Statute of the ICC, art. 32(2)). <br /><br />  What is Cheney's apparent excuse?  He claims that there was a need to engage in the illegal tactics, but others have affirmed that there was no need to engage in illegal interrogation tactics and that, on the contrary, it was well-known by professionals that reliable intelligence must be obtained by lawful means of interrogation.   Furthermore, it is well-understood that under every relevant treaty-based and customary international law there is no such thing as a necessity defense with respect to outlawed tactics that are torture or cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment.  Such forms of ill-treatment are strictly prohibited in all circumstances.  More generally, it is well-understood that the laws of war are to be strictly applied during war when our national security is seriously threatened by enemies who have killed and will kill our nationals in the future. <br /><br /> Some have argued that there is a common law necessity defense that might be available if conduct was actually necessary.  One of the August 1, 2002 Bybee memos made this claim when citing <em>United States v. Bailey</em>, 444 U.S. 394 (1980).  The Bybee memo failed to note, however, that the Supreme Court's opinion expressly warned that "[i]f there was a reasonable, legal alternative to violating the law ... the defense will fail" and the defendant must prove "that given the imminence of the threat, violation of ... [a law] was his <em>only</em> reasonable alternative."  444 U.S. at 410-11 (emphasis added).  Whether or not a threat of a major attack continued each year for eight years and was always imminent, reasonable legal alternatives with respect to time-honored forms of interrogation designed to obtain reliable intelligence were clearly always available.  In fact, the CIA IG&#39;s report declared that there is no evidence that criminal tactics stopped &quot;any credible threats&quot; and it is known that lawful forms have <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3842&wit_id=7906">often worked faster and more reliably</a> against high-level al Qaeda detainees, sometimes within an hour or a little longer. Thus necessarily, a judge must rule that, as a matter of law, the alleged necessity defense is unavailable and that the fact that a few secreted files might indicate whether torture led to useful information in a given instance is legally irrelevant.  <br /><br /> Additionally, as a matter of law, the defense is not available if relevant law sets an absolute standard, such a
s the various treaty-based and customary international legal prohibitions of torture and cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment in all circumstances.  Furthermore, as a matter of law, both treaty-based and customary international law, as supreme federal law under the U.S. Constitution, will trump inconsistent common law whether or not there might be such a common law defense to ordinary crime when international law has not been violated. <br /> <br /> Of additional import is the venerable rule announced in <em>The Charming Betsy</em>, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 117-18 (1804), that federal statutes must be interpreted consistently with international law &#8212; in this instance, consistently with the absolute prohibition of torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment.  Therefore, the Torture statute, the War Crimes Act, and 10 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 818 (which has incorporated all violations of the laws of war by reference as crimes against the laws of the United States since the 1950s &#8212; as had its precursor, the 1916 Articles of War that were found to be constitutionally sound as a basis for prosecution in <em>Ex parte Quirin</em> (1942)) must be interpreted to preclude any alleged necessity exception.  It is of further interest that the Supreme Court declared more recently in <em>Sosa v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.williamgeorgeross.com/">William G. Ross</a> of Cumberland School of Law, Samford University, says that while the US Court Supreme Court might benefit from the nomination of an elected public official, President Obama should not nominate such a person to serve as a Justice merely for the sake of diversifying the Court...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/williamrossnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>S</strong></font>ome U.S. senators and commentators are encouraging President Barack Obama to nominate a U.S. Supreme Court Justice whose primary professional experience has been non-judicial, particularly a person who has served in an elected public office. <br /><br /> Advocates of a non-judicial nominee contend that Obama's Supreme Court nominee ought to have more "real world" experience than do present members of the Court, all of whom served as U.S. Court of Appeals judges, and none of whom have served in elected office.  Until Samuel Alito joined the Court in 2006, the Court never had been composed solely of former circuit court judges or lacked any Justice who had held elected office. The present Court also is more "academic" than at most other times in its history, with three of its members (Stephen Breyer, Antonin Scalia, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg) having been law professors. <br /><br /> Shortly after David H. Souter announced his retirement, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid expressed his preference for the appointment of someone other than a judge -- "people with some real-life experience...rather than people who walk around in these black robes all the time." Similarly, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, remarked in the wake of Souter's announcement that he would "like to see more people from outside the judicial monastery, not just as a judge." And Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a former longtime member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, declared in 2007 during a debate among candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination that "We have enough professors on the bench. I want someone who ran for dog catcher." <br /><br /> Sandra Day O'Connor, who had served as majority leader of the Arizona state senate and an elected state trial judge, was the last Justice who had held an elected office. Before O'Connor, the last Justice who had served as an elected public official was her predecessor, Potter Stewart, who served two terms on the Cincinnati city council. The last nationally prominent career politician to serve on the Court was Earl Warren, who spent eleven years as governor of California before serving as chief justice from 1953 to 1969. For most of the Court's history, however, its members have included substantial numbers of prominent political figures, including former mayors, state officials, United States congressmen, and Cabinet members. <br /><br /> The frequent appointment of Court of Appeals judges also is a relatively new phenomenon. Before President Eisenhower appointed three circuit court judges (Stewart, John Harlan II, and Charles Evans Whittaker)  to the Court during the 1950s, only two former circuit court judges (Wiley B. Rutledge and Willis Van Devanter) and three former federal district court judges (John H. Clarke, Edward T. Sanford, and Fred Vinson) had served on the Court during the twentieth century. Neither of President Kennedy's two nominees had been circuit court judges, and only one of President Johnson's three successful nominees (Thurgood Marshall) was a Court of Appeals judge. Four of President Nixon's six nominees (Warren Burger and Harry Blackmun and the unsuccessful nominees Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell) were circuit court judges, and every subsequent confirmed nominee except for O'Connor has been appointed from the Court of Appeals. <br /><br /> Although President Clinton appears to have seriously considered the nomination of at least four prominent public officials -- Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt; New York Governor Mario Cuomo; Senator George Mitchell of Maine; and former South Carolina Governor Richard Riley, who served as Clinton's secretary of education &#8212; he eventually nominated Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both circuit judges and former law professors. <br /><br /> Advocates of the appointment of a Justice who has served in public office correctly contend that this experience might make justices more sensitive to separation of powers issues. Similarly, service as a state official might make a Justice more aware of the importance of federalism. Many or most of the present Justices, however, have demonstrated a proper sensitivity toward both federalism and separation of powers. Moreover, there are professional experiences other than service in elected office that can provide Justices with "hands on" political experience. Several of the present Justices, for example, served early in their careers as attorneys in the U.S. Justice Department, where they had opportunities to closely observe the inner workings of the executive branch of the federal government. <br /> <br /> There is no clear correlation between experience as an elected public official and distinction as a Supreme Court justice. Several of the Court's most distinguished members, including Chief Justices Warren, John Marshall, Salmon P. Chase, William Howard Taft, and Charles Evans Hughes, had substantial experience in elected office. On the other hand, many other notable justices, including Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. and Benjamin N. Cardozo, never were elected to public office.  One of the greatest justices, Louis D. Brandeis, who spent his  pre-Court career as an attorney in private practice, never served as a judge, professor, or public official.  <br /><br /> The three U.S. senators whom President Truman nominated to the Court (Harold H. Burton, Sherman Minton, and Fred Vinson) receive low rankings from historians. Of the nine Justices nominated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the five who had not served in elected office (Felix Frankfurter, Wiley P. Rutledge, Robert H. Jackson, and William O. Douglas, and Harlan Fiske Stone)  generally had more distinguished service on the Court than three of the four who had been  elected officials. Hugo Black, who had been a U.S. senator, became an outstanding Justice, but historians are less kind toward Frank Murphy, who had been mayor of Detroit and governor of Michigan; James Byrnes, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate; and Stanley Reed, who had served in the Kentucky legislature. With the exception of Rutledge, however, the Roosevelt nominees who had not held elected office had nevertheless had significant political experience. Jackson and Stone had served as U.S. Attorney General, Douglas had been chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Frankfurter had been a close advisor to Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> One of the dangers of having prominent politicians on the Court is that they may harbor presidential aspirations. Prior to the middle of the twentieth century, when many Supreme Court Justices were national political figures, a remarkably large number of Justices conducted covert presidential campaigns, and a few even campaigned openly from the bench. In at least three-quarters of the presidential election years between 1832 and 1960, one or more Justices attempted to obtain a presidential or vice presidential nomination or were prominently mentioned as presidential or vice presidential candidates. <br /><br /> It is highly unlikely that any Justice today would openly campaign for the presidency because such a campaign would severely compromise contemporary expectations of judicial behavior and would violate Canon 5(a)(2) of the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, which requires a judge to resign upon becoming a candidate for non-judicial office. Similarly, it would be dif
ficult for any Justice today to conduct a covert campaign for the presidency because modern presidential bids are so protracted, and require herculean fund-raising efforts that would be impossible to conceal.<br /><br /> There is a very real danger, however, that a highly political Justice might try to use the Court as a platform for a future presidential bid. There is evidence that the presidential aspirations of several nineteenth century Justices, particularly Salmon P. Chase and Stephen J. Field,  influenced those Justices' judicial decisions or at least affected the manner in which they wrote some of their opinions. Any perception that a Justice is calculating his votes or crafting his opinions for the purpose of currying favor with voters could significantly diminish public confidence in the integrity of the Court, which is the ultimate source of its power and influence. <br /><br /> Another danger of appointing a politician to the Court may arise from their connections to the nominating president. All four of Truman's nominees were personal friends, and three had been his colleagues in the U.S. Senate. At least three of these Justices receive low rankings from Court historians. Although some presidential friends have turned out to be distinguished Justices, a President's appointment of close political ally can encourage the erosion of separation of powers insofar as some presidents have remained in close contact with "their" Justices. The most egregious example was Abe Fortas, who offered political advice to Lyndon Johnson on a virtually daily basis and even is reported to have helped him write speeches and select Vietnam bombing targets. Since Johnson, no political buddy of a president has served on the Court. Harriet Miers's close association with George W. Bush as White House counsel helped sink her nomination in 2006.<br /><br /> If a prominent political figure were appointed to the Court, there also is a danger that the Justice would fail to make the adjustment from the robust world of politics to the more hermetic life of the Court. Such a justice might fail to recognize that public respect for the Court and the integrity of its rulings are jeopardized when a Justice makes extra-judicial comments about non-judicial issues. Although Justices can facilitate public understanding of the law through public comments on judicial issues, a Justice who is too accustomed to the limelight of the media might be tempted to comment indiscreetly about the inner workings of the Court or the Court's opinions, which usually should speak for themselves. Too many American institutions, public and private, have been trivialized by our culture of celebrity. The Court has largely avoided this virus, and the next Justice would do well to emulate Souter, who shunned unnecessary publicity and faithfully and quietly performed his duties without fanfare or hoopla. This is not much to ask of a professional politician, but it may be too much to expect. <br /><br /> Although many politicians are clamoring for fellow politicians to be appointed to the Court, several law professors have aptly pointed out the Court might benefit from the appointment of a state or federal trial judge. This would be particularly useful in the many cases involving criminal procedure that come before the Court. O'Connor's experience as a state trial judge clearly made her a more effective Justice. Hugo Black was derided at the time of his nomination in 1937 because his only judicial experience was as a judge of Birmingham's lowly night police court, but Black's tenure on this grassroots court is credited with helping to forge his sensitivity toward the needs of poor persons and African-Americans.  During the past century, only a handful of Justices -- Clarke, William J. Brennan, Sanford, Vinson, and Whittaker &#8212; have served as federal trial judges. <br /><br /> Military service is another life experience that might be useful to a Justice. It is unlikely, however, that the next Justice will be a veteran, particularly if the Justice is a woman, since so few elites have served in the military during recent decades. Most Justices in the past had military experience, but John Paul Stevens, who served three years in the Navy during the Second World War, is the only present Justice who has had full-time military service. Stevens probably will be the last military veteran for a long time to come. <br /><br /> Ultimately, however, professional experience may be less important than other more intangible qualities, particularly intellect, integrity, and an ability to work effectively with fellow Justices. <br /><br /> When Whittaker was nominated by Eisenhower in 1957, he was touted as uniquely well qualified and experienced because he would be the only Justice in history who served as both a federal trial judge and a Court of Appeals judge. Whittaker, however, is commonly (albeit somewhat unfairly) ranked a "failure" in polls of judicial reputation. After serving only five years, he resigned from the Court because the demands of the job threatened his physical and psychological health. <br /><br />  Although experience as a the U.S. Court of Appeals judge is the nearest possible approximation that one can have to service as a U.S. Supreme Court justice, even this experience does not fully prepare a person for service on the nation's highest court. Numerous Supreme Court Justices have emphasized that the Court is a world of its own that requires a long and difficult period of learning and adjustment, and that no previous "experience" can adequately prepare a neophyte Justice for his or her duties. Prior service as a clerk to a Supreme Court justice might help to ease the adjustment and provide useful training. Three present Justices &#8212; Stevens, Breyer, and Roberts &#8212; served as clerks to Justices, and Stevens in particular has spoken of how his clerkship with Rutledge taught him the importance of facts in adjudicating Supreme Court cases. But even prior service within the precincts of the Marble Palace is no substitute for the actual experience of sitting on the nation's highest bench. <br /><br /> In considering professional qualifications and experience, one also must distinguish between cause and effect. Is a nominee well qualified to serve on the Court because she has a certain type of experience or does she have that experience because she is the type of person who is well qualified to serve on the Court?  For example, several of the most significant Justices during the past century, including Holmes,  Brennan, and Cardozo, served as chief justices of state supreme courts. Clearly this experience was excellent training for their work on the U.S. Supreme Court; arguably, it was even more relevant than service on the U.S. Court of Appeals. But all three of these men were appointed to their state supreme courts at least in part because they were outstanding lawyers and legal thinkers, and the this trio probably would have rendered stellar service on the U.S. Supreme Court even without previous judicial experience. <br /><br /> Perhaps the greatest objection to drawing all Justices from the circuit courts is not that this circumscribes the experience that Justices bring to the Court but rather that it limits the pool of talent from which a President might choose to search for a Justice. Great Justices have come from a wide variety of professional backgrounds. Obama's pledge to appoint someone who has "empathy" with the problems of ordinary Americans suggests that he understands this and that he will not employ rigid  criteria of professional background in searching for his nominee. Obama should consider the nomination of elected public officials, from whose perspective the Court could benefit. But he should not nominate an elected official merely for the sake of diversifying the Court, particularly if there is a significant danger that the politician will seek the presidency or conduct other political activities from the bench. <br /><br /><br /><br /><em>William G.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/">Ed Richards</a> of Louisiana State University Law Center says that in the midst of current concerns about the spread of the H1N1 virus (popularly known as &quot;swine flu&quot;), passing more and stricter public health laws will neither strengthen the public health system nor effectively contain the spread of disease...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/richardsforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s this is being written, H1N1 is not a major threat, but this could change as the epidemic evolves. I want to look past the H1N1 outbreak and focus attention on what we will carry away from it, however it evolves. I am concerned because crisis-driven policy is easy to hijack, resulting in laws with horrible unintended consequences. Over the past four decades, public health crises have generated more than their share of bad laws. Some only create false expectations, but others have lead to great suffering and even death. I hope forewarned is forearmed for H1N1.<br /><br /><strong>Do We Need More Law?</strong><br /><br />It is not law <em>per se</em> that I worry about. I am quite supportive of public health law as expressed through administrative regulations and the broad exercise of the police powers. While public health depends primarily on voluntary cooperation, state public health agencies and the federal government have <a href="http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cphl/articles/hastings/hastings-Contents.htm">tremendous powers</a> to deal with a public health crisis. The United States entered the 1970s with a public health system that had nearly tripled life expectancy over the past 100 years through sanitation, which had nearly wiped out the worst of the communicable diseases in the U.S., and which was immunizing a sizable part of the population against seasonal flu. All this, including the quarantine of individuals and <a href="http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cases/pp/Compagnie.htm">whole regions</a>, had been managed through general grants of legislative power and administrative regulations. This framework has not been declared unconstitutional and as classic administrative law, there is no reason to think the United States Supreme Court would stop deferring to agency action in public health when it supports agency deference in all other areas of administrative law.<br /><br /><strong>The Interest Groups</strong><br /><br />What I worry about are statutes, i.e., specific public health policies passed into statutes to please interest groups. From quarantining people who are coughing to taxing fat people, pushing for public health statutes has become the rage at the CDC, federal and state legislatures, and private foundations. These are driven by traditional interest groups, such as employers worried about health care costs, drug companies, military contractors who want to sell bioterrorism monitors, and federal officials in recent administrations who wanted to extend the national security state.<br /><br />The last decade has seen a new interest group arise: contract researchers operating out of universities who live on grant funds to write new laws. No matter the problem, their solution is a new law, because they make no money if they admit that the problem is just that public health agencies do not have the staff to do a job because they are broke, or that there is no problem at all. Expect to see these groups calling for massive new public health powers to deal with H1N1, claiming that public health agencies and the federal government lack key powers. As noted below, public health emergencies are fully integrated into our national security laws, allowing the federal government essentially unlimited powers if it chooses to use them. Perhaps the only real limit is that since President Obama repudiated the <a href="http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cases/nat-sec/olc.htm">torture memos</a>, the torture of potential disease carriers is now off limits.<br /><br /><strong>Untended Consequences - The Road to Hell</strong><br /><br />Concerns with the public health consequences of illegal drug use in the 1960s led to Nixon&#39;s war on drugs and Rockefeller&#39;s draconian drug laws, which spread across the United States. These laws have had profound unintended consequences and seem to slip the mind of public health law scholars who tout the value of new public health statutes. In the 1980s, civil libertarians lobbied state legislatures and Congress to protect persons with AIDS. The result was to make it nearly impossible to do public health screening and case finding for HIV infection. This exacerbated the AIDS epidemic and was only reversed as a matter of federal policy in <a href="http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cdc/rr5514.pdf">2006</a>. Many states still have laws in place that limit disease control efforts for HIV. (In several states, the entire disease control code was revised, undermining the control of tuberculosis and other diseases. These laws had to be revised again as tuberculosis surged in the 1990s.)<br /><br />Post 9/11 and the anthrax letters, fears of bioterrorism lead the CDC to develop the <a href="http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/bt/MSEHPA_review.htm">Model State Emergency Health Powers Act</a> and push states to adopt it. This was criticized by many public law scholars for being a dangerous intrusion into civil liberties and probably also unworkable. More fundamentally, if you are versed in national security law, you know that the push for public health emergency powers laws at the state and federal level were derived from the Bush/Cheney vision of the seamless national security state. Taken with the Patriot Act and other national security laws, public health and safety emergencies have been recharacterized as national security threats, which creates paths for the use of the military in domestic policing and the overruling of state public health authority by the federal government.<br /><br />The real problem with all of these laws is that the problems they address are not problems of legal authority. They do nothing to address the loss of resources and expertise from health departments, and the weakness of political leaders when facing difficult choices. We have created a system of Potemkin laws whose real purpose is to allow legislatures to claim to have done something about public health emergencies without spending the money or political capital to address the weakness in the public health and medical care system. Look how well these laws worked for Hurricane Katrina. Louisiana had passed stacks of emergency powers laws after 9/11, had done all the federal planning exercises, yet was completely unprepared for Hurricane Katrina because that would have required spending money and admitting that New Orleans could flood. Yet Katrina spawned another deluge of federal and state emergency powers laws, passed as states continued to cut their already inadequate health department budgets.<br /><br /><strong>What We Did Not Learn From SARS</strong><br /><br />The most recent failure, and the one most on point with H1N1, was the reaction to the 2003 <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/">SARS</a> outbreak. Canada appointed a royal commission to study and make recommendations about the lessons learned from SARS. The commission published an excellent set of <a href="http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/sars/index.htm">reports</a> on all aspects of the SARS epidemic and the government&#39;s response. The commission was clear: strategies such as social distancing, not going to work sick, and voluntary isolation can work only if the affected individuals are supported by the employers and the government. Individuals must have paid sick leave, worker&#39;s compensation must cover workplace acquired infection, there must be health insurance coverage for personally acquired illness, and employers and others institutions must workout t
he details of mandatory immunization programs with unions and workers before there is an outbreak.<br /><br />The Canadians found little or no role for coercion, but a critical role for the government and employers to provide support to allow individuals to stay home without loss of income and with adequate medical care and food. The response in the United States was to pass even more quarantine laws, to provide bench books to judges on how to enforce those laws, and to encourage local law enforcement to think about their rules of engagement when enforcing quarantine - do you shoot the soccer mom fleeing with the minivan full of children?<br /><br />There have been no provisions for the nearly half of workers without paid sick leave, for workers with infected family members who will lose pay if they stay home, for health care for the uninsured. The huge population of undocumented aliens and the legal and illegal underground economy have been ignored, yet we know those who participate in the underground economy are not likely to honor snow days and other social distancing strategies because they do not eat if they do not work.<br /><br /><strong>What Will We Not Learn From H1N1?</strong><br /><br />The best outcome for H1N1 is that we have relatively few cases and deaths, we will develop a vaccine over the summer, we will conduct an orderly vaccination program in the fall, and H1N1 will become just one virus on the list we consider for each seasonal flu vaccine. (For perspective, remember that yearly flu outbreak results in a few million cases and 10-20,000 deaths, with no great disruption in life and the economy.) We will look back and realize that it would have been nice to have more epidemiologists in the states with cases, and the states and the federal government will increase funding and job protections for expert staff at health departments.<br /><br />More likely, whatever the outcome of H1N1, the result will be more laws benefiting more interest groups and politicians&#39; reelection campaigns, and no long-term support for the public health system.<br />    <br /><br /><em><a href="http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/">Edward P.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ana Nikodijevic, visiting scholar from the School of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade, comments on the ongoing development of human rights law in Serbia...<br /><hr size="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/serbia11-720554.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:4pt 10px 10px 4pt;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/serbia11-720552.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><strong>A</strong>lthough the ethnic conflicts of the 1990s are a distant memory for much of the world, they had massive consequences for Serbia. After a decade of Milosevic&#39;s unscrupulous regime and ideology, the country was left with a ravaged economy and culture. <br /><br />Serbia and its citizens will require a long time to heal from the numerous scars and wounds caused by wars, unemployment, low wages, international isolation and unprecedented hyperinflation. It has been almost 15 years since the end of the wars in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, and 10 years since the conflict in Kosovo, but Serbia has not yet provided shelter for all its refugees. According to data from various non-governmental organizations (NGOs), there are still 6,000 people living in collective centers without access to housing or employment. I am among the lucky people who did not actually experience the war, but I have family members who did. One of my uncles came from Croatia and had to start over from scratch. He found a job, got married, bought a house and had a son. Thanks to his parents&#39; efforts, my nephew started taking English and tennis lessons when he was only 3 years old. This gives me hope for all the other people who are not doing well or could not reconnect with their former lives again.<br /><br />Serbian rule of law must continue to develop so that it can adeptly address the vital human rights issues facing refugees and other minorities. The 2006 Constitution defines Serbia as a country made up of the Serbian people and all of the citizens who live in it. It is founded on the rule of law and social justice principles of civil democracy, human and minority rights and freedoms and based on European principles and values. Furthermore, it says the government&#39;s role is to respect ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious differences among its citizens. However, it is not unusual to find discrepancies between words on paper and real-life practices. The rule of law is still developing and the government continues to make improvements to it. Throughout the previous decade, I also saw several NGOs develop and become active in this field by calling on the new role of civil society in order to solve existing problems. <br /><br />Although we have seen improvements in Serbian law, I and other citizens living in Serbia today continue to encounter numerous human rights issues on a daily basis including hate speech, discrimination (against refugees, Roma, women, and people with disabilities) and domestic violence. Many of us in Serbia are greatly concerned with the increase in the number of individuals, groups and organizations promoting intolerance, racial hatred and attacks on minorities. There is intolerance towards a number of marginalized social groups based on race, ethnicity, gender or age. The number of neo-Nazi movements and incidents has increased during the last couple of years and some organizations hide their true identities behind the idea of &quot;Serbian Nationalism.&quot;  Despite the fact that The Ministry for Human and Minority Rights was re-established in 2008, formally increasing the protection afforded disadvantaged social groups, there is little deterrence to discontinue neo-Nazi movements or hate crimes, since legal prosecution is only rarely applied in cases of anti-Semitism. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/serbia100-721972.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:4pt 4pt 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/serbia100-721968.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>When discussing discrimination in Serbia, it is unavoidable to discuss the plight of the Roma, 110,000 of whom live in the country. An ethnic minority, Roma are so marginalized and discriminated against that it seems that they can only be seen on the street begging for food in old, torn clothes and usually barefoot, or on public transportation singing and playing musical instruments for money. Most Roma (80%) live in isolated and segregated settlements, and most children (75%) are not enrolled in elementary school. <br /><br />Without permanent addresses, the Roma people lack the possibility to obtain identity cards and, subsequently, to access health care and social services. In an attempt to solve this problem, Serbia has joined the regional program &quot;Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015&quot; with the objectives of improving the status and social inclusion of the Roma people into Central and Southeastern Europe. The project has thus far succeeded in drafting strategies and action plans in those spheres where Roma are most in jeopardy: education, housing, health care and employment. Hopefully, the implementation of these strategies and plans in Serbia will bring benefits to communities and incite further improvements.<br /><br />Women, too, continue to face discrimination in Serbia. Although an increasing number of women in our society contribute financially to the family income, their central role is still to run the household and raise children. In most families in Serbia, especially in rural areas, men rarely share domestic responsibilities. Balancing between work and home can be difficult, especially if a woman is a victim of domestic violence. Unfortunately, cases of domestic violence are widespread in the country. Most cases are not reported to the authorities for several reasons: fear of retaliation, distrust of the legal system and inadequate protection for victims. In order for the rule of law to reach its full potential, citizen awareness and demand for equal protection must increase.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/serbia4-700288.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:4pt 10px 10px 4pt;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/serbia4-700285.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Additionally, women are frequently discriminated against in the labor market. Certain jobs are still perceived as men&#39;s jobs, and there is an almost visible glass ceiling that keeps women from rising above certain levels in organizations. The Serbian parliament made a positive step towards gender equality with the adoption of a gender quota that at minimum 30% of its members must be female. The quota increased women&#39;s participation in Parliament, but Serbian women will still have to wait for a gender discrimination act or implementation of the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.<br /><br />Furthermore, if a woman has a disability, she easily becomes the victim of double discrimination. Despite passage of the Preventing Discrimination of Persons with Disabilities Act, which went into effect in 2006, individuals with disabilities still have a hard time in Serbia due to poor enforcement of the Act. While studying and then teaching at the School of Organizational Sciences, I noticed that students with disabilities had difficulties when trying to access school premises. Although the school has front access for the disabled, students are very often accompanied by their parents who help them reach inaccessible floors and classrooms to attend lectures and take exams. As a public institution, the school is also obliged by law to employ at least one person with a disability. It has not, however, done so thus far.<br /><br />Although Serbia still has a lot of work to do in order to fully establish the rule of law, the country has come a long way in th
e past several years. Even though enforcement must be strengthened, all new acts in the field meet European standards and requirements. Looking at the country today gives me hope that the gap between people&#39;s expectations and reality will lessen over time.  I also hope that we will succeed in building an unshakable multi-ethnic and multicultural society in which every citizen receives equal treatment and opportunities for achievement.<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt;" size="2">Sources:<br /><br />1.Constitution of the Republic of Serbia of 2006: <a href="http://www.parlament.sr.gov.yu/content/lat/akta/akta_detalji.asp?Id=382&t=Z#">http://www.parlament.sr.gov.yu/content/lat/akta/akta_detalji.asp?Id=382&amp;t=Z#</a> <br />2.Report of the Republic of Serbia for the Universal Periodic Review of the UN Council for Human Rights, the Ministry for Human and Minority Rights, Belgrade, 2008: <a href="http://www.humanrights.gov.yu/dokumenti/sektor_ljudska/Izvestaj_univerzalni_pregled.pdf ">http://www.humanrights.gov.yu/dokumenti/sektor_ljudska/Izvestaj_univerzalni_pregled.pdf </a><br />3.Report on the implementation of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Ministry for Human and Minority Rights, Belgrade, 2008: <a href="http://www.humanrights.gov.yu/dokumenti/Izvestaj-Evropska_povelja%20_3_.pdf">http://www.humanrights.gov.yu/dokumenti/Izvestaj-Evropska_povelja%20_3_.pdf</a><br /><br />Photo credits: Catherine Picquet</font><br />

		<title>Rejection of Khodorkovsky appeal latest example of due process failures</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2006/09/about_this_blog.htm"><strong>Robert Amsterdam</strong></a> [counsel for <a href="http://www.mbktrial.com/">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a>]: &quot;This summer, a second trial is being carried out by the Russian government against Mikhail Khodorkovsky - once Russia&#39;s most successful oil executive and opposition financier.  As may be expected, the good news continues to come from outside of Russia, where some rule-of-law courts are able to fairly view the evidence.  On May 21 the European Court of Human Rights issued a decision to admit a complaint from Khodorkovsky that Russia had violated three articles of the European Convention on Human Rights in their persecution of him.  Inside Russia, the courts have tended to ignore the defense and rule in favor of the State, most recently on June 1 when the Moscow City Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/russia-court-rejects-khodorkovsky.php">rejected an appeal</a> from Khodorkovsky regarding his inordinately long and illegal pre-trial detention.<br /><br />Prior to this new trial, Russia&#39;s most well known political prisoner had spent more than two years imprisoned in an &quot;isolator&quot; facility (SIZO), which is an unusually long period for anyone to be held awaiting trial.  The fact that Russia has broken the law to hold Khodorkovsky in this painful limbo illustrates several realities about the case in my opinion:  first, the prosecutors have been totally incapable of fabricating a credible case; second, Russia&#39;s political elite are likely in disagreement over what precisely should be done with Khodorkovsky; and lastly, there is reason to believe some hold a vindictive desire to impart as much suffering upon the prisoner as possible.<br /><br />By placing Khodorkovsky in the isolator so early, prosecutors deprived him of the more relaxed rules of incarceration of the prison colony.  In the harsher conditions of this facility, being kept in a small jail cell, Khodorkovsky has been under round-the-clock surveillance, he has been deprived of exercise and fresh air, and his family visits have been restricted to a minimum.<br /><br />Under Russian law, even if prisoners are under investigation for new allegations, they are to continue to serve their existing sentence as stipulated by the existing court verdict &#8212; which for Khodorkovsky would have meant the far less inhumane general prison colony.  I can only speculate over whether the authorities were upset that Khodorkovsky was successful in building strong support among other prisoners; for example, he had begun teaching some inmates finance and economics classes during their free time and he had purchased books and periodicals for the prison library.  Other ex-prisoners have come out in his defense, denouncing various pressures from the prison administrators.<br /><br />In the face of the obvious bad faith of the authorities in holding Khodorkovsky under the isolation regime, he petitioned the courts to ensure that his rights &#8212; and Russian law &#8212; be respected.  However the June 1st rejection of this appeal by the Court struck down this request, confirming the prosecution&#39;s view that Khodorkovsky can be held until August 17 &#8212; and thereafter for additional renewable three-month periods.<br /><br />Furthermore, the court refused to hear all of Khodorkovsky&#39;s other complaints about the severe due process violations that have been and are being committed against him, finding them not subject to appellate review.  These complaints addressed the absurdity of the current charges in both fact and law; the expiry of the statute of limitations for certain elements of the indictment; and the refusal of the court to accept any defense evidence whatsoever.  The appeal hearing was unlawfully closed to outside observers.<br /><br />Either the Russian Constitutional Court or the European Court of Human Rights would have to disagree with the rejection of Khodorkovsky&#39;s appeal.  Khodorkovsky is fully supported in his positions by both Russian law and international norms &#8212; yet the prosecutorial bulldozer continues unabated.  As new chapters in this Kafkaesque story are being written, we can only hope against all odds for a surprise verdict when the current trial finally wraps up.&quot;<br />

		<title>Failure to release torture photos a symptom of larger &#034;rule of law&#034; problems</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://votersforpeace.us/about.html"><strong>Kevin Zeese</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://votersforpeace.us/index2.php">VotersForPeace.US</a>, board member of <a href="http://velvetrevolution.us/">VelvetRevolution.US</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/abu-ghraib-photos-depict-rape-sexual.php">images of torture and abuse</a> of prisoners are vivid.  They are an embarrassment to a nation that led the efforts for the Geneva Convention which made torture and other war crimes illegal.  Now, the United States have sunk to the point where a &quot;liberal&quot; president is planning preventive detention of Gitmo prisoners that it cannot put on trial.  Why can&#39;t they be put on trial?  Because they were tortured and the evidence is tainted.  So the war crime of torture leads to the new crime of indefinite detention without trial.  What has happened to the rule of law?<br /> <br />Washington, DC is caught in a vice grip and unable to face up to the reality of torture and war crimes by US officials.  Vice President Cheney, looking like a criminal returning to the scene of the crime, is doing his best to prevent any investigation of war crimes that seem to have their root in his office.  The Congress, which was briefed 40 times on torture and remained silent, seems unable to act perhaps because of fear of its own complicity.  Attorney General Eric Holder testified under oath that he approved renditions of people in US custody to countries that torture.  And, the president has not only reversed himself and decided not to release thousands of photos and videos that will definitely show a program of torture and abuse, not a few bad apples violating the law, but he has appointed General McChrystal to head the Afghanistan War.  McChrystal commanded troops involved in torture, and according to investigative reporter Sy Hersh, served as Cheney&#39;s assassin in chief.  <br /> <br />What are Americans supposed to do?  First we must recognize this is a participatory democracy and if we believe in the rule of law, we must take action.  That is why I signed complaints against 12 Bush-era lawyers who helped to facilitate torture.  We are seeking their disbarment.  Shouldn&#39;t legal ethics mean, at a minimum, that if you use your legal license to provide cover for torture you should no longer have a legal license?  Of course, this is only a first step.  In the end the US needs a full discussion of torture and the appointment of a credible, special prosecutor who can investigate, gather the facts and apply the law without the confusion of partisan politics intruding.  <br /> <br />Torture needs to be brought out into the open and debated.  From where I stand it is hard to see any justification for it.  Not only is torture illegal under both US and international law, it is counterproductive in numerous ways.  For example:<br /> <br />1. Torture results in misinformation that confuses intelligence.  Indeed, it was the word of a prisoner tortured in Egypt, at the request of the US, that led to Colin Powell telling the UN that there was a link between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein when in fact there was none.  That prisoner allegedly committed suicide in Libya recently.<br /> <br />2. Torture is dangerous to US troops.  First, if US troops are captured they are now more likely to be tortured.  Second, the people the troops are fighting are less likely to surrender if they know they are facing torture.<br /> <br />3. Torture helps US enemies as it enrages local populations and provides a recruiting tool that builds their base of support while making it impossible for the US to win the hearts and minds of the public.<br /> <br />4.  Torture weakens the United States by making it less likely that allies will join our cause.  What country wants to be associated with a nation that is committing war crimes?<br /> <br />5.  Torture undermines what the US would like to be.  Americans do not want to be torturers.  Americans want to be a nation that lives within the law where no one, not even a president of vice president, is above the law.<br /> <br />The torture toxin in our body politic needs to be removed and this can only be done by applying the rule of law. Please join our efforts by visiting VotersForPeace.US and DisbarTortureLawyers.com.  Only active citizens can ensure the United States faces up to this issue.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Mehmet Tohti</strong> [Former Vice President, <a href="http://www.uyghurcongress.org/En/home.asp">World Uyghur Congress</a>]: &quot;Kory Teneycke, spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper, told the Associated Free Press that &quot;Canada is not looking to take any detainees from Guant&aacute;namo...In the case of the Uighurs and other Guantanamo Bay detainees Canada has no interest&quot;, in response to the Obama Administration&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/canada-refuses-us-request-to-accpet.php">request</a> of settling some of the Uyghur detainees kept in Guantanamo.<br />This is not a first rejection, however, as Ottawa has twice rejected previous requests from Washington for the relocation of already cleared Uyghur detainees in Guantanamo.<br /> <br />First of all, let us try to understand the background of Uyghur detainees who have been wrongfully detained for seven years without any charge of wrongdoing. They are Uyghurs from East Turkistan, renamed as Xinjiang Uyghurs Autonomous region after the Chinese military invasion in 1949. Since then Uyghurs have been the most prosecuted group in China for their distinct culture, unique national identity and the strategic importance of their territory and its abundant natural resources.<br /> <br />Like Tibetans, Uyghurs continued to resist against the fierce and systematic campaign of the Chinese government in order to keep their national existence. The mass influx of Chinese settlers backed by the central government not only has changed the demographic ratio in the region from 6% Chinese in 1950 to more than 60% Chinese today, but has also forced Uyghurs into economic segregation, political marginalization, religious prosecution and cultural assimilation in order to promote Chinese settlements as the dominant force. Many of those Uyghurs, like thousands of other Uyghur refuges, including myself, fled from Chinese prosecution to seek a new life. <br /><br />The September 11 terrorist attack has also changed the lives of many expatriate Uyghurs.  After being sold by Pakistani bounty hunters to the US military, they were brought to Guantanamo without having any clue about who is Al-Qaeda or the Taliban.<br /> <br />US Military tribunals since 2003 have cleared them from any wrongdoing and declared  they are ready for release and the Pentagon has already sent five of the 23 Uyghurs to Albania for settlement on May 2006.  Then Judge Ricardo Urbina of the US District Court ruled in September 2008 that the 17 wrongly imprisoned Uyghur detainees at Guant&aacute;namo must be allowed entry into the United States.  In February 2009, Sweden accepted Mr. Adel Hakimjan, one of 5 Gitmo Uyghur detainees settled in Albania as a refuge despite enormous diplomatic pressure exerted by China&#39;s government to prevent it.  On May 21, 2009, in his televised remarks, President Obama confirmed that 17 Uyghur detainees at Guantanamo should not have been there in the first place and should be released. A number of EU countries are now working quietly to resettle qualified Guantanamo detainees in an effort to help shut down the Guantanamo detention facilities. China, however, has categorically classified them as &quot;terrorists&quot; and blocked other countries from taking them. Therefore the US government refused to send them back to China due to the Chinese record of torture, prosecution and even execution without proper legal process.<br /><br />In my opinion, Canada&#39;s flat rejection of Uyghur detainees from Guantanamo upon the US request is a shortsighted decision and a reflection of Canadian weakness. Furthermore, it could be seen as a lost of opportunity, especially in connection with the arrest in China of a Uyghur Canadian, Mr. Huseyin Celil, who is sentenced to life imprisonment for the ambiguous charge of &quot;separatism&quot; despite Canada&#39;s strong expression. Many hoped that Canada would see the issue of Guantanamo Uyghurs as a rare opportunity to restore its credibility in handling the case of Mr. Celil and show its teeth to the Chinese government as a Canadian citizen continues to serve his unfounded conviction in a Chinese jail.<br /> <br />The Chinese government&#39;s intransigence for Prime Minister Harper&#39;s repeated requests to President Hu Jintao, China&#39;s flat denial of Canadian consular access to Mr. Celil&#39;s case contrary to the consular agreement between the two countries and China&#39;s unfounded conviction with life imprisonment without any due process has been huge embarrassment for Canada and continues to be so.  So in certain sense, Ottawa&#39;s rejection of the possibility of resettling some of the Guantanamo Uyghurs is a rejection of an opportunity to create a window of talks with the Chinese to advance Mr. Celil&#39;s case. Ottawa has now found itself on the same page as the Chinese government on the specific issue of Guantanamo Uyghurs. Ultimately this serves no Canadian interest.<br /> <br />Unlike others in Guantanamo, the 17 Uyghurs detainees possess strong political values and sooner or later will be taken by either the US or other EU countries for resettlement.  Yet China has successfully invalidated and nullified the strong remarks made by the Canadian Prime Minister and has disregarded repeated requests of Canadian officials on Mr. Celil&#39;s case, thus forcing Canada to adhere to Chinese terms for normalizing the frozen relationship after Mr. Celil&#39;s conviction. Meanwhile, Canada missed a rare opportunity created by the Uyghur detainees in Guantanamo for a possible initiation of dialogue with the Chinese government without a proper evaluation of its political values. <br /> <br />From this perspective, unlike Australia, Sweden and other EU Countries, Canada has become the first country that flatly rejected the settlement request of Guantanamo Uyghurs without giving any chance to the Chinese government to lobby against it. Such a national embarrassment is yet to be digested.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=87&subsecID=112&contentID=254494"><strong>Jim Arkedis</strong></a> [Director, National Security Project, <a href="http://www.ppionline.org/">Progressive Policy Institute</a>]: &quot;With the secretive <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/north-korea-high-court-sentences-us.php">conviction</a> of American journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee this week to twelve years&#39; hard labor in a North Korean camp, you might be surprised to learn that North Korea actually has a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2218389/?from=rss">functioning judiciary system</a>.  Though the West has little insight into how it works, we know that DPRK&#39;s 1998 constitution stipulates that trials will be decided by one judge and two &quot;people&#39;s assessors,&quot; that you don&#39;t need legal training to become a judge in North Korea, and that the accused do have the right to an attorney. And defendants can even defend themselves in English, though finding a judge who has learned English, but not law, would hardly be ideal.<br /> <br />But this show-trial is only part of a larger spectacle. When you consider that the Ling/Lee case shot up to Pyongyang&#39;s Central Court - bypassing the constitutionally mandated lower provincial courts - it becomes glaringly obvious that the Hermit Kingdom values propaganda, not justice, as its main goal.  <br /> <br />Here&#39;s how the Ling/Lee act fits into the overarching drama: Thus far in 2009, North Korea has tested four missiles and one underground nuclear device.  Reports from early June indicate more missile tests could be on the way.  While these actions have raised tensions with North Korea&#39;s American, European, and Asian interlocutors, it&#39;s no coincidence that they&#39;ve occurred just as Kim Jong Un&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the youngest son of the ailing Kim Jong Il&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;was announced North Korea&#39;s next Dear Leader.  <br /> <br />As with most insular juntas, the North Korean ruling elite likely views this transition period as a vulnerable time, when it believes its domestic and international foes are best positioned to topple the government.  In the West, though the possibility of an internal coup is relatively unknown, we are confident that the Obama administration isn&#39;t about to rain cruise missiles down on Pyongyang.  But Kim Jong Il&#39;s clique leaves nothing to chance, and these days they are likely extra paranoid.<br /> <br />So, it needs a distraction; or in this case, several distractions.  The Ling/Lee show-trial and military muscle-flexing are part of a coordinated act to distract the public by keeping them proud of North Korea&#39;s military might, angry at America for sending two spies, while putting America on notice that any aggression will bring consequences.<br /> <br />The timing of Laura Ling and Euna Lee&#39;s accidental tourism along the North Korean/Chinese border has been an incredible gift to the regime - the jailed Americans serve as insurance that the Obama administration will think twice before it takes any action, diplomatic or otherwise, that might punish Pyongyang.  North Korea will release the two well before their twelve-year sentences are up, but only when its leaders are feeling more secure about their grip on power.&quot;<br />

		<title>Obama&#039;s reversal on detainee abuse photos properly balances transparency and national security</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.rutherford.org/About/AboutJWW.asp"><strong>John W. Whitehead</strong></a> [Founder and President, <a href="http://www.rutherford.org/">The Rutherford Institute</a>]: &quot;President Obama has been accused of falling short of his campaign promises for a more transparent government. It certainly appears that the Obama administration is borrowing from George W. Bush&#39;s playbook, at least when it comes to keeping information on particularly controversial government programs from being disclosed. For example, Obama has increasingly relied on Bush&#39;s state secrets argument in several legal cases dealing with the CIA&#39;s extraordinary rendition program, the government&#39;s warrantless wiretapping of Americans&#39; phone calls, and the extent to which telecommunications companies aided the government in its eavesdropping efforts. <br /><br />However, despite harsh criticism from civil liberties groups such as the ACLU, Obama&#39;s recent <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/obama-reverses-decision-to-release.php">decision to block the release</a> of photographs documenting abuse of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan should not be blamed on his administration&#39;s lack of transparency. On this particular issue, at least, less disclosure might not be a bad thing.<br /><br />The photos in question, which could number close to 2,000, are at the center of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the ACLU in 2004. A federal appeals court ordered the Bush administration to release the photos in September 2008. And in March 2009, the government&#39;s request for a rehearing was denied. <br /><br />The Obama administration subsequently announced its intention to release the photos by May 28. However, according to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/13/AR2009051301751.html">Washington Post</a>, Obama &quot;changed his mind after viewing some of the images and hearing warnings from his generals in Iraq and in Afghanistan that such a move would endanger US troops deployed there.&quot; As Obama stated, &quot;The publication of these photos would not add any additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals. In fact, the most direct consequence of releasing them, I believe, would be to further inflame anti-American opinion and to put our troops in danger.&quot;<br /><br />In the wake of his reversal regarding the photos&#39; release, Obama has been harshly condemned by political supporters and civil liberties groups. One ACLU lawyer went so far as to declare that the Obama administration &quot;has essentially become complicit with the torture that was rampant during the Bush years by being complicit in its coverup.&quot;<br /><br />Yet releasing these torture photos, some of which have already been leaked and/or described in detail by the international news media, will do nothing more than titillate voyeurs and give radio talk-show hosts and television news channels something to talk about until the next news sensation arises. It certainly will not aid the cause of justice or increase government transparency. <br /><br />After all, these photos are not revelatory. Previously released pictures in 2004 clearly documented the depravity of some American military personnel who took part in torturing detainees. Who can forget the horrific images of detainees stripped naked, hooded, stacked one on top of the other into human pyramids, and forced into sexual positions while smiling soldiers stood nearby. <br /><br />As a result of the global outcry, 11 soldiers were tried and convicted, and others were reprimanded. According to a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/05/18/detainee.abuse.lookback/index.html">CNN/USA Today/Gallup</a> poll, &quot;Bush&#39;s overall performance rating sank to what was then the lowest of his presidency, 46 percent. The poll also showed support for the war at its lowest since before it began, with only 44 percent saying they believed it was worthwhile. It was a blow from which the administration, especially then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, never fully recovered.&quot;<br /><br />In the end, some good came of the release of that first set of photos - at least in terms of the nation engaging in an ongoing and much-needed national dialogue about the direction of the war, the Bush administration&#39;s stance on torture, and America&#39;s credibility in the eyes of the world. However, there is little good that can come from releasing the photos in question at this time. If the photos are as pornographic and offensive as those released in 2004, they could very well incite riots in Muslim countries and fuel intense anti-American sentiment. <br /><br />Worst of all, they could place American military forces and civilians in greater jeopardy. For example, days after the Abu Ghraib photos were released, American contractor Nicholas Berg was beheaded, allegedly in retaliation for the prisoner abuses. The video footage of his execution was even posted on the Internet. <br /><br />As Commander-in-Chief of the US Armed Forces, one of President Obama&#39;s primary concerns must be for the safety of the troops. Unfortunately, the political firestorm which has erupted over the fate of the torture photos is obscuring this greater concern. <br /><br />We must not allow ourselves to be so caught up in politics that we lose sight of what is really important for the safety of our troops and the future of the country. Releasing these torture photos will not shed any further light on the wrongs perpetrated. The cat, so to speak, is already out of the bag. <br /><br />The real consideration should be the impact on the troops in the field. And with 20,000 American forces preparing to deploy to Afghanistan and the fighting season in full swing, as Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell stated, &quot;The timing is particularly bad.&quot;<br /><br />As it now stands, Obama has until June 9 to appeal the lower court&#39;s decision to the US Supreme Court. If the high court agrees to hear the case, it could be next year before anything is decided. In the meantime, as long as the appropriate oversight committees in Congress are aware of and have studied the photos, it&#39;s time that we focus on other pressing issues. These include protecting the troops, ending these wars, getting the economy back on track, and holding this president accountable to the rule of law.&quot;<br />

		<title>Spain must resist diplomatic pressure to limit application of universal jurisdiction</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/bios/reed-brody"><strong>Reed Brody</strong></a> [Counsel and Spokesperson, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;Spain has become the latest battleground in the fight over the soul of international justice. On Tuesday, its <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/spain-congress-passes-resolution-aimed.php">lower house of Parliament called</a> for a limit on its universal jurisdiction law over international crimes, irrespective of where they are committed, to cases in which there are Spanish victims or the alleged perpetrator is on Spanish soil. If this is translated into law, victims of international crimes will lose one of the most hospitable fora for redress.<br /> <br />Spain earned its reputation as a haven for victims in 1998 when Judge Baltasar Garz&oacute;n issued an arrest warrant for Chilean General Augusto Pinochet, triggering his arrest in London and setting off a justice cascade in Chile and throughout Latin America. Since then, Spanish courts have advanced investigations of alleged crimes in El Salvador and Guatemala, issued warrants for top Rwandan leaders and convicted an Argentine official for &quot;dirty war&quot; killings. <br /> <br />But three recent cases involving powerful countries &#8212; over alleged crimes in Gaza, Tibet and Guant&aacute;namo &#8212; have put the law in jeopardy. Foreign Minister Miguel &Aacute;ngel Moratinos reportedly told Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni that he would seek to have the law changed, China has publicly protested to Spain, and it is widely believed that the Obama administration has leaned on the Spanish government as well.  While it is unlikely that these cases will lead to extraditions and trials in Spain, they can help justice to emerge. There is a hope among human rights activists, for instance, that, just as Spain&#39;s arrest warrant against Pinochet eventually led Chile to start its own prosecutions against Pinochet, the Guant&aacute;namo cases in Spain will help persuade the Obama administration to establish a true accountability process in the United States.<br /> <br />While one can understand the quandary of the Spanish government, it would be a shame if it capitulated to diplomatic pressure, as Belgium did in 2003 after then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld threatened to move NATO headquarters if Belgium  did not repeal its law after a suit against US officials.  It would confirm a growing sentiment &#8212; fueled by the dismissal of cases in France and Germany against US officials accused of crimes against detainees, and the International Criminal Court&#39;s focus thus far on Africa - that international justice targets only the leaders of weak states while officials of powerful countries have the muscle to prevent accountability.<br /> <br />There is evidence that the Spanish public is proud of their country&#39;s role in promoting justice.  In the Pinochet case, the Spanish public and press stood up time and again to attempts by the then-center-right government to block Judge Garz&oacute;n&#39;s warrants. This time, both the Socialist government and the conservative opposition have highlighted the diplomatic costs to Spain. The next few weeks will tell whether Spanish pride prevails or whether power politics will once again allow impunity to regain a foothold.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/about/staff/index.html"><strong>Noah Greenwald</strong></a> [Biodiversity Program Director, <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/">Center for Biological Diversity</a>]: &quot;On May 8, 2009, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced that he <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/obama-administration-to-keep-bush-era.php">will not rescind</a> a &quot;special rule&quot; created by the Bush administration that sharply limits protections for the polar bear by exempting all activities that occur outside of the polar bear&#39;s range from regulation under section 9 of the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits &quot;take&quot; of endangered species.<br /><br />The rule is designed to exempt regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. It is precisely because of greenhouse gases, however, that the polar bear was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. Polar bears live only in the Arctic and are totally dependent on sea ice for all their essential needs. That ice is rapidly disappearing, reaching an all-time low in 2007, when the Arctic ice cap shrank by a record 1 million square miles below average - an area equivalent to six times the size of California. Several leading scientists now predict that the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in the summer by 2012. In response to loss of sea ice, polar bears are already suffering starvation, drowning, and population declines. Leaving the special rule in place will ensure that the primary threat to the polar bear - global warming and associated climate change - will not be addressed by the Endangered Species Act.<br /><br />Although targeted at greenhouse gas emissions, the broad language of the special rule also exempts other pollutants that harm polar bears, ranging from petroleum hydrocarbons, persistent organic pollutants, and heavy metals that come from outside the current range of the species, but have found their way into the Arctic via air and ocean currents. These pollutants, many of which have been identified in polar bear tissue and are believed to be causing health problems for the bears, present an additional threat to the survival of the species. <br /><br />In retaining the rule, Secretary Salazar parroted many of the arguments made by the Bush administration, namely that it is not possible to make a direct link between one source of greenhouse gas emissions and harm to any particular polar bear and that the Endangered Species Act was not enacted with global climate change in mind. As one of the strongest laws for protecting biodiversity in the world, however, the Endangered Species Act is broadly worded to identify threatened and endangered species and address threats to these species in whatever form they might come. As such, a broad array of threats to species have been addressed under the Endangered Species Act, including threats posed by pollutants that like emission of greenhouse gases have a diffuse impact on endangered species and their habitats.<br /><br />In an April 20, 2009 biological opinion, for example, the <a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> concluded that registration of a broad range of pesticides by the Environmental Protection Agency would result in incidental take of 28 species of listed Pacific salmon and prescribed reasonable and prudent measures to avoid this take. As with greenhouse gas emissions, there is no way to connect production or use of these pesticides with harm to any particular salmon, yet the Fisheries Service found credible scientific support for concluding that the pesticides would harm listed salmon. Given the scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are in fact leading to the loss of summer sea ice and that this is harming polar bears, it is clear that a direct link can be made and that a similar approach as to that used for pesticides and salmon could be applied. With the Arctic melting away, it makes no sense to continue to exempt big polluters from provisions of existing law that could actually help address the problem.&quot;<br />

		<title>DC Circuit affirms anti-tobacco ruling that further impinges on smokers&#039; rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Audrey Silk</strong> [Founder, <a href="http://www.nycclash.com/">New York City Citizens Lobbying Against Smoker Harassment</a>]: &quot;The DC Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/dc-circuit-affirm-rulings-against.php">affirmation</a> of most of District Court Judge Gladys Kessler&#39;s ruling in the case of <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200905/06-5267-1181914.pdf">US v. Philip Morris USA Inc., et. al.</a> [PDF file] upholds ramifications that extend beyond the borders of the defendant&#39;s (Big Tobacco) and plaintiff&#39;s (US government) interests.  NYC Citizens Lobbying Against Smoker Harassment (C.L.A.S.H.) is an organization dedicated to advancing, promoting and protecting the interests of adults who choose to smoke cigarettes.  This judgement directly affects our interests in a tangible, immediate, and profoundly negative way. <br /><br />It&#39;s our basic contention that smokers and their rights have merely been tossed around like poker chips in a series of contentious legal transactions between two third parties: the anti-tobacco crusaders and the tobacco manufacturers. Whatever &quot;crimes&quot; tobacco manufacturers are accused of  (whether rightly or wrongly) were not, in any case, committed by us, yet the legal &quot;remedies&quot; have always included judgments causing us to pay the price in one form or another.  Clearly, this pertains to the case now at hand.<br /><br />As consumers of this product we disagree that &quot;light,&quot; &quot;ultra light,&quot; or &quot;mild&quot; has anything to do with being a &quot;health descriptor&quot; and object to the remedy to deny us information about the product we buy.  Those terms actually describe taste and degrees of harshness.  This would be the equivalent of barring coffee consumers from being able to discern by the packaging whether the blend they are buying is &quot;smooth (mild),&quot; &quot;rich (medium)&quot; or &quot;bold (dark)&quot; (reference Maxwell House Coffee) to suit their preference.<br /><br />The increased social penalty smokers will pay comes in the form of the remedy that requires tobacco manufacturers to issue public statements to correct past messages about their product - in particular regarding the &quot;dangers of secondhand smoke.&quot;  Cigarettes don&#39;t smoke themselves.  People smoke them.  Messages on so-called secondhand smoke vilify smokers more than they do the tobacco companies.  The message is transformed from &quot;smoking kills&quot; to &quot;smokers kill.&quot;  <br /><br />One might be tempted to argue that the denigration of smokers as a means to convey the message not to smoke conveys that message alone.  However, evidence exists that these kind of messages, already promoted by anti-smoker campaigners, provoke hate speech and calls for aggressive behavior toward smokers &#8212; and that their existence sanctions it in fact.  <br /> <br />Of extreme importance in this matter, evidence also exists, contrary to Judge Kessler&#39;s findings, that claims of health risks from exposure to cigarette smoke remain scientifically controversial to this day.  For instance, Judge Kessler has been accused of a miscarriage of justice in this area by Dr. James E. Enstrom whose 39-year-long study on secondhand smoke - published in the British Medical Journal in 2003 - found no relationship between lung cancer and coronary heart disease and exposure to secondhand smoke.   According to <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?pmid=17927827">Dr. Enstrom</a>, &quot;The judge repeated in her opinion a number of misleading and inaccurate statements about my study&quot; made by unobjective witnesses who have engaged in a smear campaign against him and his study since its release.  He protested that &quot;at no time was I ever given an opportunity to challenge or refute the statements made about me and my research&quot; and concludes it was an  &quot;inappropriate inclusion of this legitimate research.&quot;   <br /> <br />Judge Kessler&#39;s affirmed conclusion that danger from secondhand smoke has been proven is erroneous.  There is something so fundamentally wrong and pernicious about compelling speech with which the speaker - in good faith and with existing debate to substantiate it - does not agree, that it baffles the mind that it could survive a First Amendment challenge.  It&#39;s made all the more incredulous when the Appeals Court finds, &quot;Consequently, the [district] court must confine the statements to &#39;purely factual and uncontroversial information&#39;,&quot; regarding the to-be-determined content of the corrective messages.  There is nothing purely factual and controversial free about the court-mandated statement.  And the only danger that&#39;s clear - that this act achieves - is to smokers. <br /> <br />It&#39;s quite a kick in the teeth when one remedy the appellate court did reject pertains to retailers that would have had to display the corrective messages on their counters.  The court found: <blockquote>Section 1964(a) explicitly cautions that in crafting an injunctive remedy the court must &#39;mak[e] due provision for the rights of innocent persons.&#39; <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001964----000-.html">18 USC &Acirc;&sect; 1964(a)</a>.  We believe that the district court exceeded its authority by failing to consider the rights of retailers and crafting an injunction that works a potentially serious detriment to innocent persons not parties to or otherwise heard in the district court proceedings.</blockquote> In a <a href="http://www.nycclash.com/KesslerLetter-DOJ%20Case.doc">letter</a> to Judge Kessler during those proceedings, we argued that our interests were not represented. We contended that members of C.L.A.S.H. (and, in fact, all American consumers of tobacco) would suffer direct, negative and punitive consequences as innocent persons caught between the warring parties.  While our letter was reportedly entered into the record there is no record of the court considering the contents.  We ask, where was OUR &quot;due provision?&quot;<br /> <br />Our only consolation is the rejection of monetary remedies. If those remedies were actually imposed, it is we, not the tobacco companies, who would actually pay...through higher cigarette prices.  The Master Settlement Agreement is a monument to that.&quot;<br />

Davis</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.nfoic.org/">National Freedom of Information Coalition</a>]: &quot;The May 19 federal <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/dc-circuit-rules-white-house-not.php">appellate court decision</a> finding that the White House&#39;s Office of Administration is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act is an act of legal finery in bad need of a legislative fix.<br /><br />Indeed, the court&#39;s decision is but the latest example of how crabbed judicial interpretation of the Act has restricted its ambit even as the digital communications of the era bedevil a law created in the days of manila folders and Smith-Corona typewriters.<br /><br />In upholding a ruling last year by a federal judge, the appeals court found that the White House does not have to make public internal documents examining the potential disappearance of emails during the Bush administration.<br /><br />The plaintiff, the estimable <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a>, or CREW, had filed a lawsuit in 2007 seeking to force the Office of Administration (OA) to comply with a FOIA request for documents related to retention (or lack thereof) of e-mails between 2001 and 2005, a period that included the Iraq war.<br /><br />From its inception in 1977, OA functioned consistently as an agency subject to the FOIA, adopting comprehensive FOIA regulations and processing hundreds of FOIA requests. <br /><br />Then the Bush administration, in the midst of litigating a FOIA request from CREW seeking documentation of the millions of missing White House emails, decided OA no longer is an agency.<br /><br />The administration had been paying attention to broader trends in the jurisprudence of FOIA, which has seen a host of judicial interpretations gradually narrowing the law&#39;s reach, and it shrewdly sensed that the law was now on its side. <br /><br />Not the least of these precedents was a 1980 Supreme Court decision holding that the FOIA does not extend &quot;to the President&#39;s immediate personal staff or units in the Executive Office [of the President] whose sole function is to advise and assist the President.&quot;<br /><br />Leaning on that decision as well as a host of more narrow lower federal court decisions, the three-judge panel was on firm legal footing in ruling that the Office of Administration&#39;s work &quot;is directly related to the operational and administrative support of the work of the President&quot; and his staff.<br /><br />The problem with that logic nowadays is that, thanks to the seamless nature of modern governance and the very sort of electronic communication at the heart of CREW&#39;s lawsuit, such myopic focus on the &quot;independent authority&quot; of subagencies such as OA renders the FOIA a toothless tiger.<br /><br />OA has never been the sort of close presidential adviser Congress intended to exclude from the FOIA&#39;s definition of &quot;agency.&quot; This is a legislative fix that could be relatively easy to make, and one that is long overdue.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.jbharris.com/about-harris.php"><strong>J.B. Harris</strong></a> [Managing Partner, <a href="http://www.jbharrispa.com">The Law Offices of J.B. Harris, P.A.</a>]: &quot;On May 22, 2009, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/dc-circuit-affirm-rulings-against.php">affirmed</a> in large part one of the most damning verdicts ever rendered against the tobacco industry. <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200905/06-5267-1181914.pdf">US v. Philip Morris USA Inc., et. al.</a> [PDF file]. Upholding the liability findings of District Court Judge Gladys Kessler, set forth in her massive 1600 page opinion, the appeals court affirmed that Philip Morris USA, Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Lorillard Tobacco Company, The Liggett Group, Inc., and others had violated certain sections of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_96.html">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act</a> (RICO).  <br /> <br />Relying on live testimony from 84 witnesses, written testimony from 162 and 14,000 documents, Judge Kessler, following a bench trial, had concluded that cigarette manufacturers and their two nefarious trade organizations, the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco Research, had joined together in a decades-long conspiracy to deceive the American public about the health effects and addictiveness of smoking cigarettes. <br /> <br />Specifically, Judge Kessler found the cigarette companies had fraudulently denied that (i) smoking causes cancer and emphysema; (ii) secondhand smoke causes lung cancer and endangers children&#39;s respiratory and auditory systems; (iii) nicotine is an addictive drug and that the tobacco companies manipulated it to sustain addiction; (iv) light and low tar cigarettes are not less harmful than full flavor cigarettes; (v) Defendants intentionally marketed cigarettes to youth; and (vi) that they concealed evidence and destroyed documents to hide the dangers of smoking and to protect themselves in litigation. <br />            <br />Mirroring Judge Kessler&#39;s findings is the equally damning case of <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2006/sc03-1856.pdf">Engle v. Liggett et al.</a> [PDF file].  Originally brought by Stanley and Susan Rosenblatt in Miami-Dade Circuit Court as a national class action in 1994, later reduced to a statewide class in 1996, a jury ultimately returned a record punitive damage award against the tobacco companies in the amount of $145 billion following a year-long trial.  After twelve years of appeals, the Florida Supreme Court overturned the punitive damage award as being excessive, and decertified the class on the grounds that individual damages were too discrete to be part of a class.  This opened the door for class members to file individual claims in Florida. Currently, about 8000 <u>Engle</u> progeny cases are pending across the state.<br /> <br />While the Florida Supreme Court took away the punitive damage award and decertified the class, like the DC Appeals Court, it let stand the <u>Engle</u> jury&#39;s unprecedented findings that the tobacco companies committed fraud, were negligent and concealed from consumers the addictive nature and dangers of smoking in order to sell more cigarettes. <br /><br />The jury also found that cigarettes cause a variety of illnesses, including aortic aneurysm, bladder cancer, cerebrovascular disease, cervical cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; coronary heart disease; esophageal cancer; kidney cancer; laryngeal cancer; lung cancer (specifically, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma); complications of pregnancy; oral cavity &#8212; tongue cancer; pancreatic cancer; stomach cancer; and peripheral vascular disease.  Moreover, these findings are binding as res judicata in all <u>Engle</u> progeny cases, meaning plaintiffs need only prove they were addicted to cigarettes and suffered tobacco related illnesses in order to be eligible for compensation.<br /> <br />Having closed both the federal and state loops on tobacco companies&#39; wrongdoing, the task of tobacco trial lawyers in Florida and elsewhere is to enlighten juries and even judges about the depth of the tobacco industry&#39;s deceit.  As a Florida personal injury attorney representing 157 <u>Engle</u> progeny clients, the Appeal Court&#39;s ruling has just made the challenge of overcoming juror bias against smokers that much easier.<br /> <br />Also known as the &quot;&quot;you screwed up by trusting us&quot; defense, tobacco companies continue to blame smokers for the sickness and death caused by addiction to nicotine.  Many jurors accept this argument by viewing the facts solely through a personal responsibility or choice lens.  In other words, smokers choose to smoke and could choose to quit if they wanted to.  Blindly accepting this argument ignores the extent to which tobacco companies have historically gone to addict minors - before the legal age of reason - especially during the pre-Surgeon General warning era.  In other words, cigarette makers chose subterfuge over safety in the unbridled marketing of their products.  <br /> <br />Targeting children, &quot;Negroes,&quot; Hispanics, Asians, American Indians and poor Whites, tobacco companies gave away free cigarettes to inner-city kids, to folks at church and social events and at dance parties, street fairs and the like. They also sponsored sporting events like Virginia Slims Women&#39;s Tennis, NASCAR racing, baseball games, soccer matches and other sporting events.  They even gave away free cigarettes to soldiers shipping out to war during World War II and beyond.  In short, their advertising campaigns were systematic, methodical, contrived and diabolical. They were calculated to turn children and young adults into lifelong customers and they succeeded.  <br /> <br />What these innocent victims later discovered, however, and what juries are now coming to understand is that nicotine, the addictive agent in every cigarette, is as powerful as cocaine and heroin. Targeting the same receptors in the brain, its potency can also be manipulated.  Indeed, the tobacco companies discovered that spiking cigarettes with ammonia forced smokers to unknowingly freebase nicotine, making it virtually impossible for them to quit once addicted, causing them to crave ever larger and more frequent doses of the drug.  Under this level of duress the element of choice is completely obliterated as the brain&#39;s frontal lobe distress warning system is short-circuited by addiction.<br /> <br />It is against this backdrop that individual smokers in Florida, and hopefully elsewhere, will have their day in court and that justice and compensation will be awarded to those who have suffered the greatest scourge this country has ever seen. So far the results have been promising.  The first <u>Engle</u> progeny verdict resulted in an $8 million verdict, including a $5 million punitive damage component, clearly indicating that jurors, once apprised of the facts, see straight through the tobacco companies&#39; smoke screen.  <br /> <br />For those who are sick and dying, and for those whose families carry on the battle in their absence, the <u>Engle</u> and DC Appeal Courts&#39; rulings stand as monuments to transparency that will provide beacons of hope and truth to all who think the deck is stacked against them, that the system is broken and that they could have stopped smoking had they only chosen to do so.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sigonglaw.com/sub/members/members_06.asp"><strong>Hoon Lee</strong></a> [Senior Foreign Attorney, <a href="http://www.sigonglaw.com/main.asp">Sigong Law P.C.]: </a>&quot;South Korea is now almost at the end of a 7-day national mourning period for its former (16th) president, Roh Moo Hyun, who had abruptly <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/south-korea-ex-president-targeted-by.php">ended his life</a> by jumping off a cliff near his retirement village of Bong-ha, with a state &quot;people&#39;s funeral&quot; set to take place this Friday (May 29th).  <br /><br />People in Korea are obviously overwhelmed by the shock and sadness over his dramatic death, and are also much angered by the way the Supreme Prosecutors&#39; Office had conducted its investigation against Mr. Roh and his family and friends.<br /><br />For a person who had built his reputation as a &quot;clean&quot; politician and who had tried to break collusive ties between politics and big businesses while in office, it must have been unbearably difficult for Mr. Roh to have been the subject of an intense investigation by the prosecutors for bribery charges involving more than 6 million dollars.  <br /><br />Promptly after the death of Mr. Roh, the prosecutors officially ended the investigation as they no longer have jurisdiction over the case due to the death of the subject of the investigation.  With the dropping of the case, however, the prosecutors themselves now have become a target of criticism that Mr. Roh&#39;s death was in fact a political murder committed by the prosecutors, with the current Lee Myung-bak administration orchestrating the politically motivated investigation.  <br /><br />The Korean constitutional system is based upon the presidential system, of which a basic principle is the division of power through checks and balances.  But, in a modified form, the Korean system concentrates all the authority on the president, which has often resulted in corruption and abuse of power by those close to the president, and the succeeding governments have used the corruption of the predecessor to gain support and justify the power shift.<br /><br />Another anomaly in Korea is also a justice system with few checks and balances, and that has resulted in the prosecutors becoming the most omnipotent force in Korea.  And a powerful president who could control the prosecutors through power to make appointments (for prosecutor positions) is able to attack his political opponents through the prosecutors&#39; investigation.<br /><br />The political habit for presidents in South Korea to try to gain support by punishing former presidents originally started in the early 1990s when the first democratically elected governments punished the military rulers like former president Chun Doo Hwan who was blamed for his actions related to a crackdown on democracy protesters. <br /><br />Setting aside the question of Mr. Roh&#39;s culpability, the charges brought against him were minor compared to other former presidents who had collected massive sums from the nation&#39;s top business conglomerates.  But Mr. Roh was still not able to avoid the vicious cycle of the presidential investigation and chose to end his tumultuous life rather than having to continue to endure the humiliations of his &quot;clean&quot; image being tarnished.<br /><br />With his death, however, there is now a serious talk of constitutional revision to curb the president&#39;s power.  While in office, Mr. Roh tried to make the presidency less imperial and also vowed to curtail the powers of the presidency.  If and to the extent that Mr. Roh&#39;s death may finally bring about some of the changes needed to break the vicious cycle of the presidential investigation and retribution, Mr. Roh&#39;s most important legacy may unwittingly come posthumously.&quot;<br />

If such a commission is constituted, the President wants to have newly revised procedures that can assure fairer trials than those that might have occurred under the 2006 Military Commissions Act.  Other detainees would be prosecuted in a federal district court with full procedural safeguards.  This is generally admirable.  Nevertheless, for reasons unknown, it is evident that the President is not receiving adequate legal advice with respect to international law, advice that could be forthcoming even from some of the leftover lawyers from the Bush Administration who still walk the halls in DOJ, DOD, and State.<br /><br /> There is enough guidance in the majority opinion of Justice Stevens in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> for a careful lawyer to realize that common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions "is applicable here, and ... requires that ... [a detainee] be tried by a 'regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees'" recognized under customary international law and that, as Justice Stevens noted, Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, among other instruments, sets forth "basic protections" regarding due process.  Justice Stevens also noted that "regularly constituted" courts include "'ordinary military courts' and 'definitely exclud[e] all special tribunals,'" that regularly constituted means "'established and organized in accordance with the laws and procedures already in force.'"  Justice Kennedy confirmed that common Article 3 applies as "binding law," that a "regularly constituted" court "relies upon ... standards deliberated upon and chosen in advance," and that a violation of common Article 3 is a war crime.  Justice Kennedy added: "[t]he regular military courts in our system are the courts-martial" and they "provide the relevant benchmark."<br /><br /> As I noted in my recent book <em>Beyond the Law</em>, a military commission created <em>post hoc</em> and as a special military tribunal under the Military Commissions Act (MCA) (which was not "already in force" or "chosen in advance") simply could not meet the "regularly constituted" test and would necessarily violate common Article 3.  A violation would be even more clear with respect to creation of a new special tribunal in 2009 designed merely to prosecute a few detainees while others are sent to a federal district court.  As noted in the book, under venerable Supreme Court doctrine, Geneva law takes primacy as law of the United States over subsequent federal legislation such as the MCA.  There is no valid reason to support a claim that President Obama should create a new special tribunal and violate common Article 3, which would be a war crime.  An additional war crime can occur under the 1907 Hague Convention No. IV if one would "declare abolished, suspended, or inadmissible in a court of law the rights ... of the nationals of the hostile party" to an international armed conflict.  There is no valid reason for doing this either.<br /><br /> The book also documented additional violations of international law that would occur with respect to a military commission created under the MCA, some of which were addressed in <em>Hamdan</em> and as far back as December 2001 when I was on a panel with John Yoo addressing the new Bush military commission during a national workshop for federal judges and when some of the improprieties a few of us had warned about were outlined in a lengthy December 26th <em>New York Times</em> article.  One of the problems that the Supreme Court addressed is that a military commission at Guantanamo would not operate in a theater of war or in a war-related occupied territory and, therefore, could not be properly constituted as a law of war military commission.  We are not sure what procedural changes might be contemplated by Obama&#39;s advisers, but the MCA presented significant problems concerning the need for limitation of offenses to those under the laws of war, the right to counsel of one's choice, confrontation of all witnesses against an accused, and the right to review.  <br /><br /> More significantly, any tribunal that would only prosecute aliens would necessarily violate bilateral treaties with the state of nationality of the detainees that require equality of treatment, create a "denial of justice" for aliens under customary international law, and violate human rights law (treaty-based and customary) that requires "equality before the law" and "equal protection of the law" as well as the prohibition of national origin discrimination.  <br /><br /> Why would Obama&#39;s advisers even consider setting up a special <em>post hoc</em> tribunal merely for a few aliens, knowing that other aliens would be prosecuted in a federal district court and knowing that such a tribunal would result in unavoidable violations of customary and treaty-based laws of war and human rights law?  Why place all who would be directly involved in the creation and operation of such a tribunal in harm's way as violators of international law?  Knowing the significant harm to our foreign policy interests connected with the Bush military commissions, why would anyone advise that we should prosecute a few aliens in a special military commission at Guantanamo?  Are the advisers concerned that a special tribunal would only prosecute Muslims at a place that engenders outrage in the Muslim world and symbolizes inhumanity in much of the rest of the international community?<br /><br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/fulltime/damato/damato.html">Anthony D&#39;Amato</a> of Northwestern University School of Law says that North Korea&#39;s apparent disavowal of the 1953 armistice ending the Korean War does not negate the continued existence at international law of the legal boundary between North and South Korea...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/damato3.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ast week the North Koreans issued a statement carried by its official news agency, KCNA, that they "no longer feel bound by the armistice" that ended the fighting in the Korean War of 1950-53. Many media commentators have leaped to the conclusion that the North Korean statement means that the North and South are still at war. <br /><br /> It is technically true that the 38th Parallel that forms the line between the two states was artificially created back in 1950 and, in the absence of any peace treaty, may appear to be something less than an actual boundary between two sovereign states. But international law, I suggest, has a very different take on this issue.<br /><br /> We may begin by considering two other cases where the question is whether a dividing line of some sort is the same as an international boundary. In the Israel-Palestine controversy, Israel has taken the position that the Palestinian failure to establish an "Arab state" when invited to do so by the United Nations in 1947 means that the Palestinians today&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;in the West Bank or Gaza&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;have no claim to inviolable borders. Israel has accordingly encroached on Palestinian territory as demarcated by the United Nations by sponsoring the development of Israeli settlements and elbowing out the Palestinians whose farms unhappily were in the areas occupied by the Jewish settlers. Israel has also erected a Wall that has been condemned as illegal by the International Court of Justice, not because a state cannot place a high barrier on its boundary, but because Israel has placed the wall primarily on the territory the Palestinians were given by the United Nations in 1947<br />   <br /> Now consider the situation between China and Taiwan. Although there is a natural division between the two entities, namely the Strait of Taiwan, both sides claim that there is only one indivisible China. Taiwan claims sovereignty over all China under the name "Republic of China"; mainland China agrees, but claims that it is the sole governing power under the name "People's Republic of China."<br /><br /> Neither the Korean, nor Palestinian, nor Chinese cases have been settled by a treaty of peace between the contesting sides. Historically there have been hundreds of disputed boundaries between states that were not settled by a formal Peace Treaty. But international law has a 4000-year-old principle  that defines a state as having, among other things, a definite territory. This territorial principle throughout history has created a presumption in favor of a definite boundary between entities that claim sovereign power. Once a presumption is in place, it is satisfied by the best available evidence. Often the best evidence has been a natural boundary such as a river or a deep valley. Evidence has also included the oldest maps of the region, on the presumption that they were taken by both sides as depicting the boundary. A boundary could also be presumed from stones placed as mile-markers or by the records of surveyors. <br /><br /> Of the three cases we are presently considering, the presumptive territoriality principle of international law would seem to be the strongest as between North and South Korea. Both North and South Korea regard themselves, and regard each other, as states. Unlike China where both sides regard themselves as a single state, or Palestine where for reasons of its own Palestine never became a state, North Korea and South Korea are distinct territories under international law. Hence there must be an international boundary between them. The 38th Parallel appears on all maps as indicating the precise boundary.<br /><br /> The armistice which North Korea now disavows was, for boundary purposes, nothing more than a piece of evidence establishing the 38th Parallel. That Parallel constituted the original line of aggression between North and South in 1950 and continued through the armistice agreement up to the present time. <br /><br /> The international law principle of territoriality of states cannot be altered by the action of a single state. (If it could, then we would be talking about "exceptionalism" or some other Know-Nothing argument that in effect denies the existence of international law.) It is true that North and South Korea, or any two states sharing a common boundary, can alter the boundary by mutual consent. But North Korea cannot unilaterally alter its boundary with South Korea. <br /><br /> Therefore it is quite curious why North Korea disavows the armistice. Is it saying that it is free to attack South Korea because any such attack would not cross an international boundary and hence should be regarded as an internal conflict? Such a claim would have no effect whatsoever on the boundary nor upon South Korea's right of self-defense that is inherent in all states. At most it would mean that North Korea is estopped to argue that South Korea would be committing illegal aggressive warfare if it ignores the border and attacks the North. <br /><br /> Curious. And irrational. North Korea is either counting on a display of irrationality to intimidate neighboring states, or it simply is unaware of the rules of international law that will be respected and enforced by all states if North Korea attempts to act upon its threats. <br /> <br /><br /><em>Anthony D.Amato is Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University, where he teaches international law and human rights.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/damato.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='120' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

The conference will be held at the David Citadel Hotel on June 18, 2009. I will not attend because it isn't a conference, it's a PowerPoint presentation. Every speaker on the agenda is an advocate of the Israeli position. There isn't an independent scholar of international law, much less a Palestinian, on the list of speakers.<br /><br />If I had attended and had a chance to speak, I would say a few words about the closest precedent to the Israel-Gaza situation: justification. I doubt anyone at the Hotel would dare to bring it up. Justification for war crimes has been a dead letter since World War II.<br /><br />The doctrine of justification in international law applies when one side commits a war crime in order to deter the continued commission of war crimes by the other side. During World War II in German-occupied European countries, if a sniper killed a German soldier on patrol and the German authorities were unable to identify the shooter, fifteen or twenty residents in the vicinity would be selected at random, taken to the town square, and shot. Today that kind of reprisal would be considered a war crime &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 flatly prohibits collective punishment and reprisals against civilians &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; but back in the 1940's it was not illegal. The French, British, and U.S. field manuals had specifically recognized the practice and pointedly refrained from saying that it is illegal. Moreover, there were no allied protests of the German execution of hostages throughout the war. Most tellingly, in the 3000-plus war crimes trials in Europe after the war, German commanders who gave the orders to kill hostages in the 15 or 20-to-1 ratio were not prosecuted.<br /><br />However, in the Hostages Case &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the trial at Nuremberg of William List and others &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the US Military Tribunal held that the killing of 100 hostages for each German killed lacked proportionality. The 100-to-1 ratio only pertained to a few places including the Balkans. By comparison, the ratio of Palestinians killed compared to Israelis in the recent Gaza War was 98-to-1.<br /><br />Let us look at the Gaza War in light of the concept of justification as it applied during World War II. For the past seven years the Hamas political organization in Gaza has been firing rockets into Sderot and neighboring Israeli communities west of the Negev. The rockets have zero accuracy even if directed at military targets &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; which they are not. The rockets are fashioned from common metal pipes filled with explosives and propellants. The fuel is made of fertilizer and sugar. The rockets are built in simple metal shops and garages. The rockets that descend upon Israel bring unspeakable terror but not much destruction. As of March 2008 more than 500 people had been wounded by the attacks; miraculously only twelve had been killed. However, the townspeople have lived in fear of the rockets, and have confined themselves most of the time to shelters. The bombardment of undefended towns and villages is one of the oldest codified war crimes; it was prohibited by the Hague Convention of 1907.<br /><br />Imagine for a moment if U.S. cities and towns near the Canadian and Mexican borders were hit by similar rockets fired by radical terrorist groups in Canada and Mexico. Would the United States tolerate such attacks for seven years? Or even seven days? <br /><br />Israel's pent-up frustration over the rocket attacks erupted in a sudden military invasion of Gaza on December 27, 2008. Insofar as the invasion was a police action to rid Gaza of rockets, rocket launchers, and rocket factories, there was no war crime. But at the same time the Israeli Air Force dropped many hundreds of white phosphorus bombs indiscriminately over the residential areas of Gaza. I found the televised pictures of the bombs lighting up the night sky over Gaza to be eerily beautiful, and I had to check myself to reevaluate what I was seeing: in reality, these incendiary weapons were setting homes on fire and burning the skin of countless terrified people. The victims suffered third-degree burns that doctors reported went inches deeper into the flesh than ordinary fire. A spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces added insult to injury by flatly denying that phosphorus was used. <br /><br />When a sniper killed a German soldier on patrol, it was clear that the marksman had been aided actively by his neighbors who assisted and harbored him. The sniper was also aided passively by other townspeople who did nothing to stop him. The same can be said of the people of Gaza who have enabled the rocket launchings by Hamas. The concept of collective responsibility applies to the civilians in German-occupied towns as it applies to the civilians of Gaza. Neither group is blameless.<br /><br />If the two situations are factually analogous, why did the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 outlaw the defense of justification? The change is due to the demise of the concept "occupied territory." In the usual meaning of that term, a territory is occupied as the result of a war of conquest. But such wars are now illegal: conspiring to start a war of conquest is a "crime against peace" under the Nuremberg decisions. Thus we can conclude that the laws of war do not allow belligerent occupation, and since belligerent occupation is itself illegal it follows that justification, reprisals, and collective responsibility no longer apply. (Yet experts may wonder whether this logic improperly intermingles <em>jus ad bellum</em> with <em>jus in bello</em>.)<br /><br />In 2005 two major things happened in Israel. The Supreme Court of Israel declared that the Gaza Strip was territory seized during warfare, and Israeli settlers and military forces pulled out of Gaza. So an argument can be made that Gaza was not "occupied territory" when Israel attacked in December 2008. But a response to this argument could be that despite disengagement Gaza remains under Israeli military control. Israel maintains total control over the air and sea space of Gaza, it controls movement of persons and goods between the West Bank and Gaza, and controls taxation of Gaza residents. And here I end with a question: are these Israeli controls tantamount to occupation? <br /> <br /> <br /><br /><em>Anthony D.Amato is Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University, where he teaches international law and human rights.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/damato.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='120' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

In pledging to restore the basic American principles of due process, accountability, and checks and balances, the president identified as a top priority the need to reform the state secrets privilege &#8212; a doctrine that allows the executive branch to withhold information requested during litigation if disclosure threatens national security. I served in the executive branch as a top law enforcement official and a former federal prosecutor. While an aggressive approach to national security matters is critical for our nation, it is just as essential that there be oversight and checks on the power of the executive branch in national security when the use of such power impacts every day citizens.<br /><br />While the president's commitment to reforming the state secrets privilege is encouraging, his proposed remedy &#8212; limiting the occasions on which the executive branch asserts the privilege &#8212; falls short. The real solution lies in ensuring that federal judges independently review invocations of the privilege. Congress has begun taking steps towards implementing such reform. Bills are now pending in both houses, and on June 4th, I will testify before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties, in support of congressional action to reform the state secrets privilege.<br /><br />There are two fundamental problems with the state secrets privilege. First, when courts simply defer to assertions of secrecy by the executive branch without independently reviewing the evidence claimed to be secret, there is a significant risk that the government may seek to hide evidence of its misconduct under the guise of protecting national security. This exact situation occurred in <em>United States v. Reynolds</em>, the Supreme Court case that first recognized the evidentiary state secrets privilege. Later declassification of the accident report at issue in <em>Reynolds</em> revealed no state secrets, only evidence of negligence.<br /><br />Second, the government has used the privilege as a means to foreclose an entire category of litigation, namely lawsuits alleging government misconduct in national security policies, such as wiretapping, detention, and interrogation programs. The result is an unreasonable limitation on access to the courts. Cases involving legitimate constitutional questions on national security programs and illegal surveillance have been dismissed at the outset, without plaintiffs having any opportunity for a day in court to test their allegations.  <br /><br />As the state secrets privilege has evolved into a new type of immunity doctrine, it has compromised our values and created an air of suspicion. The proposed State Secrets Protection Act would enact two important reforms to address these problems. First, the legislation would restore judicial oversight by requiring the executive branch to submit the evidence asserted to be privileged to the judge for an independent review. Second, it would prohibit judges from dismissing cases on the basis of the state secrets privilege at the outset without the opportunity for a review of the evidence.  <br /><br />These reforms would ensure that the courthouse doors remain open, while ensuring sensitive national security information is kept secret. They would also restore accountability and dispel any notion that the government is invoking the privilege as a cover up.  <br /><br />The proposed reforms would also keep us safe. It is important to recognize the difference between judicial review and public disclosure. Federal judges regularly conduct private reviews of evidence, and Congress is capable of devising safeguards to ensure that judicial oversight does not result in public disclosure. Moreover, federal judges are experienced in reviewing sensitive national security information under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Freedom of Information Act, and the Classified Information Procedures Act.  <br /><br />For these reasons, I have joined with the Constitution Project's bipartisan coalition of policy experts, legal scholars and former government officials in support of the proposed reforms.  <br /> <br />The urgency of protecting our national security is clear. But the shadow cast by 9/11 should not forever obscure what is fundamentally American, namely due process, accountability, transparency, and checks and balances. Where Congress can achieve several goals at the expense of none, it should. Judicial review will keep us safe, ensure trust in our executive branch and provide an appropriate check on the executive power bestowed by the state secrets privilege. To achieve these gains, Congress should enact this important legislative reform.<br /><br /><br /><em>Asa Hutchinson is a former Republican member of Congress from Arkansas, U.S. Attorney, director of the Drug Enforcement Agency, and under secretary for Border and Transportation Security at the Department of Homeland Security.

During the first two days of June alone,  fierce fighting in Mogadishu resulted in 25 deaths and 70 injuries.  Most of those affected were civilians.<br /><br />Somalia's various clans and warlords have been fighting against each other and against external actors since the collapse of the Siyad Bare government in 1991.  The causes are plenty.  Clan mistrust, power discrepancies, and religious differences within Islam are among the most common catalysts.  The armed violence has regional and international dimensions, too.  This is why the United Nations (between 1992 and 1994) and the African Union (since 2007) deployed peacekeepers and enforcers to help secure Somalia.  According to UN reports, Ethiopia and Eritrea (consisting of Egypt, Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Syria) have also taken part in the hostilities.  Disturbingly, foreign fighters are also rumoured to have taken part in the conflict.<br /><br />As a result of the conflict, tens of thousands of Somalis have been killed, maimed, or forced to flee their homes.  According to <a href="http://www.refugeesinternational.org/where-we-work/africa/somalia">Refugee International</a>, 3.2 million Somalis (40 percent of the population) are dependent on external assistance.  Approximately 1.3 million have been internally displaced and over 400,000 Somalis have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.  UN official Mark Bowden said recently that "roughly 45 percent of the (Somali) population is suffering from moderate malnutrition."<br /><br />The situation is also exacerbating the troubled relationship between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Both have been accused of fighting a proxy war in Somalia.  The endemic problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia has posed a grave threat to maritime security, the international movement of goods, and even to humanitarian assistance.  All of these persistent and severe security concerns, caused largely by the incessant lawlessness in Somalia, raise the question whether or not the world community has adequately and responsibly responded to the crisis.<br /><br />The UN unsuccessfully attempted to intervene in the early 1990s.  Dozens of peacekeepers (most of whom were American) had been killed in an insurgency led by former army general Farah Aidid.  Although diplomatic efforts have continued, these casualties coupled with other policy goals have caused the major Western powers largely to ignore forceful multilateral intervention efforts intended to secure Somalia, with the exception of the Combined Task Force 150's (CTF-150) recent anti-piracy operations.<br /><br />At its founding, the TFG of Somalia was frail and was limited to Baidoa, a city in south-central Somalia where the Somali Parliament was based.  In 2006, the government came under concerted attack by the Union of Islamic Courts (USC), led by current president Sheikh Ahmad whose main goal was to establish an Islamic state of Somalia.  The USC successfully gained control of most of southern and central Somalia and maintained law and order in a number of cities and towns for a few months.  There was indeed calm and order for some time there, the sustainability of which was questionable owing to the fragile situation on the ground.  The USC decided to oust the TFG by military force instead of working with it to build a more stable Somalia.  Some also blamed the Abdullahi Yusuf led TFG for failing to seize the opportunity for peace and reconciliation.  <br /><br />During that critical time in 2006, the TFG sought help from Ethiopia while the USC was (and still is) backed by Eritrea.  The latter has been persistent in denying such allegations, but the UN, the AU, and the US have reiterated their concern over Eritrea's military and logistical support to the USC (now to Al-shabaab and Hizbul Islam). <br /><br />Ethiopia justified its initial presence in Somalia with reference to notions of invitation by the internationally endorsed government, and justified its later full-scale military action by asserting self-defence against the jihad declared against it.  Some, including the London based think-tank Chatham House, criticized the intervention as legally unjustifiable and unhelpful to efforts toward stability in Somalia.  While some countries, including Qatar, called upon Ethiopia to immediately withdraw from Somalia, the UN, the AU, and many western and African governments appeared to support Ethiopia's actions.  In fact, the international community, including the TFG, encouraged Ethiopian forces to stay in Somalia until they could be replaced by AU peacekeepers.  African countries were not swift enough to deploy peacekeepers.  To date, the African Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) has only 4,300 peacekeepers despite the fact that it is authorized by <a href="http://se1.isn.ch/serviceengine/FileContent?serviceID=47&amp;fileid=2FD48E46-CECF-5E93-994D-B57FC596814D&amp;lng=en">United Nations Security Counsel (UNSC) Resolution 1744</a> of 2007 to have up to 8,000 personnel.  Resolution 1744 is a Chapter VII measure which authorized AMISOM to operate in Somalia. <br /><br />While Ethiopia initially said it would withdraw from Somalia within a few weeks of diffusing the threat posed against it, it stayed there and fought the al-Shabaab until January 2009, claiming that it would have been irresponsible to leave the country in a big mess, and that remaining in Somalia was necessary to prevent the revival of the Islamists. The move to prolong the intervention was largely seen as unjustified and unnecessary by Somali and external commentators.  Ethiopia was dragged into fierce, unconventional and urban clashes in Mogadishu (and elsewhere) with the Islamists.  Human Rights Watch, which seems to be in war of words with Ethiopian authorities, alleged that all the parties to the Somali conflict, including Ethiopian forces, committed war crimes.  Ethiopia strongly denies these allegations.  Ethiopia's presence was also widely viewed as the key barrier to peace and reconciliation between the radical and moderate Islamists of Somalia.<br /><br />The aftermath of Ethiopia's 2009 withdrawal tells a different tale &#8212; that of the beginning of a renewed cycle of armed violence between Somali factions.  Since the summer of 2008, a painstaking effort has been made to form an all-inclusive TFG, including the Asmara based Islamist Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS).  The moderate wing of the ARS, led by the current president Sheikh Ahmad, joined the process.  The Asmara wing of the ARS led by Sheik Aways (who's featured on UN and US terrorist lists), al-Shabaab, and the recently formed Hizbul Islam fighters refused to take part in the post-Ethiopian intervention unity government.  The ARS and al-Shabaab intend to install Sharia law in Somalia.  Yet Sheikh Ahmad's introduction of Sharila law in April 2009 in Somalia, as the BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8062883.stm">put it</a>, "has not appeased the hardline guerrillas". <br /><br />The presence of AU peacekeepers in Somalia is one of the key disagreements between the two camps.  The TFG views AMISOM as a partner in instilling peace and securi
ty in Somalia.  Conversely, the opposition, views the peacekeepers as occupiers (or, in the words of Aways, as "bacteria") that must leave the country.  The opposition has thus declared war on the peacekeepers and has targeted and killed them in recent attacks. <br /><br />But is it really feasible to stabilize Somalia without a regional/international force?  Is the declaration of war against peacekeepers compatible with international laws and norms, particularly with regard to UNSC Resolution 1744 of 2007?  The answers to both questions are, without a doubt, in the negative.  It might be said, however, that the Somalis must deal with their own problems if they wish not to have external support.   <br /><br />Aways returned to Mogadishu in April 2009, soon after the Ethiopian withdrawal.  He denounced Mr. Ahmad's government, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8020548.stm">saying</a> it was "not elected by the Somali people, ant it is not representing the interests (of) the Somali people."  But the TFG views itself as a legitimate government both nationally and internationally.  While it may be difficult to assess the TFG's popularity among the Somali people, the UN, the AU, the EU, and others have unreservedly endorsed it as a lawful, albeit  transitional, government.  In support of the TFG, Western donors have recently pledged to raise billions of US dollars for the reconstruction of Somalia. <br /><br />Regardless, Aways and al-Shabaab refused to enter into dialogue with their former colleague, the incumbent president of the TFG.  In early May of this year, al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam, (with the open support of Aways) intensified their attacks against government forces and AU peacekeepers in Mogadishu and other key towns.  They took control over such strategically vital cities as Jowhar and Biodea.  Government forces and the peacekeepers have responded to the attacks.  On May 22, government forces initiated a large-scale counter-offensive in Mogadishu.  AMISOM is not involved in such operations, as its mandate in respect of using force is limited to self defence.  The Islamists seemed to gain impetus, but their efforts to topple the TGF have not been without problems.  Antagonism from within recently caused an opposition to defect to the TGF, for example.<br /><br />Civilian suffering has continued to mount.  In the last few weeks of fighting alone, more than 200 people (around 80 percent of whom were civilians) have been killed and more than 500 were wounded.  At least 60,000 people have been displaced.  For this and similar reasons, it is no exaggeration that Somalia is indeed at the crossroads between peace and reconciliation on one side, and total chaos and further bloodshed on the other.  Swift action (or restraint, if appropriate), is therefore crucial for all concerned.<br /><br />On May 20, IGAD <a href="http://www.igad.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=265">deemed</a> the situation in Somalia a "very grave" security concern, condemned Eritrea for arming and backing "the criminal elements in and/or to Somalia.", and called upon the UNSC to take measures including the imposition of a no-fly zone and a blockade on seaports in order to "prevent the further in-flow of arms and foreign fighters" into the country.  It also called upon the Council to impose sanctions against Asmara.  On May 22, the AU endorsed the decision of IGAD and reiterated the call upon UNSC to impose sanctions against Eritrea.  Eritrea denied the allegations and attributed the information to the work of CIA agents in the region.<br /><br />Except with regard to the imposition of sanctions, the UN seems to agree with the regional bodies' assessment of the situation.  UN Under Secretary General for Political Affairs B. Lynn Pascoe utterly <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/sc9658.doc.htm">condemned</a> "the attempted coup on May 9 by Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys and Al Shabaab fighters" and indicated the possibility of deploying peacekeepers by the USNC to support AMISOM and the TFG.  However, the UNSC only "<a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/sc9661.doc.htm">expresses</a> its concern over reports that Eritrea has supplied arms to those opposing (the government of) Somalia in breach of the UN arms embargo" and "at the loss of life and the worsening humanitarian situation arising out of the renewed fighting."  Western governments, including the White House, reiterated the UNSC's position and concerns.  The UK Minister for Africa, Lord Malloch-Brown, <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/newsroom/latest-news/?view=PressS&amp;id=17804654">condemned</a> "the attempted coup d'etat by forces opposed to the Transitional Federal Government" and the "assault on the internationally recognized government that has worked hard for peace and reconciliation in Somalia."<br /><br />These are, however, words and not deeds.  The UN and AU do not seem ready to do anything concrete yet.  Deploying UN peacekeepers has not yet been put on the negotiating table, probably due to the hostile attitudes of the parties to the conflict, as indicated in the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's report to the UNSC, released last April.<br /><br />Reports that Ethiopia moved its troops into Somalia were openly denied by both the Somali and Ethiopian governments.  Indeed, such convoluted problem needs multilateral, versatile and well-thought-out response.<br /><br />Moving forward, the parties to this conflict must make a responsible move toward peace and harmony.  They must cease destructively relying on foreign actors, including both states and non-state-actors.  They have to bear in mind the immunity of civilians and AU personnel, and the legitimacy of the UN and the AU.  They have to work toward bolstering security institutions in Somalia which will be capable of maintaining law and order in the country.<br /><br />The world community has to choose the right and responsible options to help out Somalia and to ensure regional and international security there. <br /><br />The first of these options would involve the swift deployment of a multilateral peace enforcement force in Somalia which could replace or strengthen AMISOM.  Securing cities, ports, and airports, and protecting the civilian population, must be among the peace enforcement force's main tasks.  Islamic, African and other interested countries may be of help in providing troops as a matter of urgency.  Western countries must also be part of the action in both financial and personnel terms.  A change in the attitude and policy of Washington and other leading world powers is now more necessary than ever.<br /><br />The second option would be to strongly support the TFG and AMISOM, and to punish the spoilers of, and the interventionists in, the transitional process. <br /><br />The last (and probably the least) option would involve doing nothing but watching as further atrocities and instability sweep the region, such as: the endemic problem of piracy, extremism, and the escalation of internal and perhaps interstate armed violence.<br /><br />The first option appears to be the most appropriate response owing to the persistency, severity, and the possibly future consequences of the situation.  It may not necessarily be the most realistic option, however, unless world powers and the UN make a drastic change in policy.  The second option may work if tangible and immediate measures are taken to brace AMISOM.  This option seems to be more attractive and less demanding for world powers, but other issues such as the controversy over North Korea's recent nuclear test and the situations in Pakistan and Sri Lanka may divert attention to the detriment of Somalia and the region as a whole.  The first two options cannot be successful without engaging all the parties to the conflict as long as they behave responsibly and humanely.  The last option is not morally or legally defensible.  It may be thought that whoever wins will stabilise Somalia, but this is a risky strategy for maintaining international security.  Even if AMISOM is out as per the demands of Aways and company, it is likely that the havoc w
ill continue.  Therefore, the world community must act now!<br /><br /><br /><em>Dr. Zeray Yihdego is a lecturer in international law at Oxford Brookes University School of Social Sciences and Law</em><br />

		<title>Resettling Guantanamo Detainees: Reluctance and Responsibility</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.anu.edu.au/scripts/StaffDetails.asp?StaffID=393">Don Rothwell</a> of Australian National University College of Law says that until the United States is prepared to acknowledge that it has a continuing responsibility for some of the Guantanamo detainees once they have been released and shows a willingness to resettle at least some in the US, the future for many will remain deadlocked.... <br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/donrothwellnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he future of 17 Chinese nationals of Uighur ethnic origin at Guantanamo Bay and the increasing efforts of the US to persuade various countries around the world to agree to accept them for resettlement starkly highlights some of the intractable legal issues US policy towards Guantanamo Bay detainees has created. The Guantanamo Uighurs, ethnically Turkic Muslims who populate the northwest of China, have been detained since early 2002. They had left China for Afghanistan in 2001 fleeing persecution from Chinese officials, only to have their village bombed in mid-October 2001 by allied forces during Operation Enduring Freedom, after which they travelled to Pakistan where they were arrested by local security forces and turned over to the US military. There has never been any credible evidence that the Uighurs actively supported either the Taliban or Al Quaeda, and while the US maintains that in 2001 they attended a militant training camp in Afghanistan, the evidence for this claim appears flimsy. It is therefore not surprising that once the US Combatant Status Review Tribunal began reviewing the basis for ongoing detention of Guantanamo detainees, that the Uighurs were among the first who were cleared for release. However, unlike many of the detainees that were allowed to leave Guantanamo from 2004 onwards the Chinese nationality of the Uighurs has been a significant issue.<br /><br /> The Uighurs have been engaged in ongoing conflict with Chinese authorities over the status of their region and have faced religious persecution and efforts to integrate them into the wider Chinese population. Following demonstrations in February 1997 Amnesty International reported examples of serious human rights abuses against the Uighur peoples &#8212; including arbitrary detention, unfair trials, torture, and executions. The Chinese government has used the term 'separatism' to refer to the activities of the Uighurs, and has actively sought the return of some Uighurs who live outside of China on suspicion of committing terrorist acts. Further reports that some Uighurs were tortured and executed after their return to China post 9/11 caused the United States to become wary of repatriating the Guantanamo Uighurs back to China and to this day it has refused to accede to any Chinese requests of this kind. This has placed the US in a particular quandary as effectively the Guantanamo Uighurs have been recognised as refugees entitled to asylum protection because they face 'a well-founded fear of persecution' as provided for under the Refugees Convention.<br /><br /> This dilemma for the Obama Administration has become all the more urgent in light of the commitment given to shut Guantanamo down by January 2010. Notwithstanding multiple efforts to secure the transfer of the Uighurs to safe third countries, Albania's 2006 decision to take five of the detainees has been the only offer to date. Whilst Canada rejected a US request in early June, Australia and Germany are still considering their positions. On June 9, Palau, a small north Pacific island country which has a Compact of Free Association with the US, announced that it had agreed to resettle some of the Guantanamo Uighurs. Ultimately some form of deal may be concluded with Palau agreeing to resettle up to ten of the Uighurs, and Australia and Germany taking the remainder. <br /><br /> One of the issues which third countries need to consider when assessing these requests is how China may respond. In early June, the Chinese Embassy in Canberra indicated in a statement that they considered the "Chinese terrorist suspects" held at Guantanamo Bay to be "members of the terrorist group East Turkestan Islamic Movement" and they "should be handed over to China for proper handling according to law". That the US agreed to a Chinese request to cosponsor the inclusion of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement on the State Department list of terrorist organizations in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, has only succeeded in further clouding the status of the Guantanamo Uighurs, though there does not appear to have ever been any direct allegation that the detainees were responsible for any terrorist incident in China prior to 2001. As Palau does not maintain diplomatic relations with China, it may be somewhat immunised from any Chinese backlash if it accedes to the current US request. A possible $US 200 million aid package for Palau is no doubt another factor. <br /><br /> Part of the resistance which the US has met with its resettlement overtures has been due to its apparent reluctance to accept that it too has some level of responsibility towards the Uighurs. Notwithstanding successful District Court rulings that the Uighurs should be released, both the Bush and now the Obama Administration have blocked legal efforts by the Uighurs to be released in the US. Plans were well advanced in May to relocate some of the Uighurs to Virginia, but after a Congressional backlash, those plans were scuttled.<br /> <br /> The Uighurs are of course not the only Guantanamo detainees whose resettlement after release is at issue. There are approximately 50 current detainees who are eligible for release under plans developed by the Obama Administration and US allies have been approached to assist in their resettlement. Notwithstanding a 4 June EU information-sharing agreement about Guantanamo detainees, the EU position remains that resettlement assistance will only be provided following formal a EU-US agreement providing levels of assurance as to the human rights of the former detainees, and also financial commitments towards their ongoing needs. Such an agreement will only be possible if the US is prepared to make certain concessions, of which the most important is an acceptance that it has a continuing responsibility for some of the Guantanamo detainees once they have been released and that it shows commitment to those responsibilities including resettling some within the US. It increasingly appears therefore that until the US is prepared to acknowledge that 'Charity begins at home' then the future for many Guantanamo detainees cleared for release will remain deadlocked. <br /><br /><br /><em>Donald R.

		<title>Extinction or Evolution? Ending Absolute Universal Jurisdiction in International Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="mailto:dwrist@pitt.edu">Wes Rist</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that recent passage by Spain&#39;s lower house of parliament of a non-binding resolution aimed at limiting the scope of the country&#39;s universal jurisdiction may not be a step backwards in international criminal law, but rather may signal the beginning of the end of an effort that served its purpose and is now properly dying out from lack of need.....<br /><hr size="1"><br /><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forumy/wesrist.jpg" align="left" vspace="2" hspace="0" /></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" width="5" height="1" /></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" width="1" height="1" /></td></tr></tbody></table> <span style="font-size:100%;"><strong>W</strong></span>hen the International Criminal Court (ICC) emerged in 2002 as an actual organization in the international community, many felt it represented one of the best chances for an end to impunity for human rights abusers around the world. Largely due to the seemingly tireless work of Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo, most still see the ICC as a steadily growing check on the unchallenged abuse of international humanitarian and human rights law by military or political leaders and even non-state actors. The coming into being of the ICC has not, however, uprooted other evolutionary offshoots in international criminal law that saw a resurgence during the long preceding period when the idea of a permanent international criminal court was scoffed at by the global community as a pipe dream held only by starry-eyed international lawyers.<br /><br />One of these offshoots, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a>, is actually a centuries-old legal principle that was modified and adapted to the modern international setting. Originally designed to address <span style="font-style: italic;">hostis humani generis</span>, the "enemies of all humanity" found in pirates in the 1700s and arguably later expanded to include other non-state actors such as slave traders and hijackers, the modern theory has developed two distinct branches: conditional and absolute jurisdiction. Conditional jurisdiction holds that the accused must be present in the state for the prosecution to move forward, while absolute jurisdiction gives the state the right to pursue any individual, regardless of their location, for criminal violations that fall within the authorizing legislation. <br /><br />Several countries experimented with absolute universal jurisdiction legislation in their domestic systems, and in the 1990s a series of cases began to move through domestic courts that attempted to initiate criminal proceedings against individuals who failed to meet any of the three traditional justifications for prosecution by a state: territoriality, active nationality, and passive nationality. Perhaps the most famous of these cases was the October 1998 detention of former Chilean dictator <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a> by British officials upon the submission of an extradition warrant from Spain. The "Pinochet experience" ended in a draw, as the then-UK Home Secretary preempted an apparent judicial willingness to extradite Pinochet by finding that the former dictator, then aged 83, was medically incapable of withstanding trial and granted him leave to return to Chile.<br /><br /> But the evolution of modern universal jurisdiction legislation didn't end there. Cases continued to develop in domestic legal systems and even before the International Court of Justice, which considered the doctrine in the 2003 case of <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;k=36&amp;case=121&amp;code=cobe&amp;p3=4%22">Democratic Republic of Congo v. Belgium</a>. Belgium's universal jurisdiction statute was modified after the Bush administration brought significant pressure to bear on the Belgian government after a case against U.S. General Thomas Franks for alleged war crimes in Iraq looked to be moving forward. The Belgian law was eventually replaced entirely by a much more limited law on extraterritorial jurisdiction. German prosecutors have traditionally been extremely conservative in applying the <em>V&Atilde;&para;lkerstrafgesetzbuch</em> law which gives German courts authority over the public international law crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. This conservatism is clearly illustrated by the fact that German prosecutors have opened very few investigations and have not initiated a single prosecution. Canada passed the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act in order to meet domestic requirements imposed by its ratification of the ICC's Rome Statute, and academics have argued that this gives the country an absolute universal jurisdiction statute to apply. The Canadian Department of Justice, however, has <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/wc-cg/rlf-rcl.html">clearly indicated</a> that any use of the law in Canada would fall under the conditional universal jurisdiction theory, requiring the accused to actually be present in Canada. Article 689-11 of the French Criminal Procedure Code allows for the prosecution of individuals indicted for crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, or serious breaches of the Geneva Conventions. It too, however, recognizes only conditional universal jurisdiction, requiring that the accused be "usually resident" in France. Standing alone as one of the last enforcers of absolute universal jurisdiction, the Spanish judiciary has maintained its authority via Article 23(4) of the Organic Law of the Judicial Branch to initiate prosecutions against any individual alleged to have violated public international law instruments to which Spain has subscribed.<br /><br /> A new <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/spain-congress-passes-resolution-aimed.php">non-binding resolution from the Congress of Deputies</a>, Spain's legislative lower house, is now pushing for a restriction on Article 23(4) that would require a clear connection to Spain and an absence of a current investigation in the domestic country in question. The restrictions, which seem to have support in the legislative branch of Spain's government, would reduce Spain's procedural rule allowing for open-ended investigations of violations of public international law to a more traditional conditional universal jurisdiction provision. As the opposition Popular Party presented the resolution and Spain's governing Socialist Party has previously indicated their favor in limiting Spanish courts' active use of the universal jurisdiction principle, it seems likely that the law will eventually come into effect.<br /><br /> Human rights groups have strongly protested the move, alleging that any restriction on the Spanish judiciary's ability to pursue these cases will result in an increase in impunity for human rights abusers. As a strong proponent of international criminal justice, I share their concern, but as a legal scholar, I think there is validity in asking whether this is actually a step backwards in international criminal law, or simply the ending of an evolutionary offshoot that served its purpose and is now dying out from lack of need. Despite claims to the contrary, changing the Spanish law would not end the use of universal jurisdiction. By Amnesty International's own count, over 125 nations have some type of conditional universal jurisdiction over human rights abuses. Advocates&#39; greatest worry appears to be that the Spanish court is the one that makes the news regularly and puts the issue in the public spotlight, often forcing governments to take some type of political action, if only to avoid having Spain issue an arrest warrant for the individual in question.<br /><br /> While publicity about impunity for international human rights abuses is important, international criminal law is evolving in its own right along a more unified path with the growth of the ICC. There are arguments in
favor of seeing a reduction in absolute domestic universal jurisdiction statutes as we move along that path. While Spain's prosecutions do generate media attention on human rights issues and can prompt government action, it logically follows that a push for all nations to adopt absolute universal jurisdiction legislation would result in a much more confused situation where multiple states, at the discretion of judges or prosecutors, could pursue criminal proceedings against alleged human rights abuses. <br /><br />On the surface, this doesn't seem like a bad idea, but one of the strongest and perhaps longest lasting objections to the ICC is the fear that prosecutions would become motivated by political goals rather than an actual desire for justice. That potential for political abuse of international criminal law is exponentially increased in a world where dozens of nations can exercise absolute universal jurisdiction at their own discretion. The ICC has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to resist such political calls, both from the UN and from outside actors, and it is more reasonable to expect governments around the world to develop an institutional trust in the ICC than it is for them to accept the prosecution of their own citizens, let alone their former leaders, by other domestic systems.<br /><br />In addition, there is a strong argument that the international community needs to work together to address the not-insignificant challenges facing international criminal law and the ICC. Encouraging the proliferation of absolute universal jurisdiction legislation would have the effect of splintering efforts in holding international wrongdoers accountable for their actions, rather than uniting the international community behind a common system, a common organization, and a common goal. <br /><br />The challenges facing advocates seeking an end to all impunity for human rights abusers require nations to act together. Spain by itself will never be the reason that individuals fear to perpetrate human rights abuses. Neither will a dozen or even a hundred nations with similar statutes, each acting alone. Only when the entire international community makes it clear that, regardless of a perpetrator&#39;s position or office, genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes are unacceptable, and agrees to enforce that stance through the ICC, will the possibility of impunity dwindle. And perhaps for that to happen, absolute universal jurisdiction rules must go the way of the dodo and make room for new evolutionary developments in international criminal law.<br /><br /><br /><em>Wes Rist is an Adjunct Professor and Assistant Director of the Center for International Legal Education at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Jonathan Tracy of the <a href="http://www.nimj.org/home.aspx">National Institute of Military Justice</a> at American University Washington College of Law says President Obama&#39;s decision to reconstitute the US military commissions system runs contrary to basic American legal values and revitalizes the military tribunals structure absent any military need....<br /><hr size="1"><br /><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forumy/jonathantracy.jpg" align="left" vspace="2" hspace="0" /></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" width="5" height="1" /></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" width="1" height="1" /></td></tr></tbody></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><span style="font-size:100%;"><strong><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->F<odiogo-notts-begin></odiogo-notts-begin></strong></span><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->our months later and we still cannot escape President Bush&#39;s disastrous detention policies.  On May 15, President Obama reversed his policy to continue Bush&#39;s flawed and failed military commissions.  Despite promising to expand due process rights, the commissions will remain inherently flawed and contrary to our nation&#39;s legal principles and values.  Commissions serve as a way to shroud prosecutions in secrecy and keep certain constitutional rights in check.  The changes proposed so far do little to ensure alleged terrorists are granted fair trial rights this country has long viewed as essential.  Constitutional rights that terrorists like Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind behind the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, enjoyed are discarded in commissions.  More significantly, however, reconstituting commissions means continuing the use of military tribunals absent military need.<br /><br />Only a military necessity justifies the use of military means.  For example, to lawfully resort to force a State must have no other options.<br /><br />Similarly, during battle, a military may not exert any individual use of force not &quot;imperatively demanded&quot; by the situation.  Here, the government intends to exert military means through a military system of justice.  Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), courts-martial, the keystone of military justice, are needed to dispense justice for our service members to maintain good order and discipline in our fighting force.  The UCMJ also authorizes war criminals to be tried by military commission.  A war criminal is someone accused of violating the law of war on a battlefield.  In that situation, a military necessity exists - our military must deliver swift and fair justice in a theater of war for crimes committed during war.  Our law and values long respected the notion that military justice is a narrow exception to civilian justice.<br /><br />I do not question the evil intent or actions of the masterminds of the<br />9/11 attack.  These are barbaric acts that are all rightly criminalized and subject to harsh punishment under U.S. criminal law.  Unfortunately, after 9/11 the Bush administration immediately and retroactively characterized the situation as a &quot;war&quot; where the criminals would be subject to military justice.  There is no legal precedent justifying terrorist&#39;s trial by military commission.  Before 9/11, the last time the U.S. used commissions was during and immediately after WWII.  Those convicted after WWII were accused of significant and heinous violations of the law of war.  In contrast, al-Qaeda operatives are accused mostly of crimes not considered war crimes before the Military Commissions Act.<br /><br />Terrorism is only a war crime when committed in an active theater of armed conflict.  Rhetoric aside, 9/11 did not amount to an armed conflict under international law.  Armed conflict requires &quot;protracted armed violence&quot; between two or more states or &quot;protracted armed violence&quot; within one state against &quot;organized armed groups.&quot;  War should not be a condition the government can invoke at its whim.  The government may not distort the definition of armed conflict beyond significance.  Many of the detainees facing a military commission, like 9/11 mastermind, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, were captured far from a battlefield accused of crimes not associated with a war.  Mr. Mohammed should face harsh justice, but no one in the current or previous administration has ever demonstrated that he could not be prosecuted in a civilian court.  Until the President can demonstrate that a civilian court cannot handle these cases, we should not discard them for military tribunals.  The brutal and heinous nature of the crime does not justify the use of military means.<br /><br />Justice is about more than simply levying penalties on wrongdoers.  The system of justice used by a given society is a reflection of its values.<br /><br />The policies and rules the United States is implementing in the military commissions do not reflect our true values.  It is time to end this poor attempt at a justice system and try the detainees in well-respected and established courts of law.<br /><br /><br /><em>Jonathan Tracy is the assistant director of the National Institute of Military Justice at American University Washington College of Law in Washington, D.C., and a former Army Judge Advocate.</em><br />

		<title>IRAQ: Should Anti-Smoking Laws be a Priority?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sara Burhan Abdullah, Pitt Law LL.M. &#39;08 and JD &#39;12, writes about an experience in her home country of Iraq...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a href="/dateline/uploaded_images/Baghdad-photos-summer-2009-019-709435.JPG"><img style="margin: 4pt 4pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Baghdad-photos-summer-2009-019-708909.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:100%;"><strong>T</strong></span>his summer, I returned to Iraq to intern with the Global Justice Project: Iraq, which is run by the University of Utah. The purpose of the project is to provide the Iraqi Council of Representatives (the legislative branch in Iraq) with legal advice and other legal assistance.   While working in the northern Kurdish region, I saw many signs stating &quot;NO SMOKING&quot; in three languages (Kurdish, Arabic, and English). However, I was disappointed by the fact that no one paid any attention to any of the signs.    <br /><br />Later, I found out that a <a href="http://www.gjpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/anti-smoking-070708092940.pdf">2007 law</a> [text, PDF] passed by the Kurdish regional parliament prohibits smoking in public places such as restaurants, airports, hospitals, governmental offices, and schools and universities. Under this anti-smoking law a simple violation is punishable by a fine of about $10. At first, I thought that the government would enforce the new law and punish violators accordingly. However, when I went to the regional bar association to renew my bar membership, I saw the &quot;No Smoking&quot; sign again and said to myself that people with legal backgrounds will respect the law and the law will probably be enforced here at the bar association. Surprisingly, however, the employee who took care of my paperwork smoked as he reviewed the necessary documents. I could not keep quiet at this clear affront to the law and asked him, &quot;Have you seen the sign above your head on the wall?&quot; The employee very respectfully answered me and said that this rule applies to visitors and clients, not to employees. Although he said this jokingly, he also meant what he said given his conduct.<br /><br />A few days later, I was reading the daily newspaper <em>al-Sharq al-Awsat</em> in my office in Baghdad&#39;s Green Zone. I noticed an article about efforts by the Iraqi parliament to enact a law &#8212; just like the one in Kurdistan &#8212; that would ban smoking in public areas and punish those who violate the law. The article included interviews with local people giving their opinions about the proposed law and its effect on them. Some of the interviewees laughed at the proposal, commenting that there are so many other things to fix and pay attention to in order to keep Iraqis healthy. One interviewee said that Iraqis need access to better health care, and medical equipment and necessities, not a ban on smoking, which no one will pay any attention to anyways.<br /><br /><a href="/dateline/uploaded_images/Baghdad-photos-summer-2009-014-774012.JPG"><img style="margin: 4pt 10px 10px 4pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Baghdad-photos-summer-2009-014-773457.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>At first, I was disappointed at how the law was being ignored, but reading the paper and seeing the conditions in Baghdad made me think again.  One can see why it might be a good step for the Iraqi government to pass an anti-smoking law and think about the safety of the public, specifically those who do not smoke.  Yet as the interviewees made clear, there are other more pressing concerns.   Iraqis lack many basic necessities that the government should address &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; most importantly electricity, water and good health care.  Moreover, the government can do much more to clean the streets of Baghdad and the Tigris River, which runs through the middle of the city.  In a short walk alongside the Tigris, I was disappointed to see part of the river covered with empty bottles. An anti-littering campaign would do much to improve Iraqis&#39; quality of life.<br /><br />Perhaps Iraqis are more in need of effective systems of governance addressing their basic needs than they are of an anti-smoking law that will be totally ignored, upsetting the public even more. The Iraqi people, given the challenges of mere survival that they face every day, have not arrived at the stage where caring for someone else&#39;s right regarding smoke exposure can be important to them. The Iraqi government might want to think about the Iraqi community in a more realistic way, rather than pretend that the community lives in such good conditions that a law banning smoking in public areas is the most pressing concern.<br />

		<title>British Court of Appeal ruling on prenuptial agreements should lead Parliament to change the law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.irwinmitchell.com/OurPeople/ElizabethHicks.htm"><strong>Elizabeth Hicks</strong></a> [Partner and Head of Family Law London, <a href="http://www.irwinmitchell.com/default.htm">Irwin Mitchell LLP,</a> a member of <a href="http://www.divorceaid.co.uk/">Divorce Aid</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/uk-court-recognizes-pre-nuptial.php">decision</a> of the Court of Appeal shows that the Courts are now more likely to agree that a pre-marital contract should be upheld &#8212; even when one party has not obtained legal advice and where there has not been full and frank disclosure of their assets. This is a real turnaround in the Court&#39;s positioning. Until now, the guidance and advice given by all lawyers was that to make a pre-marital  agreement as water tight as possible, the couple should tell the other about the extent of their wealth and they should each get independent legal advice.<br /> <br />In the case of <u>Granatino</u>, the wife did not disclose her assets and the husband did not seek advice. There is considerable commentary within the Judgement about the fact that there should be &quot;due respect for adult autonomy.&quot; Where there are two consenting adults who wish to regulate their financial affairs, why shouldn&#39;t they be allowed to agree on what should happen in the event of a divorce? <br /> <br />This decision makes it plain that there needs to be a change in the law which only Parliament can do. The Courts have given a clear message that prenuptial agreements should be binding &#8212; unless there is duress or fraud. <br /> <br />What is particularly interesting about this case is that it seems that there is no longer a need to disclose details of assets &#8212; although it is anticipated that this will still be the advice that is given to couples about to marry. There needs to be a change in the law and the courts have gone as far as they can to ensure that two adults can now regulate their financial affairs.&quot;<br />

Currently, roadblocks are also used for vehicle safety inspections, seatbelt use, driver&#39;s license possession, mandated insurance coverage requirements, and, perhaps most commonly, DUI checkpoints. <br /> <br />Roadblocks are meant to intimidate and restrict the movement of people, goods, and ideas.  No free society should tolerate any precedent that rationalizes the use of roadblocks.  The NMA does not condone the arbitrary stopping, interrogating, intimidation or searching of motorists when those motorists are simply using the highway to commute.<br /> <br />We applaud the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit for <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/federal-appeals-court-rules.php">ruling</a> that the neighborhood motorist checkpoint program was unconstitutional.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=5704"><strong>Allen St. Pierre</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.norml.org">National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws</a> (NORML)]: &quot;Despite the glamorization on the hit Showtime series &quot;Weeds,&quot; flashy documentaries on CNBC delving into the business side of California&#39;s multi-billion dollar annual cannabis industry derived from Californians&#39; unprecedented 13-year old legal access to medical cannabis products - qualifying patients in the state (and there are hundreds of thousands of them currently) can access high-quality medical cannabis via 24/7 vending machines in cities like Los Angeles - is Rhode Island the little state that is saying &quot;yes we cannabis&quot; the loudest <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rhode-island-legislators-approve.php">via their legislature</a>?<br /><br /><strong>&quot;Californication&quot; Of Cannabis</strong><br /><br />While California is clearly at the vanguard of implementing major legal and policy changes in seeming conflict with the federal government&#39;s 72-year old cannabis prohibition laws, in fact little ol&#39; Rhode Island is on the precipice of effectively breaking the federal government&#39;s ban on the cultivation and sale of cannabis by joining New Mexico as the only states favoring medical cannabis laws to have state-sanctioned medical cannabis cultivators and retail outlets for qualifying medical patients.<br /><br />While there are an estimated 1,800-2,000 medical cannabis dispensaries (or in the new parlance, cannabis wellness centers) in California alone, few of them are genuinely legally sanctioned under state laws to sell cannabis in a retail environment. However, this blooming of cannabis wellness centers in California has happened under the full view of law enforcement, state policy makers and the public health community. Californians have &quot;Main Street&quot; access to cannabis in many parts of the Golden State, which has evolved entirely organically - in other words, the mores and values of most Californians largely accept cannabis use, whether for recreational or medicinal purposes.<br /><br />A recent Field poll of California voters affirms this with 56% support for outright legalization.<br /><br />In Rhode Island, there is no highly refined &quot;cannabis culture,&quot; or longstanding public cannabis law reform efforts to speak of - unlike Californians that have publicly debated &quot;legalizing&quot; cannabis on numerous statewide ballot initiatives and legislative proposals going back to the early 1970s - yet, Rhode Island&#39;s legislators, from both parties and chambers, in opposition to the Governor and numerous federal government anti-drug bureaucracies (i.e., DEA, ONDCP, NIDA, DOJ, FBI, etc.) first passed a &quot;self-preservation&quot; medical cannabis law two years ago [a &quot;self-preservation&quot; medical cannabis model is defined as allowing a qualified patient, for which a severely limited number of medical ailments qualify for cannabis use (i.e., Cancer, AIDS, Glaucoma, Epilepsy and MS), to legally possess or grow a small amount of cannabis; there is no legal retail access to cannabis, seeds or plant cuttings (clones)]. <br /><br /><strong>The Little State That Says To Washington: &quot;Yes We Cannabis!&quot;</strong><br /><br />However, Rhode Island legislators, only two years after passage of the original medical cannabis laws, recognized that a self-preservation model is inadequate to serve the needs of sick, dying or sense-threatened patients who need whole-smoked cannabis and edibles. Again, in full opposition to the Governor and federal agencies, the legislature overrode a second veto to establish Rhode Island as the first bona fide state to legally sanction and license third parties to cultivate and sell cannabis (in the case of Rhode Island, the recent medical cannabis legislation has provided initial approval to three medical cannabis wellness centers for the entire state).<br /><br />While New Mexico may have officially been the first state to pass legislation in 2007that allows for the state-sanctioned distribution of medical cannabis to qualified patients, the medical cannabis program has been very slow to get off the ground, and to date has issued a single permit, and no medical cannabis is expected to be lawfully sold in New Mexico for at least another 6 months to a year. Rhode Island, at its current breakneck speed of passing pro-medical cannabis law reforms, will very likely be the first state out of the gate to effectively end the federal government&#39;s complete prohibition against cannabis distribution by cultivating and harvesting a crop of medical cannabis by early fall. <br /><br /><strong>The Major Legal and Policy Implications Sparked By Rhode Island</strong><br /><br />If the past serves any indication, under the prior four presidential administrations (Reagan, Bush, Clinton and Bush), their Departments of Justice most certainly would have raced to federal court and sought to have any state law that allowed medical cannabis to be cultivated and distributed to be found in clear violation of the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa.html">1970 Controlled Substances Act</a>, <a href="http://www.fcda.org/pdf/singleconvention.pdf">The Single Convention Treaty of 1961 </a>(the international treaty that effectively made cannabis illegal throughout the world)[PDF file] and stare decisis.<br /><br />Even numerous full-throated law reformers would concede the strong position the federal government had attained after eight decades of zealous enforcement of anti-cannabis laws.<br /><br />However, Rhode Island&#39;s challenge to the federal government&#39;s cannabis prohibition becomes increasingly interesting to political observers and policy wonks in light of President Obama&#39;s decidedly different take on the latitude he is comfortable providing states to craft their own medical cannabis laws.<br /><br />To wit, 1) Attorney General Holder indicated in February that the DEA is no longer going to target and harass state compliant medical cannabis providers in states that adopt medical cannabis laws, and 2) In May, the executive branch issued a memorandum, interestingly entitled, &quot;Pre-emption&quot; to all federal agency heads, in effect instructing them to no longer oppose states (or their voters) seeking greater autonomy to pass laws that may possibly be in conflict with federal laws (i.e., medical cannabis laws, etc.), and to only oppose them if there is a positive conflict with federal laws resulting in genuine risks to national security.<br /><br />While it is hard to swing a dead cat in the Los Angeles-area these days without hitting the cued up patrons of medical cannabis wellness centers, Rhode Island looks to be the very first state to officially end cannabis prohibition, and the feds appear ready to stand down.<br /><br />Now, if you&#39;re a cannabis consumer or lover of liberty, this is &quot;change&quot; one can believe in!&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/experts/index.cfm?fa=expert_view&expert_id=403&more=1"><strong>Christopher Boucek</strong></a> [Associate, Middle East Program, <a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org">Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</a>] &quot;On Friday June 12 it was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/three-guantanamo-detainees-repatriated.php">announced</a> that three more Saudi detainees held at Guantanamo Bay had been repatriated back to the kingdom.  With their arrival, 120 Saudi nationals have now been sent back to Saudi Arabia.  (The bodies of three Saudi detainees who died at Guantanamo have also been returned for burial).  According to a statement from the Justice Department, the former detainees will undergo a judicial review in Saudi Arabia and then enter into a rehabilitation program.  <br /><br />In Saudi Arabia, returnees from Guantanamo Bay participate in a mandatory government-run rehabilitation program designed to facilitate their reunification with their families and reintegration back into society.  The program seeks to counter-radicalize extremists and extremist sympathizers by engaging them in intensive religious debates and psychological counseling, supplemented with extensive social support, and the involvement of family members and loved ones.  Upon completion of the program, a detainee is released into the custody of his family who is then told that they are responsible for his continued good behavior as they await an eventual as-yet-undefined judicial process.    <br /><br />This extremist and militant rehabilitation and disengagement program is very much a unique Saudi solution to a unique Saudi problem.  It incorporates many traditional Saudi methods of conflict resolution and conflict management, including cooptation, conciliation, persuasion, and coercion.  Several factors are central to its success, including the focus on extended social networks, the importance of treating families and not just individuals, and the use of time-honored methods of social control including notions of family honor and extended social hierarchies.  The program was initially developed in secret and is now the best known example of an extremist rehabilitation program.  <br /><br />It is unclear to what judicial review process the Justice Department referred in its announcement.  When the first Saudi nationals were repatriated from Guantanamo back to Saudi Arabia beginning in May 2003, they went through a different process than those who returned later. Early returnees were brought before a Saudi court and charged with several offenses. Most if not all were convicted and served up to two years before entering rehabilitation. However, individuals who were repatriated at the end did not go before a court. These individuals were not charged with any crimes, and entered directly into rehabilitation for a truncated period of, in some cases, only several months.  Saudi officials admit privately that there is little appetite in society to try men who have served years in extrajudicial detention.  The Saudi government does have plans to try approximately 990 people charged with participating in a series of terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia since 2003, although many questions remain unanswered about this <a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/arb/?fa=show&article=21947">process</a>.<br /><br />Of the now 120 Saudi Guantanamo detainees that have been sent home, 23 have either been rearrested or are wanted by authorities.  A total of 12 have been arrested within Saudi Arabia: three for associating with extremist suspects; three for attempting to travel to Pakistan and Yemen; and six have been rearrested based on assessments that they were preparing to reoffend.  A total of 11 detainees fled to Yemen and rejoined al-Qaeda.  Two Saudis - Said al-Shihri (ISN 372) and Mohammed al-Awfi (ISN 333) - appeared in a January 2009 video and announced the merger of the Saudi and Yemeni affiliates into the newly formed al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).  (Mohammed al-Awfi has since returned to Saudi Arabia, and is in custody.)  An additional citizen from a Gulf Arab country that had returned from detention in Guantanamo Bay was also arrested on security charges within Saudi Arabia and returned to the security services in his home country. <br /><br />Saudi officials claim the rehabilitation program has a roughly 20% failure rate.  Thus far, those figures appear to match with the acknowledged re-arrest rates.  It is also likely that additional detainees will be arrested in the future.  Thus far Saudi Arabia has developed the most comprehensive reintegration program for Guantanamo detainees.  It is the best funded and longest continually run program, and has become a de facto model for other countries seeking to implement a counter-radicalization program. To be sure, such programs will not always work, and there will always by hardcore extremists that are beyond rehabilitation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.roachwise.com/ioannidis.html"><strong>Dimitrios Ioannidis</strong></a> [President, <a href="http://www.hellenicbarassociation.com/">Hellenic Bar Association</a> and counsel to the <a href="http://www.greekembassy.org/Embassy/content/en/Root.aspx?office=5">Consulate General of Greece in Boston</a>]: &quot;On December 6, 2008, a member of the elite Greek police forces shot and killed 15 year old Alexis Grigoropoulos in the Exarchia section of Athens. Eyewitnesses to the incident described a group of young adults throwing stones at the police officers involved in the shooting until one of the officers allegedly pointed his gun and shot Alexis.  The officers testified in preliminary proceedings that the officer fired his gun up in the air but the bullet ricocheted and struck Alexis, a scenario that is allegedly supported by the ballistic report that concluded that the bullet struck a foreign object before it reached Alexis.    <br /><br />The killing of the youngster sparked public outrage that escalated to unprecedented riots in the center of Athens ravishing the business district and the surrounding public buildings and infrastructure. While the incident appears to be one of the worse moments for the Greek Police forces, the widespread looting and destruction bestowed a sense of paralysis of the central government given its inability to restore law and order for several days. <br /><br />On June 12, 2009, the Council of Magistrate Judges in Athens <a href=" http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/06/greek-judges-order-officers-to-stand.php">charged</a> the police officer who shot Alexis with premeditated murder, and also charged his partner as an accomplice to murder, sending the case to the Criminal Court of Felonies for the scheduling of the trial. The decision extends the order of temporary custody of the two officers until the time of trial, effectively foreclosing the possibility of bail under any circumstances. Even if the prosecution is ultimately able to sustain its burden in proving that the officers committed murder, the public outcry following the December 6, 2008 killing of Alexis will play a role as to whether or not the officers will have a fair trial.  The two officers must face that reality as the verdict has already been rendered by the court of public opinion regardless of how liberal the Greek judiciary is in protecting individual rights. For a case that nearly toppled the Greek government and brought the entire system of the central authority into chaos, a not guilty verdict may prompt even more civic unrest with far reaching political consequences. <br /><br />What complicates matters even more is the fact that the case will likely be tried twice. Under the Greek legal system the first trial takes place at the Court of First Instance and if either party appeals, a second trial is held at the appellate level but on a de novo basis; that is, the Court of Appeals of Greece will hear all the evidence again and determine the facts of the case in rendering its verdict without consideration of the lower court disposition. This will force the family of the victim, the accused and everyone involved in the case to go through the rigors of a trial twice when such deep emotions can easily translate into rioting given the sensitivity of the general public in Greece to this case. Many also fear that key witnesses will not testify at the first trial given the de novo nature of the trial at the appellate level and they suggest that this factor hinders the orderly administration of justice.  <br /><br />While there have been similar cases in the US when excessive force by the police led to riots and looting, the US system is based on jury trials and the notion that a change of venue may be appropriate in cases where the impartiality of the jury may come into question. That will not be the case for the two officers as they go through the trial, as Greece does not have an all jury trial system and a change of venue in not practical given the publicity of the case throughout Greece. One can only hope that the impartiality of the Greek judges will safeguard the officers&#39; right to a fair trial and allow the trial process to proceed free from political interference and public sentiment; which demands justice for the death of the 15 year old boy. While all of us are deeply troubled by incidents of police brutality and the death of innocent people, this case will challenge the impartiality of the Greek legal system in adjudicating cases with great social consequences; yet, neither the need for justice nor the overwhelming public pressure must overshadow the right to a fair trial for the two officers.&quot;<br />

		<title>In Burma politics rather than law will decide the trial of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ratchasima.net/"><strong>Awzar Thi</strong></a> [Member, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>, Hong Kong]: &quot;At a meeting of lawyers in Hong Kong this April, Aitzaz Ahsan described how as counsel for the Chief Justice of Pakistan in the petition against his unconstitutional removal from office during 2007, neither the president nor any other senior official had even read the charges brought against the judge, which they had signed. Had they done so, they would have noticed that the charge sheet was full of blank paragraphs with the word &quot;deleted&quot; alongside. And anybody looking more closely should also have found that the petitioner had not even presided over an appeal in which he was accused of having struck a deal with one of the parties; yet a number of the judges trying him had. <br /> <br />Although the charges against the Chief Justice of Pakistan were framed in legal terms, neither their factual accuracy nor formal correctness was supposed to have mattered. Politics and military power, not laws and civilian authority, were meant to have determined the judge&#39;s fate. Yet to his credit, as well as to that of his advocate, the Supreme Court bench and the legal community of Pakistan, the court <a href="/hotline/2007/07/pakistan-supreme-court-showing-way.php">reinstated the judge</a> despite the wishes of a dictator.<br /> <br />The <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/myanmar-court-begins-trial-of-jailed.php">case now running</a> against Burma&#39;s democracy icon, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, is of the same type. <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/un-rights-experts-criticize-suu-kyi.php">United Nations experts</a> and the <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/ua/mainfile.php/2009/3178/">Asian Human Rights Commission</a> have pointed out that the charges against her and three other persons are baseless. Suu Kyi is accused of violating the terms of her house arrest by admitting an uninvited guest into the property, after the American citizen allegedly swam across an adjacent lake. But this is not an offence either under the order imposed on her personally or under the sweeping law through which it was issued. On top of this, the case is being tried in a court without jurisdiction, outside of the locality where the alleged offence occurred, with judges from two different districts. The holding of the trial inside the central prison too, like hundreds of others since 2007, is patently illegal. <br /> <br />This neglect of substantive and procedural law is a characteristic not only of the Suu Kyi trial but also of tens of thousands of others in Burma over recent decades, most of which have attracted little if any outside interest. That even in a case of global renown the government&#39;s functionaries have failed to comply with the minimum standards of their own domestic codes indicates that the only rules which really matter in their country now are those laid down in executive decrees. <br /> <br />The trial of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is, like that of the Chief Justice of Pakistan before it, being driven by political, not legal, imperatives. As the contents of the charges and formalities of procedure matter not to the final outcome, compliance with the law also matters not. But whereas Pakistan&#39;s judiciary has in recent times fiercely demonstrated that the rule of law still carries meaning under its watch, no such thing can be expected in the case of Suu Kyi. For half a century, Burma&#39;s courts have served as mere instruments of policy, not law, and it would be foolish for anyone to be too preoccupied with the legal features of a criminal case in which legal features in the end will count for naught.&quot;<br />

		<title>Rhode Island law on safe access to medical marijuana marks national trend in state regulation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jesse Stout</strong> [Board of Directors member, <a href="http://ripatients.org/">Rhode Island Patient Advocacy Coalition</a>]: &quot;When the Rhode Island Medical Marijuana Act became law in January 2006, seriously ill patients started calling the Rhode Island Patient Advocacy Coalition (RIPAC) to ask, &quot;Where do I get my medicine?&quot; There was no good answer: they could grow it themselves, unless they were too sick; they could appoint a caregiver, unless they couldn&#39;t find anyone reliable. This forced some of our most vulnerable citizens to try to buy their medicine on the black market, where some were robbed or even beaten.  <br /><br />To address this supply problem in the Medical Marijuana Program, in June 2009 the Rhode Island General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rhode-island-legislators-approve.php">passed</a> an amendment allowing non-profit compassion centers. Under the new law, non-profit organizations can apply to the Department of Health for a compassion center license. This will authorize them to grow and distribute medical marijuana for an unlimited number of patients. The Department will license a first compassion center in 2010, and two more in 2011, for a statewide total of three.  <br /><br />Supply is a problem in most of the 13 states with medical marijuana laws; New Mexico is the only other state that explicitly licensed medical marijuana distributors. However, given the federal government&#39;s inaction on this issue, state regulation of medical marijuana distribution is poised to become a national trend. As of this writing, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and North Carolina are all considering new medical marijuana legislation that would regulate distribution, and the New Hampshire bill even calls for &quot;compassion centers&quot; by name. More and more states will recognize pharmacy-like establishments to provide medical marijuana to patients until the federal government steps in to address the issue of safe access.&quot;<br />

		<title>Support for crack cocaine sentencing reform signals more rational approach to public safety</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sentencingproject.org/About.aspx?BiosID=12"><strong>Marc Mauer</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.sentencingproject.org/">The Sentencing Project</a>]: &quot;Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/ag-holder-urges-cocaine-sentencing.php">Eric Holder&#39;s call</a> this week for Congress to finally eliminate the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine &quot;this year&quot; was the most high-profile indication of the Administration&#39;s support for fundamental change in this shameful 23-year-old policy, and an indication that a change in these policies may finally be possible.  Despite wide critiques of the mandatory penalties for crack offenses from federal judges, civil rights organizations, and many others, efforts to reform the sentencing policies originally enacted in 1986 have previously met with resistance from both the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.<br /><br />The renewed prospects for reform build on several developments.  First is support from the top.  In the previous Congress, then-Senator Biden was the lead sponsor of legislation to equalize the penalties between crack and powder cocaine, and then-Senator Obama was a co-sponsor of the bill.  Support for reform has also become increasingly bipartisan in recent years.  Key Republican Senators Jeff Sessions (AL) and Orrin Hatch (UT) have each introduced reform bills, and have expressed concern both for the racial disparities produced by the sentencing policies and the excessive disparity between penalties for the two forms of cocaine.  There remain important differences among quantity triggers in the legislative proposals being discussed, but nonetheless they demonstrate growing support for change.  Finally, the crack cocaine guideline amendments put into effect by the US Sentencing Commission in 2007, and made retroactive for people currently in prison, have been met with broad support and limited partisan backlash.<br /><br />Despite this growing momentum, several hurdles for reform still exist.  First, there is not yet consensus regarding what form the legislation should take.  The Department of Justice and the Obama administration are on record as supporting &quot;complete elimination&quot; of the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine (currently a 100:1 drug quantity ratio), but have not yet committed to achieving that by increasing the quantity of crack required to trigger a mandatory penalty, rather than reducing the powder quantity (which would result in more persons convicted of low-level offenses being sentenced to federal prison).  There is no informed opinion which suggests that the powder quantities are insufficient to achieve the goals of sentencing and the US Sentencing Commission has warned Congress away from addressing the disparity by lowering the powder thresholds. One hopes that the DOJ will recognize this in its recommendations.  Second, partisan wrangling continues regarding the goal of a 1:1 quantity ratio between the two drugs, so there may be political jockeying regarding what type of bill may pass.  And finally, advocates for reform are also confronted with a packed legislative agenda this year, so the need to push hard to maintain a focus on crack cocaine reform remains.<br /><br />Advocates for rational sentencing have been heartened by the newfound support for reform in the DOJ and among political leadership.  And in many ways, the evolving climate on crack cocaine opens up broader questions regarding federal sentencing policy, and the excessively harsh mandatory penalties that have been adopted in recent decades.  One can hope that if crack reform is successful it may lead to a broader discussion about the need for sentencing reform and a more rational approach to public safety.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/about/keystaff/billpiper/">Bill Piper</a> and <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/about/keystaff/ethannadelma/">Ethan Nadelmann</a> [Director of National Affairs and Executive Director, <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org">Drug Policy Alliance</a>]: &quot;US Attorney General Eric Holder&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/ag-holder-urges-cocaine-sentencing.php">recent call</a> for eliminating the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity and reforming mandatory minimum sentencing is a welcome development that reflects the growing momentum for sentencing reform on this issue.<br /><br />This momentum began last year when then-Senator Joe Biden, running in the Democratic presidential primaries in early 2008, introduced a bill to eliminate the disparity in how crack and powder cocaine offenses are punished under federal law.  Sentiment had been building in Congress to reform the law, and Senators Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy had co-sponsored a bill to reduce the disparity from 100:1 to 20:1, but Biden&#39;s bill leapfrogged them and proposed to reduce the penalties for crack cocaine to the same as those for powder cocaine.<br /> <br />It didn&#39;t take long for the bill to collect a handful of impressive co-sponsors, including Senators Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Richard Durbin (the assistant majority leader in the Senate).  Few other senators signed on, sensing that the bill was unlikely to move during the last year of the Bush administration &#8212; but what stood out was the fact that three presidential candidates, including the two leading the pack, were willing to endorse the most far reaching reform of the crack/powder laws.  That would have been inconceivable just four years earlier.<br /> <br />Last year&#39;s sponsors are now the President, Vice President and Secretary of State, and Sen. Durbin is not just the assistant majority leader but also the Judiciary Committee member who is leading the effort to usher the reform through the Senate.  The day after the inauguration in January, the White House website was changed to make clear that the new administration would make good on the commitment of candidate Obama to eliminate the crack/powder disparity.  Attorney General Eric Holder and his senior staff have reiterated that commitment numerous times since, both publicly and privately, with the attorney general emphasizing that he views this as a personal commitment as well. <br /> <br />The issue really boils down to three points.  The first is the absence of any scientific or other legitimate basis for distinguishing how crack and powder cocaine are treated under federal law.  They are, after all, the same drug &#8212; and it takes little talent or expertise to transform powder cocaine into crack cocaine, or to smoke the former to achieve the effect of the latter.  That is why the US Sentencing Commission recommended, a decade ago, eliminating the disparity; that turned out to be the only one of the commission&#39;s recommendations to be rejected by the Clinton administration.   The second point is the extraordinary injustice and cruelty of locking up people for five, ten, and more years for possession and sale of remarkably small amounts of drugs.  This injustice and cruelty became more and more evident as the drug war hysteria of the 1980s faded and the federal prison population boomed.<br /> <br />The third point is the racial disparities in sentencing and incarceration that flowed from this law, with the crack penalties falling almost entirely on African Americans.  This glaring injustice proved pivotal in galvanizing African American communities and leaders, including many elected officials who had voted for the initial law.<br /> <br />Both the White House and the Democratic leadership in both the Senate and the House have made clear three things:  (1) that they want to eliminate the crack/powder disparity by reducing the penalty for crack &#8212; and not, as some Republicans have recommended, increasing the penalty for powder cocaine; (2) that they want a major reform of these laws signed by President Obama this year; and (3) that they want to pass reform with significant bipartisan support, which could mean settling for less than 1:1 or possibly a modest increase in powder penalties (although advocates oppose both).<br /> <br />Drug policy reformers hoped for this sort of momentum in 2009 but we are pleasantly surprised by the rapid progress in Congress. This progress reflects both widespread recognition of the drug war&#39;s excesses and a growing conviction that after decades of failure US drug policy needs to move in a new direction - one that, in President Obama&#39;s words, &quot;focus[es] more on a public-health approach.&quot; At its heart, crack/powder reform is a racial justice issue, but more broadly it&#39;s a human rights issue.<br /> <br />The United States ranks first in the world in per capita incarceration rates, with less than 5 percent of the world&#39;s population but almost 25 percent of the world&#39;s prisoners. The incarcerated population has grown from 500,000 in 1980 to 2.3 million today, of which roughly a third involves drug law violations or drug-related violations of probation or parole. We incarcerate more of our fellow citizens for drug law violations than all of Western Europe (with a much larger population) incarcerates for all offenses combined.<br /> <br />As Sen. Jim Webb, D-VA, has said, &quot;either we have the most evil people in the world or we are doing something wrong with the way we handle our criminal justice system, and I choose the latter. The central role of drug policy in filling our nation&#39;s prisons makes clear that our approach to curbing illegal drug use is broken.&quot; Policymakers, legal minds, and voters need to look critically at the social and economic consequences of criminalizing drug use and punishing people for nothing more than what they put into their bodies.<br />

		<title>Supreme Court&#039;s Epinosa decision will not impact vast majority of student loan debtors</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.forgivestudentloandebt.com/content/about"><strong>Robert Applebaum</strong></a> [Founder &amp; Executive Director of <a href="http://www.forgivestudentloandebt.com/">ForgiveStudentLoanDebt.com</a>]: &quot;The US Supreme Court has recently granted certiorari to <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-takes-student-loan.php">United Student Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa</a>, agreeing to consider whether student loans may be discharged in bankruptcy under the limited circumstances wherein the creditor fails to object to a discharge plan which includes student debt.<br /><br />Before anyone gets too excited about this, no matter which way the Court rules, it is unlikely to result in the restoration of consumer protections to those carrying student loan debt.<br /><br />The question before the Court is rather fact-specific, i.e., whether the Bankruptcy Court erred in granting a final disposition to Espinosa&#39;s Chapter 13 restructuring plan that included the student loans at issue.  The Court is not being asked to consider the constitutionality of the statutes that preclude student loan debt from being included in Bankruptcy proceedings in the first place.  <br /><br />First off, it is important to understand that there are different types of bankruptcy.  This case does not involve Chapter 7, the type of bankruptcy where a debtor essentially gives up and nearly all assets are liquidated to pay off the creditors to whatever extent possible.  Nor is this a Chapter 11 case, which usually involves a corporation&#39;s restructuring of debt.  Rather, the case that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear involves a Chapter 13 proceeding which is generally the section of the Bankruptcy code that applies to individuals seeking a restructuring of debt so that they may eventually get their head above water.<br /><br />Generally speaking, student loans are exempt from discharge or restructuring under the Bankruptcy code unless the debtor can demonstrate &quot;undue hardship&quot; - a fairly high standard to meet which essentially requires that the debtor have no chance of ever obtaining an income again to pay off his debts.  If there&#39;s any chance at all of the debtor being in a position to pay his student loan debts again, he&#39;ll have a hard time meeting the &quot;undue hardship&quot; standard.<br /><br />That said, where a debtor does seek to discharge his student loans because of undue hardship, the rules require the filing of a summons and complaint, giving any creditors the advantage of an adversarial structure in which to litigate the claims.  Absent any such attempt by the debtor, no such adversarial structure is instituted and, instead, a restructuring plan is crafted and notice is given to all creditors so that they may either accept the terms of the plan, or make an objection to it in a timely fashion.<br /><br />In <u>Espinosa</u>, United Student Aid Funds, Inc. was given notice of the restructuring plan that included Espinosa&#39;s student loans in the amount of $13,250; an amount that differed from United Student Aid Fund&#39;s claim in the amount of $17,832.15.  Not only did United Student Aid fail to object to the restructuring plan when it was initially given notice of it, it failed to object when the Court specifically informed United that the amount they claimed Espinosa owed was less than the amount United Claimed.  Thus, since there was no objection, the restructuring plan was approved.<br /><br />Three years later, United Student Aid began intercepting Espinosa&#39;s income tax refunds to satisfy the unpaid portion of the student loan.  Espinosa, in turn, petitioned the Bankruptcy court for a contempt order, claiming that United had violated the terms of the agreed upon restructuring plan. <br /><br />The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Espinosa, reasoning that United had ample time in which to object and that, after 3 years, any objection it might have had to the student loans being included in the restructuring plan in the first place was untimely.<br /><br />Other Circuit Courts of Appeals have ruled differently, holding that the creditors&#39; statutory and Constitutional Due Process rights were violated by including student loan debt in a restructuring plan without a demonstration of undue hardship. The 9th Circuit rejected the attenuated reasoning behind those decisions and, instead, adhered to its own precedents which renders the statutory and Constitutional claims moot.<br /><br />If I had to predict which way the Supreme Court will eventually rule, it seems to me that the 9th Circuit&#39;s reasoning is more sound and, as such, its finding for Espinosa will be affirmed.  <br /><br />In the simplest terms, United had not one, but two opportunities in which to object to Espinosa&#39;s student loan debt&#39;s inclusion in the restructuring plan.  It could have objected to it when it first received notice of the restructuring plan and claimed it was entitled to service of a summons and complaint and, subsequently, an undue hardship hearing, or; it could have objected when it was specifically given notice that the amount owed to United as claimed in the restructuring plan differed from United&#39;s claimed amount.  <br /><br />There are any number of reasons why United may have made a strategic decision not to object at either point in the process.  Perhaps United made a decision that it was more likely to recover some money under this restructuring plan and it didn&#39;t want to gamble that Espinosa would be able to demonstrate undue hardship.  Who knows?  The point is, they had their chance to object and they failed to do so.  As far as I can tell, game over.  The Court need not reach the statutory or Constitutional questions of whether the student loan debt should, or even could have been included in the restructuring plan in the first place because United&#39;s rights in those regards were essentially waived by their failure to raise a timely objection.<br /><br />So, what does this mean for the average student loan debtor?  Very little, I&#39;m afraid.  The fact is, student loan debt is statutorily prohibited from inclusion in a bankruptcy discharge or restructuring without a showing of undue hardship.  This case merely represents a narrow set of circumstances where a mistake was made but the aggrieved party failed to object to that mistake when it should have.  Had United made their objections when they had the chance, it&#39;s likely they would have prevailed.<br /><br />The bottom line here is that anyone expecting the Supreme Court&#39;s eventual decision in this matter to have any far-reaching implications for the majority of student loan debtors is merely engaged in wishful thinking.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ramanstrategicanalysis.blogspot.com/"><strong>Bahukutumbi Raman</strong></a> [former head of the <a href="http://www.intelligencesummit.org/speakers/BahukutumbiRaman.php">Counter-Terrorism Division</a>, Research and Analysis Wing (India&#39;s external intelligence agency)]: &quot;Even before the Mumbai terrorist attack of November, 2008, India had been repeatedly demanding the arrest and handing over to India by Pakistan of 20 terrorism suspects - Indian as well as Pakistani nationals - wanted for trial in India in terrorism-related cases. According to Indian investigators, they were living in Pakistan. In the case of the suspects who are Indian nationals, Pakistan denied their presence in its territory. In the case of the Pakistani nationals, it rejected the evidence against them produced by India as fabricated.<br /><br />India has now demanded the arrest and handing over of 22 more suspects living in Pakistan, who are wanted in the trial relating to the Mumbai attack. All of them are Pakistani nationals and belong to the Lashkar-e-Toiba, a Pakistani terrorist organisation which had carried out the terrorist strike. These include Hafiz Mohammad Sayeed, the Amir of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, the political wing of the LET. An Indian court before which the trial is presently being held has <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/india-court-issues-arrest-warrants-for.php">issued</a> non-bailable warrants for their arrest and production before the court.<br /><br />According to the media, the Pakistani authorities have ruled out the  handing over of these persons to India on the ground that they are Pakistani nationals. They have said that if India could produce credible evidence of their involvement in the Mumbai attack they would be arrested and prosecuted before a Pakistani court, but the question of their being tried by an Indian court would not arise. Five of these persons were arrested by the Pakistani police after the Mumbai attack on the basis of the evidence of their involvement in the Mumbai attack produced by Indian and US investigators. The Pakistani authorities say that they are making their own investigation into their involvement to corroborate the evidence collected by the Indian and US investigators and that they will be prosecuted in Pakistan if warranted by the evidence.<br /><br />Since Pakistan became independent in 1947, it has never handed over to India any Pakistani national wanted for trial in India in respect to any crime. They continue to follow that policy even in respect to the Mumbai attack despite international pressure on them to co-operate with India in the investigation and prosecution of the accused. For them, co-operation does not mean handing over Pakistani nationals for trial by Indian courts.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam</strong> [Spokesperson, <a href="http://iranhr.net/">Iran Human Rights</a>]: &quot;More than two weeks have passed since Iranians came on the street protesting against what they believed was an election fraud. The protests were cracked down by the pro-regime security forces and Basidj militia. They opened fire on the peaceful demonstrators. We still don&#39;t know the exact death toll following the crack down. What is sure is that the actual number is much higher than the 27 announced by the official media. It is believed that as many as 250 people have lost their lives either under the demonstrations or the following days in the hospitals. We have received disturbing reports about people dying at the hospitals as a result of serious infections in the shot wounds at the non vital parts of the body such as the legs.  <br /><br />Unknown number of people <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/iran-authorities-arrest-academics.php">have been arrested</a> and taken to undisclosed detention centers. Human rights groups are still trying to identify those arrested and so far more than 500 of them have been identified. However we believe the real number is much higher. Several <a href="http://iranhr.net/spip.php?article1167">human rights defenders and lawyers</a> are among those arrested.<br /><br />We have also received reports about inhumane treatment of those under detention. Many of them are under pressure to appear on the TV screens with false confessions. The confessions will be used as pretext for further crackdown and possible executions. Iranian authorities have started a campaign of spreading fear among the people in order to prevent future uprisings.<br /><br />There is no doubt that the uprisings in Iran were more than just protests against fraud in a presidential election or for a president that according to the Iranian constitution doesn&#39;t have real power. The protestors have challenged the authority of the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and in this way are a direct threat against Kahmene&#39;s regime as a whole.<br /><br />Iranian authorities are apparently about to get the situation under control. But what is sure is that Iran will not be the same as what it was before the protests. The main outcome of these protests is that it is now obvious for everybody that Ayatollah Khamenei has the real power in Iran and real reforms are not possible within the framework of the present constitution which gives the Supreme leader and his <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/iran-council-rules-out-new-elections.php">Guardian Council</a> unlimited power. <br /><br />Which way Iran will take depends to a great extent on what will happen in the coming weeks and months. Reactions from the international community will play an important role on the final outcome of these events. Most Iranians, regardless their political view, believe that not recognizing the election results, and thus Ahmadinejad as president, is how the world community could contribute to the democracy movement in Iran. By not recognizing the election results, the world sends the right signals both to the Iranian people and the Iranian regime. It tells the people that their peaceful protests and civil movement give positive results, and is not ignored by the world. By the same token, the Iranian authorities learn that not respecting their people&#39;s rights will have consequences for them outside their own borders. <br /><br />Another thing the world can do is to impose further sanctions on the Iranian revolutionary guard&#39;s economy sector and the many foundations (Bonyads) that dominate Iran&#39;s non-petroleum economy, and which are answerable directly to the supreme leader Ali Khamenei. The revolutionary guard and Bonyad&#39;s incomes are being merely used to strengthen the regime. <br /><br />If the crack down of pro-democracy demonstrations doesn&#39;t lead to significant international consequences, the young Iranians will lose their faith in civil and non-violent protests and we will be facing a radicalization of the pro-democracy movement in Iran. <br /><br />Many people believe that what we have been seeing on the streets of Tehran and other big Iranian cities, are the beginnings of a democratic change in Iran. A democratic Iran is not only good for its people, but also big step towards peace and stability in the world.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.utah.edu/profiles/default.asp?PersonID=6581&name=Guiora,Amos">Amos Guiora</a> of the University of Utah College of Law says that if the US had followed Israel&#39;s lead in taking an aggressive approach to judicial review of executive action, such controversial Bush Administration policies as torture, military commissions, and indefinite detention would have been subjected to the strict scrutiny they so deserved.....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/amosguiora.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->J<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->udicial review is judicial review. It is all or nothing. Sitting as the High Court of Justice, the Israeli Supreme Court proved that once again this week. The facts of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ashraf Abu Rahma vs. The Judge Advocate General</span> (HCJ7195/08) are simple: the Israel Defense Forces&#39; Judge Advocate General decided to order a disciplinary hearing rather than a criminal trial for a brigade soldier who fired rubber bullets at a handcuffed Palestinian. In response to this judgment, human rights groups filed a petition to the High Court arguing that the decision was unreasonable and that the brigade commander must be brought before a court martial.<br /><br />The Court held that the JAG's decision was not reasonable, thus clearly emphasizing a powerful lesson: the executive cannot operate outside the boundaries of the law, especially when it involves the use of military force.  This lesson should reverberate loud and clear in the US courts, where the judiciary should end its near automatic deference to executive determinations regarding the use and application of force.<br /><br />Sitting as the High Court of Justice, the Israeli Supreme Court engages in the most robust form of judicial review of the executive, which includes the Israel Defense Forces. The review is a clear manifestation of checks and balances and it reflects the importance and vitality of the separation of powers. The Court's self-imposed mandate is to ascertain the 'reasonableness' of the executive's decision. This does not mean that it 'steps in the shoes' of the decision maker; the Court does not claim expertise in all facets of executive decision making. It does, however, mean that applying reasonableness as a measuring stick ensures an analysis that goes beyond the scope of the actual decision. That is, the Court's analysis of the specific decision at issue extends to the decision's larger implications.<br /><br />Comparativism is always problematic because judicial and political regimes are inherently different. Nevertheless, I have long argued that if the US Supreme Court were to adopt an approach of active (i.e. aggressive) judicial review that&#39;s not predicated on deference to the executive, many of the Bush Administration policies (such as torture, military commissions, indefinite detention) would have been subjected to the strict scrutiny and bright lights they so deserved. Critics of my proposal respond that the American judicial system is different than the Israeli system, making the comparison untenable. Although the systems are indeed different, there are important lessons to learn from the Court's decision regarding the Judge Advocate General's decision.<br /><br />The executive, regardless of rank and post, is not immune from judicial review.  Deference does not benefit the state or the individual petitioner. If the Israeli Supreme Court had taken the track of judicial deference, in all probability the JAG&#39;s decision would have been upheld, thereby minimizing the gravity of the commander&#39;s decision. Only by directly engaging the executive in active strict scrutiny could the Court hold that the JAG had fundamentally erred.<br /><br />Some Israeli commentators have suggested that the JAG's legal opinions should be seen as beyond the High Court's purview. This suggestion is extraordinarily problematic for it implies that judicial review should not be universally applied because some decisions are 'off limits'.<br /><br />Nothing is more dangerous to a democracy than an 'unfettered executive'. Justice Jackson was both prescient and correct in <span style="font-style:italic;">Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer</span>. His concern was also timeless. This principle must be applied across the board. Encouraging judicial review of some executive branches but not others will do no more than ensure unequal justice under law. The JAG's decision must be subject to review in the same vein as that of any other executive decision maker. The essence of active judicial review is to protect the unprotected and to ensure that the executive acts within reasonable boundaries as broadly defined.<br /><br />By ruling that the JAG did not act within these boundaries, the Court is sending a loud and clear message: the executive is subject to strict judicial review and it cannot hide behind the cloak of executive decision making. That powerful and compelling message should be adopted by the US Supreme Court, particularly when striking a balance between the legitimate rights of the individual and the equally legitimate national security rights of the State. The free pass that the Supreme Court has historically granted the executive in national security cases (<span style="font-style:italic;">Korematsu v. United States</span> being the poster child) has, in the long-run, harmed the individual and the state alike.<br /><br />In effectively protecting the individual from the executive, the Israeli decision reinforces the importance of judicial review. This protection is ultimately in the best interests of society. Just as the JAG could not &#8212; and should not &#8212; escape judicial review, no US Administration policy should be immune from strict judicial scrutiny.<br /><br />This is the ultimate lesson to be applied.<br /><br /><em>Amos N.

The raw boned spectacle of tyranny is displayed on television and computer screens, and via text messages and twitter posts.  Censors attempt to stop the information flow, but the clean sands of the truth slip between their fingers.  The world sees what the Islamic Republic of Iran truly is &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a tyranny ruled by demagogues. <br /><br />After the so-called "election," Iran's leaders, in a whirlwind of statements bordering on the shrill, lashed out blindly at mostly perceived threats from within the country and internationally.  They allege that the unrest in their country has been caused by a terrorist conspiracy backed by the United States, Great Britain, and, of course, Israel.  Trying to deflect worldwide condemnation surrounding both the recent presidential elections and the heavy-handed way they have dealt with those who have taken to the streets in protest, the Supreme Leader and his President are using a centuries-old tactic that many tyrants, dictators, and thugs have relied on to focus the attention of their citizenry away from their oppressive internal policies and toward a supposed external threat to the nation. <br /><br />In effect the Supreme Leader is creating what I call a "bogeyman" to justify his government's actions.  What these thugs are essentially saying is: "I am taking away your liberty and your freedom, arresting you without charge, even killing you to protect you from the real threat: the great Satan, the bogeyman, who seeks to destroy the nation."  I know this sounds absurd, but history has shown us that it works in the short term.  Over the past thirty years in Iran, the bogeyman has helped the regime to hold on to power.<br /><br />The 20th Century &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; what I call the bloody century &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; saw the deaths of over 100 million human beings at the hands and policies of their own governments.  Tyrants, dictators, and thugs such as Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse-Tung, Idi Amin, Pol Pot, Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Hussein, Charles Taylor, and Robert Mugabe (to name a few), all justified their atrocious actions by claiming to protect the nation from a real or perceived external threat; to rally their citizens to sacrifice for the good of the nation, the motherland. What they admonish is, "I am protecting you!" What they were really doing was trying to gain and maintain their control of the nation.<br /><br />At various times in recent history, the Jews, NATO, the West, capitalists, the infidels, former colonial masters, and the United States (by virtue of its political position on the world stage), have been characterized as the so-called bogeymen. These tyrants each claim to be the one person capable of saving their citizens from themselves and from that external threat.  Without this, their policies and efforts to stay in power lose any justifiability whatsoever.  <br /><br />History also shows us that using the bogeyman tactic to stay in power is a short- term strategy that generally backfires on those who use it.  These tyrants are generally overthrown, killed, indicted, forced to resign, or forced to flee.  In Iran, the Supreme Leader is walking down a very slippery path, a path that most likely will lead to his demise.  The desire for freedom is difficult to quash.  All peoples want to be free from want and fear, to have the freedom to worship in their own traditions, and to speak their minds.  This younger generation of internet savvy Iranians know that there is a world out there far different from that which has been depicted to them by the Supreme Leader.  There is no bogeyman!  <br /><br />Query:  Will the next bogeyman used by the rulers in Iran be the worldwide web?<br /><br />It remains to be seen how this will all end, but at a minimum the end product will be a politically and morally diminished Iran.  Their place in the world community will be that of a nation feared, isolated, and feeding upon itself from within.  The regime will howl, lash out, and blame others for their problems and challenges.  It may appear that they have all the cards for now, but they don't have the ace of spades &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; freedom &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and because they don't have that card, they will ultimately lose.<br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

		<title>The Ghailani Terrorism Case: Military Lawyers in Federal Court?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a> of New England School of Law says that Department of Defense approval of military defense counsel&#39;s participation in Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani&#39;s federal court terrorism case would underline the Department&#39;s core commitment to the rule of law, and would show that military lawyers are capable of providing competent legal representation to anyone, regardless of who they are or what they may have done...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hansennew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he first terrorist suspect held at Guantanamo, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, was recently transferred to federal district court in New York to face charges for his alleged role in the embassy bombings in Tanzania.  The move received a great deal of media attention as a test case for the Obama Administration's plan to close down the detention facility at Guantanamo and to prosecute at least some of the terrorist suspects in U.S. federal court, rather then by military commission.  A development in the Ghailani case that received less attention was Ghailani&#39;s request to keep his appointed military defense counsel to represent him in federal court.  The federal district judge ruled that Ghailani could keep his military counsel if the Department of Defense approved the request. <br /><br />Representation of terrorist suspects by military defense counsel in federal district court is without modern precedent.  While military defense lawyers occasionally represent military members in federal court, those situations typically arise when the military member is being criminally investigated or sued civilly for actions taken in his or her official capacity.  There are no modern precedents for military defense counsel representing a suspected terrorist being prosecuted in federal district court.  Because of this lack of precedent and the possible concern that if a request were granted in this case it would open the floodgates for other Guantanamo detainees to make similar requests, the inclination of Department of Defense officials may be to deny the request.  More careful consideration, however, is warranted before Department of Defense officials act on such an inclination.<br /><br />Since their initial inception by the Bush administration to try terrorist suspects, the military commissions process has been subjected to widespread criticism, both domestically and by our friends and allies abroad.  The Obama administration's recent announcement that it is considering using a revised version of the military commissions for some of the detainees at Guantanamo means that this criticism and concern is likely to continue.  Much of the criticism has centered on the lack of fairness in the procedures to prosecute these detainees.  Other criticism has focused on the lack of legal authority for these military commissions, the <em>ex post facto</em> nature of the offenses which are being prosecuted, and the concern that the military commissions process is not in compliance with our treaty and other international obligations.  <br /><br />The recent request by Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani that his military lawyers remain on his case in federal district court is another opportunity for the military to demonstrate the quality of its service members and the culture of respect for the rule of law that exists in the military.  It is quite remarkable to consider that Mr. Ghailani would ask members of the military that has detained him for the past several years without trial, to now represent him in federal court.  Granting Mr. Ghailani's request would be akin to granting him the right that any service member has to make a by-name request for a military attorney to represent him or her.  These requests are known as Individual Military Counsel (IMC) requests, and they are routinely granted if the requested counsel is available and not otherwise conflicted.  <br /><br />If the military were to treat Mr. Ghailani's request as an IMC request, it is quite possible that the analysis would lead to the conclusion that his military counsel can continue to represent him in federal district court on these charges.  In doing so, the military would send a strong message that one of its core institutional values is respect for the rule of law, and that military lawyers are capable of providing competent legal representation to anyone, regardless of who they are or what they may have done.  The Department of Defense should carefully consider the powerful example and message of such a decision.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps and currently teaches at New England School of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Michael Macchiarola, an adjunct professor at CUNY Law School and Seton Hall University School of Law, says that the Securities and Exchange Commission&#39;s recent complaint against Countrywide Financial offers several lessons for those who would repair our ailing financial services industry...<br /><hr size="1"><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/michaelmacchiarola.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->T<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->he recent SEC complaint alleging that three former Countrywide Financial executives engaged in securities fraud makes for some very important reading for our nation's lawyers and law students.  Aside from an insider trading claim aimed at Angelo Mozilo, the founder and former chief executive of Countrywide, the crux of the SEC's civil charges concern the actions of Mozilo and two of his lieutenants, David Sambol and Eric Sieracki.  Whether or not the allegations are proven true, the environment described in the complaint will be eerily familiar to too many swept up in the last decade's euphoric rise of the financial industry.  We can only improve our nation and repair the soul of financial services if we learn certain lessons that the complaint can teach.  Here are five lessons to be gleaned immediately:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't change your stripes</span><br /><br />SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami described the charges as "a tale of two companies."  While on the one hand the executives had grown increasingly worried about the risks that Countrywide was assuming in its aggressive pursuit of market share, on the other they continued to describe an environment of tight controls and responsible risk management to investors.  In life, it is rarely a good idea to have a different story depending on your audience.  More specifically, it is difficult to do right by your shareholders and abide by the disclosure requirements at the foundation of the federal securities laws if you do.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't copy last year's disclosure</span><br /><br />The complaint alleges that the composition of Countrywide's mortgage portfolio changed significantly as the company offered riskier products and increased the "exceptions" to its credit guidelines.  At the same time, many of the descriptions of the Company's products and controls remained remarkably unchanged from those offered in last year's public disclosures.  While most professionals are guilty of starting from a precedent document, it is generally a good idea to deviate from precedent as things change &#8212; especially when those changes are material.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">It's difficult to stand in the way of a money train</span><br /><br />Bernie Madoff aside, very few businesspeople start out with malice in their heart.  The siren song of money and continually increasing profits can be tough to resist, however.  Here in-house counsel and regulators can play a meaningful role &#8212; perhaps ratcheting up oversight as a company gets more and more enamored with its own success.  In hindsight, we know that each failed to assert a strong enough role as a healthy skeptic.  Going forward, it is clear that we need aggressive, no-nonsense in-house counsel as well as financial regulators who are willing to ask tough questions.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't let others define your business decisions</span><br /><br />One of the complaint's most damning allegations is its description of Countrywide's "supermarket" business model which made available any product offered by at least one competitor (including subprime) and which expanded the risk guidelines to match other lenders.  To even the untrained eye, this model amounts to little more than a cobbled together collection of the riskiest standards for each product in the mortgage universe.  Not surprisingly, it didn't end well for Countrywide.  All too often in business, companies "outsource" their own decision making function to their competitors.  Whether in hiring, pricing or risk management, it is generally a better idea to do your own homework.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Very often, there are no rewards for laudable behavior</span><br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting part of the complaint is the description of the behavior of a Countrywide employee that the SEC inadvertently fails to properly introduce.  Simply referred to as &quot;McMurray&quot; throughout, these passages most likely refer to former Senior Managing Director and Chief Risk Officer at Countrywide, John McMurray.  Throughout the complaint, the SEC describes Mr. McMurray as the voice of reason within the organization - constantly warning colleagues of the risks of the portfolio and, more importantly, of their obligations to accurately disclose those risks.  Ultimately, Mr. McMurray took the extraordinary step of qualifying his certification to the company's Sarbanes-Oxley officer.  Perhaps it is telling that the most upstanding actor to be found in the bunch doesn't even warrant a proper introduction.  Oh well, I guess President Truman was right:  "If you want a friend . . . get a dog."<br /><br /><em>Michael C.

The bill follows an agreement between Spain&#39;s two main political parties on amending Article 23.4 of the Spanish Organic Law on the Judicial Power (LOPJ in its Spanish acronym). The purpose of this amendment is to limit the capacity of Spanish courts to exercise jurisdiction over international crimes committed abroad by non-Spanish nationals. This amendment has been made through an unusual and extraordinary parliamentary process which limits debate, and in fact prevents necessary informed discussion on it. While final passage of this legislation now appears inevitable, it is also lamentable, as it would be a loss to our common humanity. <br /><br />Spanish courts have been exercising universal jurisdiction for over a decade now.  They have made an extraordinary contribution to the development of international criminal law and the fight against impunity.  Article 23.4 LOPJ establishes that the Audiencia Nacional has jurisdiction over acts perpetrated by Spanish nationals and acts perpetrated by foreigners outside of Spain if such acts are alleged to constitute: genocide, terrorism, war crimes, and any other crime which should be prosecuted by Spain in accordance with international treaties. <br /> <br />The Spanish courts first exercised universal jurisdiction in 1998 when the Audiencia Nacional indicted several Argentinean and Chilean officials for their alleged roles in abuses committed as part of Plan Condor.  General Augusto Pinochet and other high ranking members of the former junta were among the 99 current or former members of the Argentinean military charged in the case.  The fate of the proceedings against Pinochet is well known.  While most of the indicted Argentineans were not extradited by Argentina, Mexico extradited former Argentinean military official Ricardo Miguel Cavallo in 2000.  In 2001, Adolfo Scilingo was also detained, processed, and sentenced to a long prison term by the Audiencia Nacional for crimes against humanity committed in Argentina.  Other cases followed, including a case initiated by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Mench&Atilde;&ordm; concerning the genocide, torture, terrorism, assassinations, and illegal detention in Guatemala.<br />  <br />Spanish courts have continued to address serious violations around the globe for which no alternate forum has been found.  Such efforts include a case against officials of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) and the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) for crimes allegedly committed against Hutu Rwandans, Congolese, and nine Spanish victims surrounding the Rwandan genocide (1990-2002).  As part of this effort, Spanish courts issued 40 international arrest warrants for alleged genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes by senior political and military officials in Rwanda.  The courts have also addressed such human rights issues as Chinese abuses in Tibet and the US torture of Guantanamo detainees. <br /><br />States have not only a right but a duty to guarantee that the most severe crimes&acirc;&#8364;&#8221; those which are considered to be committed not only against the victims, but against the international community as a whole &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; do not remain unpunished.  The amendments introduced to the Spanish law constitute an important step backwards in the effort to develop coherent global processes of accountability for human rights atrocities.  International law has developed since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials to provide norms and venues for the exercise of universal justice, as seen in the ad hoc Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the Special Courts for Sierra Leone, East Timor, and Cambodia, and the International Criminal Court.  Each of these mechanisms, acting in tandem with domestic courts, serve as instruments for the enforcement of human rights and international humanitarian law.  Universal jurisdiction is only one of the tools available in the fight against impunity for severe human rights violations. <br /><br />Spain, therefore, is not acting as a "world policeman," but is exercising both its right and its duty in international law.  If the new amendment is passed, Spanish courts would have to prove Spain's specific interest in prosecuting any given crime.  In order to do so, courts will have to evidence one of the following: the involvement of Spanish victims in the claim, the residence of the suspect in Spain's territory, or a "special relation" between the crimes and Spain.  The introduction of these conditions will severely restrict the use of universal jurisdiction as a complementary tool for the achievement of universal justice.  In practice, this would mean that those crimes committed where there is no other option for justice &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; where the international community is unwilling or unable to establish international tribunals, or where the crime was committed before the International Criminal Court was established &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; will not be addressed.  In such cases, victims will not be vindicated and justice will not be served.  <br /><br />Until now, the Spanish universal jurisdiction law has managed to withstand political pressure rising to the level of that which ultimately compelled Belgium to revise its own universal jurisdiction legislation.  It is in the interest of the international community as a whole - of all of us - to preserve this instrument as another avenue of justice, complimentary to the International Criminal Court and potential hybrid courts.  As Human Rights Watch spokesperson Reed Brody recently put it, the Spanish universal jurisdiction rule belongs not only to the Spaniards, but to all of us.  It is part of the heritage of the international community, and as such we should defend it.  <br />    <br /><em>Olga Martin-Ortega is a Senior Research Fellow at the Centre on Human Rights in Conflict, University of East London.

In other respects, however, Judge Sotomayor will not add much at all: the court's current members share with her a set of educational and professional credentials that reflect a narrow range of legal education and experience.  In this regard, there is virtually no diversity on the court.<br /><br />As noted by many commentators, Judge Sotomayor, like two current justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, received her law degree from Yale, while five of the justices are Harvard Law School graduates (as is retiring Justice David Souter). Only one does not have an Ivy League law degree &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; Justice John Paul Stevens went to Northwestern.<br />  <br />Similarity in education is only one trait common to the current membership of the court. From their Ivy League educations, five justices were law clerks to federal judges, and four have been legal academics. All nine, moreover, served as federal appeals court judges, while seven worked in the Department of Justice, a federal prosecutor's office, or as a legal counsel to a federal agency or Congressional committee.  Only Justice Souter had state experience before becoming a federal judge &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; first as New Hampshire attorney general and then as a judge in the New Hampshire court system at both the trial and appellate levels.<br /><br />According to the American Bar Association, there are 200 accredited law schools and more than one million lawyers in the United States.  Needless to say, many of the lawyers who did not graduate from Harvard or Yale are just as accomplished as their Ivy League counterparts. They count among their numbers many hundreds of respected law firm lawyers, general counsels to corporations and institutions, agency lawyers, prosecutors, and state and federal judges. <br /><br />To suggest that a Supreme Court justice need not have a Harvard degree and a federal judgeship is not to say that legal acumen should be disregarded as a qualification for the job. But the lawyers who receive elite educations and subsequent federal employment have no monopoly on legal acumen.  Few would argue, for example, that Justice Stevens is any less sophisticated in his approach to judicial decisionmaking or constitutional analysis because he did not attend an Ivy League law school.<br /><br />Elite lawyers, moreover, do not necessarily produce superior decisions as Supreme Court justices. At the annual meeting of the Association of American law Schools in 1990, A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., a long-serving federal judge and an award-winning historian of race, addressed the difference values make in judicial decision making. Rejecting what he called a "whispered or unarticulated elitism" among some law school professors, he described how four of the five justices in the majority in <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the 1896 decision in which the Supreme Court enshrined segregation into American law &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; were educated at either the Harvard or Yale law schools. The lone dissenter in the case, Justice John Marshall Harlan &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; who stated what we now understand to be correct, that separate is not in fact equal &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; was a graduate of the Transylvania College of Law.    <br /><br />That an elite education is not necessarily commensurate with superior legal argument was most recently demonstrated during the administration of President George W. Bush.  The lawyers who advised President George W. Bush on his controversial national security policies &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; including his policies on the detention and interrogation of terror suspects &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; were drawn from the same pool of lawyers from which Presidents select Supreme Court justices.  And in case after case challenging the Bush administration's policies, the arguments in support of increasing the executive's power and limiting due process protections for detainees have been found wanting.<br /><br />It remains that the tradition of judging in the United States, especially at the level of the Supreme Court, involves exercising judgment and not just a technocratic application of settled law.  In <em>A Primer on the Civil Law System</em>, James G. Appel and Robert P. Deyling describe how, in civil law systems, the judiciary is a civil service-like career track that law graduates join after passing qualifying examinations.  They move up the judicial hierarchy based upon seniority and performance. They are viewed as performing important, but not creative functions. Unless Presidents branch out from the trend toward viewing the ranks of judges on the Courts of Appeal as the only credible candidates for the Supreme Court, the federal judiciary may well start to function like the civil law system career track.<br /><br />In the end, by confining the shortlist of potential nominees to those lawyers with certain backgrounds, Presidents overlook the opportunity to add to the Supreme Court another kind of diversity, one that may be just as important as racial and gender diversity.  These Presidents deprive the public of justices who may see the world and the legal issues it presents in ways that are different and more helpful than those justices whose views on the law were shaped by essentially similar educational and professional experiences.  <br /><br /><em>Ren&Atilde;&copy;e M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Andrew J. Puglia Levy, an attorney in Washington D.C. who served in the US Department of Homeland Security from 2006-2009, most recently as deputy general counsel, says the risks of bringing some Guantanamo detainees to the United States are significant because the Obama Administration&#39;s legal options for holding them here are limited and problematic....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/andrewlevy.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>&quot;T</strong></font>he President would never allow it.  Our judicial system would never allow it....In fact, I think it is beyond the realm of possibility.&quot;  So said Senator Dick Durbin to critics of the Obama Administration's decision to transfer former Guantanamo Bay detainee Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani to the United States to face trial in federal court.  <br /><br />The Illinois Senator was responding to concerns that detainees like Ghailani (who is accused of being involved with the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings) could be acquitted and set free in the United States.  But dismissing these concerns reflects a misunderstanding of the legal framework that will govern the Administration's recent decisions.  Although trying detainees in Article III courts is President Obama's prerogative, and although doing so may be the appropriate route for some cases, this strategy must acknowledge the real risk that alleged terrorists could be acquitted or could receive short sentences.  Recent reports that President Obama is considering an executive order authorizing the indefinite detention of alleged terrorists suggest that he recognizes the current problem.<br /><br />It is impossible to predict with certainty the result of any trial, let alone those involving such novel circumstances.  Many of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay were captured in connection with combat overseas.  For those whom the Administration decides it can try, their cases therefore come with the myriad challenges associated with turning battlefield encounters into successful federal cases, including the admissibility and availability of evidence and ensuring the protection of classified sources and methods.  <br /><br />Widespread allegations of detainee mistreatment as well as the recently released Justice Department memos, which set forth the legal justification for enhanced interrogation techniques, only make these cases more vulnerable.  They provide traction for defense arguments that detainee statements were coerced, and they could undermine jurors' overall confidence in the government's case.  These potential problems may explain the Administration's reported new policy of reading Miranda rights to terrorists captured abroad&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;something that makes sense if your paramount concern is building a case, not fighting terrorism.<br /><br />Military commissions are one viable alternative to trials in federal court, in part because they can more easily incorporate procedural and evidentiary rules to lessen some of these challenges.  But while the Administration's decision to restart military commissions at Guantanamo Bay is welcome news, these commissions cannot all be completed before the President's January 2010 deadline for closing the base.  <br /><br />At that point, the White House will have serious options to consider.  The Executive Order setting the deadline for closure contains a provision authorizing transfer of all remaining detainees to "another United States detention facility."  That leaves open the possibility that detainees could be transferred to another oversees U.S. facility, an alternative the Administration may be grateful to have.  More likely, though, the remaining military commissions will take place in the United States.<br /><br />Even these proceedings are not immune from risk, however.  Salim Ahmed Hamdan, Osama Bin Ladin's driver, was sentenced by a military commission jury to only 66 months and was given credit for the 61 months he had already spent at Guantanamo Bay.  He was then sent to Yemen and is now free.<br /><br />Regardless of whether the detainees are tried in federal court or by military commission, there is no federal law that expressly permits the government to indefinitely detain them in the United States in the event that they are acquitted or complete a court-ordered sentence.  The fact that those at Guantanamo Bay are not U.S. citizens is of little significance because the immigration laws do not provide a guaranteed backstop either.  Once detainees are here, it is more difficult, for both legal and policy reasons, to remove them.  Over the years, the government has been forced to release convicted violent criminals when their home countries would not take them back or when the United States had concerns that the country would torture them upon return.  In these cases, no acceptable third country was available.<br /><br />Consider the case of Ha Tran, a Vietnamese refugee with a history of mental illness, who murdered his wife in the presence of their seven-year-old daughter, pled guilty, and was sentenced to eighteen to twenty years in prison.  Before completing his sentence, he was transferred to immigration custody and placed in deportation proceedings.  When the government was unable to effectuate his removal, a federal court of appeals granted his <em>habeas</em> corpus petition and ordered his release.  Such an outcome is troublesome enough in an ordinary criminal case like Tran's.  It is obviously more so in the case of those who are reasonably expected to pose (indeed, are committed to posing) a continuing threat.<br /><br />One possible safety valve is a provision buried in the PATRIOT Act geared toward alien terrorists picked up in the United States and pending removal, but it is likely to face its own legal challenges.  The provision allows for the indefinite detention of suspected terrorists on review and certification by the attorney general that they pose a risk to national security.  Yet, to my knowledge, this authority has never been used.  It is an extraordinary power that would undoubtedly be challenged in the courts.  And its availability is particularly unclear if an individual has already been cleared of terrorism-related charges.<br /><br />To suggest that, despite this lack of reliable law, the President "would never allow" alleged terrorists to be set free in the United States ignores legal reality  &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; or at least the version of legal reality President Obama has embraced so far.  If he goes forward with an executive order allowing for the indefinite detention on U.S. soil of those Guantanamo Bay detainees who are too dangerous to release, he will be adopting a position advanced by the Bush Administration.  That argument, that the President retains certain inherent constitutional authority as commander-in-chief in the war on terror, was maligned by some at the time, including  Senator Durbin.  At Justice Alito's confirmation hearing, he referred to the notion of a unitary executive, including as a basis for indefinite detention, as a "marginal theory at best."  <br /><br />An executive order may be a useful stop-gap measure, but it is not clear that the current Supreme Court would be willing to accept the Administration's interpretation of executive power.  Rather than allow Supreme Court review of cases in which alleged terrorists had been detained in the United States without charge based on a presidential determination that they were "enemy combatants,  the Bush Administration and, more recently, the Obama Administration, transferred the cases for trial in federal court.<br /><br />In lieu of an executive order, the Administration could work with Congress to  pass a law authorizing this kind of detention, another option it is reportedly considering.  A workable preventative detention law would be an important homeland security tool going forward, and providing for ju
dicial review in the form of a national security court could increase the chances of such a law surviving legal challenge.<br /><br />Bringing detainees here comes with risks nonetheless.  The Supreme Court has shown an increased willingness to delve into war on terror decisions, as well as a refusal to automatically defer to the national security assertions of the President (or Congress).  Considering the stakes, President Obama may not want to allow the only thing preventing dangerous detainees from walking the streets to be a newly enacted law that the Court could strike down.<br /><br /><br /><em>Andrew J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amelia Mathias, Pitt Law &#39;11, writes from Brussels about the European Union elections...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a href="/dateline/uploaded_images/European-voting---posters-703258.JPG"><img style="float:right; margin:4 4 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/European-voting---posters-702815.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>t would have been easy to forget entirely about June&#39;s elections for the European Parliament if one ignored the election posters plastering European cities, portraying diverse faces of every color, creed, and gender beaming out of every convenience store window. Indeed, it seemed many Europeans themselves forgot about the elections - or, rather, chose to stay home and sit out the election entirely. Turnout across the European Union member states was just over 50 percent, even including countries like Belgium and Luxembourg where voting is compulsory. Slovakia&#39;s turnout was the lowest at less than 20 percent. Although Europeans have sometimes shown discontent with the European Union by staying home for elections, this turnout set a new low. <br /><br />Even more interesting to politicos, academics and election-watchers was not how few people voted but who they elected. Those elected were mostly moderate parties with a definite leaning to the right. There were also isolated incidents of extreme right parties being elected to seats in the European Parliament, such as the British National Party gaining two seats in the United Kingdom. Voters may be reacting against the European &quot;Blue Card,&quot; which would allow more immigrants into their countries to replace an aging work force. While it is true that most governments in the European Union are currently led by more leftist parties, and that the poor economic climate could lead voters to vote against the party in control, there are two other trends in Europe that would seem to draw voters towards leftist parties: the Obama effect, and the political climate. <br /><br />US President Barack Obama is quite popular in Europe, with pictures of him and Michelle Obama smiling out from every cover of the Paris Match tabloid and crowds gathering for his frequent trips across the pond. But with Obama&#39;s government taking over major industries in the United States and expanding government oversight in the private sector, it is surprising to see that European voters who adore him are voting for his ideological opposites. It is even more surprising given that in the depths of a recession, voters could be expected to vote for more leftist, socialist candidates who provide a government safety net to fall back on in times of trouble. <br /><br /><a href="/dateline/uploaded_images/European-voting---EU-Parliament-754740.JPG"><img style="margin: 4pt 10px 10px 4pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/European-voting---EU-Parliament-754740.JPG" alt="" border="0"></a>The picture is not so black and white, however, particularly when it comes to the European Union, which many still perceive as disconnected from their daily lives, unlike their local or national governments. The leftist, socialist parties tend to be the more pro-Europe groups, while the more rightist parties advocate a more &quot;Euro-sceptic&quot; approach. Many labor laws in Europe make it difficult for people to lose their jobs, so the recession has hit more slowly, but those same laws make it more difficult for economies to recover. That said, the fear of a longer depression has Europeans frightened of further firing waves, and has made them more aware of the dangers of competing with a less expensive, immigrant work force. Sending a politician to the European Union who is not the organization&#39;s biggest fan will hamper activity in the European Parliament, but will also send a message to domestic leaders that the people want their attention at home right now, not in Brussels listening to new countries lobby for entry into the exclusive European clubhouse. These European elections are always a good prediction for what will happen the next time a domestic vote is held. <br /><br />The migration issue is another hot topic in European elections, as internal borders mean less and less. There has never been such a massive influx of immigrants into modern Europe as there is now. Many countries are finding their social services burdened as they have never been before, with a new influx of immigrants from Turkey and North Africa, and workers from newly-welcomed nations in the European Union such as Poland and Romania. With few mechanisms for integrating these new populations, it is easy to blame them for the current troubles by voting for a party or a candidate with a strict view on immigration, or even with racist tendencies. Despite this, the European populations, particularly in the northern countries, need their new countrymen. With expensive social programs and safety nets, they need to keep generating money through taxation, particularly as their populations age. With their native birth rates barely keeping up with the aging population or even declining outright, it is in the best interest of native it is in the best interest of native Europeans that their Turkish and Moroccan neighbors succeed in their new homes and pay into the expensive social welfare system that will support them in their old age. <br /><br />In Belgium, province politics are usually at the center of every vote, with vastly different voting records in Flanders versus in Wallonia. This election was no exception. Wallonia&#39;s voting record remained mainly stable, with the Socialist party that has dominated politics for years losing only one seat &#8212; and Wallonia as an entirety lost a seat with the expansion of the entire European Union. A greater change was seen in Flanders, the more prosperous half of Belgium, the Socialist party lost a seat. Vlaams-Belaang, the notoriously rightist party opposing immigration except on strict complete assimilation terms, lost a seat but still held steady in third place. While many in Brussels breathed a sigh of relief at their loss, Vlaams-Belaang has a strong presence in Flanders and could come back in the next election. <br /><br />Personally, observing this European election reminded me of the old American adage: vote Democratic at home, Republican nationally. While domestic governments suffered losses in these European elections, it is unlikely that this spells any significant doom for their parties (with the possible exception of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom). The biggest loser in these elections was the European Union. With many newly elected parliament members from parties that are skeptical of the EU, it will likely find that its continued quest to pass a constitution will be stymied again this fall. The Swedish leadership that just took over will have its hands full getting everyone to cooperate in order to achieve its goals.<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt" size="2">Sources: http://www.elections2009-results.eu/<br /><br />Photo credits: Amelia Mathias</font><br />

		<title>Defeat of Thune amendment runs afoul of Constitution&#039;s full faith and credit clause</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.gurapossessky.com/attorneys/gura.html"><strong>Alan Gura</strong></a> [Partner, <a href="http://www.gurapossessky.com/">Gura &amp; Possessky, PLLC</a>]: &quot;Gun rights opponents at last have cause to rejoice. Only 58 members of a lop-sided Democratic-controlled Senate approved of a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/senate-narrowly-rejects-amendment-to.php">provision</a> mandating that states give full faith and credit to each other&#39;s gun-carry permits. The laws of forty-eight states, at least in theory, allow their peaceable citizenry to carry guns in public for self-defense. Forty of these states either require no license to do so, or issue such licenses as a matter of routine upon meeting basic qualifications. Even in the small minority of hold-out states, gun carry licenses are often available depending on one&#39;s residence. Senator Boxer&#39;s Marin County neighbors cannot carry a gun to defend themselves, but her constituents in Fresno and Bakersfield suffer no such disability if they dot their i&#39;s and cross their t&#39;s. <br /><br />However, when permit holders travel across state lines, the validity of their permits &#8212; and thus their ability to exercise their right of self-defense &#8212; depends upon a crazy-quilt patchwork of ever shifting reciprocity agreements hammered out among the states. This is precisely the sort of problem the Constitution empowers Congress to solve, giving it the authority to have states extend &quot;<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/article04/">full faith and credit</a>&quot; to each others&#39; public acts. Ensuring that Americans do not trip on internal borders is a basic feature of our national existence. But gun rights opponents, unsafely esconced in their shrinking gun-free fortresses, adamantly oppose mingling with those who exercise their Second Amendment rights &#8212;  nevermind the fact that gun-carry permitees constitute an incredibly law-abiding population, and that the liberalization of gun carry laws has correlated for the most part with substantial declines in violent crime.<br /><br />Alas, this celebration will last no longer than the denial about the meaning of the Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/supreme/slip/554/07-290/opinion.pdf">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [PDF file]. <u>Heller</u> confirmed that most licensing regimes regulating the carrying of handguns are not unconstitutional &#8212; but it also signaled the end of hyper-restrictive laws in the minority of holdout states which print handgun carry licenses on paper made of unobtainium. Rejecting the argument that &quot;keep and bear arms&quot; was a unitary concept referring only to a right to possess weapons in the context of military duty, the Supreme Court held that to &quot;bear arms,&quot; as used in the Second Amendment, is to &quot;wear, bear, or carry...upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose...of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.&quot; Twice more, the Court referred to the right to &quot;keep and carry arms.&quot; The Court then helpfully noted several exceptions that prove the rule. Explaining that this right is &quot;not unlimited,&quot; in that there is no right to &quot;carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose,&quot; the Court confirmed that there is a right to carry at least some weapons, in some manner, for some purpose. The Supreme Court then listed as &quot;presumptively lawful&quot; &quot;laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places,&quot; confirming both that such &quot;presumptions&quot; may be overcome in appropriate circumstances, and that carrying restrictions are not presumptively lawful in non-sensitive places.<br /><br />The Supreme Court also offered that the concealed carrying of weapons may be prohibited, and for this proposition it had ample precedential support. A close reading of <u>Heller</u>, and of the cases upon which it relied, reveal that concealed carry bans are lawful only where open carrying is permitted, lest the right to carry a gun be completely abrogated. In an earlier time, where the carrying of guns was commonplace, concealment of one&#39;s firearm was viewed as unmanly at best, most probably sneaky. Hence the constitutionality of mandating that guns be carried openly. But today, social norms often prefer that guns be concealed. Post-<u>Heller</u>, hold-out states may still maintain concealed carry bans should they allow open carrying. This is a choice they are unlikely to make, but one they will be forced to confront.&quot;<br /><br /><em>Alan Gura was lead counsel for the respondent in <u>District of Columbia v. Heller</u>.  He is currently spearheading a challenge to the constitutionality of policies that deny law-abiding individuals gun carry permits in California. <u>Sykes v. McGinness</u>, U.S. Dist. Court, Eastern Dist. of Calif. No. 09-01235</em>.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Aaron Rhodes</strong> [Spokesperson, <a href="http://www.iranhumanrights.org/">International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran</a>]: &quot;While certain commentators echoing official Iranian positions dismissed the <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/rights-groups-hold-iran-election.php">demonstrations</a> on the July 25 United4Iran Global Day of Action as an attempt to interfere with Iran&#39;s &quot;internal affairs,&quot; such comments reflect a lack of understanding of international human rights and Iran&#39;s obligations as a member of the international community and as a state party to the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cpr.html">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR).  <br /><br />Opposing human rights violations is not political interference. The idea behind the demonstrations, and their goal, was to oppose human rights violations and to support the Iranian people&#39;s right to peaceful protest, guaranteed by the ICCPR as well as by the Iranian constitution.  These demonstrations were nonpartisan, and the organizers explicitly opposed outside interference in Iran. The demonstrators appealed for an end to violence against those seeking to express their political views; appealed for the release of political prisoners; and  urged the United Nations to send envoys to Iran to monitor and intercede in ways that will lead to the release of political prisoners and to improving Iran&#39;s very low level of compliance with UN human rights standards.<br /><br />Some of the political prisoners detained since the disputed election have been released in the past few days.  Many more remain and face continuing abuse including torture to force confessions, lack of access to legal counsel, as well as unfair trials if they are prosecuted. Many people died in the course of the recent events, either during demonstrations at the hands of security forces or militias, or later in detention.  <br /><br />What is important now is to prevent further torture, further abuse, and further deaths, as well as to advocate for opening a space in which political disputes can be resolved peacefully and legally, consistent with human rights principles.  While identifying the specific consequences of any protest is generally difficult, the over 100 demonstrations around the world raised international awareness about these problems; they put the spotlight on the responsibilities of Iranian authorities, many of whom are increasingly disturbed by the humiliating spectacle of torture and death of innocent people in Iranian prisons; and most importantly, they showed the Iranian people that their efforts to exercise their human rights are supported by hundreds of thousands around the world who demonstrated, and many more.&quot;<br />

		<title>Enforcing antiquities laws is vital to preserve material culture of both Iraq and the West</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bib-arch.org/e-features/pergamon.asp#author"><strong>Sarah Yeomans</strong></a> [Managing Web Editor/Travel Study Director, <a href="http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org">Biblical Archaeology Society</a>]: &quot;The recent <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/iraq-antiquities-law-central-to.php">release</a> of UNESCO&#39;s Final Report on Damage Assessment in Babylon is a significant step in the right direction toward preserving the rich material culture of Iraq&#39;s past. Among the recommendations for archaeological mitigation in Babylon made by the ICC is adherence to the provisions of the Iraqi Antiquity laws, which provide for the protection, conservation and appropriate documentation of archaeological sites and antiquities.  They are a fairly comprehensive set of laws aimed at preserving Iraq&#39;s cultural heritage and making it accessible to both researchers and the broader public.<br /> <br />Sound laws, however, are only as effective as the ability to enforce them.  How the Iraqi Antiquities laws will be applied, and to what degree, was not addressed in the current report. Nor was there any discussion of how to fund the inherent - and likely substantial - cost of implementing these laws. Without a sound plan for the application and enforcement of these laws, as well as the procurement of the available funds to do so, the report&#39;s recommendation is meaningless. Such a plan will hopefully be forthcoming. <br /> <br />It is the hope of many in the archaeological community that this same type of assessment and mitigation process will also be applied to the other historically invaluable sites in Iraq, such as Nippur and Ur. The fact is that modern Iraq is the troubled heir of some of human history&#39;s most important empires. The ancient Sumerian, Babylonian, Akkadian, Assyrian and Achaemenid empires all ruled in this land, and their legacy has influenced some of the most fundamental aspects of Judeo-Christian society. <br /> <br />Protecting the rich material culture of Iraq&#39;s past is not just important for modern-day Iraqis, but for today&#39;s Western civilizations, whose origins are so closely tied to this ancient place.

B.C.) and of Nebuchadnezzar (6th cent. B.C.), which appears prominently in both the Old Testament and in classical sources, was one of the greatest cities of antiquity.  Excavated by Robert Koldewey (1899-1913), it has yielded outstanding monuments such as the Ishtar Gate (now recreated in Berlin).  Its site was unfortunately damaged, first by Sadam Hussein&#39;s grandiose plans to make it a tourist mecca, then even more so by the building of a base (Camp Alpha) in 2003-2004 by the American army.<br /><br />A detailed <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/iraq-antiquities-law-central-to.php">description of the damages</a> to the site was released on June 26 by a committee of distinguished scholars including J. Curtis, J. Russell and E. Stone.  The building of the military installation caused direct and indirect damage through much of the site.  Though the <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001831/183134e.pdf">report</a> [PDF file] does not say so, in hindsight the insensitive and unnecessary disregard for the preservation of such an extraordinary site was an outrageous assault on Iraq&#39;s most important ancient city.<br /><br />The report concludes with six recommendations, which should all be followed including: &quot;The provisions of the Iraqi Antiquity laws should be observed on the stie of Babylon,&quot; and &quot;All activities should be undertaken with a view to the nomination of Babylon for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List.&quot;  <br /><br />I would add a seventh: That the United States offer funds to repair the site to make amends for  our failure to safeguard the integrity of this most important city.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jackson Chin</strong> [Associate Counsel, <a href="http://www.prldef.org/">LatinoJustice PRLDEF</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/homeland-security-announces-revised.php">changes announced by ICE</a> to operating its controversial 287(g) program and the gradual upgrading of current state-local agreements do not inspire confidence among the civil rights and human rights community. These changes are ultimately superficial and flawed. Unfortunately, they come too late to overcome systemic problems and cannot justify the expansion of the 287(g) program into new localities.<br /><br />Most advocates are alarmed by the escalating number of arrests and the use of racial profiling by local police and sheriffs, CBP and ICE agents. ICE&#39;s purported mission to arrest and remove the &quot;most serious criminal aliens&quot; has been turned on its head as is underscored by the percentage and volume of local law enforcement&#39;s disproportionate arrests and detentions of Latinos for minor traffic infractions and low-level offenses. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09109.pdf">A recent GAO report</a> [PDF file] and other civil rights and human rights reports provide ample documentation to support critics of ICE&#39;s 287(g) programs. For many years, there was inadequate oversight on 287(g) program agencies - no reporting requirements, no accountability,  no independent audits, and, the implementation of few, if any, uniform standards. <br /><br />The recent <a href="http://policefoundation.org/indexStriking.html">Police Foundation report</a> [PDF file, abstract], through its network of law enforcement executives, shows that the 287(g) program has had a corrosive effect on local policing. Shifting already strained resources into civil immigration enforcement is at the expense of serious crime-fighting; loss of trust and cooperation from crime victims and the communities they serve have created &quot;a negative overall impact on public safety.&quot; <br /><br />On the flip-side of the coin, ICE and local enforcement of civil immigration law have created <a href="http://www.cardozo.yu.edu/uploadedFiles/Cardozo/Profiles/immigrationlaw-741/IJC_ICE-Home-Raid-Report%20Updated.pdf">dire consequences</a> [PDF file] for literally tens of thousands of immigrants (documented and not) and citizens caught up and detained in the gulag of local jails, federal and privately-leased detention facilities. Poor detention conditions, flawed judicial review for civil immigration detentions, no oversight of ICE officers&#39; parole decisions, extra-judicial expedited removal of aliens without access to counsel, lawful permanent residents put in &quot;mandatory detention&quot; for minor offenses, arbitrary medical care for detainees (over 74 detainee deaths in the past five years) and many other nagging questions  underscore serious due process and liberty concerns.<br /><br />Many problems will continue to plague the ICE 287(g) program and its operations. Our constitutional values and civil liberties do suffer under an enforcement regime whose easiest targets are the most vulnerable among us and where racial and ethnic traits are commonly used.&quot;<br />

		<title>Protecting copyrights from internet piracy should not deprive users of due process rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=722235"><strong>Jernej Letnar &Auml;&#338;erni&Auml;</strong></a> [Researcher, <a href="http://pravniinstitut.si/index_en.html">Institute for European, Constitutional, International Law and Law of Economics</a>]: &quot;The rights and obligations of Internet users have been hotly debated in recent months in a number of European countries. Particularly, challenges arising from illegal file sharing and downloading have caused for a great concern among internet users, politicians and the entertainment industry. Several European countries have so far taken action against internet sites that illegally disseminate work online, most recently in Sweden with a judicial decision against a torrent website. Similarly, France <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/iran-implements-controversial-internet.php">has attempted</a> to introduce an internet piracy statute, which would grant an administrative authority the power to suspend an individual&#39;s internet access if he/she infringes upon copyright law three times in a row. The French Constitutional Council thereafter held that only a judicial organ has the authority to restrict the right of accessing the internet. <br /><br />In a similar development on May 6, 2009, the European parliament adopted a legislative <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P6-TA-2009-0360&language=EN">resolution</a> which argues that users&#39; internet access cannot be restricted without a previous decision of a judicial authority. The resolution provides in paragraph 22 that:<br /><blockquote>Member States wishing to implement measures regarding users&#39; access to and/or use of services and applications must respect the fundamental rights of citizens, including in relation to privacy and due process, and any such measures should take full account of policy goals adopted at Community level, such as furthering the development of the Community information society.</blockquote> <br />In short, the European parliament argues that individuals should be bestowed with a right to a judicial decision by an independent judicial organ.  <br /><br />Surely, protecting copyrights is one of the necessary conditions for stimulating creativity and safeguarding cultural traditions and identities. Whereas individual countries are free to set up administrative organs to address increasing piracy on the internet, they cannot be granted carte blanche to enforce copyrights on the internet. Nonetheless, it is debatable whether there exists a fundamental right to access the internet, but there exists a fundamental right to a fair trial and due process in most national legal orders. It is feared that granting an administrative authority the right to stop a person&#39;s individual access arbitrarily and without judicial remedy may result in violating basic constitutional and human rights standards in the majority of European countries. Additionally, there a number of different ways to tackle illegal file sharing and downloading. For instance, the European Commission argues that a full-fledged EU market for downloadable content could substantially curtail illegal downloading.  <br /><br />Granting an administrative organ the right to suspend an individual&#39;s internet access undermines the fundamental right of a person to a judicial decision and remedy. Above all, it appears that such administrative agency powers are not necessary in a democratic society.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://johnrlott.blogspot.com/"><strong>John Lott</strong></a> [author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226493644/ref=nosim/?tag=johnrlotttrip-20">More Guns, Less Crime</a>; senior research scientist, University of Maryland]: &quot;By a 58 to 39 majority, the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/senate-narrowly-rejects-amendment-to.php">voted</a> last week to let concealed handgun permit holders carry handguns across state lines. Yet, it was two votes short of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster. The legislation sponsored by Senator John Thune (R, SD) would have allowed reciprocity in permitting, as anybody would still be required to obey the laws of the states that they travel in. This is the same way driver&#39;s licenses work. <br /><br />The legislation before the senate doesn&#39;t really break new ground. <a href="http://www.handgunlaw.us/">Most states</a> already recognize permits from other states: 35 states recognize Michigan&#39;s permits, 34 states for Missouri and Tennessee, 33 for Utah, 32 for Arizona and Florida, 31 for Texas, 28 for Colorado, 26 for Ohio, 25 for Montana, 24 for Pennsylvania, and so on. States that allow citizens to carry concealed handguns have been slowly moving towards creating permits that are recognized in most of the country on their own. Despite this, there are still a number of people whose ability to protect themselves when they travel is limited by a patchwork set of rules across states. <br /><br />Gun control advocates were predicting the worst from Thune&#39;s amendment. Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D, NJ) <a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2009/07/20/thune-lautenberg-clash-on-concealed-carry-gun-proposal.html">warned</a> it is an &quot;attempt by the gun lobby to put its radical agenda ahead of safety and security in our communities.&quot; Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D, NY) calls it a <a href="http://gillibrand.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=4b423443-c49c-4ce7-a2f2-39f8895720f4">&quot;harmful measure&quot;</a> that will put the public at risk. Senator Chuck Schumer (D, NY) <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2009/07/democrats_scramble_to_block_th.html">said</a>: &quot;It could reverse the dramatic success we&#39;ve had in reducing crime in most all parts of America.&quot; <br /><br />If those claims sound familiar, they should. Opponents of concealed-handgun laws gave similar warnings about permit holders losing their tempers and blood in the streets when state after state originally passed right-to-carry laws. Obviously that never happened. We now have extensive experience with concealed-handgun permit holders. In 2007, about 5 million Americans were permitted to carry concealed handguns across the 48 states that let citizens carry. 39 of these states have relatively liberal right-to-carry laws that let people get permits once they pass a criminal background check, pay a fee, and in many states receive training. Take Florida, for example. Between Oct. 1, 1987, and June 30, 2009, Florida <a href="http://licgweb.doacs.state.fl.us/stats/cw_monthly.html">issued permits</a> to 1,540,712 people, many of whom renewed their permits multiple times. Only 167 had their permits revoked for a firearms-related violation - about 0.01 percent.<br /><br />The same pattern occurs in state after state. Permit holders lose their permits at hundredths or thousands of one percent for any type of gun related violations, and even then they are usually for relatively trivial offenses. And there is no evidence that these reciprocity agreements have caused any problems. Gun control groups such as the Violence Policy Center and the Brady Campaign have put out reports last week that attempted to show how dangerous permit holders are. But they made several serious mistakes: they usually included arrests and not convictions and they made mistakes on whether the people have concealed handgun permits. Even in the few cases where they correctly identified problems, they never discussed the rate that permit holders violate the law. If a permit holder fires a gun defensively and kills or wounds an attacker, even if the shooting was completely justified, they will almost always be arrested. A police officer who arrives on the scene simply can&#39;t be sure what happened until an investigation is completed. But these justified shootings are exactly why concealed handgun permits are allowed and including them as a cost of concealed handgun laws has the entire process backwards. <br /><br />Even though the adoption of right-to-carry laws was initially highly controversial in some states, the laws were so successful that no state has ever rescinded one. Indeed, no state has even held a legislative hearing to consider rescinding concealed-carry. Everyone wants to keep guns away from criminals. The problem is that law-abiding citizens are the ones most likely to obey the gun control laws, leaving them disarmed and vulnerable and making it easier for criminals to commit crime. Police are extremely important in deterring crime - according to my research, the most important factor. But the police also understand that they almost always arrive after the crime has been committed. There is a lot of refereed academic research on the impact that right-to-carry laws across the country have on crime rates. While <a href="http://johnrlott.tripod.com/postsbyday/RTCResearch.html">a large majority of the refereed studies</a> by economists and criminologists find that crime rate fall after these laws are adopted and some claim to find no effect, no such studies find a bad effect on crime rates, suicides or accidental deaths. <br /><br />Here is a prediction. Once Thune&#39;s amendment is passed, the original ruckus over the fears about allowing people to travel with guns, just like passing concealed handgun laws, will soon be forgotten.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.dallasjustice.com./lawfirm/firm_attorney.php"><strong>Michael Lowe</strong></a> [Criminal defense attorney, <a href="http://www.dallasjustice.com/">Law Offices of Michael Lowe</a>]: &quot;I&#39;ve been following the <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/senate-terminates-federal-judge.php">Judge Samuel Kent story </a>since last fall, <a href="http://DallasLawyer.blogspot.com">blogging</a> on it periodically.  Perhaps my perspective is a bit different than some other folks, given that I&#39;m a Texas board-certified criminal defense attorney, but I find the end result of the Kent case troubling. <br /> <br />First of all, I&#39;m not surprised that the impeachment of Judge Kent is being dropped.  Why spend the money? Second, while his initial post-dated letter of resignation was insulting to many, the strategy was shrewd.  It was a clever and aggressive defensive tactic by Kent.<br /> <br />I see a bigger problem here. Judge Kent was initially indicted for three crimes: (1) two counts of abusive sexual contact; and (2) one count of attempted aggravated sexual abuse. His first trial setting got bumped due to Hurricane Ike.  On the eve of the new setting, three new charges were added to his indictment.  One of them was an obstruction of justice charge.<br /> <br />Remembering back to Enron and Martha Stewart, the obstruction of justice charge is proving to be a powerful and successful tool in the prosecution&#39;s belt.  Under an obstruction charge, you don&#39;t have to be guilty of the crime being investigated to be guilty of obstruction. And you still face a significant punishment: on obstruction alone, Judge Kent faced 20 years imprisonment.<br /> <br />Charging obstruction is a scary thing - you&#39;ve got the constitutional right not to incriminate yourself, but absent taking the 5th how much leeway does a defendant have these days in dealing with the legal authorities? Creating criminal liability where there wasn&#39;t any beforehand is a danger to justice, and something we all need to be watching, as many scholars are warning against prosecutors&#39; &quot;creative interpretation&quot; of the obstruction statutes.<br /> <br />Bottom line, from my perspective: I think that the obstruction charge may have been the deciding factor in Kent&#39;s case, and all this hoopla about his notorious resignation letter &#8212; which I believe led an infuriated Congress to start impeachment proceedings &#8212; distracts us all from a very real problem:  the increased use of obstruction of justice charges by prosecutors in this country.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Mehmet Tohti</strong> [Former Vice President, <a href="http://www.uyghurcongress.org/En/home.asp">World Uyghur Congress</a>]: &quot;Horrible video footage posted on the internet regarding the July 5th Urumqi massacre has brought <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/china-official-says-police-killed-12-in.php">some international attention</a> and at the same time revealed the bitter reality that can be summarized as miserable Uyghurs, cruel Chinese and a generally uninterested world when it comes to the reaction to this tragedy that resulted in more than 1000 dead and the subsequent arrests of as many as 10,000, according to a RFA Uyghur service caller from Urumqi where riots have taken place.<br /> <br />All Uyghurs are unanimous in calling the July 5th Urumqi massacre a tragic event, as both Chinese armed forces and civilian Chinese mobsters were given a free hand in attacking and killing Uyghurs in Urumqi without proper restrictions. It was reported that on the late evening of July 5th, electricity was cut in a mainstream Uyghur neighborhood  upon the order of Wang Lequan, Communist Party chief in Uyghur Autonomous Region, and that Chinese military forces the began a &quot;Uyghur Hunt&quot; that lasted the whole night, resulting in the killing and arrest of an unspecified number of Uyghurs. According to the eye witness statements to RFA Uyghur service of Kazak nationals who came to Urumqi for a business trip, 150-200 Uyghurs  were murdered right in front of their hotel and the Chinese military cleaned up the body and blood from the streets just prior to dawn on July 6th.  According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/world/asia/21china.html">Edward Wong</a> from the New York Times, &quot;Hospital officials in Urumqi have generally declined to allow foreign reporters to interview injured Uyghurs, but have allowed them to interview injured Han.&quot; So far the Chinese government has failed to show any injured or dead Uyghurs out of fear that most of them were apparently killed by bullets shot by the armed forces.<br /> <br />Uyghurs in East Turkistan are in the state of shock and anger for lack of condemnation from the outside world -  especially from the United States of America -particularly considering the greater global reaction to the much smaller scale riots that occurred in Tibet last year. The lack of concern from the Western world gave a much needed free hand to the Chinese regime to expand its brutal crackdown throughout the region with the threat of execution to be used for those who have been part of the public unrest.<br /> <br />The July 5th outbreak is just the tip of the iceberg with regard to long existing ethnic tensions and evem hatred between the Uyghurs, who are the rightful owners of &quot;Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region&quot; and the Chinese, who are a migrant boss from mainland China that arrived to colonize the region due to its abundant natural resources and strategic location. <br /> <br />Despite the incorporation of East Turkistan into mainland China in 1949, Uyghurs have not accepted Chinese rule and want to restore their independent statehood while China remains determined to colonize this territory with a massive Chinese settlement program under the shadow of guns. As a result of this program the ethnic Han Chinese population has jumped from 5-6% in 1950s to almost 60% to today, even though many media outlets are using the old census numbers that put the Chinese population in the region around 40%, which is exclusive of the nearly 3.5 million Bingtuan, 1.5 million unregistered migrant workers and nearly 300,000 military personal and their family members. This colonization has brought cultural marginalization, ethnic isolation, social injustice and political deprivation to Uyghurs in East Turkistan as the central government in Beijing has consistently put the interest of the Han Chinese on the top of its priority list. <br /> <br />As early as 1980 China started a &quot;Go West&quot; campaign with tremendous incentives to encourage more and more Chinese settlers to resettle in East Turkistan. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and emergence of neighboring Turkic republics alongside the border of East Turkistan as independent states, a campaign was launched targeting Uyghurs to prevent a possible break up of East Turkistan from China and thus tighten Chinese control over the region. After 1997, right after publishing an official White Paper under former President Jiang Zemin, the central government identified East Turkistan as a high risk area for Chinese national security and adopted harsh measures to prevent the East Turkistan problem from being internationalized. They established the <a href="http://www.trcb.com/news-and-society/international/shanghai-corporation-organization-sco-a-new-platform-2531.htm">Shanghai Corporation Organization</a> with the persuasion of the neighboring countries of East Turkistan (Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan) in the name of border security, which put Uyghurs as prime target.  Short after the establishment of SCO almost all Uyghur organizations in central Asia that were kept open since the Soviet era were dismantled or sanctioned, a number of  influential Uyghur organizational leaders have been assassinated and Uyghur refugees were deported back to China for prosecution.<br /> <br />The September 11 terrorist attacks provided a perfect opportunity for China to step up pressure on Uyghurs and the Uyghur national identity. Further diluting Uyghur identity is a short cut answer for the Chinese government to complete the long-term elimination of a Uyghur voice. Chinese efforts in this regard include branding every incidence of civil unrest or discontent with the terrorism label; increased religious persecution; harsh political suppression; sharp ethnic discrimination in employment, education and social participation; banning the more than 2000 year old Uyghur language from schools and forcefully imposing Chinese education starting from the kindergarten level; implementing the same Chinese law differently for Uyghurs; forcing Uyghur families to send their children to mainland China for employment arrangements while bringing millions of Han Chinese to the Uyghur region to fill employment vacancies; and generally coercing Uyghurs to become like the Chinese by sacrificing their unique identity. <br /><br />There are further recent examples of Chinese oppression of Uyghurs.<br /> <br />In May 2009 a 33 year-old Chinese teacher surnamed Zhao, who was recruited by government to teach Uyghur pupils in the historical Uyghur city of Yarkend, was discovered to have sexually assaulted more than 20 pre-teen Uyghur girls. For this unforgivable crime, he was protected by the school principal Liu Yu Mei, along with other local Chinese police. One parent of the assaulted pupil traveled to Urumqi to have his voice heard but officials ignored him.<br /> <br />Then video footage surfaced of brutal beatings and killings of Uyghur workers in a Shaoguan toy factory on June 26, 2009, which resulted in more than 56 dead. Both the regional government in Urumqi and authorities in Shaoguan have downplayed this brutal killing of Uyghurs issuing a report of 2 dead and have done nothing to punish the perpetrators.<br /> <br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilham_Tohti">Ilham Tohti</a>, Economic Professor in Beijing Nationality University and owner of an online Uyghur website intended to promote ethnic dialogue between Hans and Uyghurs has been arrested after the July 5th massacre for his sharp criticism of the government&#39;s wrong policy stating that &quot;unemployment among Uyghurs are the highest on earth.&quot; <br /> <br />As many independent analysts have pointed out, it was the Chinese government&#39;s discriminatory policy that instigated the July 5th uprisings and and so the government needs to review its hard line policies in the region and move towards the prospect of reconciliation. <br /><br />One anonymous Uyghur <a href="http://www.uyghuramerican.org/forum/showthread.php?t=16052">posted</a> his outcry as follows:<br /><blockquote>I am very shocked to find out that the world is much [more] disabled than I imagined. The images show the Chinese in Urumqi are carrying out ethnic cleansing with the protection of the Chinese Army and the Police. The world is not seeing it and could not see it. But they saw it when it happened in Darfur, Even George Clooney saw it. Fareed Zakaria saw it when it happened to Tibetans. Bill Clinton saw it when it happened to Kosovar people. And the world spoke out on behalf of all of them.</blockquote> <br />But now? They are all deaf and blind.&quot;<br />

		<title>International trend to abolish death penalty makes continued US support untenable</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/contact-dpic"><strong>Richard C. Dieter</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a>]: &quot;The fact that fewer countries employ the death penalty and that the number of executions worldwide <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/executions-down-worldwide-report.php">declined last year</a> should serve as a wake-up call to the United States.  On many issues, the US is seen as a leader in the field of individual rights, but with the death penalty we could be one of the last countries standing.  The US is already isolated from its closest allies in Europe, North America, Australia, Israel, and parts of Africa where capital punishment has already been abandoned.  The death penalty is clearly part of the international stream of human rights, and it is flowing towards abolition.  In many ways, the issue of capital punishment is similar to the struggle against apartheid.  Eventually, a worldwide consensus left South Africa in an embarrassing and untenable position.  It is doubtful that the US would want to find itself in the same spotlight.<br /><br />There are signs that the death penalty is losing ground here as well.  In the past two years, three states have abandoned the death penalty: New York, New Jersey and New Mexico.  Executions declined last year to their lowest level in 14 years.  This is a distinct reversal from the 1990s when new states were adopting the death penalty and executions were increasing.  But all signs are not in the same direction.  After the Supreme Court approved the ordinary use of lethal injections, the number of execution dates rose, and there will be an increase in executions in 2009.  The federal death penalty is also a concern, having been expanded during the Bush administration.  The policy is currently under review in the new administration.<br /><br />Perhaps more than any other reason, Americans are rethinking the death penalty because of the revelations of so many wrongful convictions.  Since 1973, 135 people have been exonerated and freed from death row.  This problem is not going away.  There have been 5 exonerations in just the first half of 2009.  This risk, exacerbated by the extremely high costs of the death penalty in an imperiled economy, may eventually lead the US to join the international trend away from the death penalty.&quot;<br />

		<title>Binyam Mohamed&#039;s allegations spark debate on British use of torture to combat terror threats</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/about/directory/view/-/id/27/"><strong>Sonya Sceats</strong></a> [Associate Fellow in International Law, <a href="http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/">Chatham House</a>]: &quot;Claims by Binyam Mohamed that the UK security service colluded in his &#39;medieval&#39; torture while detained in Pakistan, Morocco and Afghanistan have reignited an important debate about the standing of the torture ban in UK foreign policy.<br /> <br />According to Mohamed, British officials not only failed to protect him from torture they probably knew was occurring, they actively contributed to it by supplying information about his life in Britain which his tormentors used as a basis for interrogations.  <br /> <br />The <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">UN Convention against Torture</a>, which the UK ratified in 1988, requires states to criminalise complicity in torture. It demands that allegations of complicity in torture be examined and, where appropriate, prosecuted. <br /> <br />The UK Government denies any wrongdoing in relation to torture allegedly inflicted on Mohamed by the security forces of other states; however on 10 July the Metropolitan Police Service <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/uk-police-begin-investigation-into.php">announced</a> that it was launching a full criminal investigation. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, others are stepping forward with similar claims. In evidence to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee on 16 June, Foreign Secretary David Miliband disclosed that there are eight cases involving alleged complicity by British officials in &quot;mistreatment&quot; of detainees abroad. <br /> <br />The UK is justifiably proud of its long rejection of torture as a matter of law, but the imperatives of counter-terrorism have seemingly placed this commitment under increasing strain of late. <br /> <br />The issue of how information extracted through torture may be used is especially fraught. In 2005, the House of Lords ruled that evidence obtained this way is inadmissible in UK courts, with Lord Bingham remarking that the prohibition of torture means that the &quot;fruits&quot; of torture must also be rejected. <br /> <br />But the question remains whether such information may be used operationally to combat terror threats. Lord Bingham suggested this might be permissible in &quot;limited and exceptional circumstances&quot; and the Government&#39;s stated view is that where there is a threat to life, a &quot;balanced judgment&quot; must be made. <br /> <br />Mohamed&#39;s allegations expose the risks in this approach &#8212; if intelligence gleaned via torture is usable as part of efforts to prevent terror attacks, security officials may have mixed feelings about pushing for the torture to stop. <br /> <br />This dilemma is addressed in Government guidance for security officials interviewing detainees abroad. The problem is that the Government has repeatedly refused to make this guidance public (it is currently being reviewed and the Prime Minister has promised to disclose the new version), fuelling suspicions that it is not compliant with the UK&#39;s obligations under the Convention against Torture.  <br /> <br />As well as requiring states to keep guidance of this sort under regular review, the Convention obliges states to &quot;fully&quot; include education and training on the prohibition of torture in the training of anyone, including law enforcement personnel and public officials, involved in the custody, interrogation or treatment of detainees.<br /> <br />The Government was due to submit a periodic report to the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/6/cat/index.html">UN Committee against Torture</a> on its compliance with the Convention in December 2008, but such is the gravity of the issues raised by Mohamed&#39;s case that it has decided to withhold its report until they are resolved. There can be no doubt that the Committee will scrutinise closely whether any violations of international law have occurred. <br /> <br />According to Lord Bingham in the judgment referred to above, &quot;[t]here can be few issues on which international legal opinion is more clear than on the condemnation of torture. Offenders have been recognised as the &#39;common enemies of mankind.&#39;&quot; The UK Government should ensure that it remains on the right side of this divide.&quot;<br />

		<title>Senate rejection of right to carry concealed firearms across state lines a misguided attempt to limit self-defense rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Alan Gottlieb</strong> [Founder, <a href="http://www.saf.org/">Second Amendment Foundation</a>]: &quot;Nearly all states allow qualified law-abiding citizens to carry guns for self-defense, but a few states arbitrarily reject the basic human right of self-defense by refusing to issue ordinary people gun carry permits. Of course, violent criminals in the impacted states continue to carry guns without police permission.<br /><br />Many carry licensing systems are being abused by some officials who are hostile to self-defense rights. The police can regulate the carrying of guns, and that includes preventing dangerous people from being armed. Complete deprivation of the right to bear arms, however, is not an option under our Constitution.<br /><br />The Supreme Court&#39;s <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-290.pdf">decision</a> [PDF file] last year in the <u>Heller</u> case shows that there is both a right to keep arms and a right to bear arms. In most states, authorities do not deny a license to carry an operable firearm to any law-abiding applicant that completes training and a background check.  <br /><br />We need 21st century gun laws that respect our Constitutional rights, and adopt modern, widely accepted practices that work well throughout the United States. The exercising of a constitutional right should not <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/senate-narrowly-rejects-amendment-to.php">stop at a state border</a>.<br /><br />Hopefully we can give a wake-up call to our legislators, and to those officials who stubbornly resist accommodating Second Amendment rights.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=31">Michael A. Olivas</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that the nomination and expected confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor, a Latina, shows how far Latino lawyers and the Latino community in the United States have come, even if anti-immigrant discourse and discrimination show how far they have yet to go...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/michaelolivasnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n a recent CNN.com editorial I was asked to write on Judge Sonia Sotomayor&#39;s confirmation hearings, I noted how thrilled I was at her candidacy, but I also voiced apprehension at the sure-to-be-bruising nomination process. I wrote:<blockquote>The search for a justice with &quot;empathy&quot; is no less coded than is the traditional search for &quot;judicial temperament&quot; and a person who will &quot;judge, not legislate.&quot; All nominees have the requisite merit badges, as does Judge Sotomayor. And to make their way to such a short list, all have the combination of personal and professional lives that warrant their consideration. What Sonia Sotomayor will have, as few other candidates, is the additional weight of historical expectations and the hopes of Latinos. In today&#39;s culture, Latinos are marginalized and demonized and feared. ...The racial rhetoric against Latinos has been tolerated for too long on cable television news and in political and polite discourse. I will be carefully watching the confirmation hearings for the coded political messages, knowing that Justice-elect Sotomayor&#39;s many merits will ultimately win her confirmation.</blockquote> (The editorial and the resultant hate mail can be read <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/26/olivas.sotomayor/index.html">here</a>.)<br /> <br />Well, I have gotten what I expected, and more. And less. As the Senate questioning winds down before her certain confirmation, I can report that no one has landed a full-square punch, and all the roundhouses thrown at her have glanced off. She retreated somewhat from her &quot;wise Latina woman&quot; remarks, which I wish she had not, but at some point the boxing metaphors have to give way to Kabuki theater, with heavily-stylized movements and music. She explained her short affirmation of the <em>Ricci</em> case, and it was left to less-than-a week-old Senator Al Franken to raise the issue of Republican appointee judicial activism, especially in Voting Rights Acts and affirmative action cases. I was surprised at the patronizing tone of Sen. Lindsey Graham, who called her out on the reviews she has received in judicial polls, and was reassured that those of us who opposed Jeff Sessions in his confirmation to the federal bench a decade ago had done the right thing. The specter or these old white men calling her out on her racial views was starkly evident for voters to remember.<br /> <br />But I honestly would not have expected the ghost of Miguel Estrada to arise (a trope for Republican efforts to advance Latino representation on the bench, as if), as it did several times, or for Judge Jose Cabranes to be reconstituted to appear as her foil. Judge Cabranes is a good and wise man, and as young Sotomayor&#39;s mentor and sponsor, he now inexplicably finds himself in the odd position of having his views on the <em>Ricci</em> case and his Puerto Rican-ness used as evidence that she was out of touch with the mainstream and even, God forbid, this other Puerto Rican judge. No one has noticed (yet) that Yale Law School professor Kate Stith, Cabranes&#39; wife, will be testifying on Judge Sotomayor&#39;s behalf, and fewer yet have noted the exquisite irony that a Puerto Rican&#39;s demurrer on this particular case, a case which at the Supreme Court level is an example of conservative judicial activism, is being touted as the norm. Surely this is a first, even if the right hand took the cultural authority away by employing the old Ricky Ricardo punchline that Judge Sotomayor would have &quot;some &#39;splainin&#39; to do.&quot; It makes one wonder, as I have more than once, what would have happened if President Clinton had done the right thing many years ago and named Cabranes to the Supreme Court when he had the chance.<br /> <br />I have never had the opportunity to watch confirmation hearings on television, although I have taken great pains to follow the last few in the print media and through the evening news. I have even assisted in preparing testimony for various testifiers over the years, for different bar associations and through my membership on the board of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF). This time was different, however, as Judge Sotomayor was the first Latina nominated, so like countless others in the larger Latino community or even in the smaller Latino legal world, I have been riveted. It is hard for many Anglos to appreciate the extent to which this is a matter of pride for us. I attended the Berkeley conference several years ago in which Judge Sotomayor made her &quot;wise Latina woman&quot; remarks, and I was struck then, and again upon reading the actual article that contained her remarks, at how thoughtful and nuanced she was. Taking any one sentence out of context is easy pickings, and the Republicans and the right wing media have had to resort to this tactic, as her judicial record (so extensive the Senate minority wanted more time to prepare and analyze it) gave them no real traction. Indeed, my own reading of her record in the area of immigration and other areas that I care about reveal her to be a moderate. It is the Puerto Rican-ness of this woman that so scares the conservatives: her outing the law firm that asked discriminatory questions, her youthful activities as a student, her serving on the PRLDEF Board. (The right wing, which has lionized Judge Cabranes, apparently does not know that he helped found PRLDEF.) It is hard to imagine a principled Latina of her stature and of her time NOT being involved in Latino pro bono and professional activities. It was his failure to do these kinds of services that so aligned Latinos against Miguel Estrada.<br /> <br />As a MALDEF Board member, I have been widely involved in the various depredations that Judge Sotomayor has been accused of--leaning against power, defending unpopular causes (at least the PRLDEF of her time did not have extensive involvement in undocumented immigration issues, and she has managed to dodge this tar baby), and doing the unglamorous fundraising and time-consuming advocacy work that PRLDEF (now LatinoJustice-PRLDEF) and MALDEF must do. If we did not do this work, someone would have to invent us. To be honest, it never occurred to me that doing this kind of work, which I am honored and proud to be in a position to undertake, would be seen as disqualifying. On my watch, such as it is a watch, we have prevailed in several important Supreme Court cases and generally done the Lord&#39;s work for a group that by definition (in the undocumented context) is powerless to effect change.<br />  <br />In 2006, I buried one of the lawyers who took up the first case ever in the U.S. Supreme Court argued by Mexican American lawyers, <em>Hernandez v. Texas</em>. Judge James DeAnda, the second Mexican American federal judge, was a close friend and mentor. This 1954 case, long hidden by its being the case decided immediately before <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, was a significant event in Latino legal history. In 2006, MALDEF lawyer Nina Perales (the daughter of PRLDEF founder and president Cesar Perales) successfully argued a Voting Rights Act case in the Supreme Court, where the Texas defense was argued by the State&#39;s Solicitor Teodoro Cruz. It was the first time that both sides of a Supreme Court case were argued by Latino lawyers. This October, the first Lati
na will sit on the bench. This has all happened in my lifetime, and it shows how far Latinos have come, even if anti-immigrant discourse and &quot;beaner-hunting&quot; show how far we have to go.<br /> <br />But, in many respects, my life has been her life, at least in the spores of our loyalties and organizational commitments. Of course, she chose a different path, and has done and will do an extraordinary amount of service as a judge and justice. indeed, no one can present her record of accomplishment, certainly no one since Thurgood Marshall. But this is the first time one of my own has advanced to this level, and it is hard to explain to others not similarly-situated how life-affirming this has been for me and for other Latino lawyers (and even more so for Latina lawyers). If Alberto Gonzales was the agony of defeat, Sonia Sotomayor is my triumph as well.<br /> <br /><br /><em>Michael A. Olivas is the William B.

Non-movement lawyers have become leading advocates for the cause.  This shift is a positive step for the gay rights movement, but it also presents new risks for a movement that has been carefully orchestrated by a small group of legal organizations.<br /><br />Last year, I commented in a JURIST <a href="/forumy/2008/03/california-marriage-case-and.php">column</a> that we were witnessing the mainstreaming of gay rights in the California marriage litigation.  The California Attorney General, charged with defending the state's then-statutory restriction on same-sex marriage, refused to make a number of arguments in favor of the restriction.  He wouldn't argue that the ban strengthened different-sex marriages, encouraged and channeled procreation, or served the interests of children by promoting dual-gender parenting.  Instead, social conservative advocacy groups were left to do the heavy lifting.<br /><br />Now, just over a year later and following the passage of Prop 8, the state has abandoned all pretense of defending a discriminatory marriage law.  Instead, in the state court challenge to Prop 8, the California Attorney General argued, under a novel theory, that the constitutional amendment was unconstitutional, taking away a fundamental right from a suspect class without a compelling governmental interest.  Now, in the federal suit challenging Prop 8, that same Attorney General filed an answer asserting that the constitutional amendment violates federal due process and equal protection guarantees.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, the state's Attorney General may have done one better.  She filed her own federal lawsuit challenging the operation of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) on her state.  Piggybacking on an earlier suit filed by Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders (GLAD), the Massachusetts Attorney General contends that DOMA usurps state control over marriage and unconstitutionally requires Massachusetts to treat similarly situated people (couples married under Massachusetts law) differently.  And, she notes, it does so based on nothing more than animus toward lesbians and gay men.<br /><br />Suddenly, two of the movement's most forceful and high-profile advocates are public government lawyers, putting the force of the state behind the gay rights cause.  As gay equality norms become mainstream equality norms, thanks to the tireless work of lawyers at Lambda Legal, GLAD, the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), and the ACLU, cause lawyers emerge from outside the ranks of movement lawyers.  But, contrary to what we might assume, it's not a story of clear triumph.<br /><br />The shift in advocacy from movement lawyers to non-movement lawyers comes with a corresponding loss of control.  For a collaborative movement that has been carefully orchestrated, that is no small price.<br /><br />In the Prop 8 litigation that resulted in the California Supreme Court upholding the amendment, the Attorney General explicitly rejected the amendment/revision theory put forward by movement lawyers and instead advanced a novel, somewhat convoluted theory of his own.  His support, while an important political moment, led to a confused oral argument.  The Attorney General's representative was left to make a case for the unconstitutionality of Prop 8 by arguing against the movement lawyers' theory while at the same attempting to articulate his own theory of pre-political rights.  The justices were not buying it.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the Attorney General's support was certainly a good thing.  And while he shed doubt on the movement lawyers' strategy of focusing on the amendment/revision question, he did not displace those lawyers.  But that's exactly what David Boies and Ted Olson have done in their federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Prop 8.  The union of these high-profile ideological rivals removes the question of same-sex marriage from traditional political divisions and persuasively presents it as an issue of basic fairness and civil rights.  But Boies and Olson, and the newly formed American Foundation for Equal Rights, have proceeded against the advice of movement lawyers and without those lawyers' official involvement.  And they've done so at a moment when movement advocates have been enjoying an impressive amount of success on a state-by-state basis around the country.<br /><br />Movement lawyers would like to see more states move to marriage equality before proceeding to federal court.  They remember all too well the seventeen years of continued criminalization and discrimination between <em>Bowers v. Hardwick</em> and <em>Lawrence v. Texas</em>.  They noted the Supreme Court's reliance on an "emerging consensus" against sodomy prohibitions in <em>Lawrence</em>, and they know such "emerging consensus" is unlikely to be found at this point with regard to marriage.  They know also that the Supreme Court is rarely ahead of public opinion, and when it is, significant backlash may result.<br /><br />But the federal suit is moving forward, in the famous words of Gavin Newsom, "whether you like it or not."  And so movement lawyers from Lambda Legal, NCLR, and the ACLU have sought to intervene on behalf of lesbian and gay community groups.  And the American Foundation for Equal Rights has rebuffed their attempt, alleging (in a letter that became public) that the groups aren't acting in good faith and will only undermine the suit.<br /><br />And so we arrive at the downside of mainstreaming gay rights.  Movement lawyers have seen their orchestrated strategy derailed by mainstream, non-movement lawyers.  They are now on the outside of a suit that would benefit from their expertise and experience.  There is little they can do but stand by and watch.  They might watch their movement suffer a devastating setback.  Or they might watch the movement record its most significant victory to date &#8212; a victory for which they would have laid much of the groundwork - and yet be unfairly portrayed as ineffectual naysayers.<br /><br />In the end, the mainstreaming of gay rights is a good thing.  It means the movement has gained legitimacy and its claims of equality and fairness are resonating with more and more people.  But with more and more people comes less and less control.<br /><br /><br /><em>Douglas NeJaime is an Associate Professor at Loyola Law School Los Angeles.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://artsandscience.usask.ca/history/people/detail.php?bioid=616">Pamela A. Jordan</a>, an associate professor of history at the University of Saskatchewan (Canada) who writes on politics and human rights developments in Russia, says that the recent murder of Chechnya human rights activist Natalia Estemirova may help jolt average Russians into demanding that their leaders finally get serious about legal reform....<br /><br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/pamjordan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->P<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->rospects for legal reform in Russia are closely linked to the country's wider political context, particularly the regime's threat perception and its concerns about economic development.  In 2008, Russian liberals had some reason to invest their hopes in their newly elected president, Dmitry Medvedev, despite his being a prot&Atilde;&copy;g&Atilde;&copy; of his predecessor, Vladimir Putin. Unlike Putin, he has no KGB past and, born in 1965, came of age during Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika.  Before his election, Medvedev &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a lawyer by training &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; publicly stated his intention to combat "legal nihilism," by ensuring judicial independence, fighting corruption, and educating average Russians about the law.  <br /><br />So far, though, it remains unclear whether Medvedev truly supports full governmental transparency and accountability or encourages reforms that would check the power of the Kremlin, two necessary ingredients for legal reform.  In evaluating Russia's prospects for legal reform, we also need to distinguish between structural reform (the adoption and implementation of laws governing courts and the legal profession) on the one hand, and attitudinal changes on the other.  The latter are far more difficult to foster among law-enforcement officials, judges, and even the public at large.  Russians are now using the civil and <em>arbitrazh</em> (commercial) courts in higher numbers than before to resolve their conflicts.  However, despite this promising trend, they still do not trust the courts to satisfy their claims against public officials, as shown by data published in a report on Russian public opinion (March 2008-March 2009) by the independent <a href="http://files.wyw.ru/3745608">Levada Analytical Center</a>.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Putin's Legal Legacy</span><br /><br />What kind of <a href="http://www.loc.gov/law/help/russia.php">legal system</a> did Medvedev inherit from Putin, who, as prime minister, is still widely viewed as the dominant ruler of Russia?  Putin, himself trained as a lawyer, famously proclaimed a "dictatorship of law" as a strategy for empowering the Russian state through a universal observance of federal legislation and government decrees.  Despite his reputation in the West as an authoritarian ruler, there is some evidence that he actually strengthened the foundations for a future rule-of-law state during his eight-year presidency (2000-2008).  He supported the adoption of new laws that&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;at least on paper&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;fostered an independent judiciary and built on earlier, although more modest, achievements made during Boris Yeltsin's presidency (1991-99).  <br /><br />These measures included liberal, reform-minded criminal procedure, civil, civil procedure, and land codes, as well as a new law on the <em>advokatura</em> (the Russian bar).  For instance, the criminal procedure code injects adversarial elements into an existing inquisitorial process, while the civil code promotes a free market system.  The new law on the <em>advokatura</em> was meant to protect advocates against prosecution and state intervention and to enable the bar's professional organs to maintain a minimum level of quality control for new entrants.  Putin also supported a law creating new justice of the peace courts, in an attempt to alleviate judges' heavy caseloads.  During his presidency, jury trials in more serious criminal cases were instituted in every region but Chechnya, and Russia ratified international conventions, including the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html">UN Convention Against Corruption</a> and the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/173.htm">Criminal Law Convention on Corruption</a> of the Council of Europe, which obligate it to meet certain standards of compliance. Thanks to increasing oil and gas revenues, Putin's federal budgets allocated more operating funds to Russia's 2,600 courts and significantly increased the salaries of its 37,000 judges.  Even a June 2009 Council of Europe <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2009/20090623_abusesJUR_E.pdf">report</a> about politically-motivated abuses of the Russian criminal justice system found that "strong improvements in the social status of judges and prosecutors in recent years have all but eliminated their dependence on executive bodies for housing and other basic needs and should help in reducing judicial corruption."  <br /><br />Russia's membership in the Council of Europe and participation in cases adjudicated by the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> have resulted in some positive, though limited, effects on the Russian legal system.  Russia joined the Council of Europe in 1996, and it ratified the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which grants Russian citizens the right to file complaints against Russia in the ECtHR after exhausting their options for redress in domestic courts.  Most complaints have centered on either the widespread failure to execute court decisions in civil cases or to honor the due process rights of defendants in criminal cases. The number of ECtHR judgments in which Russia was a defendant rose from two in 2002 to over 700 in May 2009.  In the spring 2009 issue of <a href="http://www.demokratizatsiya.org">Demokratizatsiya</a>, Alexei Trochev found that "Russian judges increasingly refer to the jurisprudence of the ECtHR despite Russia's losses in the Strasbourg court, the insistence of Russia's leaders that ECtHR decisions are 'politicized', and the resistance among certain circles in the legal academy to recognizing the binding force of ECtHR judgments on Russia's courts." <br /><br />In the end, however, Putin's commitment to legal reform was limited, and problems in the justice system remained widespread. He first and foremost served the interests of his fellow <em>siloviki</em> (officials in law-enforcement agencies and the military), and, predictably, did not reform conservative law-enforcement agencies.  As a result, corruption became even more entrenched during his presidency, to a point where it was undermining further economic development and deterring many foreign businesspeople from investing in Russia.  It should be no surprise, then, to learn that Transparency International ranked Russia 147th out of 180 countries in its 2008 <a href="http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table">Corruption Perception Index</a>.<br /><br />The conviction of Yukos Oil owner <a href="http://www.robertamsterdam.com">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> in 2005 on charges of fraud and tax evasion signaled that the Putin regime was willing to use the justice system as an instrument for undermining its critics, especially potential political rivals like Khodorkovsky.  Some Kremlin critics ended up dead, including journalists <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5416238.stm">Anna Politkovskaya</a> and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2004/07/12/cz_sf_0712steveforbes.html">Paul Khlebnikov</a>, as well as former KGB officer <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6163502.stm">Alexander Litvinenko</a>.  A select number of regim
e critics like <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3315213.ece">Roman Nikolaichik</a> were incarcerated in psychiatric wards, and law-enforcement officials regularly harassed and sometimes arrested defense attorneys and breached attorney-client confidentiality in high-profile criminal cases.  While Putin waged a second war in Chechnya, Russian forces tortured and murdered Chechen civilians with impunity.  Inside the courts, "telephone law" (whereby public officials lean on judges to rule in their favor in politically-sensitive cases) was still sometimes practiced, along with the arbitrary interference of court chairpersons in judicial decisions. In terms of civil cases, state agencies and courts often failed to execute rulings and to defend property rights. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Developments Under Medvedev</span><br /><br />One year into Medvedev's presidency, the signs of a new push for legal reform are mixed. Some recent developments appear to signal change, particularly in light of the fact that Medvedev has publicly expressed his opposition to Putin's stance on certain policies (i.e., Russia's application for WTO membership). The signs of legal reform include the release on parole of former Yukos Oil attorney <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Russia_Releases_ExYukos_Lawyer_Bakhmina_On_Parole/1612722.html">Svetlana Bakhmina</a>, a Russian <em>arbitrazh</em> court's dismissal of the majority of claims filed by the Federal Tax Service against the British Council, and the dismissal of a corrupt judge.  In terms of state-society relations, this July Medvedev approved amendments to a controversial 2006 law that had strengthened state regulation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The amendments are meant to ease several restrictions and are generally viewed as a positive development for civil society.<br /><br />Other developments are more ambiguous.  For instance, Medvedev supports a change to the rules for selecting the chair of the <a href="http://www.russiaotherpointsofview.com/2009/05/medvedevs-judicial-reforms-dont-prejudge.html">Russian Constitutional Court</a> that would allow him to nominate, and the Federation Council to appoint the chair &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; who is presently elected by the Court's justices themselves.  The Federation Council is the upper house of Russia's parliament, and the president indirectly appoints half of its members. Critics of this move say that it is meant to strengthen the so-called executive power vertical, while supporters claim that the change will not compromise judicial independence.<br /><br />In addition, several recent developments strongly call into question President Medvedev's professed commitment to end legal nihilism. These include incidents and trends outlined in the aforementioned Council of Europe report, including the murder of human-rights lawyer <a href="http://ru.indymedia.org/newswire/display/21503/index.php">Stanislav Markelov</a> and journalist <a href="http://ru.indymedia.org/newswire/display/21503/index.php">Anastasia Baburova</a> on a Moscow street in January.  The report argues that "Court chairpersons have disproportionate power over individual judges, in particular because of their power to decide on the distribution of cases.  Legal protection for judges resisting such pressures is very limited, as the judges' councils have not yet developed sufficient independence and standing."  Similarly, an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/EUR46/012/2009/en">Amnesty International report</a> about widespread human rights abuses in the North Caucasus, especially in Chechnya, finds that law enforcement officials "conduct counter-terrorism measures which, in many instances, entail serious human rights violations&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;There has been an almost total failure of political will to uphold the rule of law and address impunity for present and past abuses of human rights in the region."  On July 15,  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8152648.stm">Natalia Estemirova</a>, an esteemed human-rights activist in Chechnya, was found murdered.  To his credit, Medvedev quickly condemned her murder and praised Estemirova for her work with the NGO Memorial.  But Russian human-rights activists insist that his words will not suffice and that Estemirova's killers will likely remain at large.<br /><br />Other developments suggest the further politicizing of the legal system.  For instance, as William Pomeranz argues in the spring 2009 issue of <em>Demokratizatsiya</em>, Medvedev appears to be looking for more legislative ways to bolster the power vertical, possibly by reinforcing the dominance of Putin's party of power, Unified Russia, in regional legislatures.  In January, Medvedev approved legal amendments that ended jury trials in cases involving terrorism, treason, and other politically-sensitive charges.  Also this year, the state launched a second criminal case against Khodorkovsky.  <br /><br />Even if Medvedev is sincere about promoting rule of law, he faces considerable barriers.  Conservative factions in the Kremlin reportedly continue to dominate decision making and obstruct legal reform, which would involve transforming a corrupt system that has well served their political and economic interests.  Besides conflicts among political clans, the chief obstacles are entrenched interests in the law-enforcement agencies and the powerful Procuracy, which supervises criminal investigations and prosecutes criminal cases.  Even many judges are former law-enforcement officials and thus more prone to accusatory bias. In general, as Trochev's research shows, judges face a host of internal and external pressures that prevent them from applying measures in the European Human Rights Convention.  <br /><br />In addition, as demonstrated by widespread banditry in the North Caucasus, adherence to federal law is not universal.  According to the 1993 <a href="http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-01.htm">Russian Constitution</a>, federal law takes precedence over regional law, but in reality this measure is not yet observed in all 83 regions of the Russian Federation.  It is also important to note that, while on the one hand, the Kremlin strives to centralize power in Moscow, it has, on the other, turned a blind eye to illegality in some regions.  For example, human-rights activists have attributed Estemirova's murder to Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, a corrupt warlord whom President Putin appointed in 2007.  <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/207657?from=rss">Estemirova</a> herself reported that the Kremlin "gave a green light to the special service and local militia to do as they please here, on the condition that they provide Chechnya's absolute loyalty to Russia." <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Long-Term Prospects for Legal Reform</span><br /><br />Medvedev and Putin are more likely to support legal reforms over which they have a semblance of vertical control, including as primary drafters of legislation and as the overseers of a new television channel called Law TV, than those proposed by, say, independent human rights NGOs with ties to Western groups. Russia's leaders tolerate autonomous NGO activity so long as they feel sure that it does not threaten the regime's legitimacy or the power bases of key political and economic elites.  <br /><br />Certain reforms may stand a better chance of being implemented if they correspond to Russia's obligations under international legal conventions, especially those embedded in intergovernmental organizations that are important to Russia's international prestige.  Legal reforms may also be internalized if Russia's leaders perceive that doing so will result in more foreign direct investment, which is crucial to diversifying Russia's economy. According to <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/artsci/polsci/media/worldruleoflaw.pdf">Valery Zorkin</a>, the chair of Russia's Constitutional Court, "Flagrant nihilism in regard to international legal values becomes too costly during the solution of any serious problem, be it privatization, or regulation of the securities mark
et."  Unfortunately, Russia's commitment to international law was severely compromised after its invasion of Georgia last August.<br /><br />The good news is that Russia has a core group of dedicated legal reformers (academics and practicing lawyers), in addition to a dwindling number of courageous human-rights activists and investigative journalists who document the state's corrupt practices and human-rights abuses.  Russian legal reformers already have strong blueprints for change that build on the <a href="http://www1.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol11num1_2/features/krasnov.pdf">Concept of Judicial Reform</a> of 1991, the 1993 Russian Constitution, and other key documents.  Take, for instance, the report "<a href="http://www.stetson.edu/artsci/polsci/media/worldruleoflaw.pdf">The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform</a>," which was published in 2007 by the Moscow City Chamber of Advocates in cooperation with leaders of the International Bar Association and other foreign legal experts. It contains several articles outlining well-designed ways to promote legal reform.  The authors stress that, for legal reform to take hold, Russian legal education must improve, especially in regards to training judges and lawyers, teaching legal ethics, and keeping abreast of Russia's obligations under international law and frequent revisions to its own domestic laws.  <br /><br />The major obstacles to legal reform can be chiefly attributed to attitudinal factors, specifically, a lack of political will among law-enforcement officials and the Kremlin itself, rather than a lack of viable blueprints for change.  If Medvedev is attempting to break free of Putin's dominance and transform Russian society along more democratic lines, now is the time for him to capitalize on whatever good will is left among legal reformers and other liberals. <br /><br />Recent accounts, including a piece in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/world/europe/01russia.html?_r=1">New York Times</a>, suggest that "there are signs of a growing demand for civic discourse," especially as Russians see that the regime has further limited their freedom of speech and assembly and has dealt irresponsibly with the economic recession and long-standing demographic problems in Russia.   If any good can come from Estemirova's murder, it might very well be that it will jolt average Russians into demanding that their leaders finally get serious about legal reform.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Pamela A.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Anand Grover, UN Special Rapporteur on health and founder of the <a href="http://www.lawyerscollective.org/">Lawyers Collective</a> human rights advocacy group describes his group&#39;s decade-long fight to end discrimination based on sexual orientation in India, culminating in his recent Delhi High Court victory against India&#39;s colonial-era anti-sodomy law....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/anandgrover.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->O<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->n the evening of Wednesday, 1st July, while I was in Geneva for my work as the UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on Health, I received a text message followed by an e-mail from our local Advocate in Delhi informing me that the Gay Rights matter was listed for the pronouncement of the judgment by the Delhi High Court the next day.  I immediately relayed the information to my Delhi team members.  Within a few hours, every media outlet in India came to know of the impending judgment.  There were frantic calls around the country in anticipation of the next day's announcement.  My team arranged for me to receive the operative part of the order and the complete text by e-mail as soon as possible. <br /><br /><strong>Another yoke is shed...</strong><br /><br />By 10:30 the next morning the courtroom had been filled to capacity.  Onlookers both inside the courtroom and throughout the country as a whole waited the outcome with bated breath.  When the judges pronounced the verdict with these words, "We declare that Section 377 IPC, insofar it criminalizes consensual sexual acts of adults in private, is violative of Articles 21, 14, and 15 of the Constitution," ecstatic joy broke out.  This joy spread as quickly as the news of the judgment spread beyond the walls of the courtroom.  According to one observer, the atmosphere was electric.  <br /><br />I learned of the order at approximately 10:45am when the words, "We have won, we have won," flashed across my mobile.  At first I was elated.  Ten years of struggle had come to an end.  The first major phase was over.  But then the elation gave way.  I could not hold my emotions back.  The pain of nearly ten years of struggle overwhelmed me.  The delay in the Indian legal system had taken its toll on me.  No matter how you pit yourself against them, emotions cannot be held back.  I can tell you that at times the struggle was hard, arduous, and painful.  Late in the press conference in Geneva I said. "There were no words to express that moment. After years of struggle in the court, victory is like a new dawn. Another yoke of colonialism is shed from our shores". <br /> <br /><strong>The Beginning</strong><br /><br />It all started in 2000.  I had been fighting for the rights of those living with HIV since 1988.  After losing my first HIV case in 1989, (<a href="http://www.lawyerscollective.org/hiv-aids/judgements/indian-public-health-lucy-vs-goa">Lucy R. D&#39;Souza v. State of Goa</a>), the Lawyers Collective HIV/AIDS Unit, the NGO which I head, won a major victory in 1997.  In the case of <a href="http://www.lawyerscollective.org/hiv-aids/judgements/indian-discrimination-x-vs-zy">MX v. ZY</a>, the Bombay High Court held that there can be no discrimination against recruiting HIV positive people for employment in the public sector. After our work proved successful in a number of other cases, we decided in 2000 to start taking on the issues faced by groups especially vulnerable to HIV.  We had already had a number of gay clients come to the office for advice regarding blackmail, threats, extortion, and harassment by civilians as well as by police officers on account of Section 377. <br /><br />Section 377 was introduced to India's Penal Code by the British in 1869 in order punish persons indulging in "unnatural sex."  The section was later exported in number, letter, and spirit to all countries in British Commonwealth.  <br /><br />Over the years the Indian Supreme Court held that the section applied to  penile-non-vaginal sex.  Over the last few years, the court expanded the definition to include "sexual perversity."  Consent and age were immaterial.  Though it was textually facially neutral as it applied to homosexuals and heterosexuals alike, in practice the police targeted homosexuals.  <br /><br />I discussed the issue with a number of people in order to initiate litigation challenging the constitutional validity of Section 377.  There were a number of international precedents in support of such an effort.  However, nobody except Ashok Row Kavi, the well-known gay activist in Mumbai, was prepared to file suit.  Initially, we thought that it would be necessary to file the petition in the Delhi High Court as we were under the impression (falsely, as it turned out) that AIDS Bhedbav Andolan, another AIDS advocacy group, had filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, and as such that filing in the Bombay High Court would have meant that our case could be transferred to the Supreme Court, thus leaving us no chance to appeal in case we lost.  We ultimately persuaded the Naz Foundation to file the petition in their name.  They were an appropriate choice to file a Public Interest Petition (PIL) in the Delhi High Court as they were running both an HIV program and a program for intervention within the gay community in Delhi which had been hampered because of the criminalization of gay sex on account of section 377 IPC. <br /><br /><strong>Framing the Challenge</strong><br /><br />The framing of the petition was a challenge in itself.  Indian Superior Courts can strike down a statutory provision on the ground that such provision violates one or more of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution.  On some issues, it was easy to frame the challenge.  There were already precedents in India and internationally that we could and did use to challenge Section 377.  Thus we invoked the Fundamental Right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution (which has been interpreted to also contain the Fundamental Right to privacy, dignity, and health) and the Fundamental Right to equality and non-discrimination contained in Article 14 of our Constitution.  But we also wanted to set new precedents in interpreting our Constitution on some other issues.  We included two such issues.  First, we wanted the concept of personality to be included in the Court's interpretation of Article 19, which establishes such freedoms as speech, association, and assembly.  However, this has not finally been decided by the Delhi High Court in the Naz case.  Second, we wanted the Court to expand the definition of "sex" in its interpretation of the non-discrimination provision contained in Article 15 to include sexual orientation.  I had tried to expand the scope of the meaning of "sex" in Article 15 in other cases but failed.  <br /> <br /><strong>The Lows in the Journey.... </strong><br /><br />Like all journeys, this one has had its share of trials and tribulations, of highs and lows. <br /><br />The AIDS Bhedbhav Andolan group initially criticized me for filing the petition in the Delhi High Court.  I let that slide.  Then we realized that the AIDS Bhedbhav Andolan Petition had already been dismissed.  As such, we could have easily filed the petition in the Bombay High Court after all.  <br /><br />Then Delhi High Court dismissed the petition on technical grounds, stating that Naz did not have the locus standi to file a petition as it was not directly affected.  More importantly, the Review got dismissed in less than 5 minutes.  That was a real low.  <br /><br />The other major low point was marked by divisiveness among the diverse groups that supported the petition.  Some of the groups resented the Naz Foundation's decision to take up the case in the first place, as it was no
t a gay group but rather an HIV support group.  This issue became increasingly pronounced later on in the case.  <br /><br />On the intellectual front, we faced criticism on two issues.  First, our critics felt that the petition should not have raised the privacy issue at all on the basis that such was antithetical to the practice of gay men for whom, according to argument, privacy had no meaning.  On this front, I relied on my good sense and the precedent of the South African Constitutional Court which had rejected precisely this argument.  The second was the criticism by some that the petition was too heavily based on HIV.  Despite these criticisms, I realized that HIV was a key issue and a weak point in the Government armory and that we should exploit it.  This became apparent when the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) filed its affidavit supporting our stand on HIV and decriminalization, thus contradicting the stand of the Home Ministry.  Any lawyer worth his salt will tell you never to give up an argument, especially one rooted in ideological an ideological base.  Ideological bases in law are like tools.  You should use them they way you want to.  I decided to stick to that argument. <br /><br /><strong>... and the Highs </strong> <br /><br />First, my teammates and I were prepared for the long haul.  Issues like these are not for fly by night operators, of whom there are a plenty.  Secondly we were able to train the team in the Collective to go for a win.  Of course you don't win every case, and lawyers must therefore be trained both to bear a loss and also for adulation in case of a win.  But you must fight only to win.  The team also worked very well on the arguments and we were able to produce high quality work.  <br /><br />The other great thing was that throughout the journey we were able to consult the community in the course of each turn we took, such as when we lost in the High Court, when the Supreme decided in our favor, and just before the Court finally agreed to take the case.  In each of these occasions we consulted a wide section of the community.  <br /><br />Also, the Supreme Court's order directing the Delhi High Court to decide the matter on the merits was a great turning point.  Yet another was when NACO filed an affidavit in our favor. <br /><br />Another profound high came when the signature campaign to support the case of decriminalization came through despite the risks attached.  Well-known authors like Amartya Sen and Vikram Seth signed on.  It was at that time that I realized that tide in the public mind was turning in our favor.  <br /><br />The greatest high was undoubtedly the final judgment, especially due to the fact of the Court's acceptance of all of our arguments dealing with the expansion of "sex" in Constitutional interpretation to include sexual orientation.  <br /> <br /><strong>The Impact of the Judgment </strong><br /><br />The Court has the broken the shackles of the criminalization that had gripped LGBT groups for the past 140 years.  A new era has dawned in India.  The judgment merely underscores the real triumph: the dignity and inclusion that we have captured.  The judgment carries with it lessons for other sectors beyond the LGBT community.  India will be richer by this judgment.  It will also make sure that we are able to deliver HIV services without fear.  Furthermore, it will carry repercussions in all parts of the world, particularly the Commonwealth countries which have replicated 377 in their criminal statutes.  <br /><br />The battle has been won.  However, the war is far from over.  Some parties have approached the Supreme Court.  On 20th June, the Supreme Court refused to stay the order and judgment.  That battle has yet to be won.  The ultimate war is for minorities to be treated without discrimination on all counts.  That will be a very long and arduous war. <br /> <br /><strong>Things Have Changed...</strong><br /><br />A lot has changed since the day we started.  When we first started, nobody was prepared to take up the case.  That has largely changed, though not completely.  However, there is a tendency in some quarters to say that gay issues are not a matter that non-gays have a right to enter into.  That is an unfortunate sentiment.  Firstly, if this were so, it is debatable whether this case would have been taken up even in this decade.  Moreover, though there are a lot of gay activists now, and that is partly because of the mobilization in the case, there is still reluctance to be out fully and go to court in one's own name. Secondly it is fundamentally wrong to think that others who are equally concerned with these issues should not be part of the struggle.  Ironically, some of the people who are arguing in this manner were opposed to the fight against 377 in the first place. I think this issue will take some time to resolve, but I hope that people do not become intransigent on this as that will only harm the movement in the long run, and the fight is still far from over.   <br /><br /><em>Anand Grover is the UN Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, a practicing attorney, and the founder of human rights advocacy group the Lawyers Collective.</em><br />

The arrests and convictions of key members of the <span style="font-style:italic;">17 November</span> group in 2002 clearly failed to end the nation's struggle with domestic terrorism.  After the extremist group <span style="font-style:italic;">Revolutionary Fight</span> launched a rocket-propelled grenade at the US Embassy in Greece in 2007, other attacks followed against police stations and a television station, and a car-bomb (that ultimately did not explode) was planted outside a banking group. Finally, last month&#39;s coldblooded murder by the recently formed anarchist <span style="font-style:italic;">Sect of Revolutionaries</span> of an anti-terror squad police officer guarding a key witness to a terrorism case being conducted in central Athens served as a wake-up call to Greek society.  <br /><br />Without a doubt, terrorism constitutes the chief threat faced by modern states, and modern states meet such threats with highly varied and often strict measures.  However, the rest of Europe and the USA tend to deal mainly with international rather than domestic terrorism.  With the exception of Spain, which has focused a great deal of energy on domestic terrorism at the hands of <span style="font-style:italic;">ETA</span> in the Basque region, the danger posed to the Western world emanates largely from organizations considered to be Islamist extremist and Jihadist.  Such organizations tend to use suicide bombings and other violent methods in order to attack the cultural and political identities of Western democracies.  Even countries with long traditions of anarchist and leftist domestic terrorism (such as Italy and Germany), seem today to be enjoying a remission of this type of activity, thus enabling them to focus on the danger of international terrorism.<br /><br />Attacks from extreme leftist and anarchist groups in Greece are a great cause for concern as they appear to be symptomatic of the social and political problems that tend to distinguish Greece from the other European nations in the first place.  Such problems include political scandals, governmental problems, issues surrounding the justice system, general corruption, an ineffective and anachronistic education system, problems regarding citizens' rights, and the national quality of life.<br /><br />The terrorist organizations that carry on the legacy of <span style="font-style:italic;">17 November</span> tend to justify their violent and criminal acts with reference to the same social and political problems that <span style="font-style:italic;">17 November</span> claimed as their alibi 35 years ago.  The only difference to be found is in the rhetoric of the new terrorist groups.  Their messages are conveyed much less eloquently and are lacking in serious ideological arguments.  This could be the result of deliberate efforts to refrain from using complicated manifestos in order to gain audiences beyond their narrow ideological cores.  However, this new rhetorical tactic could also be the result of a widespread disregard for the practice of gaining the public's sympathy.  This latter theory might explain the increasing use of car bombs, restaurant bombings, and other such attacks such as take place in Iraq and Afghanistan that tend to lead to indiscriminate killings and large numbers of casualties.  It seems that the new terrorist organizations have no qualms about attacking everywhere and whenever without hesitation as to the number and identity of their victims.<br /><br />While Greece has undertaken special police operations and begun to enforce new measures to face the present terrorist danger, its counterterrorism strategy should not be exclusively directed towards arresting members of terrorist organizations.  Law enforcement and intelligence authorities ought also to adopt security measures that will prevent new attacks.  Anti-terrorism policy should not, however, threaten basic rights and freedoms.  The best counter-terrorism strategy a state can institute is one that respects its citizens.<br /><br /><br /><em>Dr. Maria Alvanou is a Greek defense lawyer and Professor of Criminology at the Hellenic Police Officers Academy</em><br />

Madigan</em>, the Seventh Circuit lifted a permanent injunction that had prevented enforcement of Illinois' parental notice for abortion law since its enactment in 1995.  The decision hinged on an arcane question of state procedural law, and the opinion did not break new legal ground on the abortion issue.  What is noteworthy about the decision, then, is precisely what for many might seem mundane: Illinois will now join the ranks of 34 other states in enforcing some kind of parental involvement requirement before a teenager can obtain an abortion.  The court emphasized the unexceptional nature of its decision, noting that "[m]any, if not all of the concerns first raised against parental involvement laws in the 1970s and early 1980s have been addressed" in laws like Illinois'.<br /><br />This soothing language, however, obscures the fact that a substantial majority of states blithely impose what are in reality irrational laws that impose appalling burdens on the teenagers who are least able to consult with their parents about their pregnancies.  States continue to enforce these restrictions despite evidence that they do not serve their intended purpose, and are unnecessary for most teens and downright dangerous for others.  It is worth a pause to reflect on these laws that now seem scarcely to merit a yawn from the courts.<br /><br />On their face parental involvement laws appear intended to keep parents informed and to ensure minors' wellbeing.  But let's remember that the main proponents of parental involvement laws oppose abortion altogether.  Their ultimate goal is not to improve familial communication but to eliminate abortion as an option for all women.  A strategy memo written by anti-abortion-rights movement leaders James Bopp, Jr., and Richard E. Coleson, for example, encourages the passage of "parental involvement" laws, among other "incremental" restrictions on abortion.  They argue that such laws "keep the abortion issue alive and . . . also translate into more disfavor for all abortions, which in turn reduces abortions."<br /><br />Parents understandably want to be involved in their minor children's important life decisions, but this desire has not translated to parental involvement requirements for other sensitive medical decisions that minors make.  Most states recognize that mandating parental involvement for sensitive medical treatment will have the hazardous drawback of deterring many minors from seeking care at all.  As the Guttmacher Institute reports, "The legal ability of minors to consent to a range of sensitive health care services &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; including sexual and reproductive health care, mental health services and alcohol and drug abuse treatment &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; has expanded dramatically over the past 30 years."  Minors in most states can consent to services such as contraception, prenatal care, and treatment for sexually transmitted infection.  In many states, minors can even relinquish their children for adoption and consent to medical care for their children.  Parental involvement laws for abortion stand out as the glaring antithesis to this trend.<br /><br />Studies have shown that most pregnant teens voluntarily involve their parents in their abortion decisions.  Even in the absence of a parental involvement law, about six in ten teens consult at least one parent before seeking an abortion. Teens who avoid telling their parents often have compelling reasons for doing so.  Teenagers may suffer abuse when their parents discover they are pregnant; other teens are thrown out of the house.  Some parents actively prevent their children from obtaining an abortion.  Some minors function as the <em>de facto</em> adult in dysfunctional homes where the custodial parent is largely absent.  Because of the dangers that minors can confront when forced against their own judgment to involve their parents, most major medical groups, including the AMA and the American Academy of Pediatrics, oppose mandating parental involvement for abortion. <br /><br />The Supreme Court has held that teenage girls, like adult women, have a constitutional right to determine the fate of their pregnancy.  Thus, while states can require parental consent or notice for abortion, the Court requires that they provide some alternative for teens who do not wish to consult their parents.  The alternative that has become standard is the judicial bypass.  The judicial bypass allows a teenager to seek permission from a court rather than involve her parents in her decision.  Not surprisingly, this option holds many perils for a pregnant teenager.  Teens must navigate the process of a court hearing.  They must find the time, often during school hours, to appear in court before an imposing stranger to discuss this most intimate of issues.  Although the Supreme Court has required that the process be confidential, in practice it can be difficult for teens to keep their presence secret.  In small towns, they may know the court personnel.  In one instance, a teen waiting in the hallway for her hearing encountered her sister's entire class, which had come to the courthouse on a field trip.<br /><br />Ironically, properly functioning bypass systems demonstrate the irrationality of requiring court waivers in the first place. When bypass processes work as envisioned, the vast majorities of minors' petitions are granted.  This is because the law requires that judges must grant a waiver of parental involvement if a minor is either mature enough to consent on her own or if an abortion without notice would be in her best interests. The vast majority of minors fall into one of these two categories. For example, one study in Massachusetts showed that out of 477 petitions, only one minor was denied a waiver. Indeed, a report by the AMA found that minors' decision making process on abortion is comparable to that of adults aged 22-25. Thus, when bypasses work correctly, they ensure nothing more than that minors needlessly parade through courtrooms in order to be granted the right to do what they can already do for a host of other sensitive medical treatments: provide their own consent.<br /><br />On the other hand, bypass processes often don't work.  Helena Silverstein's book, <em>Girls on the Stand: How Courts Fail Pregnant Minors</em>, documents the myriad ways in which the bypass process can fail.  Court personnel are often misinformed about the procedures.  Some judges ignore confidentiality requirements.  Other judges, ideologically opposed to abortion, refuse to hear bypass petitions, or they conduct hearings but then lecture teens about their immorality and routinely deny waivers.   In these all too frequent circumstances, the "bypass" becomes a roadblock.  While minors facing such roadblocks can try to seek an abortion in another state, not all will be able to do so.  As the Guttmacher Institute points out, "[t]o travel out of state, a minor must have access to transportation and must be within a reasonable distance of a state with less restrictive laws. The degree to which minors exercise this option varies by age, socio-economic status and access to public transportation."<br /><br />The <em>Zbaraz</em> court conceded that the bypass process may be "intimidating" and may pose "practical proble
ms" for many minors.  However, the court demurred, "[W]e fail to see a better alternative."  This is a cop-out.  The court may have felt compelled to follow precedent, but it should not pretend that precedent dictated a good outcome.  Healthcare providers should always strongly encourage teens to involve their parents in their abortion decisions.  But laws like the one that will now be enforced in Illinois do nothing to help teenagers, while imposing traumatic hurdles, and sometimes grave danger, on those who lack loving and supportive parents to whom they can turn.<br />     <br /><br /><em>Caitlin Borgmann is a professor at CUNY School of Law and editor of the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/reproductive_rights/">Reproductive Rights Prof Blog</a> </em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://lawschool.unm.edu/faculty/gomez/index.php">Laura G&amp;oacute;mez</a> of the University of New Mexico School of Law says that although Senators Graham and Sessions were technically right about the political consequences that would befall them if they had said anything along the lines of the &quot;wise Latina&quot; remark Judge Sonia Sotomayor made in a 2001 speech at UCLA, they fail to appreciate how her roots in a traditionally excluded community make that &quot;rhetorical flourish&quot; appropriate and even inspirational coming from her...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/lauragomez.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->S<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->enators Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama) both asserted during their questioning of Judge Sonia Sotomayor that, if they&#39;d made the reverse statement she made about a wise Latina judge about white male judges, it would have been a career-ender for them. As Graham put in a rhetorical question to Obama's first Supreme Court nominee, "Do you understand ma'am that if I had said anything like that, they would have had my head?" <br /><br />Graham's right, but his claim misses the boat by treating two things that are different the same. Saying that a Latina judge might sometimes reach a better conclusion than a white male judge is not equivalent to saying the same thing about white male judges. Individual claims of "reverse racism" such as this ignore the larger context that has made racism so pernicious in American society. We do not live in country that has historically discriminated against white men. Rather, we live in a nation where legalized discrimination against women of all races, African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans and others characterized much of this nation's first two centuries. <br /><br />The legal system, including the Supreme Court, played a key role in perpetuating discrimination against non-whites and women of all races who were not allowed to exercise the fundamental indicia of citizenship -- the right to vote (and, in the case of African American men after the Civil War Amendments to the Constitution, the ability to vote after the technical right was granted via mechanisms like the poll tax, literacy tests and the all-white primary) and the right to judge one's fellow citizens as a juror. Mexican Americans, 115,000 of whom became U.S. citizens in 1846 with the end of the war against Mexico, were widely discriminated against as jurors in the Southwest until 1954, when (during the same term it decided <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>) the Supreme Court concluded such discrimination against them violated the Fourteenth Amendment in a cased called <em>Hernandez v. Texas</em>. As late as 1961, the Supreme Court allowed states to openly discriminate against female jurors (<em>Hoyt v. Florida</em>).<br /><br />Although we deride jury service as something to avoid today, traditionally the role of juror was an important counter-weight to the judge. Jurors are lay-judges who play a unique role in the Anglo-American judicial system. There was good reason for advocates of white supremacy (and those state and local governments controlled by them) to fight so long and hard to prevent empowering people of color and white women to sit in judgment of white men, whether defendants in civil or criminal cases.<br /><br />Historically, women were incapable of becoming judges because they could not first become lawyers. The Supreme Court upheld state laws that banned women from obtaining law licenses in 1871 (<em>Bradwell v. Illinois</em>) and again in 1894 (In re Lockwood). It was not by accident that all judges were at one time white males; it was by systematic design.<br /><br />Even after the removal of formal bars to white women and people of color becoming judges, stereotypes and popular images portrayed judging as the domain of elderly white men (close your eyes and picture a wise judge). Cultural images of judging have changed dramatically in the past 20 years; consider that we have seen way more women of color on the bench on shows like "Law and Order" than exist in real-life. But stereotypes and cultural norms change slowly. Hispanic women are much more commonly portrayed in television shows and movies as either lascivious sexual objects or domestic workers, or both (see Jennifer Lopez in "Maid in Manhattan").<br /> <br />Sotomayor is doubly implicated in this sad American history as both a woman and a Puerto Rican. So I take her at her word when she said during her confirmation hearings that her wise Latina comment was "a rhetorical flourish" meant to inspire Hispanic law students and young lawyers to consider careers in the judiciary. Precisely because of the historical exclusion of people like them from judgeships, she was eager to let them know they could bring something unique and important to the bench.<br /><br />In response to Sessions, she added, "I do believe that every person has an equal opportunity to be a good and wise judge, regardless of their background or life experience." This was an implicit nod to the discriminatory history I've outlined, even if she was unwilling to make the argument outright. More than anything, Sotomayor was making the point that even Latinas can be judges &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; sometimes even wise ones. <br />     <br /><br /><em>Laura G&amp;oacute;mez teaches law at the University of New Mexico and is the author of </em>Manifest Destinies: The Making of the Mexican American Race<em></em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ekaterina Porras Sivolobova, legal intern at the <a href="http://www.cejil.org/main.cfm?switch=i">Center for Justice and International Law</a> in Buenos Aires, Argentina, writes about the military justice system in Chile....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/alex-lemun_6_11_2007-732963.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:4 4 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 260px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/alex-lemun_6_11_2007-732961.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><font size="3"><strong>S</strong></font>ince Chile emerged as a democratic state in 1990, it has done very little to reform its military justice system to comply with international human rights standards. The military justice system in Chile denies its citizens due process rights and is inconsistent with basic international human rights principles. Military justice in Chile is essentially governed by the Code of Military Justice, which among other things establishes the scope of military jurisdiction. Since the Pinochet dictatorship, Article 3 and 5 of the Code of Military Justice have extended the reach of military jurisdiction to cover both civilians who commit crimes conceived as military crimes and military officials who commit common crimes.  <br /> <br />The Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled on November 22, 2005, in the case of <u>Palamara Iribarne vs. Chile</u>, that military jurisdiction in Chile must be limited solely to crimes committed by military personnel in active service. The Court not only ruled that Chile must eliminate the application of military jurisdiction to civilians and inactive military personnel, but that Chile must guarantee due process of law and that court members must be competent, impartial, and independent.  However, four years after this binding decision by the Inter-American Court for Human Rights, Chile has yet to comply with any of the rulings.<br /><br />Chile has also failed to respect basic rights established in the American Convention of Human Rights (the Convention), and in particular, has failed to respect and uphold Article 8 (right to a fair trial) of the Convention. Article 8.1 of the Convention guarantees that every person will be heard by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal.  However, a large number of the officials who work as prosecutors or judges in Chile&#39;s military tribunals do not even have a legal background, which brings their competency into question.  In addition, the tribunals are comprised of active military officials subject to the hierarchical structure of the armed forces.  As active members of the military, these military officials have the duty to obey higher ranking officers, and are subject to disciplinary measures and reports, making them unable to guarantee an impartial and independent decision to their colleagues. <br /><br />Procedure in military tribunals also undermines the rights of the accused.  Chilean military proceedings require the indictment to be kept secret, contrary to Article 8.5 of the Convention, which states that the &quot;criminal proceedings shall be public.&quot;  Under Article 130, the accused is not able to know the charges brought against him or her and does not have access to the investigations for the first 60 days. Since the file and investigations are kept secret, the accused does not have the adequate time nor means for preparation of his or her defense (Article 8.2 of the Convention).  Furthermore, the accused is unable to examine witnesses as required by Article 8.2(f).<br /><br />In order to address the injustices in the system, a reform to the Code of Military Justice must be made.  In particular, it is essential to limit the jurisdiction of military courts so that under no circumstance will civilians be tried in the military system. Furthermore, the system should establish and guarantee that fair trials will be conducted in cases where carabineros (uniformed police) have committed human rights abuses.  <br /><br />Although civilians under military jurisdiction face harsh trials and are not afforded sufficient due process rights, carabineros tried for excessive and unnecessary use of force against the indigenous Mapuche community in southern Chile are not sufficiently nor justly prosecuted in military trials. The investigations covering these abuses often fail to bring forth and question all possible witnesses, fail to recover or examine all facts, and fail to exhaust all possible means to reach an impartial truth and objectively appreciating all evidence.  The results of these investigations usually amount to nothing more than a disciplinary measure towards the carabinero.For example, a carabinero shot Alex Lem&uacute;n (age 17) while he was accompanying a group of Mapuches in an effort to reclaim their ancestors&#39; land. At the end of May 2009, a military judge declared a stay of proceedings, setting free the caribenero who was responsible for his death. Since Chile has decided to close the case and fails to acknowledge any form of responsibility towards the death of Alex Lem&uacute;n, the case has been submitted to the Inter-American Commission with the hope that Chile will finally admit responsibility for Lem&uacute;n&#39;s wrongful death.<br /><br />However, a more recent decision demonstrates that Chile may be ready to be more objective in its military trials of carabineros. Matias Catrileo was shot by a carabinero under the same circumstances as Alex Lem&uacute;n. Thus, when the military tribunal made its decision at the end of June 2009, a similar ruling was expected. However, the tribunal ruled for the prosecution, holding that the carabinero used unnecessary force resulting in the wrongful death of Matias Catrileo. This decision can be viewed as a historical outcome since it acknowledges the abuse against the indigenous Mapuches in the hands of the carabineros. It remains to be seen whether the decision regarding the death of Catrileo was an aberration or whether it signifies a new development for Chilean military tribunals, at least in cases involving severe human rights abuses by carabineros.<br /><br />Four long years after the Palamara judgment by the Inter-American Court, the Chilean military justice system still has standards which contradict international human rights principles.  Chile must reform the Code of Military Justice, to limit the military jurisdiction strictly to military crimes by military officials and to promote and establish responsibility for the crimes committed by the carabineros against the Mapuche community.  For the military justice system to be compatible with international human rights standards, it is essential that Chile adapts its domestic military standards to international human rights norms pursuant especially to Article 8 of the American Convention of Human Rights. With the case of Alex Lem&uacute;n pending before the Inter-American Commission and the recent developments in the case of Matias Catrileo, perhaps Chile will take positive steps to adopt international human rights standards and comply with the Palamara judgment.<br /><br />In order to address the injustices in the system, a reform to the Code of Military Justice must be made.  In particular, it is essential to limit the jurisdiction of military courts so that under no circumstance will civilians be tried in the military system. Furthermore, the system should establish and guarantee that fair trials will be conducted in cases where carabineros (uniformed police) have committed human rights abuses.  <br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt" size="2">Sources: <br />Inter-American Court of Human Rights. <u>Palamara Iribarne v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/clarealgar">Clare Algar</a></strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.reprieve.org/">Reprieve</a>]: &quot;It is really extraordinary that the British government is relying on the Data Protection Act to avoid disclosing the identities of those in whose <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/rights-group-suing-uk-government-over.php">renditions</a> it was complicit.  Imagine, if you will, a kidnapper who admits to a kidnap but refuses to identify the victim of the kidnap.  The position is ludicrous.  It is just not good enough for our Defence Secretary, having repeatedly said that British troops were not involved in any rendition process, to say that in fact, British forces did hand over 2 men to US forces in 2004, who were then rendered to Bagram, who remain in Bagram today, but whose identity he will not disclose. <br /><br />I believe that, eventually, our government will be forced to disclose the names of the two individuals illegally rendered to Bagram with UK complicity. Once this happens, Reprieve will be able to obtain authorisation to act for these men from their family members and reunite them with the rule of law.<br /><br />It looks as though Guant&aacute;namo Bay will close, although whether it closes to deadline remains to be seen.  Bagram is Guantanamo&#39;s lesser known twin &#8212; it has recently been expanded to hold 1,600 people, rather than its previous 600.  Conditions in Bagram are worse than in Guantanamo and there is incredibly limited access to legal representation.  The information we are currently demanding from the British government will allow us to represent the two men in question and thus begin to bring the rule of law to Bagram.  This will in fact make our troops in Afghanistan safer, as it will mean that the West is less likely to be perceived to be behaving unjustly, and is a crucial task if democracy and stability is to be brought to the country.&quot;<br />

		<title>Afghanistan&#039;s Shia Personal Status Law treats women as second-class citizens</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.farzanahassan.com/"><strong>Farzana Hassan</strong></a> [Communications Director, <a href="http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/">Muslim Canadian Congress</a>]: &quot;Afghan president Hamid Karzai has obviously capitulated to the conservative Shia clergy in signing the contentious Shia Law of Personal Status that severely <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/amended-afghanistan-personal-status-law.php">curtails the rights</a> of Shia Muslim women. The law grants a husband the right to withdraw material support to his wife by even denying her food if she refuses to comply with his sexual demands. It also severely limits the rights of Afghan Shia women on matters of custody, as well as in seeking redress for marital rape. <br />  <br />That marital rape is not recognized under Sharia law as a crime is rooted in the concept of the &quot;nikah&quot; or the Islamic marriage contract. The concept stems from the patriarchal belief in sex for maintenance.  A woman, under strict Sharia law is hence seen as being in violation of her chief obligation towards her husband.  The view that sex is an expression and consequence of love is totally alien to this way of thinking. <br />  <br />In the case of the Afghan law however, there also appears to be a mixing of Afghan customary practice in the law, as there is little sanction in the Shia view for coercion in marriage, exemplified by the life of Fatima as a wife, wherein she undertook work outside her home, indeed for community and political issues. Moerover, the Nahjul Balagha (codified utterances of Imam Ali) refer to coercion being highly unfavourable in the martital relationship.<br /><br />Be that as it may, it is well nigh impossible to expect that Sharia law will come to embrace modern concepts of love and marriage unless there is a fundamental shift in the thinking of clergy on this issue.  As it stands, the contentious Shia application of domestic religious law will not yield the desired result of recognizing women as equal partners in a marriage contract. <br />  <br />The answer to such quandaries is therefore, the enactment of laws based on secular principles. Religious law has historically discriminated against women in stipulating unequal and unjust domestic practices. Islamic countries including Afghanistan must look into separating religion from politics in the public domain, so that human rights violations meet proper redress within the legal framework of a country. <br />  <br />Although the Shiite law affects only ten to twenty percent of the Afghan population, it is setting a very dangerous precedent for other Islamic societies where Shia law might prevail. Additionally, similar laws may come to be enacted in some Sunni communities as well. <br />  <br />Women must be treated as equal citizens in a given Islamic country. As a preeminent guiding principle, a law must not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, class or gender. Afghan women are rightly concerned about the enactment of the Shia Law of Personal Status. Their protests should be heeded rather than brutally silenced by Afghan authorities. Moreover, Afghan women have every right to question the fairness of the law and to hold Mr. Karzai to his words of bringing the law at par with international human rights standards.&quot;<br />

		<title>Ninth Circuit ruling to reinstate Roadless Rule leaves wilderness areas vulnerable to fire</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sosforests.com/?page_id=634"><strong>Mike Dubrasich</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://westinstenv.org/">Western Institute for Study of the Environment</a>]: &quot;On August 5th the San Francisco based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals set aside the State Petitions Rule and <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/ninth-circuit-prohibits-construction.php">reinstated</a> the Roadless Area Conservation Rule, more commonly known as the &quot;Clinton/Dombeck Roadless Rule.&quot; <br /><br />The Ninth Circuit Court, the most overturned court in the United States, has once again overstepped its authority, written law from the bench, and engendered massive environmental destruction across nearly 60 million acres of federal land in the West.<br /><br />Background: the Clinton (Dombeck) Roadless Rule was rushed through (by proclamation) in the waning days of that administration. It was immediately litigated in more than a dozen courts. In 2003, Judge Brimmer, a United States District Court Judge for the District of Wyoming, found, in response to the complaint filed by the State of Wyoming, that NEPA had been violated on several different levels, including the fact that Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) input from the states had been excluded, the process had been rushed, the United States Forest Service (USFS) had failed to take the requisite &quot;hard look&quot; at the proposed rule, and that the NEPA process was a sham in order to adopt a political rule. Judge Brimmer also found that the Roadless Rule violated the <a href="http://www.wilderness.net/NWPS/documents//publiclaws/PDF/16_USC_1131-1136.pdf">Wilderness Act</a> [PDF file] in that it designated 58.5 million acres as defacto wilderness despite the fact that only Congress has the authority to do so. Judge Brimmer enjoined the Clinton/Dombeck Roadless Rule. The USFS developed an alternative plan, called the State Petitions procedure, ensuring that not only would state concerns be addressed, but that tribes, local governments, and the general public would be able to participate in the NEPA process.<br /><br />The usual environmental groups sued in the Ninth District Court and, in 2006, Magistrate Laporte concluded that the State Petitions procedure violated NEPA because it was not accompanied by an EIS. In the strangest twist of legal logic, she then reinstated the enjoined Clinton/Dombeck Roadless Rule, and ordered that the USFS comply with its terms.<br /><br />Wyoming again filed suit in an attempt to fix the mess created by Magistrate Laporte&#39;s decision. In August 2008, Judge Brimmer issued yet another permanent national injunction against the Clinton/Dombeck Roadless Rule. Then (judicial ping pong) on Aug 5, 2009, the Ninth Circuit Court affirmed Laporte&#39;s ruling and reinstated the defective and repeatedly enjoined Clinton/Dombeck Roadless Rule.<br /><br />That is an abuse of discretion, despite the Ninth Circuit Court&#39;s claim to the contrary. It may be within the power of the Ninth Circuit Court to throw out the the State Petitions Rule for violating NEPA, but it is not within their power to reinstate the Clinton/Dombeck Roadless Rule, which has itself been found to violate NEPA. The remedy to the defective State Petitions Rule cannot be another defective rule found to be illegal by another court. <br /><br />The Ninth Circuit Court did not consider the merits (or demerits) of the Clinton/Dombeck Roadless Rule. The Ninth Court, like Magistrate Laporte, blamed the USFS for setting aside the Clinton/Dombeck Roadless Rule, when in fact the Tenth District Court had enjoined it. Judge Brimmer is the only federal judge that has reviewed the administrative record related to the Clinton/Dombeck Roadless Rule. Magistrate Laporte has never reviewed the Roadless Rule&#39;s administrative record because it was never before her. Neither has the Ninth Circuit Court.<br /><br />The effect of the Ninth Circuit Court decision is to disable the efforts of states to participate in the roadless area process. That was a key failing of the Clinton/Dombeck Roadless Rule. Dombeck pushed through the last-second Roadless Rule without consulting the states. The State Petitions Rule was an effort to involve the states. Since establishment of the State Petitions Rule, many states, such as Idaho and Wyoming, did invite public participation and developed (or are developing) their own roadless area plans in cooperation with the USFS. Those plans are now condemned to legal limbo, and the public involvement was for nought. <br /><br />The various plaintiffs are now asking the Obama Administration to reinstate the Clinton/Dombeck Roadless Rule. If, however, the Obama Administration replicates the illegitimate actions of the Clinton Administration, those actions will also be illegitimate.<br /><br />Equally disturbing is the insistence by the Ninth Circuit Court and the plaintiffs that roadless designation somehow &quot;protects&quot; resources and the environment when the evidence is overwhelming that it does not. Roadless designation, like wilderness designation is a defacto order tp &quot;let it burn.&quot; Without a road network, fire suppression is complicated and compromised. Roadless designation not only leads to megafires, the lack of access precludes stewardship actions that could prevent or mitigate insect infestations. Environmental devastation by insects and fire is not conservation. Roadless designation is not environmentally protective and does not maintain ecosystems and endangered species. In fact, just the opposite - roadless designation leads to huge environmental disasters.<br /><br />The 9th Circuit Court has endangered our forests, our environment, and our communities and economy with their misguided and illegitimate decision.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.wtplaw.com/attorney.cfm?id=214"><strong>Joseph Morales</strong></a> [President, <a href="http://marylandhispanicbar.com/">Maryland Hispanic Bar Association</a>]: &quot;On his remarks congratulating newly appointed Justice Sonia Sotomayor to the United States Supreme Court, President Obama explained that her <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/senate-confirms-sotomayor-for-supreme.php">confirmation</a> was incredibly important for our Nation because it has sent the message to many of our children that nothing is out of reach if you work hard. The President said children around the country will now think &quot;if Sotomayor can do it, so can I.&quot;  The truth in the President&#39;s remarks cannot be challenged.  <br /> <br />It is indeed a special time in the history of our country.  With Justice Sonia Sotomayor as a role model we cannot do less but aspire to our own success striving always toward excellence.  Among the turmoil of a financial crisis and military operations in two separate theaters, we can stop for a moment, ponder her Senate confirmation, and see America for what it is: a land where the strength of your character and your work ethic can help you reach the highest of goals and make a difference.<br /> <br />It is not just the inspiration Justice Sotomayor provides to our citizens, born out of her rise from humble beginnings in New York to the highest Court in the country, that makes this a special moment for America.  The selection of a United States Supreme Court justice is not a regular occurrence.  There have only been 111 individuals appointed to the high court (only three women, two African-American, and now one Latina).  In average, each president may appoint two or at most three justices to the Court.  As a result, only the best qualified make it to the President&#39;s &quot;short list&quot; and, of those, only the best make it through the appointment process.   This is particularly the case in the last decade when the appointments to the Court have become increasingly scrutinized by both parties for political reasons.  <br /> <br />No one should doubt that Judge Sotomayor is exceptionally well-qualified to sit on the Supreme Court as Associate Justice. She has been both assistant district attorney and a corporate litigator. President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and President Bill Clinton in 1998 found her legal qualifications unparalleled &#8212; the former nominated her to the federal district court, and the latter to the federal appeals court. On the US District Court, Southern District of New York, she presided over some 450 cases. As an appellate judge for the Second Circuit, she participated in more than 3,000 decisions and authored 380 opinions.  It is telling that during her confirmation hearings, her critics focused not on her performance on the bench but on a few sentences taken out of context and made outside her role as a judge.<br /> <br />For the Hispanic/Latino community it is a particularly proud moment in the history of the United States.  Justice Sotomayor&#39;s appointment has opened a new window through which America can view the immense contributions the Latino community makes to the country and the world every day.  The confirmation process was a refreshing and invigorating one for our community.  For a moment, the discussion shifted from the apparent burden of illegal immigration to the many contributions we, as Latinos, make.  The Country had the opportunity to hear not just from Justice Sotomayor but from many of our leaders in every sphere of society - individuals who have also risen to the highest levels in their own professions.  From this historic moment on, we are certain, the number of qualified and prepared Latinos taking leadership roles in government, academia and in the higher echelons in business will continue to increase for the benefit of the entire nation.&quot;<br />

		<title>The cynical global response to Aung San Suu Kyi&#039;s trial leaves Burmese people to face junta alone</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ratchasima.net/"><strong>Awzar Thi</strong></a> [member, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>, Hong Kong]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/myanmar-court-finds-suu-kyi-guilty-of.php">verdict</a> handed down against Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her co-accused in Burma this week surprised no one. The trial was throughout <a href="/hotline/2009/06/in-burma-politics-rather-than-law-will.php">political, not legal</a> in character. The only real question has been what, if anything, anyone else will do about it.  <br /><br />A chorus of angry statements from across the world quickly followed the end of the trial. Most of these were probably prepared weeks before, given that the final date for the judgment was delayed several times. In those weeks of angry statements smouldering on desks, waiting for the final details to be inserted, nobody did anything. Now that the trial is over, there is little evidence that they will either. The matter is being put to the UN Security Council, and it will most likely end there. A few countries may tinker with ineffectual trade embargoes and leave it at that. The sound and fury will go on for a while and then fade away, like it did following the protests of 2007 and the cyclone of the year after. Detailed <a href="http://www.article2.org/pdf/v07n03.pdf">reports</a> [PDF file] of groups like the <a href="http://www.alrc.net/">Asian Legal Resource Centre</a> on the farcical cases against detained demonstrators, much like that launched against Suu Kyi, have not made news. Agencies involved in the cyclone recovery effort are having trouble to raise even a quarter of the money that they have sought to continue their work in the next two or three years, although the amount is miniscule in comparison to what was given for the Indian Ocean tsunami recovery effort over three years before.  <br /><br /><a href="/hotline/2009/08/burmese-juntas-continued-persecution-of.php">Some commentators</a> have pointed to noises coming from the <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a> as a cause for hope, but that body consists of people who are experts at discharging smokescreens to confuse and demoralize others. There is no reason to think that they will do differently now. The plans to establish a powerless and pointless regional human rights institution illustrate well how the association works to create appearances that are contrary to reality. While not more than one or two countries in the grouping have rights bodies that are in fact operating to protect human rights, the association has gone along with the fraud that it can establish one encompassing all ten members, including Burma. And the irony of Thailand&#39;s foreign minister raising questions about the neighbour&#39;s planned 2010 election, which nobody ever seriously expected to be conducted fairly or democratically anyway, will not be lost on people familiar with events in his country over the last year; he was part of an army-backed scheme to hijack power through political manipulating of a pliant judiciary and an undemocratic constitution.  <br /><br />Meanwhile, talk among Burma&#39;s activists is increasingly not about what the international community can do for them but what they can do for themselves. Time and again they have seen the United Nations and other supposed allies demonstrating only reluctance or impotence in dealings with the junta. Change in their debates and thinking could lead to new strategies to break the political impasse, but if these attempts fail then they also risk causing even more people to give up and disengage. Most folks in Burma have already done just that, not because they don&#39;t care but because they are consistently pushed into corners from which they can do little without endangering themselves and their loved ones. As a result, domestic outrage at the verdict, in contrast to that of foreign leaders and their spokespersons, is muted, shapeless and deep. Sporadic protests and gatherings of a few committed supporters will continue, but until another tipping point is reached and thousands can again take to the streets in the safety of numbers, people will stay at home and try not to think too much about the woman who once represented a hope for the future but who today is another pathetic example of how brute force and mediocrity have again won the day over talent and integrity in Burma.&quot;<br />

		<title>Burmese junta&#039;s continued persecution of Aung San Suu Kyi signals failure of global engagement</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://businessandeconomics.mq.edu.au/contact_the_faculty/staff/alphabetical_list_of_staff/sean_turnell"><strong>Sean Turnell</strong></a> [Associate Professor, <a href="http://www.mq.edu.au/">Macquarie University</a>]: &quot;The conviction and sentencing of democracy icon, Aung San Suu Kyi, on absurd charges in a farcical &#39;trial&#39; has rightly outraged the world. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/myanmar-court-finds-suu-kyi-guilty-of.php">sentence</a>, of an 18 month extension to her (already manifestly unjust) house arrest is part of a crude effort by Burma&#39;s military junta to ensure that she is unable to take part in &#39;elections&#39; they are organising for next year. Of course, suspicion that these elections would be anything except free and fair are now all but confirmed by this sentencing travesty.<br /><br />Converting the expressions of international outrage into action is clearly the next challenge. The United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and a number of other countries already impose sanctions on Burma, but hitherto these have been rendered less effective by the &#39;engagement&#39; policies of Burma&#39;s neighbours in the <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a> (ASEAN), and of India and China. Pleasingly, however, ASEAN countries have thus far responded with scarcely less disappointment than elsewhere to this latest demonstration of bad faith by Burma&#39;s leaders, and there are grounds for hope that at last a more decisive approach may emerge from the grouping.<br /><br />Less pleasing are the actions of China. The great protector of Burma&#39;s regime in the UN Security Council and elsewhere, the principal supplier to the same of arms and other military equipment, and the prime beneficiary of the rapacious scouring of Burma&#39;s forests and other natural resources, China&#39;s role in Burma is almost completely irresponsible and destructive. For China, the relationship is truly &#39;all about&#39; commercial and strategic advantage, but it is a relationship that bears too little scrutiny. Contrary to belief, China is susceptible to international pressure (it has bigger fish to fry than Burma), and is not invulnerable to international pressure to play a more responsible role. Let this pressure begin now.<br /><br />There are a number of lessons to be learned from these latest events in Burma, but surely one of the most important is that policies of engagement, as if Burma&#39;s isolation is imposed by others, is a dead end. There has not been an occasion in recent times when the international community, but especially the USA under President Obama, has held out a more inviting hand. These efforts, as well as those of the UN and others, have been rebuffed. Burma&#39;s regime is not interested in international engagement beyond that which entrenches its rule. This is why it controls the economy so tightly, but especially those sectors (energy particularly) that are most connected to the international economy. Engaging Burma on its own terms will not create an alternative loci of power entrenched in a distinct business class - but simply fortify economically and financially a class in military uniform.<br /><br />Finally, there was a time when non-democratic countries were perceived as possessing economic advantage. Burma is a poster child for the prosecution against this proposition, as the military regime that has ruled the country for nearly fifty years has reduced this once prosperous country (&#39;the rice bowl of Asia&#39;) into pauperism. It is Burma&#39;s military regime that is responsible for the country&#39;s poverty, and it will only be its ending that will return to the people of Burma any measure of economic security.<br /><br />The conviction of Aung San Suu Kyi, growing ties with North Korea, an endless stream of irrational policies that have destroyed the economy - all from a regime guilty otherwise of human rights abuses on a massive scale, of ethnic cleansing campaigns that have razed more villages than Darfur, of the widespread use of rape against ethnic minorities, and of ecological vandalism of an epic dimension. Enough. The international community must do all that it can to free Burma, not just Aung San Suu Kyi or John Yettaw, from a regime for whom the dustbin of history urgently beckons.&quot;<br />

		<title>Proposed Russian bill paves the way for continued aggression against neighbors</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.hudson.org/learn/index.cfm?fuseaction=staff_bio&eid=sattdavi"><strong>David Satter</strong></a> [Senior Fellow, <a href="http://www.hudson.org/">Hudson Institute</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/russia-president-proposes-bill-to.php">proposed law</a> allowing Russian troops to intervene beyond Russia&#39;s borders is meant merely to provide legal cover for possible future Russian aggression. The law, which presumably will be adopted, declares as &quot;legal&quot; what was already done in the case of the Russian invasion of Georgia last August. <br /><br />The principal point of the new law is that under its terms, Russia can intervene to protect &quot;Russian citizens&quot; abroad. Since, as the South Ossetian and Abkhazian experience shows, Russia is prepared to hand out passports to foreign citizens and, in the process, make them &quot;its&quot; citizens, the law does not limit the authorities&#39; war making prerogatives in any way. If it has significance, it is in assuring the Russian military, in the case of any new adventures, that they can count on political support. <br /><br />In June, 2005, the State Duma passed a law allowing the president to authorize attacks by the FSB on &quot;terrorists&quot; in foreign countries. This may have emboldened them to carry out the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6163502.stm">murder of Alexander Litvinenko</a> in London six months later. The Russian intelligence services did not need a law to attack persons they regarded as terrorists abroad. On February 13, 2004, the former Chechen president, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev was killed and his 12 year old son seriously injured when a bomb attached  by Russian agents ripped apart their SUV. The new law, however, gave a seal of legitimacy to such operations and guaranteed that those who carried them out would not be disowned or forgotten in the event of failure. The proposed law on foreign intervention is likely to work in a similar manner.&quot;<br />

This pressure can only be a good thing and will serve to inform the future practice of extraordinary rendition internationally.<br /><br />The implications of this trial will only truly be felt following the verdict, but we can safely predict that the process of rendition, of incarceration without charge and of torture will be brought under sharp review. It is of specific interest to us at Atlantic Community to monitor how it may affect the transatlantic relationship and with that in mind the embarrassment that this case is set to cause for Washington. We would like to generally commend Reprieve for the work that they are doing in regards to keeping this issue alive and we eagerly anticipate the outcome of the trial.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Christina Hill</strong> [Mining Advocacy Coordinator, <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.au/">Oxfam Australia</a>]: &quot;It has been reported that local communities in the Indonesian province of West Papua have filed a $30 billion lawsuit against the local subsidiary of US mining company Freeport-McRoRan Copper &amp; Gold - operator of the giant Grasberg mine.  The company is being sued for environmental and human rights violations.  As <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/ninth-circuit-prohibits-construction.php">reported by the JURIST</a>, Freeport has been a frequent target of environmental and human rights groups who allege human rights abuse and environmental damage.  <br /> <br />Back in 2006, Freeport was excluded from the $300 billion Norwegian Government Pension Fund&#39;s investment portfolio on ethical grounds.  Freeport&#39;s mining activities at Grasberg were <a href="http://www.regjeringen.no/pages/1956975/F%20Recommendation%20Final.pdf">found</a> [PDF file] to &quot;involve an unacceptable risk of complicity in severe and irreversible damage to the natural environment&quot; while the &quot;company&#39;s practice of riverine [tailings] disposal is in breach of international standards.&quot;  Freeport is not the only mining company to be blacklisted by the Pension Fund for causing severe environmental damage due to the practice of dumping mine waste into rivers.  Barrick Gold and Rio Tinto &#8212; which has a stake in the Grasberg mine &#8212; have also been excluded from the Fund&#39;s investment portfolio for this reason.  <br /> <br />More recently, a coalition of other pension fund investors has <a href="http://www.responsible-investor.com/home/article/freeport_mcmoran/">lobbied</a> Freeport shareholders to push the company to improve its poor environmental performance by appointing an environmental expert to its board.  <br /> <br />This all serves to demonstrate that mining companies can face reputational, financial and legal risks if they do not operate in accordance with internationally accepted best practice.  These risks can be avoided if mining companies commit to engaging in genuine dialogue with local communities, put an end to environmentally destructive practices such as riverine tailings disposal, and demonstrate a commitment to respecting the human rights of local people.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/experts/index.cfm?fa=expert_view&expert_id=403&more=1"><strong>Christopher Boucek</strong></a> [Associate, Middle East Program, <a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/">Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</a>]: &quot;Early this week <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> released a new <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/saudiarabia0809web.pdf">report</a> [PDF file] on internal security in Saudi Arabia.  The report is very fair and makes many good points, especially about the numbers of <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/saudi-arabia-illegally-detaining.php">individuals held</a> in continued detention and regarding the judicial process for security suspects. Despite recent research, there remains much that we do not know about what goes on inside Saudi prisons, rehabilitation centers, and courtrooms. <br /><br />As of March 2009 - according to the Ministry of Interior - there were approximately 4,200 people detained in Saudi Arabia on charges connected to security and terrorism.  This is reportedly down from a high of somewhere around 12,000 people held at the height of the security clampdown several years ago.  Saudi officials have stated that over 11,400 people have been interrogated and released.  Before September 11th, 2001, there were just under 200 people held in Saudi prisons on allegations of terrorism.   <br /><br />Prolonged detention will continue to be a major issue in counter-terrorism, not just in Saudi Arabia but everywhere terrorists are detained.  There are currently no good methods to determine when to let a security detainee out of custody.  There is an urgent need to develop comprehensive risk assessment tools to evaluate security detainees prior to release. Until we have such risk assessment tools, the issue of continued detention will persist. <br /><br />For the past several years, Saudi officials have discussed plans to try accused terrorists under Islamic law in open court.  A total of 991 individuals were to go on trial in connection with a number of domestic terrorist attacks.  In July it was announced that a special court had convicted 330 people; several suspects were also acquitted.  This was the first official confirmation that the trials had commenced.  Very little information has been forthcoming about the trials, procedures, or the evidence used.  Since the verdicts were announced, the names, charges, and sentences of the convicted have not been released.  Despite earlier assertions to the contrary, it seems that foreign observers were not permitted to attend the trials.  <br /><br />The report also observes that many of those that have been released through Saudi Arabia&#39;s rehabilitation program were not engaged in violence, but were sympathizers or logistics and support personnel. However, this is not necessarily a deficiency in the Saudi approach.  Individuals that have participated in violence within the kingdom are not released through the Counseling Program.  All of the senior experienced operational leaders in the country have either been killed or captured.  Focusing on lower-level operatives has worked to prevent supporters and sympathizers from moving closer to violence and filling those gaps.&quot;<br /><br /><em>Christopher Boucek is an Associate in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace where his research focuses on regional security issues.  For the past three years he has been conducting research on Saudi rehabilitation, disengagement, and reintegration strategies.</em><br />

		<title>Shia Personal Status Law undermines Afghanistan&#039;s societal development</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.womenforwomen.org/about-women-for-women/zainab-salbi.php"><strong>Zainab Salbi</strong></a> [Founder and CEO, <a href="http://www.womenforwomen.org ">Women for Women International</a>]: &quot;Throughout Afghanistan&#39;s history, negotiations over women&#39;s status and rights in Afghan society have occurred largely in the context of political struggles to take power or to hold on to power. We can see from President Karzai&#39;s authorization and secretive implementation of the <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/amended-afghanistan-personal-status-law.php">Shiite Personal Status Law</a> - a measure that curtails rights of women of the Shia minority and curries favor amongst a conservative minority with whom he was unpopular - that for women, very little has changed about this tradition in Afghanistan.  <br /><br />The law constitutes a worrying precedent and a palpable threat to the advancement of gender equality and justice in Afghanistan.  Originally, the measure subjected women of the Shia minority to restricted movement, mandatory marital sex, limited ability to seek work, pursue an education or visit the doctor without their husbands&#39; permission and special regulation on matters like inheritance. After international outcry and widespread protest by Afghan women in Kabul, the law was revised and quietly implemented last month. The new version allows a man to deny his wife food and sustenance if she does not submit to his sexual requests. However, it removes a provision granting the husband the right to a certain number of sexual encounters each week. Additionally, this new draft makes fathers and grandfathers the sole guardians of children. <br /> <br />Women&#39;s rights in Afghanistan must be preserved and protected.  No action should be taken that further exaggerates the problem that Women for Women International <a href="http://www.womenforwomen.org/global-initiatives-helping-women/help-women-afghanistan.php">Afghanistan</a> Country Director Sweeta Noori calls the  &quot;two Afghanistans&quot;: one in Kabul where women&#39;s rights are preserved as women gain more access to social, economic and political opportunities, and another where socially excluded and rural women are subject to a different set of rights and laws that restrict their socioeconomic development and often endanger their lives and violate their human rights. <br /><br />Issues like forced marriage, self-immolation and honor crimes are still very real issues in this Afghanistan, and they threaten not only individual women but the ability of the nation as a whole to achieve stability, security and development, all of which are intimately interlinked.<br /><br />Over 16 years working with women survivors of war has taught me that women&#39;s wellbeing is the bellwether of society. Restrictions on women&#39;s mobility and personal autonomy are detrimental not just at the household and community levels, but to a peaceful and stable Afghanistan as well. The quality of life of a nation&#39;s women correlates directly with how the society fares overall - where women suffer, it is only a matter of time before entire communities are at risk. When women thrive across all sectors of society - including education and the economy - all of society benefits.<br /><br />Any blueprint for sustainable peace risks failure without united, local and national level efforts to enact gender-equitable policies that dismantle - not construct - obstacles preventing women&#39;s full participation in society.  In a recent survey of 1,500 Afghan women, Women for Women International found that the central government is believed to be more engaged on women&#39;s issues than local leadership. If the national government as a model rolls back women&#39;s rights, this hard-fought trust in central government will be squandered.  This would represent a real misstep in the nation&#39;s progress toward development of a healthy democracy.<br /><br />The women of Afghanistan need access to economic opportunities, access to education in all levels and access to physical and psychosocial health services, without having to seek permission first.  They need to exercise their rights without threat of retaliation.  They need to be able to articulate their needs, both as individuals and as equal partners in decisions about the future of their society.  There can not be a prosperous, strong, economically healthy and democratic Afghanistan without having strong women in the nation who are fully part of shaping the society.<br /><br />By their own accounts, if Afghan women can participate shoulder to shoulder with men in rebuilding their country, all of society will benefit. But for this to happen, all Afghan women must be able to exercise their human rights, regardless of religious or political affiliation.&quot;<br />

		<title>The Geneva Conventions Between War and Peace: Sixty Years and Counting</title>

Sixty years ago, on August 12, 1949, sixty-four countries that had lived through the tragedy of war came together to sign the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/genevaconventions">Geneva Conventions</a>, the cornerstone compacts of international humanitarian law (IHL) that regulate the conduct of armed conflict and seek to limit its effects.<br /><br />These four Conventions included:<ul><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field</span>, Aug 12, 1949 (GWS). This Convention represents the fourth updated version of the Geneva Convention on the wounded and sick following those adopted in 1864, 1906, and 1929;<br /><br /><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick, and Shipwrecked; Members at Sea</span>, Aug 12, 1949 (GWS Sea), This Convention replaced the Hague Convention of 1907 for the Adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the Principles of the Geneva Convention;<br /><br /><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War</span>, Aug 12, 1949 (GPW), which replaced the Prisoners of War Convention of 1929; and,<br /><br /><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Civilian Persons in Time of War</span>, Aug 12, 1949 T.I.A.S. 3365. (GC) (Geneva Conventions, 1949) adopted before 1949 but signed in 1949.</ul><br />The Geneva Conventions and their Protocols Additional of 1977 are looked to as instruments circumscribing, prescribing, and proscribing the permissible use of armed force within the context of a variety of other internationally recognized legal bases for use of force in relations between States found in both customary and conventional law. Generally speaking, however, modern <span style="font-style:italic;">jus ad bellum</span> (the law of resort to war) is reflected in the United Nations (UN) Charter.  The Charter provides two bases for the resort to force:  Chapter VII enforcement actions under the auspices of the Security Council, and self-defense pursuant to Article 51, which governs acts of both individual and collective self defense. (Charter, 1945). <br /><br />The UN Charter, specifically Chapter VI: Pacific Settlement of Disputes (Articles 33-38), and Chapter VII: Action with Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts of Aggression (Articles 39-51), envisioned a Security Council role in assisting parties to "any dispute likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security" as they strive to resolve conflicts through "peaceful means of their own choice."<br /><br />The four Geneva Conventions were drafted to protect civilians and health/aid workers who are not taking part in the hostilities, as well as those "out of combat" who are no longer participating in the hostilities, including wounded, sick, and shipwrecked soldiers and prisoners of war. <br /><br />Today, the use of force and threats thereof present challenges regionally and globally to individuals, corporations, nations, and other organizations of persuasion. At its most benign and pacific, force or the potential use thereof may encourage and nurture peace or deter aggression. At its most belligerent, force or the potential use thereof may be a dramatic and overwhelming tool of compulsion. A multitude of new terms have emerged to describe such armed conflicts, including (but not limited to):  <br /><blockquote>Brushfire wars, Complex Emergencies, Complex Humanitarian Operations, Complex Contingency Operations, Contingency Operations, Crises, Dirty Little Wars, Disaster Operations, Guerilla War, Humanitarian Operations, Insurgencies &amp; Counterinsurgencies, Internal War/Armed Conflict, Irregular Warfare, LIC (low intensity conflict), LRC (localized regional conflicts), MOOTW (military operations other than war), OMO (other military operations), OO (other operations), OOTW (operations other than war), Partisan War, Peace Operations, Peace Support Operations, People's war, Revolutionary Warfare, Rebellion, SASO/SOSO (stability and support operations, Small Wars, UW (Unconventional Warfare), Wars of National Liberation</blockquote>. . . and many others!<br /><br />Not all of these terms/acronyms hold the same legal, political, or operational significance to the counselor, commander, coordinator, civilian, or political leader affected by or effecting change during these armed operations "between war and peace." This begs the question: just exactly what is war? It is generally recognized that, aside from political declarations, war is a contention, i.e., a violent struggle through the application of armed force." Elements of what constitutes a war may include: a) a contention; b) between at least two nation states; c) wherein armed force is employed; d) with an intent to overwhelm.<br /><br />In that context, a multitude of applicable legal principles and broad statements of law have become particularly contentious in the instances of intranational armed conflicts, and certain international "undeclared" wars or armed conflicts, yet with respect to "international armed conflict," this threshold is codified in Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949.<br /><br />Common Article 2 states: "[T]he present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them." This is a true <span style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span> standard, where the subjective intent of the belligerents is not relevant. Armed conflicts such as the 1982 Malvinas (Argentina)/Falklands (UK) War, the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, and the first (1991) and second (2003-04) U.S.-led Coalition wars against Iraq could be considered "international armed conflicts" to which the Law of War applied.  The 1977 Protocol I Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions has expanded this scope of application to include certain wars of "national liberation" for parties to that convention.  According to Pictet's <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/Geneva_conventions-1949.html">Commentary on the Geneva Conventions</a>, the law of war applies to: "any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces." <br /><br />Article 2 effectively requires that the law be applied broadly and automatically from the inception of the conflict. Howard Levie in <u>The Code of International Armed Conflict</u> opined that the following two facts result in application of the entire body of the law of war: (1) A dispute between states, and (2) Armed conflict.  An exception to the "dispute between states" requirement arises where there is a conflict between a state and a rebel movement recognized as belligerency.  This concept arose as the result of the need to apply the Laws of War to situations in which rebel forces had the <em>de facto</em> ability to wage war.  The Law of War ceases to apply under Article 5, GWS
 and GPW and Article 6, GC upon: (1) final repatriation (GWS, GPW); (2) general close of military operations (GC); or (3) occupation (GC), in which case it applies for one year after the general close of military operations. In situations where the Occupying Power still exercises governmental functions, however, that Power is bound to apply for the duration of the occupation certain key provisions of the GC.  For military operations under circumstances other than armed conflict (e.g., peacekeeping and peace enforcement in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia), the Law of War, in general, will also apply, but the applicability of particular treaties is open to interpretation.  <br /><br />Conflicts which are not of an international character "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties" will fall under Common Article 3, and make up the majority of the ongoing conflicts.  International regulation over such conflicts is more regulated than under international armed conflicts, and domestic law may control the application and use of force or other economic, political, or military applications of state authority.<br /> <br />While there is no objective definition for what lies "between war and peace," IHL is somewhat clearer on what constitutes an "internal armed conflict."  Although no objective set of criteria exists for determining the existence of a non-international armed conflict, Pictet listed several suggested criteria:  (1) the rebel group has an organized military force under responsible command, operates within a determinate territory, and has the means to respect the Geneva Conventions; and, (2) the legal Government is obliged to have recourse to the regular military forces against the rebels, who are organized and in control of a portion of the national territory.  Protocol II of <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/genevaconventions">The 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions</a>, December 12, 1977, was intended to supplement the substantive provisions of Common Article 3.  It formalized the criteria for the application of that convention to a non-international armed conflict:  (1) Under responsible command; and (2) Exercising control over a part of a nation so as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement the requirements of Protocol II.<br /><br />The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the official custodian of the conventions, does provide some guidance in its commentary, in distinguishing between civil war and mere riots or disturbances. One <a href="http://uniset.ca/terr/art/fonaff_lawwarterror.html">test</a> suggested by the ICRC for determining whether wartime or peacetime rules apply is to examine the intensity of hostilities. In addition to the intensity of hostilities, the ICRC suggests considering such factors as the regularity of armed clashes and the degree to which opposing forces are organized. Whether a conflict is politically motivated also seems to play an unacknowledged role in deciding whether it is "war" or not.<br /><br />Knut D&Atilde;&para;rmann, head of the ICRC&#39;s Legal Division <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/geneva-convention-interview-120809">opined</a> on the occasion of the Geneva Conventions' sixtieth birthday that "the vast majority of people support the core principles of IHL and the idea that even wars should have limits," but that "what we really need is better compliance with the law."   Regardless of the legal justifications for &#8212; and limitations upon - such operations, the ICRC found through an opinion poll in eight nations affected by conflict and violence that, in reality, "few [polled] are aware that the rules exist," and that "some doubt that the law has a real impact on the ground." Armed conflict has not only legal ramifications but also practical impacts of death, destruction, displacement, and despair.  As we examine &#8212; and implement the spirit and the letter of the Geneva Conventions, perhaps we should heed the words of Sun Tzu from many centuries prior:<br /><blockquote>The art of war is of vital importance to the State.  It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin.  Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.<br />&#8212; Sun Tzu, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UTGnopblxt8C&dq=The+Art+of+War&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=8eKCSrLwDqGltgfKq9HOCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7#v=onepage&q=&f=false">The Art of War</a>, 490 B.C. </blockquote> <br />  <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Kevin Govern is a professor at Ave Maria School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Robbie Sabel of the Hebrew University Faculty of Law in Jerusalem, Israel, says that despite its partisan nature, a report issued by Israel&#39;s government on the legal and factual underpinnings of the December-January Gaza offensive is a development that should be welcomed by the legal community....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/robbiesabelsmall.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Israeli government has lately posted on its website a lengthy and detailed <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/E89E699D-A435-491B-B2D0-017675DAFEF7/0/GazaOperation.pdf">examination</a> of the legal and factual background of its military operations in Gaza during December and January of this past year.  The Report is avowedly partisan and is no doubt intended as a response to calls for an international enquiry made by various international NGOs and to a complaint submitted to the ICC by the Palestinian Authority. However the very fact that a government involved in a controversial military operation consequently publishes in real time a detailed legal and factual brief is a development to be welcomed by the legal world. It could transform the public debate from an exchange of sound bite-like recriminations into a discourse as to the very real legal dilemmas involved in a regular army fighting irregular fighters of a non-state actor. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Self Defence Against Non-State Actors?</span><br /><br />Among the issues studied is the cardinal issue of whether Israel had the right in the first place, to use armed force against the Hamas in Gaza. The Israeli report lists the armed attacks by Hamas against Israel and, not surprisingly, concludes that Israel was acting in accordance with its inherent right of self defence. The report  bases its conclusion on the wording of <a href="http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N01/533/82/PDF/N0153382.pdf?OpenElement">Security Council Resolution 1368</a>  which recognized "the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence," in connection with "threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts" and <a href="http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N01/557/43/PDF/N0155743.pdf?OpenElement">Security Council Resolution 1373</a>  which noted that "international terrorism constitute[s] a threat to international peace and security" while "reaffirming the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence as recognized by the Charter of the United Nations as reiterated in resolution 1368". The report does not ignore the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf">ICJ advisory opinion on the Separation Wall</a> which concluded that a right of self defence applies only to attacks by a State .  The report quotes various authorities (see Report footnote 48) including dissenting judges Buergenthal and Higgins for the conclusion that the Court had erred in its opinion on this issue. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Applicability of the Laws of Armed Conflict?</span><br /><br />The report questions whether the laws of armed conflict applied to the conflict in Gaza and if so whether it was an internal or international conflict. Here the Report applies a pragmatic approach quoting the decision of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/tadic/appeal/decision-e/51002.htm">Tadi&Auml;&#8225; case</a>, that "an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State."  The Report concludes that &quot;The conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza meets this definition&quot;. (Report, paragraph 28). The report added that &quot;Israel as a matter of policy applies to its military operations in Gaza the rules of armed conflict governing both international and non-international armed conflicts. At the end of the day, classification of the armed conflict between Hamas and Israel as international or non-international in the current context is largely of theoretical concern, as many similar norms and principles govern both types of conflicts&quot;. (Report, paragraph 30). This pragmatic approach was the approach adopted by the Israel Supreme Court which ruled in a series of cases that the Israel armed forces were bound to comply with the laws of war whenever they were engaged in armed conflict, regardless of the classification of the conflict and without regard to the behavior of the other side.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Civilian Casualties</span><br /><br />The Report admits that there were heavy casualties among the civilian population of Gaza but adds a caveat that &quot;The fact of civilian casualties in an armed conflict, even in significant numbers, does not in and of itself establish any violation of international law. In fact, the doctrine of proportionality operates in scenarios in which incidental injury and collateral damage are the foreseeable, albeit undesired, result of attack on a legitimate target". (Report, paragraph 90) The Report criticizes NGOs and UN bodies for concluding that there were violations of the laws of war based on the uncontested fact that there were civilian casualties. The Report points out that &quot;non-governmental organizations and rapporteurs and committees acting under mandates from international organizations too often jump from reporting tragic incidents involving the death or injury of civilians during armed combat, to the assertion of sweeping conclusions within a matter of hours, days or weeks, that the reported casualties ipso facto demonstrate violations of international law, or even "war crimes&quot;. (Report, paragraph 34) The Report points out that in the law of armed conflict &quot;any assessment of the legality of particular conduct cannot focus only on the consequences (whether civilians were harmed). Instead, the proper focus is on whether the persons carrying out the attack, based on what they knew and the conditions they faced at the time, complied with the applicable rules of international law&quot;. (Report, paragraph 93) The report brings legal authority that &quot;the presence of civilians at a site (whether voluntarily or involuntarily) does not by itself forbid an attack on an otherwise legitimate military target.&quot; (Report, paragraph 99). &quot;Military operations that cause unintended and unwanted damage to civilians do not constitute violations of the Law of Armed Conflict, much less a war crime.&quot; (Report, paragraph 114). In other words, there is no indication of a "war crime" simply because others conclude after the conflict that a different decision &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; often, a snap decision taken on the battlefield &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; could have led to fewer civilian casualties. To the contrary, if the commander in the field did not intend and did not know that the attack would cause clearly excessive levels of civil harm, there is no legal basis for labeling it as war crime&quot;. (Report, paragraph 129).  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What if the Enemy Purposely places Civilians in Danger?</span><br /><br />The Report states that the Hamas policy of placing &quot;weapons systems in or near apartment buildings, schools, mosques or medical facilities, or to encourage civilians to gather in areas that are likely military targets &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; violates the Law of Armed Conflict, because such tactics inevitably increase civilian casualties beyond what otherwise might occur in connection with an attack on a legitimate military target.&quot; (Report, paragraph 139). Such behavior is certainly a violation of the laws of war but the Report does not claim that such Hamas behavior negates the obligation of the other side, in this case Israel, to
ensure proportionality. The Report leaves open the thorny question of whether such behavior by Hamas should affect if at all the obligations of the other side as regards targeting such military objectives.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Is Hamas Bound by the Laws of War?</span><br /><br />The Report refers to Hamas violations of the laws of war and to war crimes that can be attributed to the individual members of the Organization. The Report refrains from examining whether Hamas as an organization is bound by international law including the laws of armed conflict. The question could be asked for instance whether Al Qaeda is subject to international law and I believe the answer here again to be that individual members are guilty of war crimes and there is no utility in examining whether such non-state actors who act completely outside international legal frameworks are subject to international law. The analogy could perhaps be made to a non-incorporated criminal gang in national legal systems. It is the individuals who violate the law.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Complementary Principle in Applying Universal Jurisdiction</span><br /><br />The Report, for obvious reasons, stresses that third party States should intervene by prosecuting alleged violations of the laws of war only where the State involved either lacks an independent legal system of its own or lacks the will to undertake a bona fide investigation. The report quotes at length from the decision of the Spanish court of appeal that refused to deal with a complaint against an earlier Israeli bombing in Gaza as &quot;Israel's system of appellate review was independent and impartial&quot;. (Report, paragraph 306). <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span><br /><br />A legal report on its military operations issued for international consumption by any government is bound to be partisan. Nevertheless the issuing of such a detailed and well researched report is a valuable precedent and it is to be hoped that we will see in the future similar reports by other governments.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Robbie Sabel is a visiting Professor of International Law at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem</span><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://people.creighton.edu/~rjm35054/">Raneta Lawson Mack</a> of the Creighton University School of Law says that while Japan&#39;s establishment of a jury trial system is a bold effort to democratize its criminal justice process, it&#39;s yet to be seen how the new system deals with the inevitable &quot;bumps&quot; in the road....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/renetalawsonmack.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->J<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->apan's first jury trial in more than 60 years apparently went off without a hitch earlier this month.  The defendant, a 72 year-old man charged with murdering his 66 year-old neighbor, had already confessed to the killing, explaining that he attacked his neighbor with a knife because she knocked over some bottles of water on his property.  Thus, the jury of six laypeople and three professional judges had only to decide the level of culpability and the severity of punishment, not whether the defendant was guilty of committing the act.  The jury ultimately convicted the defendant of murder and sentenced him to 15 years in prison.<br /><br />Prior to the reinstitution of jury trials in Japan in 2004 (known as "<span style="font-style:italic;">saiban in</span>&quot;), there was a great deal of skepticism about adding citizen participation to the criminal justice process.  The Japanese culture of deference to authority was thought to be a significant impediment to impaneling lay jurors who would be willing to participate in the process.  Additionally, the lack of transparency in the criminal justice system had left much of the population in the dark about the operations of criminal justice in Japan.<br /><br />In an attempt to address these concerns, Japan instituted a jury system based upon a model used in many inquisitorial systems of justice, i.e., lay jurors deliberating with professional judges.  Although this is not a jury of one's peers in the purest sense, there are some advantages to having individuals skilled in the law in the deliberation room, especially if the lay citizenry has been effectively shielded from the criminal justice process for a prolonged period.  Of course, there is also significant concern that the professional judges may dominate the proceedings, and this concern is particularly acute in Japan with its culture of deference to authority.  <br /><br />To combat the potential for judicial dominance, Japan established a voting system that could reduce such influence.  Each of the nine jurors has a vote, but even if all three professional judges vote guilty, five of the lay jurors can essentially "veto" the judges by voting not guilty.   However, if all six lay jurors vote guilty, they need at least one professional judge on board to prevail.<br /><br />Allowing jurors to directly question the defendant and witnesses during the trial is another feature that enhances citizen participation in Japan's jury trial process.  This is dramatically different from the process in the U.S., in which jurors are, for the most part, seen but not heard from until the verdict.  This is also quite different from many inquisitorial systems in which lay jurors are allowed to question the defendant and witnesses, but must often do so through the presiding judge who acts as a "filter."  <br /><br />In Japan's recently concluded jury trial, lay jurors demonstrated their understanding of the core issues by asking questions about the particular knife used by the defendant (why a survival knife instead of a kitchen knife?) and questioning why the defendant didn't seek help for the victim even though he thought she could die (the defendant claimed that he thought another neighbor would call for help).  Although this particular jury trial appeared to go smoothly and the lay jurors took an active role as expected, this is a process that is still in its infancy, which means there will inevitably be some bumps in road.<br /><br />For example, this was a trial about the level of culpability as opposed to a question of guilt or innocence.  What will happen when lay jurors are confronted with a trial in which the actual guilt or innocence of the defendant is in question?  As anyone familiar with the U.S. criminal justice system knows, when those types of questions are left in the hands of jurors, the results can be unpredictable and cause for heaping copious amounts of criticism on the U.S. jury trial system.<br /><br />Additionally, Japan has an exceptionally high conviction rate (&gt; 99% by most estimates).  While this can certainly be attributed, in part, to prosecutorial selectivity, it is also clear that most of the criminal cases in Japan are presented to the courts wrapped neatly with confessions by defendants.  In most instances, these confessions are obtained without the benefit of counsel and within the secret confines of the interrogation room.  Japan has so far resisted repeated calls for general audio- or videotaping of interrogations explaining that recording could impede the interrogation process.<br /><br />This situation will present two challenges to the newly established jury system.  First, what will happen when jurors are presented with a challenge to the credibility of a confession?  Can Japan continue to resist calls for recorded interrogations when the voluntariness of confessions becomes key to determinations of guilt or innocence?  Second, what will happen if, or when, the conviction rate drops?  Perhaps Russia's "experiment" with jury trials might be instructive in this regard.  Russia reestablished jury trials in 1993, only to eliminate them for some cases in 2008 due to a perception of excessive acquittals and leniency by jurors.<br /><br />Finally, will Japan be able to maintain the requisite level of citizen participation in the jury trial process?  During the first trial a lay juror withdrew and had to be replaced due to illness.  As mentioned above, Japanese culture exhibits strong deference to authority.  This inclination is in sharp conflict with the responsibilities of jury service, which will sometimes require challenging the prosecutor's evidence and might require debating with the professional judges.  Will lay jurors come to accept these challenges as a natural part of the process or will jurors simply seek to avoid jury service altogether?<br /><br />Japan's establishment of a jury trial system is a bold effort to democratize its criminal justice process.  Lay citizen participation in the criminal process adds transparency and a level of credibility to the criminal justice system.  Observers of this change in Japan will undoubtedly be watching to see how this new system deals with the inevitable "bumps" in the road and whether this degree of openness in the trial system yields similar results for the interrogation process.<br />  <br />    <br /><br /><em>Raneta Lawson Mack is a professor at the Creighton University School of Law and author of </em>Comparative Criminal Procedure; History, Processes and case Studies<em> (W.S.

One of the arguments that has been made repeatedly is that a problem with trying terrorism suspects in civilian courts is the potential disclosure of classified information.  The risk that such information may be revealed in the course of a trial is unreasonably high, the argument goes, and the more flexible rules governing military commissions are therefore preferable.<br /><br />The premise of this argument does not withstand close consideration. Judges in our federal district courts have multiple tools at their disposal to ensure that no classified information is revealed beyond what is necessary for the lawyers on both sides of the case to do their jobs.<br /><br />Indeed, the current rule governing classified information in the military commissions reads very much like the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) and equivalent rule governing military courts-martial. As the military commissions in Guantanamo have continued to evolve to resemble ordinary military courts-martial, moreover, with evidentiary rules and procedures that favor fairness over expediency, they have demonstrated ways in which classified information necessary to hearings nonetheless can be protected. <br /><br />In a Guantanamo Bay hearing room, for example, observers are separated from the commission, lawyers and suspects by a glass partition. Sound from the hearing reaches observers via speakers and on a 40 second delay. This set-up allows  the audio feed to be blocked if someone in the courtroom makes mention of classified material. A person in the courtroom monitors the proceedings and has the ability to mute them with a press of a button if classified information is discussed. When this occurs, a red light flashes so that everyone in the courtroom, and particularly the judge, is aware that classified information is being discussed.<br /><br />One of us recently had the opportunity to observe hearings in Guantanamo. At a hearing concerning the 9/11 co-conspirators, this system of muting classified evidence was employed for a brief period.  Observers were not able to hear what was being said and, as important, when the audio feed returned the judge cautioned the defense counsel not to discuss the classified topics in this forum&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;there was a classified session of the hearings scheduled for later that afternoon to which the public was not invited.  The judge made factual findings on the record stating that the interest in national security outweighed the public&#39;s right to know in respect to the matters that would be discussed at the closed hearing.  Even though the public would be excluded from the hearing, the accused and counsel would be present.  This system appeared to function in an orderly fashion.<br /><br />As President Obama and his advisers continue to consider what to do with the detainees at Guantanamo and whether any of their cases should be tried in civilian courts in the U.S., we would do well to remember that the need to safeguard classified intelligence information need not preclude the fair administration of justice in American courts of law. Civilian judges, like their Commission counterparts, are capable of striking the appropriate balance in determining whether the discussion of certain information must be confined to the attorneys and the suspects, and also of taking the steps necessary to ensure that such information is not inadvertently disclosed.  <br /><br />And, while the debate over where to try the detainees continues, the federal district court in Washington, D.C. continues to entertain habeas petitions from the detainees and evaluate their merit. Like the military commissions, the judges on the district court have proved themselves fully capable of protecting classified information while at the same time ensuring the suspect a fair hearing.  There may be reasons not to try terror suspects in civilian courts in the United States, but the problem created by the need to safeguard classified information is not one of them.<br /><br /><em>Lawrence Friedman and Victor Hansen teach constitutional law and criminal law courses, respectively, at New England School of Law.

It is estimated that about 1,200 innocent people were killed in the course of three months. Of those, the majority lost their lives because of their ethnicity, political affiliation, or both. Since then, Kenyans have been demanding that the perpetrators of those crimes be brought to justice. <br /><br />In principle, the country has three choices to prosecute post-election violence. First and most obviously, it could use its domestic courts to do so. National courts are usually the best forum in which to prosecute crimes. That is why they are the default option. Among other things, they are the <span style="font-style:italic;">locus criminis</span>, the place where the crimes occurred, and where suspects, victims, their relatives, and most witnesses reside. State prosecutors can also normally rely on the law enforcement machinery of the domestic criminal justice system (such as the police) to swiftly conduct investigations, draw up charges, execute arrest warrants, and detain suspects.<br /><br />Unfortunately in Kenya's situation, the Commission of Inquiry into Post Election Violence ("Waki Commission"), which was established in order to do a post-mortem on the election-related crimes and to recommend a way forward, ruled out this option. Why? Because in the Waki Commission&#39;s view, the local justice system was in such a "sorry state" that the public rightly lacked confidence in its ability to dispense credible justice. <br /><br />In addition, the country's legal system was plagued by major institutional deficiencies. These had a tendency to encourage rather than deter entrepreneurs of violence because the chances were high they would get off scot-free. On top of that was a lack of political will at the high levels to genuinely address such crimes, as well as fears about prosecuting powerful people among the lower ranks of the police. In such an environment, impunity tends to thrive and the rule of law starts to wither.   <br /><br />Thus, the Waki Commission recommended that Kenya choose the second option available to it, that is: to establish a hybrid Special Tribunal for Kenya ("STK"). The STK, a court of mixed subject matter jurisdiction and staff composition, would investigate and prosecute those "bearing greatest responsibility" for the killings and other atrocities related to the 2007 general elections. <br /><br />Special courts are in vogue in the international community. They are a better option wherever domestic courts cannot be trusted to dispense justice, whether because of a lack of capacity or a lack in the necessary juridical space to function independently. A key advantage of these types of tribunals, among others, is that they can be grafted onto the existing justice system. This is what happened in Bosnia, East Timor, and Cambodia with United Nations assistance. Alternately, they could be insulated from the travails of domestic legal systems by creating a separate institution altogether. The best examples of this are the Special Court for Sierra Leone, which has jurisdiction over national and international crimes, and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which only has jurisdiction over common Lebanese crimes.<br /><br />Regrettably, Kenya appears to have given up the various advantages of setting up a hybrid court. On 30 July 2009, President Mwai Kibaki and his coalition government rejected the STK idea despite having endorsed it back in December 2008. Instead, the Cabinet decided the country would prioritize "national healing and reconciliation." Toward this end, they would undertake "accelerated" and extensive reforms in the judiciary, police, and investigative arms of government to try "perpetrators of post-election violence locally" (that is, within the regular national courts). <br /><br />Talks of institutional reform were obvious attempts to turn the fail grade that the Waki Commission had given the domestic system into a passing mark. In any case, the government would now deploy local trials alongside the recently established Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission ("TJRC"). It appears that the TJRC is more popular among the powers that be because it emphasizes forgiveness and reconciliation, not criminal prosecutions. It can also grant amnesties for some crimes (albeit conditional ones) which is why many Kenyans question whether, in reality, the government plans to set &quot;justice&quot; aside in order to put in place a process devoted exclusively to truth and reconciliation.<br /><br />In theory, as United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton observed during her recent visit to Nairobi, the ideal situation would be for domestic prosecutors, judges, and law enforcement officials to "step up to their responsibilities" and remove the impunity question. Indeed, Kenya, like other countries, should aspire to render justice through its regular courts. <br /><br />In practice, however, this poses a huge problem because some Kenyan leaders who have apparently been implicated by the Waki Commission are unlikely to sit idly by while tribunals with long arms are created to reach them and their cronies. Those politicians have reportedly been fighting a rear guard action to kill the STK idea since last year. They seem to have succeeded. In the meantime, the government now promises to fix the local justice system to prosecute post-election violence. <br /><br />What the government is not telling Kenyans is that it takes significant resources and time to implement the extensive reforms that would be required to credibly prosecute perpetrators. This is especially so when we consider the Waki Commission's damning indictment of the domestic legal system. Not only did it point a finger at the judiciary, but it also questioned the effectiveness of key players in the justice process, including the Attorney-General. The latter has the power to block prosecutions, and in the past has not hesitated to use it, especially those brought against prominent individuals. <br /><br />The good news is that the skeptical commissioners left Kenyans a back-up plan in case the politicians fail, for whatever reason, to establish the STK. It therefore gave custody of evidence and an envelope containing a list of alleged suspects of post-election violence to Kofi Annan. Annan, the former UN Secretary-General, chairs the Panel of Eminent African Personalities that the African Union dispatched in 2008 to help the rival political camps reach political settlements. He was to hand over the material to Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Essentially, the Waki Commission tried to shame the government into dealing with impunity domestically through a locally driven but internationalized STK process- or, failing that, for it to refer itself to the ICC for investigations and possible prosecutions.   <br /><br />In early July 2009, the Kenyan authorities sent a high level delegation to meet with the ICC prosecutor in The Hague. This suggested that the government is indeed serious about
dealing with the accountability question. On the other hand, by choosing to scuttle the STK recommendation just a few weeks later, the politicians appear to be playing games- not only regarding impunity, but regarding the future stability of the country as well. In the end, time will tell what their motives were. But if this turns out to be political maneuvering, as evidenced by the experiences of other African countries, Kenyan leaders would be engaging in a dangerous dance with impunity. <br /><br />Annan, by this point one of Africa's leading post-conflict paramedics, has recently transmitted the evidence and list of suspects to the ICC Prosecutor. The question now is whether the proposed domestic prosecutions would square with the country's obligations under the Rome Statute. Part of the answer can be found in Article 17(1). <br /><br />Under that provision, a case is inadmissible before the ICC if it "is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it." However, where the concerned state proves to be either "unwilling" or "unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution," the presumption of complementarity will be reversed, thereby rendering the case admissible in the ICC. Unwillingness exists where national authorities undertake sham investigations to shield suspects from prosecution, where there is unjustified delay indicating that there is in fact no intention to prosecute, or where proceedings are not conducted impartially. <br /><br />The Waki Commission found that, historically, impunity has reigned supreme for election related violence in Kenya. So, in a way, one could quickly consign the country to the "unwilling" category and, on that basis, argue for ICC involvement. Indeed, what is known about the post-election violence raises serious concerns about whether there is a genuine commitment to investigate and prosecute post-election crimes given the alleged links between perpetrators, politicians, and other higher level persons associated with the current government. <br /><br />There are also serious problems affecting justice delivery in Kenya. The weakest link is apparently the investigative arm of the police. Yet the country relies heavily on police prosecutors who apparently conduct the majority of all cases in Kenya due to the limited capacity of the Attorney-General's office. Because of heavy police involvement in the violence, this raises serious questions about fundamental principles of natural justice. But the threshold for inability under the Rome Statute appears so high that it would only be met where there is a "total" or "substantial collapse" of the national legal system. Thus, for the "unable" prong of the Article 17(1) test, a strong argument can be made that Kenyans have some ability to prosecute the crimes locally. The system may be tattered, but is not yet a write off from an Article 17 point of view.  <br /><br />Nevertheless, the politicians probably figured that they are better off opting for "self-referral" because, under Article 17(1)(b), the ICC would not possess jurisdiction if Kenya investigates and decides not to prosecute. This would be so unless there is evidence of bad faith tending to show unwillingness or inability to prosecute. It is also hard for the Prosecutor to exercise jurisdiction if someone is prosecuted within a Kenyan court, and say because of subtle pressure on a judge, is exonerated in a local trial. Double jeopardy rules would apply to the ICC proceedings as per Article 17(1)(c).  <br /><br />But the clincher behind the latest insistence on domestic prosecutions may lay elsewhere. They probably know that the ICC Prosecutor must analyze the "seriousness" of information received about alleged crimes under Article 15(2) of the Rome Statute. Ocampo announced in February 2008 that he is undertaking preliminary investigations into the Kenyan situation. However, to invoke his jurisdiction he must find that one or more defined ICC crimes in Article 5 (i.e. genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes) were perpetrated. <br /><br />It seems to be settled that ethnicity was a key factor in the post-election violence. However, the Waki Commission did not discover any evidence of genocidal intent. At best, there was an internal disturbance after the elections so war crimes are also not in issue. Nevertheless, according to the commissioners, the evidence of attacks against civilians may amount to "crimes against humanity." Even here, there are serious difficulties because it is uncertain that the post-election violence in Kenya would necessarily match the definition in Article 7 of the Rome Statute.<br /><br />First, on the positive side crimes against humanity no longer require a nexus to an armed conflict to be punishable. On that score, Kenya would pass the first hurdle. <br /><br />Second, Article 7(1) prohibits certain acts that were apparently perpetrated in Kenya, including: murder, deportation or forcible population transfers, unlawful imprisonment, torture, sexual violence such as rape or other acts of comparable gravity, persecution against identifiable political or ethnic groups, and enforced disappearance. In addition, specific features of the post-election violence that caused victims great suffering or serious bodily or mental injury, such as the forced circumcision of Luo men, could conceivably fall into the residual category of "other inhumane acts" in the same way that forced marriage, which was a salient feature of the Sierra Leonean conflict, has since been jurisprudentially determined to constitute an inhumane act.    <br /><br />On the more challenging side, in order to show that crimes against humanity were committed in Kenya, the Rome Statute requires proof of the "contextual elements" that would transform an ordinary offense such as murder into an international crime. This requires that the prohibited acts, in the language of Article 7(1), be found to be "part of a widespread or systematic attack direct against any civilian population." The first part of this test is disjunctive so only proof of one of the two elements is required. The second half requires an "attack," which is generally taken to mean "multiple" (as opposed to random or isolated) acts against a civilian population. It is certainly arguable that there were widespread attacks against Kenyans after the elections. The more difficult argument to sustain is that those attacks were carried out deliberately as a result of some state or organizational policy. This is especially so considering the finding that some of the post-election violence was spontaneous rather than organized.<br /><br />Ultimately, the answers to these legal questions will be fact driven. It is therefore hard to allege that crimes against humanity were committed in Kenya without detailed evidence. In fact, even the Waki Commission, which spent months studying the post-election crisis, hesitated to reach a definitive conclusion on this point. Much of the evidence gathered was apparently insufficient to prove the suspects' guilt in a regular criminal trial, and as such was meant to serve as a springboard for further investigations. Significantly, the report admitted that the evidence "may even fall short of the proof required" for crimes against humanity.<br /><br />The possibility that only one international crime may have been committed in Kenya will be weighed by the ICC prosecutor alongside the numbers of victims, amongst other factors, in deciding whether to pursue the Kenyan situation. Furthermore, while tragic and unprecedented, he is free to conclude that the post-election violence does not meet the gravity threshold when considered against other situations from around the world. In other words, under Article 17(1)(d), he may find that there is insufficient gravity to warrant further investigations or prosecutions. <br /><br />Where does this analysis leave Kenya? If the desire is to mete out credible justice for the post-election crimes, Kenya's best option remains the STK, as the Waki Commission argued back in October 2008. But since agreement on a hybrid court seems to be elusive, or
 is caught up in survivor politics, Kenyan leaders have opted to prosecute cases domestically. This clearly gives them more control and influence over the process. Whether local prosecutions would ultimately pass ICC muster would depend upon how they are carried out. That in turn depends on how speedily reforms can be implemented in a judicial system that apparently enjoys little confidence amongst ordinary Kenyans. <br /><br />The final option is for an ICC self-referral. Contrary to popular commentary within Kenya, the so-called "Hague option" is not, and should not be seen as, a magic bullet for the country's impunity problems. For one thing, as shown here, there is no guarantee that the Prosecutor would invoke his jurisdiction to pursue the crimes there. Even if he does so for his own reasons, say to prove the point that some African states still support instead of oppose the ICC, he can only prosecute those "most responsible" for the violence. An "impunity gap" would result except if Kenyan authorities prosecute middle and lower ranking perpetrators, while sending the "big fish" to The Hague. <br /><br />In any case, distant trials at the ICC would offer little comfort for those to whom it matters the most: the Kenyan victims of the violence. Why? Because they would effectively be denied the opportunity to watch their tormentors face justice. In turn, while this could be a good way out for the politicians seeking to evade responsibility for stoking ethnic hatreds and fomenting post-election violence for personal gain, international prosecutions may ultimately have limited impact in healing the raw wounds of the currently divided nation. <br />  <br />    <br /><br /><em>Charles C.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law says that the notion of setting up a special international tribunal to try Guantanamo detainees - most recently floated in an op-ed in the <em>New York Times</em> - is not as promising as it might at first appear...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kellyupdated.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>M</strong></font>ssr. Gu&Atilde;&copy;na&Atilde;&laquo;l Mettraux, a respected defense counsel for international criminal tribunals in The Hague, has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/opinion/20mettraux.html">suggested</a> in the <em>New York Times</em> that creation of an international criminal tribunal would be the best way for the Obama Administration to deal with the Guantanamo Bay detainees.  This idea has been floated before, but has not gained much traction.  True, it would shore up American support for international law and multilateral institutions, raise our stock in the U.N. Security Council, and finally provide some kind of legal process for those lingering in the legal black hole of Gitmo.  But the flipside of this proposition is characterized by extraordinarily lengthy and costly trials probably located somewhere distantly removed from the evidence and witnesses needed for both prosecution and defense.  Trials of major war criminals at the Yugoslav tribunal extended for years and cost millions. <br /> <br />    And, although I am a supporter of international criminal tribunals, it must be noted that these institutional creatures are not all apples and apples.  The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg established by the Allied powers after World War II, glowingly noted in Mettraux&#39;s op-ed, was widely viewed as nothing more than victor&#39;s justice.  The Tokyo Tribunal moreso.  They were important antecedents to today&#39;s tribunals, but they were hardly perfect.  The Yugoslav and Rwandan tribunals were established in The Hague and Arusha - physically removed from the countries where the underlying atrocities took place so as to neutralize them, and staffed exclusively with international specialists to ensure impartiality.  This was, in part, a corrective to the Nuremberg and Tokyo experiences, which took place in the ravaged countries of the defeated powers, and in part necessary in the case of the Yugoslav tribunal as the Balkan wars were still underway when the court was established.<br /><br />    The weaknesses of these experiences were thought to have been corrected by the time so-called &quot;hybrid&quot; tribunals began to walk the international landscape.  Tribunals for atrocities in Sierra Leone and Cambodia were located back in the countries in question and staffed with a blend of internationalists and local judges and attorneys.  Again, the record of success that emerges is mixed.  The Sierra Leone tribunal got off to a good start under the leadership of David Crane, its first prosecutor, but faced with the trial of Charles Taylor, the Liberian warlord responsible for most of the suffering in that area, the tribunal had to send him to The Hague for trial in the face of increasing security concerns, thereby undermining one of the key aspects of the hybrid tribunal model.  The Cambodian tribunal has since its inception been beset by political intrigue trickling down from the unstable government in Phnom Penh.  Several years on, progress on prosecuting the perpetrators of the killing fields remains elusive.<br /><br />    The new Lebanon tribunal, designed to investigate and prosecute those involved in the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri, reflects yet another adjustment.  Located outside Lebanon and staffed with 2/3 internationalists and 1/3 Lebanese judges and attorneys, the court&#39;s jurisdiction encompasses what amounts to terrorism.  This is a new wrinkle, especially as there is no agreed international legal definition for the crime of terrorism.  Traditionally, <em>ad hoc</em> criminal tribunals dealt with only the &quot;big 3&quot; - genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  <br /><br />    Any international tribunal for Gitmo detainees would have to encompass prosecution for terrorism as well as violations of the laws of war.  Placing it in Afghanistan (where most of the detainees were captured) would be problematic for obvious reasons.  So to would be staffing it with a blend of local and international specialists.  Afghanistan is barren of an effective bench and bar.  About the best that could be done is for international judges and lawyers to participate alongside those from other Islamic societies, which would actually be a big step forward.  Participation from the Islamic legal world in the development and functioning of international criminal law institutions is meager.  Buy-in from that sector would be critical to the tribunal&#39;s legitimacy.  Geographic placement in Cairo instead of The Hague would also be a symbolic and meaningful gesture.  The well-developed lawyer class in Egypt could be tapped to assist, as well as the penal system - keeping Islamic convicts in jail in an Islamic country.  But such a venture must be undertaken only with the caveats mentioned above fully in mind.<br />  <br />    To the extent that the crimes of the Gitmo detainees occurred after July 1, 2002, prosecution at the permanent International Criminal Court could be an option if its jurisdiction were altered to include crimes of terrorism.  That would be a contentious definitional quagmire.  But states parties to the Rome Statute that created the court would be well-served to tackle this issue and include it in the ICC&#39;s mandate for future use.  Domestic prosecution in the U.S. is fraught with difficulty - both legal and political.  The Obama Administration is apparently in talks with Governor Jennifer Granholm of Michigan to secure a prison facility north of Detroit to house the detainee population that remains.  It is also considering rescuing the military commissions system in Gitmo.  There are no good options at this point, only &quot;least worst&quot; ones.  Mssr. Mettraux&#39;s suggestion, echoing <a href="/forumy/2008/11/converting-gitmo-into-front-line-post.php">one I made</a> on these pages last year, may be a &quot;least worst&quot; option, but the perils of failure are still quite high.  That&#39;s no reason not to try, but it would be wise to remain cognizant of them.<br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J.

There has been much debate regarding the provisions of the new law and the votes cast leading to its approval were far from unanimous. I myself have expressed a very critical view on this matter.<br /><br />Public opinion regarding the presence of immigrants in the country has recently been fed with media reports on atrocious crimes committed by foreigners, exacerbating feelings of insecurity, fear, and even xenophobia among Italians. However, those who are benefiting from the services of immigrants, in the care for children and the elderly, in domestic work and other blue collar jobs that fewer and fewer Italians are willing to do, claim that injustice is being done to them in not reporting these aspects as well. Mass media operators have to take their responsibility in this regard.<br /><br />Today, Italy, which has been considered the "least fortress" among the countries in fortress Europe, is fast approaching the hard line that other states in the continent have long adopted and is even surpassing them. <br /><br />Before entering into the merits (demerits, I should say) of the law in question, it is important to mention very briefly the world situation and the context in which emigration and immigration are taking place today.<br /><br />In his report to the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9th September 2002, two years after the Millennium Declaration was adopted, then Secretary General Kofi Annan affirmed that "it is time to take a more comprehensive look at the various dimensions of the migration issue, which now involves hundreds of millions of people and affects countries of origin, transit and destination" and that "we need to understand better the causes of international flows of people&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;." <br /><br />It does not require a great effort to know that today people are fleeing from their countries due to wars, violence, violation of human rights, or famine, and other natural or man-made catastrophes. There are also those who leave their countries to be able to provide for their needs and those of their families, or simply to find better opportunities abroad. When they approach our national borders, do we ask what reasons moved them to be there, or are we so biased that we immediately regard them with suspicion and consider them a potential danger or threat, as our Instruction <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/migrants/documents/rc_pc_migrants_doc_20040514_erga-migrantes-caritas-christi_en.html"><span style="font-style:italic;">Erga migrantes caritas Christi</span></a> (The love of Christ towards migrants) warned against? I certainly do not mean to disregard the fundamental distinction and difference in legal treatment, as far as international law is concerned, between migrant workers, and refugees and asylum seekers. This disregard for differences was evident in the last cases of <em>refoulement</em> ordered by the Italian government to be inflicted on the people who were traveling by boat from the African coast towards Italy. We know that the principle of non-<em>refoulement</em> is essential in the protection of persecuted people. <br /><br />In any case, the <a href="http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/45/a45r158.htm">International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families</a>, adopted by the UN General Assembly resolution 45/158 of 18 December 1990 and in force since 1 July 2003, points out that "the human problems involved in migration are even more serious in the case of irregular migration" (Preamble). It therefore encourages "appropriate action &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; in order to prevent and eliminate clandestine movements and trafficking in migrant workers" (ib.). It is worth noting that the measures it deems should be taken, within the jurisdiction of each State concerned, are not directed to irregular migrants, but to those who cause the phenomenon. It in fact calls for "appropriate measures against the dissemination of misleading information relating to emigration and immigration" and the imposition of "effective sanctions on persons, groups or entities which use violence, threats or intimidation against migrant workers or members of their families in an irregular situation" (art. 68). It instead urges signatories to assure the protection of the fundamental human rights of irregular migrants (Preamble).<br /><br />Indeed, it affirms that "every migrant worker and every member of his or her family shall have the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law" (art. 24) and that appropriate measures should be taken "to ensure that migrant workers are not deprived of any rights &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; by reason of any irregularity in their stay or employment." <br /><br />The new Italian law, on the contrary, has tightened the norms related to the irregular status of foreigners, and has transformed irregular migration into a criminal offence instead of the administrative breach that it used to be. This change has significant repercussions in the concrete life of the migrant and his family. I consider it an "original sin" in the legislation on migration. To start with, it will be difficult for the irregular migrant to find lodging, since whoever rents an apartment to people in his condition runs the risk of imprisonment. It will be difficult if not impossible for him to send remittances back home through money transfer services, since this requires the presentation of a regular permit to stay in the country. This is a serious concern for the welfare of the families who have stayed behind in the home country and also deprives their countries of origin of that income that their poor economies badly need. <br /><br />The new law does not seem to be "family-friendly". Since all legal acts regarding the civil status requires the presentation of a regular permit to stay, an irregular migrant cannot be registered as a parent of a child who may even have a legal status in Italy. The child will therefore have to be identified as one with unknown parent(s). The authoritative financial newspaper "Sole 24 Ore" recently published, in its August 3rd issue a whole page on the serious problems deriving from the new law that will need to be solved.<br /><br />The same permit is necessary to be able to get married even to an Italian citizen. In its absence marriage has to be postponed, or celebrated abroad where marriages can be solemnized without an Italian permit to stay. However, the non-Italian party can become an Italian citizen only after two years of residence in Italy, or after three years of residence abroad. Fortunately, the presence of children, even adopted ones, can shorten the period of waiting by half. Questions regarding marriages are particularly sensitive for the Church in Italy because of the civil recognition given to religious marriages.<br /><br />Another point is the option for doctors to report to the authorities the presence of irregular migrants in the territory. The latter would be scared to approach public health services. This would make
them vulnerable to clandestine health care, exposing them to unsafe services, jeopardizing not only their own health but also that of the people around them, including Italians.<br /><br />Under the new law, an immigrant, whose permit to stay for employment reasons is not renewed within a period of six months, will be canceled from the National Register. Moreover, all those who have no fixed dwelling cannot be entered into the National Register. For civil purposes, these individuals do not exist. "Clochards" are instead obliged to be included in a special list at the Ministry of the Interior.<br /><br />Certainly, States have the right to control their borders and make sure that it is not a porous entry for criminals, who may also take advantage of the misery and desperate conditions of would-be immigrants. However, justice and solidarity are not antonyms, they come hand in hand, just like public security and welcome. National common good, in any case, has to be considered in the context of the universal common good. <br />  <br />    <br /><br /><em>Archbishop Agostino Marchetto is the secretary of the Vatican&#39;s Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People and Titular Archbishop of Astigi</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://mainelaw.maine.edu/faculty/profiles/friedman.jsp">James Friedman</a> of the University of Maine School of Law says that despite the potential political cost to President Obama of investigating the torture memos released by the former Bush administration, failure to act on the memos may take an even more costly toll on our identity and well-being as a nation....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/jamesfriedman.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n light of the current controversy concerning the responsibility of certain lawyers in the Bush administration for the torture of detainees, it is  worth recalling with some particularity the war crimes trials the United States initiated after World War II.  A primary purpose of the trials was to articulate values fundamental to the United States. <br /><br />The first trial of the Germans at Nuremberg was held before the International Military Tribunal (IMT) from November 1945 to October, 1946.  This was the trial of the "major German war criminals," the surviving leaders of Nazi Germany.  As Justice Robert Jackson, Chief American Prosecutor, put it, this was the first international criminal assize of governmental leaders in history.  The Charter of the Tribunal charged with waging aggressive war, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.  The charges were established by the Charter of the Tribunal.  The case was entitled <u>United States v. Goering, et al.</u><br /><br />One often comes across references to the "Nuremberg principles." While there is no fixed meaning to this phrase, I think it is most often used to connote that neither official governmental office nor superior orders constitutes a defense to charges of war crimes or crimes against humanity.<br /><br />At a philosophical level Nuremberg represents a rejection of the Germans' defense of legal positivism.  To put it simply, the Tribunal held that Nazi offenses were so egregious that even if they were "legal" when committed under the law of the Third Reich, the defendants should have known that mass murder and other atrocities were contrary to the "law of civilized nations."<br /><br />Less famous than the trial of the major war criminals before the IMT were a series of trials held before American Military Tribunals, also at Nuremberg, from October of 1946 to May of 1949.  These eleven cases, known as the Nuremberg Military Tribunal (NMT) cases, were brought against lesser known figures in the Nazi bureaucracy as well as private persons who committed war crimes or crimes against humanity.  The prosecutions were brought under Allied Control Council Law No. 10 which closely tracked the definitions of criminal conduct under the Charter of the International Military Tribunal.  Torture was categorized as a crime against humanity as well as a war crime under both the IMT Charter and Control Council Law No. 10.  <br /><br />Recently two of the NMT cases, "The Justice Case" (<u>United States v. Alstotetter,</u>) and "The Ministries Case" (<u>United States v. Von Weisaecker</u>) have been subjects of renewed interest among legal scholars.  "The Justice Case" involved the prosecution of individuals in the Reich Ministry of Justice for a variety of atrocities including everything from theft of Jewish property to death sentences for individuals who had opposed Hitler to mass murder.  In sum, certain defendants were convicted for what the American court called "the perversion of law and justice."  <br /> <br />"The Ministries Case" also involved lawyers.  Defendants Von Weizaecker and Woermann were high ranking legal advisers in the foreign office who advised the German Foreign Office that the deportation of French Jews to Auschwitz was lawful.  The American Military Tribunal convicted Von Weizaecker and Woermann of crimes against humanity for their disastrous legal advice. <br /> <br />The reason for the renewed interest in these cases has been the declassification over the last several years of legal memorandums written by lawyers of the Bush administration authorizing torture as a lawful means of interrogation.  The first and perhaps most notorious memo is dated August 1, 2002.  This memo was requested by Alberto Gonzales, then the President's lawyer.  Mr. Gonzales wished to know what constituted permissible interrogation techniques in light of the prohibition against torture in the U.S. criminal code (18 U.S.C. 2340-2340A) and the prohibitions contained in the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment, a multilateral treaty that had been ratified by the United States.  The memo was written by Justice Department lawyer John Yoo and signed by then Assistant Attorney Jay Bybee.  The memo constituted a formal legal opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) of the Department of Justice.<br /> <br />Another memo, recently declassified, was written in May of 2005.  This memo justified waterboarding as a lawful means of interrogation by CIA employees.  It was written by Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury, again as an opinion of the Justice Department's OLC.<br /><br />John Yoo's 2002 memo was bizarre.  Its most notorious conclusion was that for an interrogator's act to constitute torture it must cause pain "equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death."  Any physical abuse short of this was legally permissible.<br /> <br />What was as remarkable as Yoo's definition of torture was the legal authority he cited for the definition.  He relied upon <u>West Va. Univ. Hosps., Inc v. Casey</u>, 499 U.S. 83 (1991).  The issue in the West Virginia case was not torture, but the scope of coverage under Medicaid reimbursement.  This <em>non sequitur</em> citation was consistent with the quality of Yoo's legal arguments more generally.  <br /><br />He concluded in Part V of the memo that federal laws such as the anti-torture statute were unenforceable against executive branch officials as they would interfere with the President's ability to wage war.  Mr. Yoo did not speak to the language of the Constitution in Article One, section 8, clause 14 which states that Congress shall have the power "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces."  Nor did he address issues of military law.<br /><br />Yoo's torture memo was withdrawn as an OLC Opinion by Jack Goldsmith in 2004 before Goldsmith resigned from the Justice Department.   Torture did however occur during the period when the OLC Opinion was in effect.  Given the quality of Yoo's legal reasoning, it is hard to conclude Yoo's memo was written in good faith.  <br /><br />Unfortunately U.S. torture of detainees did not stop in 2004.  I mentioned the Bradbury memo of 2005 because the controversy over waterboarding apparently continues.  Bradbury concluded that waterboarding is a lawful form of interrogation under certain circumstances.  There is no reference in the Bradbury memo to U.S. convictions of  Japanese officers after World War II for waterboarding American POWs.<br /><br />One could go on about other Bush Justice Department memos, but my point is a simple one.  The United States stood for very different values in the Nuremberg prosecutions after World War II.  These values were more in line with Lincoln's sensibilities as Commander-in-Chief, when he refused to engage in reprisals for Southern war crimes against Union prisoners of war.   The question now is: shall we remain who we have professed to be?<br /><br />I realize the enormous political cost to the Obama administration of a public inquiry or criminal investigation of officials of the previous administration.  The dilemma is that to ignore U.S. memos authorizing torture may do greater damage to our identity and well-being as a nation.  To paraphrase Justice Brandeis, we wou
ld be tacitly endorsing "men of zeal without understanding."<br />  <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">James Friedman is Professor of Constitutional Law at the University of Maine School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anna Mandel, Boston College Law &#39;11, writes about her experience at the Latvian Constitutional Court....      <br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/RigaMay-June2009-021-779279.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:4 4 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/RigaMay-June2009-021-778879.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n the United States, state and federal courts are not bound by the precedents or laws of other jurisdictions. For example, the Supreme Court of Texas is not bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court of California. While courts are free to base their holdings on the logic used by courts in other jurisdictions, in my experience, they rarely do so. It is even rarer for American courts to refer to international law, although there are always exceptions, such as the US Supreme Court&#39;s referral to the Geneva Conventions in <u>Boumediene v. Bush</u> in a 2008 ruling concerning the treatment of Guantanamo Bay detainees and executive powers.<br /><br />Working at the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Latvia, I have encountered the opposite practice. The Constitutional Court heavily cites precedents from other countries - even non-European ones - and often relies on decisions from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). While these foreign precedents are not binding, it is an unwritten albeit accepted rule that such case law should still be cited. For example, although the Latvian Constitutional Court often cites decisions of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Lithuania due to the similarity of their political structures and legal issues, it also makes frequent reference to holdings from constitutional courts in France, Italy, and Germany.<br /><br />However, neither the Latvian Constitutional Court nor many other European courts will cite precedent from certain former Soviet block countries because their governments are viewed as being largely undemocratic.  This refusal sends a poignant message. Citation, in this sense, is internationally significant not only as precedent but also as a signal of approval or disapproval.<br /><br />Decisions from the ECHR and the European Court of Justice (ECJ) are binding upon the Latvian Constitutional Court according to Chapter VIII, Article 89 of the Latvian Constitution (the &quot;Satversme&quot;). It is perhaps due to the collective nature of the European Union that countries such as Latvia use case law from other European nations, but it also seems to be a way for newly-independent republics to gain &quot;best practices&quot; information from older states such as Germany and Italy.<br /><br />For example, in a 2004 immigration case, the Constitutional Court used German Administrative Law to support its holding that a claimant&#39;s immigration status may be appealed. The case, entitled &quot;On the Compliance of Section 61 of the Immigration Law with Article 92 of the Satversme,&quot; dealt with a claimant who sought appeal of her denial of permanent residence status by the State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior. The Court looked to the General Administrative Law of Germany for examples of administrative acts (verwaltungsakt), and ultimately found the Secretary&#39;s denial to be one. Therefore, according to Latvian Administrative Procedural Law, Part A, ch. 1, &Acirc;&sect; 1(3), the denial could be appealed. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/RigaMay-June2009-072-735367.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:4 10px 10px 4;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/RigaMay-June2009-072-734861.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>In the same judgment, the Court utilized Canadian law to support the notion that, although great deference is accorded to security officials such as the State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, security concerns cannot be manipulated so as to mitigate fundamental human rights and individual freedoms. The Court cited the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act of 2001 to bolster the idea that due process and procedural justice are fulfilled when an individual is accorded the right to appeal an administrative decision, even though the decision concerns national security.<br /><br />Likewise, Case No. 2001-08-01 (&quot;On Conformity of Article 348 (the seventh part) of the Civil Proceedings Law with Article 92 of the Republic of Latvia Satversme&quot;), a matter concerning one&#39;s right to a fair court, cited a legal concept from the German Federal Constitution as well as case law from the ECHR. While it is obligatory for Latvia and other signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights to adhere to ECHR precedent, they are not officially required to refer to other countries&#39; case law. However, constitutional courts such as Latvia&#39;s make their judgments seem more legitimate and acceptable in the European community when they do so. In the same case, the Constitutional Court cited a provision of the German Federal Constitution which supported abiding by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Latvian Constitutional Court, like The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany (Das Bundesverfassungsgericht), abides by international conventions to the extent that they do not limit the fundamental human rights expressed or implied in the national constitution. In this case, rulings from the ECHR and provisions in the German Federal Constitution were used to reason that although Article 92 of the Satversme grants a citizen the ability &quot;to protect his or her rights and legal interests in a fair court,&quot; it does not always guarantee a right to appeal in civil matters.<br /><br />Thus, it can be seen that the constitutional jurisprudence of Latvia is often closely-linked with the constitutional jurisprudence of other European and non-European nations. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Courts Crossing Borders</span>, John F. Stack, Jr. and Mary L. Volcansek wrote:<blockquote>[O]ne side effect of the move toward globalization has been the development of a network of judicial bodies with wide-ranging authority to alter domestic policy and domestic law. What began as a mere side effect is now...a major force in shaping legal practice in many regions of the world and in driving resolutions of human rights, economic, and even criminal issues.</blockquote>In addition to judicial bodies like the ECHR and the ECJ, case law and legal doctrine from individual countries is penetrating the constitutional jurisprudence of other independent nations such as Latvia. In this way, a micro-system of international jurisprudence is being built, where precedents from foreign nations are treated not as laws but as an adjudicatory code. The United States Supreme Court does not frequently borrow ideas from other nations&#39; constitutional courts, but perhaps this approach would benefit human rights and immigration policy laws in the future. <br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt" size="2">Sources:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.saeima.lv/Likumdosana_eng/likumdosana_satversme.html">Latvian Constitution</a> <br /><a href="http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/?lang=2&mid=19"><br />Case No.2004-14-01, Judgment in the Name of the Republic of Latvia, Riga, December 6, 2004, &quot;On the Compliance of Section 61 of the Immigration Law with Article 92 of the Satversme (Constitution).&quot;</a>  <br /><br /><a href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UNTC/UNPAN018406.pdf">Administrat&Auml;&laquo;laquo;vie Procedure Law, Part A, ch.1, &Acirc;&sect; 1(3)</a><br /> <br /><a href="http://www.iijcan.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2001-c-27/latest/sc-2001-c-27.html">Canadian Immigration &amp; Refugee Protection Act of 2001</a><br /><br />Photo credits: Anna Mandel</font><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org/user/borden"><strong>David Borden</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org">StoptheDrugWar.org</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/mexico-president-replaces-attorney.php">resignation</a> of Mexico&#39;s Attorney General in the midst of a <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/599/mexico_drug_war_update">veritable war</a> between the government and drug traffickers - and amongst trafficking organizations - is unlikely to change much in the grand scheme of things.  Prohibition will continue to divert billions of dollars from the licit economy into the organized criminal economy.  Criminal organizations benefiting from those funds will continue to fight each other for control of turf, continue to fight the government when they find it necessary, and continue to bribe government officials.  Mexican and American police organizations will continue to interdict some modest fraction of the drug supply before it reaches the consumers - <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/599/police_drug_corruption">some will resell it for personal profit</a> - and the cartels orchestrating the trade will continue to produce a quantity of cocaine and opium equal to the projected consumer demand plus the amounts they anticipate will be seized by law enforcement.  The net supply will continue to roughly equal the demand, and the frequent, sometimes addicted users will continue to use as they have done so all this time.  And cartel leaders will continue to plough their vast profits into a diversified set of businesses, both clean and dirty.<br /><br />The answer to the drug trade violence problem, the drug corruption problem, and even some of the public health problems related to drug abuse, is to end prohibition.  That means legalization, in some well thought out, controlled form.  Legalization would quickly put organized criminal groups out of the drug business, dramatically shrinking their total revenues and power.  But it would also free addicts from the incubus of the criminal underground, which currently afflicts them with debilitating-level high prices, overdoses and poisonings due to the lack of regulation, spread of infectious diseases through the encouragement of needle sharing, fear of not being able to secure one&#39;s &quot;fix,&quot; fear of getting caught, fear of seeking help.  Political leaders in the US don&#39;t like to talk about this, but <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/08/21/jorge-castaneda/the-eroding-support-for-the-drug-war/">more and more Mexicans are doing so</a>.<br /><br />In the meanwhile, it&#39;s an open secret that President Calderon&#39;s crackdown is partly the cause of the dramatic escalation in violence with its grim consequences, over 4,500 deaths so far this year alone.  As <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle_blog/2009/mar/31/obama_compares_drug_war_to_alcoh">President Obama commented for CBS</a> last March, &quot;[Calderon] has taken them on in the same way that when, you know, Elliot Ness took on Al Capone back during Prohibition, oftentimes that causes even more violence.&quot;  Short of ending prohibition, Mexico&#39;s choices may be limited to a return to the previous business-as-usual model with its lower level of violence, while fighting criminal corruption but more slowly and less dramatically; or an ongoing war that will claim tens or even hundreds of thousands more lives while failing to accomplish its goal.  Scholars have much to offer on the first path, though politicians for obvious reasons don&#39;t like to publicly give such ideas voice.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ippr.org/aboutippr/staff/?id=3178"><strong>Andy Hull</strong></a> [Senior Research Fellow, <a href="http://www.ippr.org/">Institute for Public Policy Research</a>]: &quot;Both the UK&#39;s domestic Security Service (MI5) and its overseas Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) are being <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/uk-police-to-investigate-claims.php">investigated</a> by London&#39;s Metropolitan Police to see if British agents have been complicit in torture.<br /> <br />I am reassured by contacts I trust that no British agent has actually committed torture. Some of those same contacts are, however, less convincing when asked whether they believe that in every situation in which a British agent may have had reason to suspect foreign security services of treating a suspected terrorist in a cruel, inhuman or degrading way, they have spoken out against that treatment as forcefully as they might have done, or as forcefully as international law demands.<br /> <br />There is no doubt that in interrogation chambers around the world a golden rule - the absolute prohibition of torture - has been broken. I hope that these police investigations in the UK confirm that none of those charged with protecting us here have effectively stood by in the knowledge that others were breaking that rule.<br /> <br />Civil libertarians cannot dodge an uncomfortable truth. UK intelligence liaison with the likes of the Pakistani ISI has saved British lives. We have good reason to believe that the ISI sometimes torture their detainees. They will always deny that, if asked.  Such an intelligence relationship therefore inherently runs the risk of being perceived as - or, worse, actually being - collusive in torture. The only way to avoid that risk would be to terminate the relationship. That could cost British lives.<br /> <br />Security professionals, on the other hand, cannot dismiss or dishonour the considered conclusions of those who, in the wake of the horrors of the Holocaust and the aftermath of World War II, signed the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, which forbids torture without exception. <br /> <br />Stopping bombs while standing up for what we believe in is no simple matter, but, in the end, legitimacy in security policy is a strategic neccesity, not a liberal nicety.&quot;<br />

		<title>Government&#039;s position on incompetency issue in bin al-Shibh case may justify pre-trial court intervention</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cato.org/people/tim-lynch"><strong>Tim Lynch</strong></a> [Director, Project on Criminal Justice, <a href="http://www.cato.org/">CATO Institute</a>]: &quot;Lawyers for Ramzi bin al-Shibh are doing what they are supposed to do - representing their client with zealous advocacy.  The lawyers are advancing three basic claims.  The first is a <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/guantanamo-detainee-lawyers-challenge.php">sweeping attack</a> on the Military Commissions Act.  The validity of the commission system is indeed dubious, but after <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/legalbriefs/salim_ahmed_handan-v-donald_rumsfeld.pdf">Hamdan</a> [CATO Institute <span style="font-style:italic;">amicus</span> brief], the court of appeals is not going to be entertaining such a broad-based challenge.<br /> <br />The second argument is that the commissions are not working properly.  In other words, even if the commissions are valid in theory, they have turned into &quot;political show trials&quot; in actual practice.  This argument may also have merit, but I suspect the court of appeals will want to wait until after an actual trial takes place to hear this serious and disturbing charge.  A post-conviction appeal will be the proper time and place to hear arguments about &quot;show trials,&quot; rather than before trial.<br /> <br />The third argument is that bin al-Shibh is incompetent to stand trial because he is unable to assist in his own defense.  Here the issue if competency seems inextricably intertwined with the prisoner&#39;s treatment after capture, but before trial (the interrogation [torture?] phase).  The government&#39;s stance on this point seems very weak: The defense must demonstrate incompetency, but anything pertaining to the prisoner&#39;s treatment/interrogation is out-of-bounds - not discoverable and not admissible.  This is where the court of appeals is most likely to intervene in this case prior to trial.&quot;<br />

		<title>Oklahoma court ruling against abortion access restrictions is a victory for women&#039;s health and the rule of law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/profile/stephanie-toti"><strong>Stephanie Toti</strong></a> [Staff Attorney, <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">The Center for Reproductive Rights</a>]: &quot;A state district court in Oklahoma sent a clear message last week when it <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/oklahoma-judge-finds-broad-abortion-law.php">struck down a law</a> that imposed numerous restrictions on access to abortion services.  Enacted in 2008, the law&#39;s restrictions included a provision that would have prevented a woman from obtaining an abortion unless she first submitted to an ultrasound and listened to her doctor describe the ultrasound image to her in detail; a provision that would have prevented a woman from suing her obstetrician for malpractice if the obstetrician intentionally withheld information from her about fetal anomalies that may have led her to consider having an abortion; and a provision that would have restricted access to the abortion pill.  After some of these provisions failed to meet the deadline for advancing in the legislature, they were combined with other, more popular, provisions into a single omnibus measure.  That action was taken despite an Oklahoma constitutional imperative that a single piece of legislation address no more than a single subject.<br /> <br />The court&#39;s <a href="/pdf/okabortiontranscript.pdf">ruling</a> [PDF file] that the omnibus measure violated the Oklahoma Constitution&#39;s single-subject rule was a victory not just for women&#39;s health, but also for the rule of law.  It sent a clear message that the agenda of a small special interest lobby cannot trump constitutional values and democratic norms.  Around the country, those with an anti-choice agenda have tried repeatedly to muscle-through legislation that does not have the support of a majority of the electorate.  Perhaps the most prominent example of this occurred in South Dakota in 2006.  The South Dakota legislature enacted a complete ban on abortion, but voters overwhelmingly rejected this action, overturning the ban through a referendum.  The law in Oklahoma fits this pattern.  Its most restrictive provisions could not have passed on their own, so they were combined with more popular provisions, to force legislators to pass them despite a lack of public support. <br /> <br />Had the Oklahoma law been allowed to take effect, it would have threatened women&#39;s continued access to abortion in a state where onerous legal burdens and intimidation by anti-choice extremists have already whittled the number of licensed abortion providers down to three.  Moreover, it would have demeaned women, embodying a presumption that women are not capable of making informed medical decisions independently.  The law would have enabled the State, and certain obstetricians, to control the information that a woman receives about her pregnancy - forcing some women to receive information that they consider irrelevant and preventing others from receiving information that they would consider crucial.  Unable to pass this extreme and offensive law using proper methods, anti-choice legislators resorted to unconstitutional tactics. <br /> <br />The court&#39;s ruling striking down the omnibus measure vindicated the rule of law in Oklahoma and will serve to ensure that the Oklahoma legislature abides by the Oklahoma Constitution, rather than the whims of a special interest lobby with an extremist agenda.  Thankfully, it will also ensure that women in Oklahoma will continue to have access to safe and legal abortion services, and will be treated with dignity and respect under the law.  For those reasons, it should be applauded.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Stephanie Toti was the lead attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights on the case of <u>Nova Health Systems d/b/a Reproductive Services v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.steveemerson.com/about/"><strong>Steven Emerson</strong></a> [Founder, <a href="http://www.investigativeproject.com/">The Investigative Project on Terrorism</a>]: &quot;Attorney General Eric Holder has <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/doj-to-open-investigation-into-cia.php">appointed</a> a career Federal prosecutor from Connecticut to lead a preliminary investigation into whether criminal laws were broken by US intelligence operatives involved in post-9/11 terror suspect interrogations.  In April, President Obama went to CIA Headquarters and <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/04/21/obama_visits_cia_headquarters_to_reassure_agency/">assured</a> the Agency&#39;s career employees that no CIA officers would face investigation or prosecution for conducting interrogations while following Department of Justice (DOJ) legal advice and policy.  Whether Holder is demonstrating a degree of independence from his boss the President or is simply following backdoor directives from the White House, pursuing even a preliminary inquiry into terrorist interrogations is wrong-headed.<br /><br />Holder and the administration claim this initial inquiry is simply an effort to discover if there is evidence that CIA and other US intelligence officers may have gone beyond the scope of what was then legally permissible under policies set by the Department of Justice under the Bush administration.  Those policies, set forth in several previously classified memos that were made public by the Obama administration, were the result of a multi-tiered and complex legal review by high-level government attorneys from the DOJ and the Intelligence Community.<br /><br />Ironically, in an April 16th <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/April/09-ag-356.html">press release</a> issued by the DOJ announcing the release of the interrogation memos, the DOJ seemingly closed the door on any investigation or prosecution of officials involved in the interrogations. <br /><br />Holder has also stressed that intelligence community officials who acted reasonably and relied in good faith on authoritative legal advice from the Justice Department that their conduct was lawful, and conformed their conduct to that advice, would not face federal prosecutions for that conduct.<br /><br />The Attorney General has informed the Central Intelligence Agency that the government would provide legal representation to any employee, at no cost to the employee, in any state or federal judicial or administrative proceeding brought against the employee based on such conduct and would take measures to respond to any proceeding initiated against the employee in any international or foreign tribunal, including appointing counsel to act on the employee&#39;s behalf and asserting any available immunities and other defenses in the proceeding itself.<br /><br />To the extent permissible under federal law, the government will also indemnify any employee for any monetary judgment or penalty ultimately imposed against him for such conduct and will provide representation in congressional investigations. &quot;It would be unfair to prosecute dedicated men and women working to protect America for conduct that was sanctioned in advance by the Justice Department,&quot; Holder <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/April/09-ag-356.html">said</a>.<br /><br />This April 16 press release, and the purported policy noted therein, should have been the end of this matter.  Yet four months later, the Attorney General launched the current &quot;preliminary&quot; inquiry.  Holder claims the scope of the investigation is to learn if any intelligence officers may have gone beyond the scope of what the memos authorized.  But a recently released CIA Inspector General report covering interrogations from September 2001 to October 2003 clearly indicates that interrogation activities were monitored and documented.  The terrorist interrogations were not conducted in a rogue cowboy-style environment, but rather were limited actions conducted by highly trained professionals whose actions were subject to close internal review. <br /><br />In fact, one intelligence contractor conducting interrogations was found to have crossed the line and was prosecuted and convicted in 2007 for his misdeeds.  In 2004, the CIA referred some 19 cases of suspected abuse to the DOJ for review and possible prosecution.  While no other prosecutions stemmed from those referrals, the referral and review process itself demonstrated the agencies involved took these matters very seriously and that strong internal oversight did exist.  So, if the interrogation program had significant and meaningful real time oversight that addressed suspected abuse and did properly punish at least one egregious violator, why is there a need now to reopen and renew a review process that goes in exactly the direction the Attorney General and the President said they would not go as recently as last April?<br /><br />Even assuming this current preliminary inquiry discovers what prosecutors believe might be actionable evidence that some interrogators violated the law, the legalities involved make a successful prosecution potentially very difficult.  Former Federal counter-terrorism prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has addressed these issues at length in <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=MGExNzdjMTMyODc4NTRhMmU3MzllMGZhZDNiZDRmMTI=">National Review Online</a>.  His comments from August 11:<br /><blockquote>...the Justice Department has quietly conceded that federal law makes torture exceedingly difficult to prove (i.e., federal law ensures that the ignominious label &quot;torture&quot; is reserved for especially heinous, malevolent abuse). Not only must there be an infliction of extreme physical or mental suffering; the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant specifically intended to torture his victim. In congressional testimony, Holder himself has admitted that if a government official had a purpose different from causing extreme pain, he could not be guilty of torture even if he actually caused extreme pain.</blockquote><br />Reacting to the potential of being investigated and prosecuted for doing what they perceived at the time to be their lawful duty to their country - a duty that frequently put their lives at risk - CIA and other intelligence personnel involved in these interrogations are reportedly seeking personal legal representation to defend themselves.  This is highly reflective of the state of morale among intelligence operations officers.  Their primary focus, for a long time, will be legally protecting themselves rather than effectively conducting their missions.  This harms national security.  The Attorney General should have followed his own directive in his department&#39;s April 16 press release: &quot;It would be unfair to prosecute dedicated men and women working to protect America for conduct that was sanctioned in advance by the Justice Department.&quot;&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.christinaabraham.com/">Christina Abraham</a></strong> [Civil Rights Director, <a href="http://www.cairchicago.org/">Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) - Illinois</a>]: &quot;The newly adopted amendment to Rule 611 of the Michigan Rules of Evidence (MRE 611) is constitutionally questionable.  The portion at issue reads:<br /><blockquote>The court shall exercise reasonable control over the appearance of parties and witnesses so as to (1) ensure that the demeanor of such persons may be observed and assessed by the fact-finder, and (2) to ensure the accurate identification of such persons.</blockquote>The controversy began after a Michigan judge dismissed a woman&#39;s case when she refused to remove her face-veil (niqab), which she said she wore pursuant to her religious beliefs.  In response to the dismissal, the woman <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/michigan-supreme-court-issues-order.php">filed</a> a federal complaint against the judge seeking a declaratory judgment.  The federal court refused to exercise jurisdiction over the woman&#39;s case, finding that deciding the case would undoubtedly &quot;increase friction in the relationship between our state and federal courts.&quot;  See <u>Mohammad v. Paruk</u>, 553 F. Supp. 2d 893, 900 (E.D. Mich. 2008).  The amendment to MRE 611 was proposed shortly thereafter, and as a direct response to the incident.<br /><br />The rule raises questions of constitutional validity because, although neutrally worded, its intent was to allow the court to control the religious dress of Muslim women, and is therefore discriminatory.  Moreover, the rule is not the least-restrictive means of ensuring that the trier of fact can make credibility determinations or accurately identify witnesses.  Further, the rule will likely result in the marginalization of Muslim women, as they will be denied meaningful and fair access to the courts unless they choose to compromise their sincerely-held religious beliefs - a decision no one should have to make.  <br /><br />It is well established that religious freedom is not an absolute right, but nonetheless one of the most important rights enshrined in the Constitution.  If the government seeks to curtail such a right in any way, the courts typically subject it to a strict scrutiny standard.  This means that the government has the burden of proving that its measures are the least restrictive means to attain a compelling government interest.  Under the Michigan Constitution, the government cannot substantially burden a person&#39;s religious practice unless the provision can pass the strict scrutiny test.  See <u>McCready v. Hoffius</u>, 459 Mich. 131, 143-44 (1998).  The Supreme Court has also upheld this standard, although holding in one case that this does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with valid and neutral laws of general applicability.  <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/494/872/case.html">Employment Division v. Smith</a>, 494 U.S. 872, 878-79 (1990).  It is important to note, however, that the Michigan courts have not chosen to apply this Supreme Court nuance in interpreting the rule.      <br /><br />In any case, it is highly arguable that the new amendment to MRE 611 is neutral.  The Michigan Supreme Court itself acknowledged that the proposal came about in response to a case in which a state judge was sued for dismissing a woman&#39;s case after she had refused to remove her &quot;hijab&quot; (it was, in fact, a niqab that the woman refused to remove) for religious purposes.  See Proposed Amendment of Rule 611 of the Michigan Rules of Evidence, ADM File No. 2007-13 (proposed December 9, 2008).  Thus, it is clear that the impetus of the proposal was a desire to permit state judges to require the removal of religious clothing, and particularly those of Muslim women.  <br /><br />The question then remains, is this amendment necessary to achieve a compelling government interest?  There is no question that the government has a compelling interest in being able to assess the credibility of witnesses.  This is one of the most important functions of the trier of fact.  However, there is an abundance of evidence that supports the argument that this particular amendment is not necessary because there are other, less restrictive, means to maintaining the trier&#39;s ability to assess witness credibility.  In fact, empirical studies have shown that being able to see the face of the testifying witness does not help credibility determinations, and may even hurt them at times.  These studies indicate that triers are better able to tell if a witness is lying by focusing on language and voice inflection, rather than on facial expressions.  <br /><br />The other issue raised by the proposal is the court&#39;s ability to identify the witness.  The niqab covers a woman&#39;s face, making it difficult to identify her unless she removes it.  Muslim women who practice wearing the niqab are able to remove the veil in the presence of other women.  Allowing a woman to be identified in private by a female officer of the court would be a sufficient accommodation.  Thus, the proposal is not the least-restrictive means to achieving this interest.  In fact, in many cases witness identification has been modified to accommodate national security interests (often for foreign countries such as Israel), protection of witnesses, and other various reasons.  Accordingly, providing for accommodation for religious purposes as well is not such an unbearable burden for the court.<br /><br />The real issue at hand is not whether accommodation is possible - it is possible - the issue is whether the Michigan Supreme Court wants to grant an accommodation for Muslim women wearing niqab.  But not accommodating Muslim women will likely result in their disenfranchisement, as they will be more hesitant to bring their legal issues to court.  Controversy over Muslim women&#39;s dress is a global issue affecting not just the United States, but nations across Europe and the Middle East.  Many, including some Muslims, find the practice of wearing niqab unnecessary, unreasonable or even offensive.  But this is all beside the point.  The point, as the founding fathers made abundantly clear, is that it is not the job of the government to dictate to individuals what and how to believe.  My reservations about the niqab do not give me the right to impose my beliefs upon another, at least not through government.  <br /><br />Moreover, marginalizing Muslim women on the basis of their dress will not result in their adoption of mainstream practices.  Rather, it will prevent them from having access to fundamental components of society - components they have a right to, and that they pay taxes to fund and support - such as the justice system.  This has already been the ironic result of nations that have banned the hijab and niqab in public forums.  In their misguided attempt to &quot;liberate&quot; Muslim women by forbidding them to dress according to their religious beliefs, they have further marginalized Muslim women by forcing them to choose between their religious beliefs and their desire to contribute as functioning members of society.  In the United States, the courts have long recognized that the two are not mutually exclusive, and that nobody should have to make such a decision unless there really is no other alternative available.  For Michigan courts, it appears there are other alternatives; they merely chose to overlook them by adopting this amendment.&quot;<br />

		<title>Controversy over judges&#039; asset disclosure forces Indian Supreme Court to place information online</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prashant_Bhushan"><strong>Prashant Bhushan</strong></a> [Convenor, <a href="http://www.judicialreforms.org/home.htm">Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms</a>]: &quot;The issue of <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/india-supreme-court-judges-to-disclose.php">asset disclosure of judges in India</a> arose out of a Right to Information Application filed by one Subhash Agarwal with the Supreme Court seeking to know if judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court were complying with the 1997 &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; adopted at the Chief Justices Conference, which required judges to disclose their assets in confidence to their Chief Justices. The Public Information officer of the Supreme Court (endorsed by the Chief Justice) responded by saying that this information does not exist in the Supreme Court registry. <br /><br />In the appeal before the Central Information Commission it transpired that the Supreme Court was making a distinction between information with the Chief Justices office and that of the Supreme Court. The CIC rejected this distinction and directed the infromation officer of the Court to obtain this information from the Chief Justices office and provide it to the RTI applicant. This prompted the Supreme Court to file a writ petition in the Delhi High Court to challenge the CIC order. Though the CIC had merely directed release of the information about whether judges were disclosing their assets to the Chief Justice, the Supreme Court argued that this would pave the way for people seeking actual asset disclosures under the RTI Act. They claimed that asset disclosure was exempted under the RTI Act on the basis that this information was disclosed by judges to the Chief Justice under a &quot;fiduciary relationship&quot; and that this was &quot;personal information having no relationship to public interest and would cause an unwarranted invasion of the privacy&quot; of judges. The Court further claimed that the Chief Justice was not a &quot;Public Authority&quot; amenable to RTI requests under the RTI Act. <br /><br />While the High Court heard submissions in the matter and had reserved judgment, the issue became a major controversy after the government introduced a bill in Parliament providing for asset disclosure of judges, but with a clause which said that the asset disclosure would remain hidden from the people and that judges would not be made liable for any action on the basis of their disclosure. This led to a furor in Parliamant and MPs cutting across party lines unanimously condemned this clause, forcing the government to withdraw the bill. <br /><br />Soon thereafter, a couple of High Court judges publicly declared their assets while publicly dissociating themselves from the Chief Justice of India&#39;s stand that asset disclosure would lead to harassment of judges at the hands of disgruntled litigants. Many former judges and senior jurists also publicly aired their views in favour of public declaration of judges&#39; assets. The issue snowballed into a major public controversy with the media almost unanimously ranged against the Chief Justice&#39;s view. Ultimately the Chief Justice had to yield to unrelenting public pressure and the Supreme Court announced that the asset declarations of the judges would be put up on the website.<br /><br />This issue also caught the pubic and media imagination because it was associated with the RTI Act which has become one of the most  popular pieces of legislation of recent times. The Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms took up this campaign although we have stated that our principal demands remain:<br /><blockquote>1, Setting up of independent and credible institutions for the appointment of judges and for entertaining complaints against them.<br /><br />2. Overruling of the Veeraswami judgement which prohibits the criminal investigation of judges without the written permission of the Chief Justice of India.<br /><br />3. The amendment of the Contempt of Courts Act by removing &quot;scandalising and lowering the authority of the Court&quot; from the definition of Criminal contempt.<br /><br />4. The full application of the RTI Act to the judiciary which is being thwarted by self serving rules framed by the High Courts and self serving judgements which have effectively stonewalled information about the adminstrative functioning of the judiciary. </blockquote>Meanwhile, the public controversy about judges&#39; asset disclosure has brought the issue of Judicial Accountability into public consciousness and onto the agenda of Parliament. That is the salutary contribution of this controversy.&quot;<br />

		<title>Government laptop border searches a slippery slope to accessing citizens&#039; electronic communications</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/profile/barry-steinhardt"><strong>Barry Steinhardt</strong></a> [Senior Advisor, <a href="http://www.privacyinternational.org">Privacy International</a>]: &quot;Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials have a legitimate <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/dhs-announces-increased-oversight-for.php">power to search</a> for contraband goods crossing national borders. But searching laptops is not a search of goods. It is a search of a storehouse of information - private correspondence, financial and medical records, business records. It is a search of speech protected by the First Amendment to the US Constitution.<br /><br />CBP claims to be able to conduct these searches for any reason or no reason.  Countless numbers of travelers have their laptops searched and even seized at our nation&#39;s borders without any requirement that the government has reason to suspect them of illegal activity.<br /><br />In the last session of Congress Senator Russ Feingold (D - WI) introduced the Travelers&#39; Privacy Protection Act. The bill, which should be reintroduced and passed in the current session, would require that CPB have the Constitutional requirement of probable cause before conducting a laptop search or seizure. <br /><br />Beyond searches of laptops, the CBP policy raises the question of what other powers should be accorded to the government to search private information crossing the nation&#39;s borders. The amount of private speech and information imported by laptop is only a fraction of that which crosses international boundaries every day via the Internet. <br /><br />If CBP can without cause or Constitutional predicate search a physical vessel for transporting private information, why shouldn&#39;t it be able search the private electronic data transported across electronic frontiers? <br /><br />I hope the prospect of Custom&#39;s officials searching electronic communications gives the reader pause. But so should the search of a laptop without cause. The same private information and speech is at risk. Only the means of transport is different.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.lpct.org/Party.html">Joshua Katz</a></strong> [Legislative Director, <a href="http://www.lpct.org/index.html">Libertarian Party of Connecticut</a>]: &quot;The Libertarian Party of Connecticut joined with the state&#39;s Green Party to <a href="http://brennan.3cdn.net/b4ba9cbfee47b4517a_wbm6b9058.pdf">file a lawsuit</a> [PDF file] in federal court challenging the state&#39;s Citizens&#39; Election Program.  We maintained that this program was unconstitutional in that it imposed asymmetrical burdens on minor parties vis-a-vis the Republican and Democratic parties in elections within the state.  While billed as an opportunity for political unknowns without access to fundraising to compete on an equal footing with more established candidates, the effect of the law was rather to give additional advantages to established candidates and incumbents.  We were gratified that the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-court-rules-connecticut.php">agreed with us</a>, maintaining that the law imposed a severe burden on minor party candidates without imposing a similar burden on candidates from major parties.<br /><br />The Citizen&#39;s Election Program (CEP) offered public funding for candidates for various offices, with the amount of funding dependent on both the office sought and the amount of money already raised.  In addition, a candidate who hoped to seek CEP money had to comply with various restrictions on his own fundraising.  Because of the large amount of money that a candidate needed to raise before qualifying for this public funding, the impact was to simply magnify any difference in fundraising ability present at the outset of the race, not to reduce it.  An unknown candidate would have great difficulty meeting the required hurdles, while his better known opponent would easily qualify.  As if this weren&#39;t enough, though, the law went further and actually allowed some major party candidates to qualify without demonstrating any particular level of public support, while all minor party candidates had to jump over numerous hurdles.<br /><br />It might be objected that failing to qualify for funding is not a hindrance, just the absence of aid, and that anyway, Libertarians oppose public funding of campaigns, and so it is odd (to say the least) that we would complain about not being able to qualify for such funding.  Such an analysis, though, misses a crucial point.  A candidate who does not qualify for funding, while his opponent does, is not left no better or worse off than he would be if such funding did not exist - he is much worse off, as his opponent now has more money to campaign against him.<br /><br />Now, the hurdles have been justified on the basis of the need to save money.  After all, the state cannot be expected to fund anyone who announces that he is running for office, and even qualifying for ballot access is a relatively low hurdle - being on the ballot does not, according to this argument, a viable candidate make.  So the fundraising requirement and other hurdles limit public funding to those who are viable.  Yet consider that most minor party candidates run in elections with at least 3 candidates, and that the hurdles amount to requiring 20% support before qualifying for funding.  In a tight race, a candidate winning with 35% or 40% would not be unlikely.  This is particularly true for minor party candidates (whereas a Republican cannot expect his Democratic opponent and his Green opponent to split the vote evenly, a Libertarian may hope that his two opponents will), and so a 20% requirement would necessitate, before qualifying for funding, that the candidate be more than halfway to victory!  This is after the minor party candidate spent most of his initial funding, and a great deal of time, achieving ballot access, which his opponents were not required to do.  Furthermore, he must achieve this without public funding, after both of his opponents received public funding!<br /><br />By striking down this law, the court took a great step forward in ensuring open access to the political process for Connecticut residents.  Unfortunately, many Connecticut elected officials, all from major parties, have stated that they will seek ways to keep the laws in effect, both by appealing and by creating new laws which skirt the judge&#39;s decision.  What needs to be addressed, though, is the state&#39;s web of special privileges for some parties at the expense of others.  The last thing we need is a new program that will reinforce these privileges by other means.  A plan of action for opening access to the political process would need to include entirely scrapping the CEP, followed by a fundamental revision to the laws for ballot access.  While some would simply drop ballot access requirements, many believe that doing so will simply crowd the ballot, making it hard for serious candidates to be heard.  A reasonable solution, though, does exist - all parties could be subjected to equal ballot access requirements for each office.  In any case, removing public financing of campaigns is an important step.  It must be remembered that public financing laws are written, considered, and voted on by incumbents from major parties.  It would be unreasonable to expect those incumbents to pass laws making it easier for challengers to succeed, and in particular for minor parties to succeed.  More generally, is it possible to not understand the serious dangers presented by increased political control of elections?  When incumbents make decisions about which candidates receive what funding, rather than those decisions being made in a decentralized manner by each citizen who decides to contribute money to a campaign, how can a fair outcome be expected?&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ratchasima.net/"><strong>Awzar Thi</strong></a> [Member, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>, Hong Kong]: &quot;A court in Thailand inched closer to its counterparts in neighboring Burma last week when it <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/thailand-court-sentences-political.php">sentenced</a> an anti-coup protestor to 18 years in prison. The Bangkok criminal court convicted Daranee Chanchoengsilapakul on three counts of lese majesty arising from statements she made in a rally to support the ousted prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. In the speech, she connected the 2006 military takeover to the palace, and drew parallels between events in her country and the fate of the monarchy in Nepal, which was abolished in 2008 after a popular uprising. <br /><br />The charges were brought against Darunee following a complaint from Sondhi Limthongkul, the leader of the army-sponsored anti-Thaksin movement that occupied the prime minister&#39;s offices for three months and the national airport for about a week last year. Neither he nor any of his cohorts have been brought to justice over those events, despite the massive criminality involved, including assaults and alleged murders, wanton vandalism, and theft of public and private property. While targeting opponents for alleged crimes of thought and speech, Sondhi and allies continue to spread their own vitriol through a variety of broadcast and Internet media. <br /><br />The judges made little pretense of conducting the trial fairly. They denied bail three times, reportedly because they were worried that Darunee&#39;s release would affect public sensibilities, which is not a justifiable reason under the Criminal Procedure Code. They closed the court on grounds of national security. Given that in Thailand even the trials of alleged terrorists have been held in open, it is hard to identify the superior threat that the diminutive 46-year-old former journalist may have posed, even with the nickname &quot;Da Torpedo.&quot; Presumably the real reason for closing the doors was that the accused chose to fight the charges; defendants in lese majesty cases typically just give up, take the rap and then approach the king to seek forgiveness and obtain a pardon. Darunee will not be doing that. She told journalists that she is going to appeal the sentences. <br /><br />Darunee joins <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/ua/mainfile.php/2009/3140/">Suwicha Thakor</a>, who earlier this year received ten years for posting offensive images of the king on the Internet, as one of Thailand&#39;s prisoners of conscience. Others awaiting trial over similar alleged offenses include Chiranuch Premchaiporn, the webmaster of an independent Internet news site, <a href="http://www.prachatai.com/english/">Prachatai</a>, who is being prosecuted under the country&#39;s ambiguous Computer Crime Act. Chiranuch did not say or do anything herself; her &quot;crime&quot; was not having removed sensitive comments from her website quickly enough. The Asian Human Rights Commission, a Hong Kong-based regional advocacy group, has <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2009statements/2209/">written</a> to two United Nations special rapporteurs seeking their involvement on these and other cases. <br /><br />Thailand&#39;s judiciary has again shot itself in the foot in its hurry to defend increasingly outdated social arrangements. A court has for the umpteenth time in the last couple of years succeeded in injuring itself while scrambling to protect an entrenched political order that is less and less relevant to a fast-changing society. Although the disservice the judges did to themselves is in certain ways detrimental to everyone in Thailand - declining respect for their institution only further undermines the rule of law - it has also done a service by having the opposite effect from what it intended. Instead of silencing critics, it has triggered a new round of debate and comment at home and abroad about the limits to what can be said, let alone done, in the kingdom. The more courts try to stop people in Thailand from saying what they think, the more people will stop to ask why.&quot;<br />

		<title>KindHearts ruling exposed Treasury Department&#039;s unconstitutional freezing of Muslim charity assets</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.nela.org/NELA/index.cfm?showfullpage=1&event=showAppPage&pg=semwebCatalog&panel=browse&ft=SWOD&bb=aut&aut=3884"><strong>Sahar Aziz</strong></a> [Pro Bono Counsel, <a href="http://www.bordc.org/">Bill of Rights Defense Committee</a>]: &quot;A recent <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/10171360/KindHearts-v-Geithner">ruling</a> [PDF file] by a federal district court signifies an encouraging shift for Muslim charities in the United States.  For many such non-profits, mere investigation by the Department of Treasury&#39;s Office for Asset Control (OFAC) into their humanitarian activities abroad has become a kiss of death.  <br /><br />Under the USA PATRIOT Act, Treasury&#39;s authority to designate organizations suspected of supporting terrorism as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (&quot;SDGT&quot;) pursuant to <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/terror/terror.pdf">Executive Order 13224</a> [PDF file] was expanded to asset blockage pending mere investigation into whether an organization meets the standards for an SDGT.  This authority enables OFAC to effectively shut down charities pre-emptively, leaving a cloud of suspicion over anyone affiliated in any way with their work (e.g., as donors, staff, or beneficiaries).  Hence the ultimate question of whether a particular charity actually supports terrorism quickly becomes a moot point.<br /><br />The ruling relates to KindHearts, which was founded in January 2002 with the stated purpose of providing humanitarian aid in the Middle East and elsewhere after OFAC shut down the largest American Muslim-affiliated charities in the fall of 2001.  Exercising its broad authority, OFAC froze KindHearts&#39; $1 million of humanitarian donations in February 2006 pending investigation as to whether it provided material support to Hamas.  The freeze was imposed just weeks after <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/26/AR2006012600372.html">Hamas won parliamentary elections</a> in Gaza.  Indeed, KindHearts had been donating humanitarian aid to poor Palestinians in Gaza, and others in impoverished areas across the globe, for four years with no objection from the US government.  <br /><br />One especially troubling aspect of the KindHearts case is that its founders purposely took great care to ensure compliance with anti-terrorism financing laws, sought guidance from the US Department of Treasury during the organization&#39;s inception, and proactively implemented Treasury&#39;s voluntary <a href="http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/docs/tocc.pdf">guidelines</a> [PDF file] for charitable organizations.  These efforts were ultimately futile, raising concerns throughout the <a href="http://www.charityandsecurity.org/">nonprofit secto</a>r.  Rather than reflect legitimate efforts to combat terrorism, this authority penalizes charitable giving by Muslims in America to Muslims abroad and <a href="http://www.aclu.org/intlhumanrights/nationalsecurity/39251res20090616.html">politicizes humanitarian charity</a>.<br /><br />More than three years after the asset block, the US District Court for the Northern District of Ohio recently <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/10171360/KindHearts-v-Geithner">held</a> [PDF file] that KindHearts has &quot;a fundamental right to be informed on what basis and for what reasons the government deprived it of its assets and shut down its operations.&quot; The Court found that KindHearts never received timely or adequate notice of the basis for the investigation or why it was &quot;preliminarily&quot; designated.  The charity thus was unable to prepare a meaningful defense to the government&#39;s allegations.  <br /><br />Moreover, the inadequate notice came after long and inexplicable delays by OFAC.  As a result, the court concluded that OFAC failed to provide KindHearts with pre- and post-deprivation process in violation of Fifth Amendment due process rights.  Specifically, the allegations required the government to provide an estimate of the approximate amount of allegedly illegal donations and to whom the donations went.  The government also has a duty to promptly provide a charity the unclassified administrative record on which it relied.  While OFAC eventually provided such information to KindHearts, the Court reproached OFAC for a 30-month delay in violation of KindHearts&#39; due process rights.  <br /><br />Representing a dramatic change, the Court also found that OFAC&#39;s asset-blocking constitutes a seizure subject to Fourth Amendment analysis.  Equating OFAC&#39;s preliminary investigation prior to an asset freeze pending further investigation to traditional law enforcement investigatory activities, the Court found that OFAC is required to <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judge-rules-probable-cause.php">obtain a judicial warrant based on probable cause</a> prior to issuing a blocking order.  <br /><br />Finally, the Court found that OFAC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in limiting the extent to which a charity can access its frozen funds to compensate counsel.  Though a charity does not have a constitutional claim to its own funds to pay counsel, the court reasoned, OFAC&#39;s decision to approve $27,040 - a meager amount in light of the complexity of the case and extensive delay caused by OFAC - increased the risk to KindHearts of erroneous deprivation in violation of Fifth Amendment due process rights.  <br /><br />In a post-September 11 judicial and statutory landscape that has favored government counterterrorism authority at the expense of individual rights, the thoughtful <u>KindHearts</u> ruling spells a long overdue change.  In June 2009, President Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-at-Cairo-University-6-04-09/">acknowledged</a> that &quot;in the United States, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m committed to working with American Muslims to ensure that they can fulfill zakat.&quot;  Whether his administration will act on his commitment in practice remains to be seen.&quot;<br />

		<title>DC Circuit&#039;s ruling in Comcast case properly eliminated outdated market control limits for cable companies</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sheppardmullin.com/attorneys-596.html"><strong>Christopher Huther</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.sheppardmullin.com/attorneys-771.html">Jeremy Keim</a> [Partner and Associate, <a href="http://www.sheppardmullin.com/">Sheppard Mullin Richter &amp; Hampton, LLP</a>]: &quot;On August 28, 2009, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/dc-circuit-strikes-down-fcc-rule.php">issued an opinion</a> in <u>Comcast Corporation v. FCC</u>, which vacated the FCC&#39;s 30% limit on the number of subscribers to which a cable operator could offer service.  This cap, created in 1993, was initially intended to promote competition in the cable television market and increase consumer access to diverse network programming.  <br /><br />In 1993, however, the cable television market was dominated by large companies that had exclusive monopoly franchises in particular geographic areas.  Since that time, the cable television landscape has changed dramatically.  Now, direct broadcast satellite companies provide programming to approximately one-third of subscribers, consumers have access to significantly more channels of programming than ever before, competitive wireline providers are expanding rapidly, and alternate transmission methods of video media are playing ever-increasing roles in the lives of consumers.  Despite these fundamental changes, however, the FCC refused to alter or eliminate the 30% subscriber limit to better reflect market realities.  Moreover, the FCC applied the cap not only to incumbent cable providers, but to competitive wireline providers - telephone companies providing fiber optic video services - which, ironically, decreased competition by limiting the total number of subscribers to which these new providers could offer service.<br /><br />Citing to the &quot;substantial competition&quot; in the cable television marketplace today, the DC Circuit struck down the FCC&#39;s 30% limit as arbitrary and capricious.  The Court found the record &quot;replete with evidence of ever increasing competition among video providers,&quot; and properly observed that &quot;the broadcast industry is dynamic in terms of technological change; solutions adequate a decade ago are not necessarily so now, and those acceptable today may well be outmoded 10 years hence.&quot;  Refusing to ignore this &quot;crucial fact about the nature of the video industry,&quot; the Court vacated the FCC&#39;s 30% subscriber limit.  <br /><br />Though the DC Circuit did not &quot;think that prospect looms large,&quot; the FCC will have another opportunity to justify the 30% limit.  In weighing this decision, the FCC would be wise to remember that competitive markets consistently prove themselves superior to regulatory fiat in fostering investment and innovation and in protecting consumers&#39; interests and serving their needs.  Providers have a strong incentive to provide desirable programming that consumers want.  Otherwise, their competitors will do so.  Fostering competition is the best way to ensure that consumers are given access to the greatest amount of programming diversity and to meet the goals of the 1992 Cable Act.  The FCC thus should avoid placing unnecessary restrictions on cable operators - particularly competitive wireline providers - who, by definition, have never possessed bottleneck monopoly power over access to video programming.  In light of the Court&#39;s ruling and the realities of the cable market, it will be very difficult for the FCC to justify any future cap-based regulation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.intstudies.cam.ac.uk/staff/joffe-georgea.html"><strong>George Joff&eacute;</strong></a> [Research Fellow, <a href="http://www.intstudies.cam.ac.uk/">Centre of International Studies</a>, <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>]: &quot;Despite all the <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/scotland-justice-minister-defends.php">fulmination</a>, protest and anger, the return of Abdelbasset al-Maghrahi to Libya draws a definite line under what has proved to be a very worrisome case &#8212; at least for the Scottish justice system.  Mr. al-Maghrahi was convicted in a special Scottish court, organised at Camp Zeist &#8212; an abandoned NATO base &#8212; in Holland, of responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing in 1988.  The case had been problematic from the start.  The Libyan authorities had first refused to hand over the two accused &#8212; Mr. al-Maghrahi and Mr. al-Khalifah al-Fahima &#8212; despite United Nations sanctions and then only agreed because the court that was to try them was constituted outside direct British or American control.  Then there had been problems over the evidence, with one key witness being disqualified on the grounds of mental instability.  And the verdict itself had raised almost as many questions as it had answered, with the bench admitting that some of the evidence barely passed tests of credibility.<br /><br />In short, Mr. al-Maghrahi had been convicted only on the balance of probabilities, not because of overwhelming evidence of his guilt.  Doubts about the rightness of his conviction surfaced almost immediately afterwards.  They were raised covertly in Scottish legal circles, despite the rejection by the Scottish law-lords of Mr. al-Maghrahi&#39;s appeal.  They were raised overtly by the Libyan leader, Colonel Qadhafi, who promised to arrange Mr. al-Maghrahi&#39;s release as an innocent victim.  They were common knowledge within the corridors of power in Whitehall and in Edinburgh, even if official disquiet was kept suppressed.  Then, as time went on, particularly after Mr. al-Maghrahi became terminally ill, they became part of the day-to-day diplomatic exchanges between Britain and Libya. The Libyan authorities made it clear that they would not forgive Mr. al-Maghahi&#39;s death in Scottish custody and that British-Libyan relations would suffer severely if it occurred.<br /><br />In such circumstances, it is hardly surprising that, when pushed, the Scottish authorities, no doubt with considerable resentment at the position in which they had been put by Whitehall, decided to take the one legally impeccable exit available to them, compassionate release.  Since Scotland acquired its own autonomous government a decade ago, there have been thirty applications for compassionate release, twenty-three of which have been granted.  In Mr. al-Maghrahi&#39;s case, no doubt, the issue was eased by his willingness to abandon his appeal, instigated by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission&#39;s finding that there were at least six grounds for legitimate concern about the original judgment.<br /><br />In other words, the release on compassionate grounds tied up a whole series of loose ends.  A potentially unsatisfactory conviction was ended without the embarrassment of a successful appeal and potential diplomatic and commercial tensions were dissipated without the British government being directly involved, the Scottish authorities, in effect, being forced to take over Whitehall&#39;s responsibilities.  It would have been a solution worthy of Machiavelli himself, were it not for three further considerations.  First was the undoubted anger of the families of the American victims which the Obama administration has adroitly diverted onto Scotland.  Second was Libya&#39;s maladroit handling of Mr al-Maghrahi&#39;s return which will, no doubt, be amplified by the celebrations for the fortieth anniversary of the Libyan revolution.  And third is the unfortunate fact that we shall never know what really happened at Lockerbie nor, indeed, who was really responsible.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://johnwesleyhall.com/"><strong>John Wesley Hall, Jr.</strong></a> [Former President, <a href="http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/freeform/publicwelcome?opendocument">National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers</a>]: &quot;This fiscal year, through August 11, 2009, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tells us that there were about 1,000 <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/dhs-announces-increased-oversight-for.php">laptop computer searches</a>, only 46 of which were in-depth.  This out of 221 million <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/pr_1251393255852.shtm">border crossings</a>.  It simply is not possible for CBP to widely search laptop computers at the border.  Too many people are lined up coming in to search everybody intensively, let alone their computers and electronic media too.<br /> <br />CBP is searching laptop computers, a least in the litigated cases that I have seen, only for child pornography.  And they at least appear to be limiting these searches to those whom they have reasonable suspicion to believe are potentially transporting child pornography into the country so as to target their resources.  But what happens when these searches begin to occur based on political speech because one opposes a government position or happens to disagree with the opinion of the customs agent making the decision (&quot;the discretion of the officer in the field&quot;)?<br /> <br />All the case law to this point is clear that reasonable suspicion is not required for a laptop search. No case has held that it is, and I don&#39;t think that any will.  That should not be surprising considering the Supreme Court held in 2004 in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/541/149/case.html">United States v. Flores-Montano</a> that the reasonable suspicion requirement is limited to searches of the person and not personal belongings, and in 1971 that pictures and motion pictures could be examined at customs in<a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/402/363/case.html"> United States v. Thirty-Seven Photographs</a>.  <u>Thirty-Seven Photographs</u> predated the widespread use of truly portable laptop computers by more than a decade. <br /> <br />Can the reasonable suspicion standard of the border search law of searches of the person be readily imported into computer searches?  Not likely. <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/473/531/case.html">United States v. Montoya De Hernandez</a> from 1985 left open the question as to whether reasonable suspicion was required for intensive border searches of the person, including strip and body cavity searches (n. 4: &quot;It is also important to note what we do not hold. Because the issues are not presented today we suggest no view on what level of suspicion, if any, is required for nonroutine border searches such as strip, body-cavity, or involuntary x-ray searches.&quot;). <br /> <br />The technology did not exist until the last four years, but what about <a href="http://fourthamendment.com/blog/index.php?blog=1&title=tsa_to_have_revealing_body_scanner_runni&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1">backscatter technology</a> that permits a virtual strip search at the border?  Virtually all persons subjected to it have no idea that it shows what one looks like under his or her clothes.  It is not a mere x-ray.  Should something that intrusive require reasonable suspicion?  It doesn&#39;t right now at the airports that use it for standard airport security - at least not yet because nobody has litigated it of which I am aware.  That should prove to be an interesting case.  But then again, it might not because the targets of the search are simply not going to be embarrassed by a virtual strip search that they don&#39;t even know is happening. <br /> <br />But should Fourth Amendment protections be premised on what the target knows is happening?  No, because you have a right to be free from an unwarranted search of your house, belongings, or conversations when you don&#39;t know that it is happening.  It is what the government is doing to your privacy that tips the balance in favor of the citizen, not what the target knows at the time.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.wsgr.com/wsgr/DBIndex.aspx?SectionName=attorneys/BIOS/8681.htm&extprint=yes"><strong>Nema Milaninia</strong></a> [President, <a href="http://www.iaba.us/home.aspx">Iranian American Bar Association</a>]: &quot;The recent appointment of Ayatollah Sadegh Ardeshir Larijani as the new head of Iran&#39;s judiciary is unlikely to remedy the <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/iran-official-acknowledges-torture-of.php">dire judicial and prison conditions</a> prevailing in Iran and exacerbated by recent <a href=" http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/08/iran-begins-trial-of-25-more-election.php">turmoil</a> following the election.  If anything, it is likely to frustrate efforts by the United Kingdom and its allies to secure the release of foreigners and dual-citizens being detained in Iran for political reasons.<br /><br />Sadegh is one of the Kennedys of Iran.  The major difference is that while the Kennedys tilt toward the liberal side of the political spectrum, there is no doubt that the Larijani&#39;s rear to the hard, hard right. <br /> <br />Ali Ardeshir Larijani, Sadegh&#39;s brother, is the current Speaker of Iran&#39;s Parliament and formerly the Secretary of Iran&#39;s National Security Council and a Presidential candidate in 2005.  Sadegh&#39;s other brother is Mohammad Javad Larijiani, the former Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs.  After them are Bagher Larijani (the chancellor of Iran&#39;s most prestigious medical school) and Fazel Larijiani (Iran&#39;s cultural attach&eacute; in Ottawa). <br /> <br />Together, the family of five brothers along with their father, a senior cleric in Iran, and their cousin, a prominent rightist politician and member of parliament, have been called one of Iran&#39;s &quot;dynasties of power.&quot;<br /> <br />Unlike his brothers, however, Sadegh is inexperienced in politics and possesses very little support amongst either the clergy or Iran&#39;s legal elite.  While Sadegh was a member of Iran&#39;s Guardian Council, the political body charged with interpreting Iran&#39;s Constitution, he was the quiet member who never engaged a argument and rarely took forceful positions on any matter.  Rather his rise to power is in due completely to his obedience to Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the perception that he is malleable and can be manipulated. <br /> <br />Yet even despite his obedient personality, Sadegh comes in at a time when Iran&#39;s judiciary is dominated by hard-lined clerics and where the prisons and the prosecutors&#39; offices are controlled by members of Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence.  This dichotomy in power has effectively allowed Iran&#39;s security and paramilitary forces to nullify the power of Iran&#39;s courts.<br /> <br />Although Iran&#39;s judiciary has legal authority over detention centers, the IRGC and Intelligence office have created secret prisons where political prisoners and prisoners of conscious and opinion are generally held. <br /> <br />In some instances, including in Iran&#39;s version of Abu Gharib, Evin prison, the Ministry of Intelligence has even created a &quot;prison within a prison,&quot; the notorious Sector 209.  In Sector 209, political prisoners and prisoners of conscious in Iran are detained, often in solitary confinement, and tortured if not killed.  Thus, despite efforts by Sadegh&#39;s predecessor, Ayatollah Seyyed Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, to prohibit extra-judicial killings through the enactment of tougher regulations, the practice has continued, unabated and without either oversight or transparency. <br /> <br />Despite these dire conditions, Sadegh has already taken steps to emulate hard-line positions supported by the conservative establishment.  He has ardently supported recent restrictions dramatically limiting the independence of Iran&#39;s Bar Association and allowing judicial officers to disbar Iranian lawyers who may take on controversial clients, including political opponents and human rights defenders.  He has also actively preached that the legitimacy of a government is derived by its adherence to Islamic norms and not the popular vote.  These positions resonate deeply with hardliners in Iran, including President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.<br /> <br />With current power struggles raging in Iran between members of the IRGC and the conservative cleric establishment, it is unlikely that Sadegh will bridge the gap between the letter and practice of Iranian law.  Iran&#39;s regulations protecting detainees from torture or arbitrary detention are more or less complete.  Yet corruption within the judicial ranks and political cronyism has altogether made the law no more than language without meaning. <br /> <br />Sadegh might be entering the judiciary with the power and influence accompanying the Larijani name.  But he is unlikely to take any steps to rock the boat for real judicial or legal change.  Today, that power rests in the hands of the IRGC and Iran&#39;s intelligence establishment.  So long as those responsible for arrests, interrogations, detentions, and prosecutions are controlled by unelected gangs, Larijani is no more than a talking figurehead without the strength or desire needed to reinvigorate the rule of law in Iran.&quot;<br />

Ms. Dark was arrested at the French border in 1989 and charged with a drug offense. After a trial in France, she was found not guilty and released from jail, and she returned to her home in the UK.  At that point, Ms. Dark likely had no reason to expect that her case in France would proceed any further.  From her perspective as a citizen of the UK, the term &quot;acquittal&quot; probably meant finality just as it would to any person with a common law orientation.  Indeed, at that time, except in very rare circumstances, an appeal from an acquittal was not possible in the UK, and the finality of such judgments was recognized as a fundamental component of due process and liberty guarantees. <br /><br />However, the inquisitorial system in France permits the prosecutor to appeal acquittals in certain cases as a matter of course.  Therefore, the fact that the prosecutor appealed Ms. Dark&#39;s case would not have been unusual in the French system, and likely would have been expected in certain cases.  But, only individuals familiar with France&#39;s inquisitorial system would have had this knowledge or expectation, and that category of individuals seemingly did not include Ms. Dark.  Moreover, to compound the discrepancy between the UK and French criminal justice systems, it appears that the French courts did not provide Ms. Dark with notice of the appeal.  In 1990, Ms. Dark&#39;s acquittal was overturned.  She was convicted in absentia and ordered to serve six years for the drug offense.  In 2005, France obtained an EAW for Ms. Dark&#39;s surrender to serve the sentence that had been imposed 15 years earlier.<br /><br />Ms. Dark first became aware of the EAW when she was arrested in Spain in 2008.  She spent one month in prison in Madrid before the Spanish court refused to execute the EAW because of unreasonable delay and the potential for unfairness to Ms. Dark.  She was released and returned to the UK, where she was arrested yet again.  The UK court similarly refused extradition due to the passage of time between the conviction and the securing of the EAW.  The UK court was also concerned that Ms. Dark would likely suffer undue prejudice upon retrial if extradited.  To date, the EAW is still outstanding and Ms. Dark&#39;s ability to freely move about the EU has been significantly curtailed because authorities in EU Member states are required to detain her upon entry into their countries.  <br /><br />There are at least four options available to Ms. Dark at this juncture:<br /><br />1.  She can remain in the UK secure in the knowledge that she will not be extradited.  But, according to Ms. Dark, this option isn&#39;t practical because she has an ailing father in Spain whom she would like to visit and care for.  Although a court in Spain has refused to extradite Ms. Dark, there is no guarantee that she would not be detained again in Spain because the EAW is still in effect.<br /><br />2.  She can allow herself to be extradited back to France.  Pursuant to Article 5 (1) of the EAW Framework Decision, she is guaranteed an opportunity to apply for retrial if the sentence or detention order was imposed in absentia.  However, this is another problematic course of action for Ms. Dark because her original trial occurred 20 years ago and the potential for witness unavailability and stale evidence is very high.<br /><br />3.  She can allow herself to be extradited back to France on the condition that she can return to the UK to serve her sentence pursuant to Article 5(3) of the EAW Framework Decision.  This option is not acceptable to Ms. Dark because from her perspective an acquittal means a final judgment that a person is not guilty.  Of course, in France an acquittal may not necessarily represent the final judgment in a criminal case.<br /><br />4.  She can petition the French courts to dismiss the EAW, thus releasing Member States from the obligation to detain her.  This appears to be the approach she is taking at this point, but there is no clear process for an individual to raise such challenges short of surrendering to the EAW.  Instead, the EAW contemplates dialogue and cooperation between judicial authorities in Member States.  Therefore, it is unclear whether this approach will be effective and until the EAW is dismissed each Member State is required to comply with its terms.<br /><br />While this unfortunate scenario presents several issues that will undoubtedly need to be resolved within the EAW Framework Decision, at the heart of the case is a collision between two justice systems: the inquisitorial system which permits retrials after acquittal and the adversarial system which, for the most part, adheres to principles of double jeopardy.  The EAW certainly cannot take into account all of the procedural disparities among criminal justice systems across the EU.  But it can and should provide mechanisms (short of surrender) to obtain dismissal of warrants issued based upon processes that were undertaken without notice to the person and which a reasonable person under the circumstances would not expect to occur.  Fairness and justice dictate that diverging procedural approaches should not be taken advantage of to the detriment of Member State citizens.<br />  <br /><br /><br /><em>Raneta Lawson Mack is a professor at the Creighton University School of Law and author of </em>Comparative Criminal Procedure; History, Processes and case Studies<em> (W.S.

Bachir Ghoumid endured 40 hours, Saliha Lebik: 30 hours, Radicha Alam: 25 hours.  None of them had a lawyer present. None of them were told they had the right to remain silent. All of them experienced sleep deprivation, disorientation, and intense psychological pressure.  What else do they have in common?  All of them were held under special counterterrorism laws.<br /><br />These stories are the norm - not the exception &#8212; of terrorism investigations in France. Terrorism suspects are held in police custody for four days (up to six days in some cases), and are only permitted to see a lawyer for 30 minutes after three days of questioning.  Uninformed of their right to refuse to answer questions and often denied the right to contact family or friends, those arrested under suspicion of terrorism are subjected to often oppressive questioning in sessions whose only record is what the police themselves create. <br /><br />Proposed reforms to improve safeguards on police custody in France would leave this regime intact. The L&Atilde;&copy;ger Committee, tasked with drawing the outlines of a broad reform to criminal procedure and which issued its final report on September 1, has recommended narrow adjustments to the rights of those held in police custody that neither go far enough nor apply to everyone.  Far from creating a "habeas corpus &Atilde;&nbsp; la fran&Atilde;&#167;aise," in the Committee's words, the reforms would still leave France far short of its obligations under international human rights law.<br /><br />The Committee proposes reforms for ordinary criminal cases that would allow suspects to see a lawyer after 12 hours in custody, rather than the current 24 hours, in addition to a visit at the outset of detention.  The person's lawyer would have access to the transcripts of interrogations for the meeting after twelve hours, which is not the case under the current rules.  If police custody is extended beyond 24 hours, the lawyer would be present during all further interrogations. <br /><br />Under the reforms, suspects in drug trafficking cases would be able to see a lawyer for the first time after 48 hours, a day earlier than permissible under current law.  When it comes to terrorism cases, however, the Committee has ruled out any changes to the police custody regime lest the justice system be rendered "dangerously powerless."  Yet there is no reason to believe that a properly conducted investigation would be compromised by ensuring that terrorism suspects have the right to a proper defense.<br /><br />Any system of justice must be measured not only by its efficiency but also by its fairness.  International fair trial standards, set out in binding treaties such as the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, require that all persons suspected or accused of a crime have the right to defend themselves.  Access to a lawyer during police custody and the right to remain silent are integral to that right. <br /><br />The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has said that the UK violated the European Convention when it denied access to a lawyer even for 24 hours of questioning in terrorism investigations because the rights of the defense could be "irretrievably prejudiced" in that time.  The United Nations Human Rights Committee urged France in July 2008 to ensure that terrorism suspects have access to a lawyer "without delay", be told of their right to remain silent under questioning, and be brought "promptly" before a judge.<br /><br />Prompt access to a lawyer is also a fundamental safeguard against torture and ill-treatment.  In the course of our research on counterterrorism laws and procedures in France, Human Rights Watch learned of disturbing accounts of physical violence and other ill-treatment in police custody.  A half-hour meeting with a lawyer three days after arrest is no protection against such abuse.  That is why the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture has urged France repeatedly since 1996 to allow all suspects in police custody to see a lawyer from the very outset of detention.  <br /><br />The L&Atilde;&copy;ger Committee and the Outreau Commission rightly recommend that all police interrogations be recorded regardless of the nature of the offense under investigation. This would be an improvement since terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime cases are currently excluded from this obligation.  But audio- and video-taping, vital as they may be, are no substitute for the presence of proper legal counsel at a critical stage in criminal proceedings. <br /><br />Acts of terrorism are horrifying crimes and law enforcement authorities have a clear obligation to prevent and investigate these crimes and to prosecute suspects.  But denying due process to those accused of terrorism is unnecessary and counter to France's fundamental values and international obligations. <br /><br />A true "habeas corpus &Atilde;&nbsp; la fran&Atilde;&#167;aise" cannot allow for half-measures or exceptions.  All suspects in police custody, no matter the alleged crime, should have the right to see a lawyer immediately, to have access to a lawyer during interrogation, and to be informed of their right to remain silent.  The French government will need to look beyond the Leger Committee if it is committed to real criminal justice reform.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Judith Sunderland is senior researcher for Western Europe at Human Rights Watch.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/researchpost.php?postid=427">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that outside observers purporting to assess adherence to the &quot;rule of law&quot; in Iraq should pay less attention to compliance or non-compliance with formally enacted codes, and more to social practice... <br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hamoudi.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>here is a conventional wisdom concerning law and social order that is prevalent in the West.  This is that somehow once a law on any particular subject is enacted, social compliance necessarily follows.  The only real hurdle, then, is to make sure the law is passed according to proper procedures, in accordance with what H.L.A. Hart would refer to as "the rule of recognition" whereby a pronouncement is recognized to be "law."   <br /><br />While it is true that anyone who considered this proposition carefully would immediately find problems with it (jaywalking in New York City and marijuana consumption in California are both technically against the law), it nonetheless informs much of American policy in Iraq. This mistaken assumption underlay much of the lawmaking work of the Coalition Provisional Authority ("CPA"), the US/UK institution that ran Iraq from the end of the invasion until the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty.  <br /><br />The CPA took great care to ensure that its legislation, generally characterized as CPA Orders, was issued in accordance with accepted procedure.  There were justifications (albeit controversial ones) for the Orders based on international law, and the CPA took steps to ensure that the Orders were published in the Official Gazette, which is under normal circumstances the final step to the enactment of law.  They even put these issues of the Gazette online so that there could be no question of their issuance.  To some extent this worked quite well, in the sense that Iraqi lawyers generally concede that the orders issued by the U.S led coalition remain valid Iraqi law unless repealed.  This, it was assumed, was all that was necessary, the rest being up to the Iraqis.  <br /><br />The track record of the CPA Orders, as measured by actual effect on social practice, is not terribly good.  Very few are paid much attention to; most Iraqi lawyers and judges barely know what they say.  Rather than revise the original (and clearly mistaken) assumption of an inherent link between law and social practice, instead the reaction has been to tie all of this to the "rule of law", which apparently it is assumed we in the United States have and Iraq does not.  Simply train them in the "rule of law" and then the link between law and social practice will appear in Iraq as it does in the United States.  <br /><br />Recent Iraqi legislation demonstrates this to be almost as na&Atilde;&macr;ve as the first assumption.  It not only ignores San Francisco marijuana, New York City jaywalkers, and moderate amounts of speed limit violations just about everywhere; it also seems to ignore the realities of Iraq, where some laws are enforced.  The police arrest people every single day for basic felonies.  Even lesser laws such as traffic laws have some force.  I have been shocked, for example, by the growing level of compliance in Iraqi Kurdistan with seat belt laws.  Where wearing a seat belt was at one time to self-identify as a foreigner (thereby leaving the expatriate Iraqi like me in a bit of a pickle: either risk your life without a seat belt or expose yourself as a foreigner and risk your life that way), now drivers wear seat belts almost universally.  The passengers do not &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; for some reason the law does not encompass them &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; but there would be no reason to believe that they would not wear them if the law was amended to require it.  At the same time, other laws (among them, a ban on smoking also enacted in the Kurdish region) are universally ignored.  <br /><br />So it would be a mistake, then, to view the near universal noncompliance with the smoking ban, compare it as against the near universal compliance of similar bans in the United States and Europe, and conclude that the discrepancy had to do with some ephemeral notion of the rule of law, as our policymakers seem to want to do.  One may as well conclude that there is a deficiency in the United States with the rule of law as Iraqi anti-drug laws are vigorously enforced and nobody smokes pot on the public streets in the Karrada neighborhood of Baghdad as they might in Haight-Ashbury.  Rather, in gauging social compliance in any society it is important to look deeper than the mere fact of enactment to its broader circumstances.  Again, while this may seem obvious, almost banal, to some, clearly our country has not learned any such lesson in its dealings abroad.<br /><br />The reality is that Iraqis care little about smoking and tend to dismiss discussion on the dangers of smoking as a concern of rich nations with fewer dangers.  These laws are passed more as a signal by a legislature to demonstrate acceptance of growing global standards than anything else.  The idea that anyone would think to follow them because people in Paris do is absurd.  Iraqis are, however, (at least in the north) becoming increasingly aware of the dangers of not wearing a seat belt.  The deaths by car accident are astonishingly high, and this has resulted in a social campaign against speeding.  When this is accompanied by a law, one might well expect broader compliance.  As for the CPA, I suppose it should be obvious what the problems are going to be when a foreign government attempts to impose law, even uncontroversial law, on a populace by enacting Orders in a foreign language and then assuming that they will be enforced because they are, after all, "law."  <br /><br />I do not mean to suggest that all developing and developed nations may be treated uniformly. Clearly the resources for enforcement and the respect given to the government in pronouncing law, vary widely across the globe.  My only point is that sometimes, we might do well to pay a little less attention to enacted codes, and a little more to social practice, when trying to understand why societies react to different laws in the way that they do.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Haider Ala Hamoudi is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

		<title>Fair or Foul? Inheritance-Driven Adult Adoption Within Same-Sex Partnerships</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.aspx?fac=134">Terry Turnipseed</a> of Syracuse University College of Law says that the increasing frequency of adult adoption within same-sex partnerships as a means of ensuring the receipt of inheritances may have set in motion an irreversible legal freight train that won&#39;t stop until same-sex marriage is legalized in every state....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/terryturnipseed.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->T<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->here is a growing trend in this country&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;startling to many&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;of adopting one&#39;s adult lover or spouse for various (although mostly inheritance-based) reasons. Courts all around the country are struggling to figure out whether or not these adoptions should be upheld. Though few seem to realize it right now, the outcome of this battle might well impact millions of American lives.<br /><br />On July 23, Maine&#39;s Supreme Judicial Court approved the adult adoption by Olive Watson of her lesbian lover. Now deceased, Olive was the granddaughter of Tom Watson, one of IBM&#39;s founders and the highest-paid CEO in the 1930s, and the daughter of Tom Watson, Jr., who took over the reins of IBM from his father in 1952. Watson Jr. established a very large trust fund for the benefit of his children and grandchildren. He stipulated that his children would receive assets during their lifetimes and that his grandchildren would receive large trust payments after the passing of Watson Jr. and his wife and upon reaching the age of 35 years old. The fortunate adoptee and benefactor of last Thursday&#39;s court ruling, Patricia Spado, may now be in line to be an unanticipated grandchild-beneficiaries of the Watson Jr. trust.<br /><br />Olive simply wanted what many want for their loved ones: to ensure that her lover Patricia was well cared for in case Olive died. As such, she adopted the older Patricia. Activists in the gay community said that the case showed just how far same-sex couples must go to obtain the rights that those legally able to marry are routinely granted. At the time, obviously, Maine did not allow same-sex marriages.<br /><br />For homosexuals in jurisdictions that do not recognize same-sex marriage (or something close that yields many of the same benefits and burdens), adoption is one darn sure (or darn close to darn sure), albeit drastic (read &quot;irrevocable&quot;), way to ensure an inheritance. There are many contract-based methods that are available to any competent individual who has reached the age of majority: wills, trusts, life insurance, retirement plans, powers of attorney for financial and health care matters, etc.; but all are subject to the claims of heirs-at-law (those who would take probate property absent a will) of undue influence against the partner-recipient of the assets. These suits are more successful than one might imagine since anti-gay biases are often quite evident in jury verdicts. If a lover or spouse is a &quot;child&quot;, however, this status keeps biological relatives from even having the right to sue.<br /><br />In many states, however, there could well be one pretty serious repercussion to all of this for the adopter and the adoptee: the possibility of an incest conviction resulting in serious jail time. Think about it: the person is having sexual relations with his or her legal child. Is that not incest? At least 25 states and territories, representing over 140.8 million people (approximately 46 percent of the total population) in the U.S., are subject to laws that include the adopted parent/adult child relationship within the definition of incest. However, even if a state agrees that this behavior is incest, there is now some question regarding whether the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court case <span style="font-style:italic;">Lawrence v. Texas</span> (which struck down an anti-sodomy law) might now protect this behavior, preventing these people from being successfully prosecuted for this type of incest. This will be the first post-<em>Lawrence</em> Supreme Court individual sexual privacy rights case. Given the three new Justices on the Court since <em>Lawrence</em> was handed down, no one can be certain how such a case will be decided.<br /><br />In no less than four instances, Justice Scalia&#39;s dissent in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lawrence</span> (in which he was joined by three other Justices) warned that adult incest can no longer be outlawed by state or federal governments: with the decision in <em>Lawrence</em>, Justice Scalia lost his incest repellant. Indeed, if this type of incest is now protected by the U.S. Constitution, might the whole house of sexual-crime cards fall with it? Along with this strand of incest laws might also go laws addressing the so-called "core" incest (sexual relations between a biological parent and an adult child or adult biological siblings), adultery, bestiality, masturbation, fornication, bigamy, and possibly even the brass ring of same-sex marriage protection.<br /><br />Because of its potential importance to the issue of whether same-sex marriage is constitutionally protected, everyone should be paying much more attention to these adult adoption battles that are occurring with increasing frequency across the nation. Olive and Patricia may well have unwittingly set in motion an irreversible legal freight train that may not stop&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;for better or worse, for richer or poorer&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;until same-sex marriage is available in every state. <br />    <br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Terry L. Turnipseed is an associate professor at Syracuse University College of Law. His full-length article on adult adoptions of lovers and spouses can be downloaded <a href="http://ssrn.com/author=452494">here</a>.</span><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ingrid Burke, Pitt Law &#39;11, attended an &quot;alternative&quot; G-20 event on world hunger and economic decline which was hosted by the People&#39;s Summit on Pittsburgh&#39;s North Side...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/wh2-747544.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:4px 10px 4px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/wh2-747542.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>his week I was given the opportunity to attend several G-20 alternative/resistance events in Pittsburgh.  On Monday night, I opted for a lecture and panel discussion hosted by the People&#39;s Summit entitled &quot;Ending World Poverty, Reversing Economic Decline in Our Communities.&quot;  The People&#39;s Summit, a three-day event held in various locations around the city, was intended to provide a forum for the discussion of the various &quot;social, economic, and political problems facing the world.&quot;  All of the events were scheduled as part of a collaborative effort among Pennsylvania State Senator Jim Ferlo (D) and several local advocacy groups. Monday night&#39;s event featured keynote speaker Privilege Haangandu, a debt program officer for Jubilee Zambia and the Jesuit Center for Theological Reflection in Zambia, in addition to several guest panelists representing various advocacy groups.  <br /><br />I was surprised to find that the theater was very crowded, but I found a seat just in time to hear Haangandu speak about his belief that no two individuals share the same conception of Utopia.  Although this theory was aimed at explaining the G-20&#39;s inability to help impoverished Zambian farmers, it occurred to me throughout the course of the evening that his thoughts would have served as sound advice to the People&#39;s Summit organizers in their initial planning of the event.  What had started as a narrowly-focused discussion on the G-20&#39;s capacity to address the needs of developing nations generally, and Zambia specifically, devolved by way of the panel discussion into a random series of political statements.<br /><br />Common to every panelist and audience member was the desire to improve living conditions for people of all walks of life around the world. The keynote speaker, the panelists, and the audience members seemed to be in agreement with regard to the fact that there is suffering in the world, that suffering is bad, and that people who aren&#39;t suffering as badly should make it their business to minimize the suffering of those who have it the worst.  The participants differed, however, with regard to their definitions of suffering and victims involved.  Essentially, each seemed to envision a world aspiring toward a unique conception of Utopia.<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/wh4-780889.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 150px; height: 200px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/wh4-780887.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Haangandu came from Zambia to Pittsburgh to raise awareness of the plight of Zambian farmers and to use them as illustrations of the gaps left in the developing world when a handful of individuals from the wealthiest nations make decisions affecting everyone.  In his view, the heads of state at the G-20 summit have only speculation as a tool for determining the best interests of developing nations such as Zambia, and speculation is not sufficient to improve living conditions for the world&#39;s poorest people.  Haangandu rejected the idea that African interests will be represented by South Africa&#39;s President Kgalema Motlanthe, stating that South Africa perceives itself as superior to the continent&#39;s other nations, and that even the poorest South Africans turn up their noses at Zambians.  In his view, South Africa&#39;s central agenda at the G-20 will be to &quot;rub us [Zambia] down.&quot;  He emphasized that developing nations such as Zambia need not just legislation allocating foreign aid dollars, but a platform from which all voices can be heard.  <br /><br />Haangandu&#39;s lecture was met with overwhelming praise by the audience, and I took it as a sign that a great night lay ahead.  However, the constant repetition of the slogan, &quot;local is global and global is local,&quot; should probably have tipped me off that the panel discussion would take us toward purely local issues.<br /><br />The panel consisted of John Canning, a neighborhood activist based in Pittsburgh&#39;s North Side and a member of North Side United and the North Side Leadership Council; Carl Redwood, a neighborhood activist representing the interests of the Hill District by way of his position as convener of the Hill District Consensus Group; Molly Rush, co-founder of the Thomas Merton Center, famed for having beaten the nose cone of a nuclear weapon with a hammer in protest of nuclear war in 1980; Tim Stevens, Chairman of the Black Political Empowerment Project and former president of Pittsburgh&#39;s NAACP; and Maria Somma, a union organizer with United Steelworkers.<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/wh3-728901.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/wh3-728895.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>As each panelist spoke, the evening&#39;s discussion drifted farther from Zambia, from developing nations, from world hunger, and from anything else with a shred of a connection to the G-20.  While the event&#39;s title made clear that the discussion would address &quot;economic decline in our communities,&quot; I hadn&#39;t expected such a total disconnect.<br /><br />Tim Stevens opened the panel discussion by asserting that we need to replace &quot;white privilege&quot; with a &quot;people&#39;s privilege,&quot; but added that the people&#39;s privilege will not supplant the white privilege until voting in all political elections becomes common place in African American communities, until elected officials are more diverse, and until African American voters see the connection between voting and the representation of their interests.  He emphasized the importance of solidarity within African American communities. <br /><br />Next, Carl Redwood discussed what he sees as the profit-driven motives of community development.  Stating that the government tends to favor business at the cost of the people, especially low-income citizens, he commented, &quot;They don&#39;t call [the stimulus legislation] welfare.&quot; He stressed the need to strengthen and organize behind a common purpose in order to change things in the world. <br /><br />John Canning began his segment of the discussion with the declaration that the G-20 will be a total failure if it results in the wealthier nations getting wealthier at the cost of developing nations.  He, like Redwood, believes that the development industry is profit-driven.  In his view, &quot;old politics&quot; were, and continue to be even among new politicians, replete with business deals between governments and developers.  Like Redwood, he believes that developers don&#39;t want to improve living conditions; they merely want to earn a profit. <br /><br />Molly Rush then began to discuss health care legislation, asserting that big pharmaceutical companies are working together to keep the cost of medicine high and that the national health care bill will garner massive profits.  She claimed that infectious diseases are spreading at an unparalleled rate while the average Pennsylvania household is getting progressively poorer, making Pennsylvanians and other similarly-situated Americans more vulnerable to infectious disease.  She is currently working on a state health care bill and feels that state legislatures are quicker and easier to work with.  She hopes that the passage of her bill would set a precedent.<br /><br />The
 end of the panel discussion became more sensational as Maria Somma declared, &quot;[Free trade] was artificially constructed by.... greedy, corporate SOBs.&quot;  She illustrated the need for unions to protect low-income workers by telling stories of Burmese political refugees working in terrible conditions for half the cost of their English-speaking colleagues.  Her own union mirrored the language of a bill banning the use of cat and dog hair in clothes, replacing &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;dog&quot; with the word &quot;human.&quot;  While the animal fur bill passed in one day, her human rights bill has not been taken seriously.  The panel discussion was followed by a general community discussion.  <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/wh1-768243.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:4px 10px 4px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/wh1-768241.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>As a general whole, the evening was interesting and informative.  I learned more about Burmese refugees and North Side gentrification than I ever intended to. However, I couldn&#39;t help but wonder how Haangandu felt after having flown across the world to deliver a speech on Zambia which, despite its designation as the subject of the keynote lecture, was quickly shoved out of the spotlight in favor of a barrage of personal anecdotes and pet issues.  If these programs are truly meant to be &quot;alternatives&quot; or &quot;reactions&quot; to the G-20 itself, then would it not have made more sense to stand together as the panelists recommended, devoting the evening to a discussion of global issues which, like Zambia, will likely be affected by the decisions made this week? <br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt" size="2">Discussed in this post:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.peoplessummit.com/">The People&#39;s Summit</a><br /><br />Photo Credits: Ingrid Burke</font><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abigail Salisbury, JURIST&#39;s Executive Director, observed events in downtown Pittsburgh on the first day of the G-20 Summit... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/summit-press-room-774138.JPG"><img style="float:right; margin:4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 172px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/summit-press-room-773674.JPG" border="0" alt=""/></a>I was able to get a press pass to the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and after going through security at Mellon Arena on Thursday morning, I was taken by shuttle to the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, the site of the summit itself.  Upon arrival, I was struck by the utter lack of activity.  Small clusters of journalists hung around the international media hall, but few seemed to be producing much content.  There was even a bit of meta-news when I was interviewed by a pair of reporters who were putting together a story on other reporters&#39; views of activist journalism and various journalistic styles.  After wandering around the Convention Center for a while, I decided to see what was going on outside the secured area and so I ventured outside to see what was happening on the streets.<br /><br /><a href="/dateline/uploaded_images/027-746392.JPG"><img style="float:left; margin:4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 172px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/027-746392.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a>Given all the pre-G-20 preparations and admonitions (along with a good degree of fear mongering, to be frank), I was puzzled by the nearly complete lack of activity on the streets of downtown Pittsburgh, which had the air of a dystopian film centering around some sort of society in which nearly every citizen is a uniformed police officer, leaving no civilians for them to police.  The action picked up a little shortly after 2 pm, however, when I happened upon a group of four ACLU Legal Observers hanging around about two-dozen Ethiopian protesters at Liberty and Seventh Avenues. I was quite surprised to find that the protest in progress centered around some of the same issues discussed in a JURIST Forum article I wrote last year when working in Ethiopia.    <br /><br /><a href="/dateline/uploaded_images/004-737097.JPG"><img style="float:right; margin:4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 172px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/004-736726.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a>I tapped on a protester&#39;s shoulder and asked whether their posters, which called for the US to stop funding the regime of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, were related to H.R. 2003, the proposed US legislation which made non-essential aid to Ethiopia contingent on the attainment of certain human rights goals. He said that I should talk to one of the organizers, who by some strange coincidence ended up recognizing me from the JURIST Forum article.  <br /><br /><a href="/dateline/uploaded_images/006-780187.JPG"><img style="float:left; margin:4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 172px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/006-779827.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a>As I mentioned, there was an abundance of police officers outfitted with riot gear in the area, and they wasted no time in deploying a unit of perhaps twenty officers to the scene.  More police then arrived to enclose the area on the other side.  The situation became tense for a while when one young protester took his sign right up to the front line of the police formation.  The officer in charge called for the others to slowly advance on the protesters, batons at the ready, in what reminded me of a fencing drill more than any sort of attack. The area was full of onlookers and media, who mostly kept to the sidewalks and stayed behind a sort of imaginary line established by individual roaming officers&#39; implied comfort zones. The protest broke up after about thirty minutes, at which point a group of about six faux-Rastafarians took advantage of the Ethiopians&#39; presence to unfurl a banner advocating for marijuana legalization at the &quot;G-420&quot; summit.  Their ironic protest stayed on the street corner until they saw a large group of Tibetan ethnic nationalists coming by, and they brought up the rear of their march toward the Convention Center.<br /><br /><a href="/dateline/uploaded_images/011-725157.JPG"><img style="float:right; margin:4px 4px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 172px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/011-724817.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a>The &quot;Free Tibet&quot; protest was much larger than the Ethiopian one, and had come down Fifth and then Liberty Avenues in a quickly-moving march accompanied by dozens of police officers at all times.  They crossed crowd-control cement barriers and were stopped at 3:15 pm at Smithfield Street, within sight of the Convention Center fencing, where they continued their admonitions of China and celebration of the Dalai Lama.  Most of their chanting focused on criticisms of Hu Jintao, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.  ACLU Legal Observers were once again on site, and the tension between police and protesters seemed to escalate for a moment when the participants stayed in place for over thirty minutes and police seemed ready to break up the event. <br /><br /><a href="/dateline/uploaded_images/020-752954.JPG"><img style="float:left; margin:4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 172px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/020-752602.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a>No altercations occurred, but committed onlookers refused to abandon the scene.  I felt as if we were picnickers stationed near Manassas, hoping to see something exciting.  As the protest seemed to stretch on forever (it was really only a couple of hours), there were definite rumblings from the still-sizable crowd, and I heard some stray comments amounting to wishes that someone would get beaten so there would be a decent show to watch. A few others criticized the overly-large police presence in the city and praised the protesters for continuing to chant in the officers&#39; faces.  Ultimately, excitement waned and most onlookers and media headed off in search of other stories.  I wandered around downtown for another hour or so before heading back to Oakland, where inquisitive university students were gathered, hoping to catch a glimpse of heads of state as they made their way to Phipps Conservatory for their &quot;working dinner&quot; later that evening. I later heard that police used OC vapor to rapidly put down an unsanctioned protest organized by a self-proclaimed group of anarchists in Lawrenceville, an event attended by some curious JURIST student staffers who will provide additional commentary in the days to come.<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt" size="2"><br /><br />Photo Credits: Abigail Salisbury</font><br />

		<title>WASHINGTON DC: The World Bank&#039;s Fight Against Corruption</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kindra Mohr, Boston College Law &#39;11, was a consultant at the headquarters of the World Bank* in Washington, DC...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/World-Bank-2-762181.jpg"><img style="margin: 4pt 10px 10px 4pt; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 183px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/World-Bank-2-762178.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><font style="font-weight: bold;">O</font>ne of the fastest growing areas in international law, and within the international development field in general, is the expansion and enforcement of anti-corruption standards.  The United Nations Convention Against Corruption, along with domestic laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, have existed for a number of years.  Now, however, multilateral development banks (MDBs) are playing a larger role in combating corruption in their member countries.   For instance, in 2008 alone, the Inter-American Development Bank applied sanctions for corrupt practices against 33 firms and individuals.   In addition, the Asian Development Bank recently sanctioned one firm  and one individual for bribing public officials.  The World Bank has also been active in the fight against corruption.  Since January 2009, the World Bank has already debarred 20 firms and individuals for  corrupt and fraudulent practices.  The World Bank also posts its 24-hour Fraud and Corruption Hotline phone number on its home page, which includes interpretive services, and displays a link to its guidelines for reporting suspected misconduct.  <br /><br />During  my consultancy with the World Bank this summer, I recognized how critical  the work of MDBs is in promoting anti-corruption standards on a global  scale and in holding firms and individuals accountable for their actions.   The World Bank achieves this through a multi-phase investigatory and adjudicatory process that evaluates whether a firm or individual has  engaged in &quot;sanctionable&quot; practices&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;corruption, fraud, collusion, coercion, and/or obstruction.  These practices may involve forgery, bid manipulation, labor mischarges, and bribery, among others.  In brief, this process begins with an investigation by the Integrity Vice Presidency  (INT), which forwards the case to the Office of Evaluation and Suspension if there is sufficient evidence of these practices.  After reviewing the evidence, the Evaluation and Suspension Officer determines whether to apply sanctions, which can be contested by the firm or individual through the Sanctions Board &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the final level of the World Bank&#39;s sanctions system.  After this process, it is possible that the firm or individual will be permanently barred from bidding on all future World Bank projects.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/World-Bank-768562.jpg"><img style="margin: 4pt 10px 10px 4pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 287px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/World-Bank-768561.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Although  the sanctions system within the World Bank is limited in that it applies to private entities rather than public officials, it often provides member governments with the support they need to deter corruption.   In many cases, developing countries have weak and unaccountable judicial  institutions, and thus these governments are unwilling or unable to prosecute firms or individuals engaging in corruption. However, if a business recognizes that the World Bank will take action for misconduct, it will naturally be less inclined to submit a fraudulent bid or to bribe a public official in connection with a World Bank-financed project.  In turn, as more businesses refrain from &quot;giving in&quot; to demands for bribery by public officials, these officials will soon find that the supply of bribes or illicit payments has run dry.<br /><br />Corruption still infiltrates the private and public sectors in both developed and  developing countries.  Nevertheless, the work of the World Bank and other MDBs is a necessary and important element in establishing  and enforcing anti-corruption standards and reducing the supply of and  demand for misconduct.  Following my experiences this summer, it  is my hope that these efforts will continue to play a prominent role  in the global fight against corruption.  <br /><br /><br /><em>* The views expressed herein are the personal views of the author and are not intended to reflect the views of the World Bank.</em><br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt" size="2">Referred to in this article:<br /><a href="http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=1927592"></a><br /><a href="http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=1927592">Inter-American Development Bank Office of Institutional Integrity, Annual Report 2008</a> <br /><a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.worldbank.org"></a><br /><a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.worldbank.org">World Bank Home Page</a><br /><a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/ORGANIZATION/ORGUNITS/EXTOFFEVASUS/0,,menuPK:3601066%7EpagePK:64168427%7EpiPK:64168435%7EtheSitePK:3601046,00.html."></a><br /><a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/ORGANIZATION/ORGUNITS/EXTOFFEVASUS/0,,menuPK:3601066%7EpagePK:64168427%7EpiPK:64168435%7EtheSitePK:3601046,00.html.">World Bank Sanctions System</a><br /><br />Photo Credits: Jennifer Long</font><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amelia Mathias, Pitt Law &#39;11,  attended a speech given by European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso at the University of Pittsburgh on Thursday...<br /><hr height="1"><br />Accompanied by his wife, Margarita, and staff, President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso came to the University of Pittsburgh on Thursday to accept an honorary doctorate of Public and International Affairs from Chancellor Mark Nordenberg.  Barroso then gave a short lecture, speaking before an assembly of Pitt students, faculty, and press in Alumni Hall. He also accepted questions from students and press in a forum moderated by Nordenberg Professor Alberta Sbragia. <br /><br />Barroso focused on the need to continue to build important relationships between the European Union and the United States, and likened the process to the revitalization of Pittsburgh through its cultivation and adoption of new technologies. He praised Pittsburgh for its adaptation and said that the world could draw lessons and inspiration from &quot;the most livable city.&quot; <br /><br />The Commissioner moved on by speaking of the future of the European Union. While acknowledging that the European Union awaits the passing of the Lisbon Treaty (up for the vote in an Irish referendum in just a few weeks) he also praised the EU&#39;s commitment to foreign aid and police deployment throughout the world. He frankly noted that the foreign affairs discourse seems to be moving toward a vision of the world as a dualism between China and the United States, but he also refused to let this be the last word on the matter. Somewhat jarringly, he commented, &quot;The world doesn&#39;t need Europe,&quot; he said, &quot;but Europe has something to offer.&quot; If the world is open to that discussion, he believes that the 21st century could become &quot;The Century of Europe.&quot; <br /><br />Turning his attention to the most pressing matters of the G20, Barroso spoke about the disarray of the world financial system and also the importance of combating climate change. Speaking strongly about the need for quick, firm reform of financial markets, he admitted that there had been moral as well as financial failings by the world&#39;s financial leaders that led to the financial crisis that began in 2008. While reform will not happen quickly, he chalked up that delay to the price of democracy, and seemed confident that it would happen eventually.<br /><br />Speaking about climate change, he called the problem a &quot;challenge without borders.&quot; He said that even if the European Union and the United States dropped their emission levels to nothing, climate change would continue at a rampant pace, and so developing countries must accept their role and do what they can, instead of blaming the problem on developed nations. He expressed optimism that the December meeting in Copenhagen could amount to a real climate change agreement with real subsequent measures being taken, naysaying what the press has been anticipating in the months leading up to that meeting. <br /><br />Ultimately, Barroso stopped short of expressing optimism for the future of the European Union and the world. The Lisbon Treaty must still be passed, the financial problems of the world must still be resolved, something must be done about climate change. Yet with every bridge, the European Union and the United States, along with the rest of the world, get a little bit closer to mending these problems.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Morgan, Pitt Law &#39;11, attended a lecture given by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd while in Pittsburgh for the G-20 Summit...<br /><hr height="1"><br />I&#39;ll be the first to admit that I don&#39;t know an awful lot about Australian politics. When I received a press pass for a speech by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd at Pittsburgh&#39;s Carnegie Mellon University last Thursday, I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. In the end, here&#39;s what I found out: Kevin Rudd is a nerd. I&#39;m not casting aspersions. The Prime Minister of one of the world&#39;s richest nations took the podium at one of the world&#39;s premier technical universities and introduced himself as a &quot;self-proclaimed nerd.&quot; He then set about proving this hypothesis, and succeeded admirably. <br /><br />Mr. Rudd began his speech as all speeches must begin, with enough details about the forum to show that he knew where he was speaking, and a few quips to lighten the mood. He managed to tie William Pitt&#39;s establishment of a fort at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers to the creation of Australia in fewer than five steps, and finished this observation by noting that we should &quot;blame the British for everything.&quot; His largely Australian and American crowd erupted with applause, thirty seconds of cacophony demonstrating our common colonial heritage. He likes Pittsburgh, he told us, recounting the now-familiar story of its renaissance from gritty industry town to gleaming paragon of the &quot;knowledge economy.&quot; In what can only be considered a small misstep by his research staff, Rudd told us that you can see the spirit of Pittsburgh in the Steelers, the Penguins and the Pirates, perhaps not realizing that the Pirates haven&#39;t had a winning season in 17 years, the longest losing streak in any of the four major American sports. <br /><br />The introduction did its job: Kevin Rudd is an affable and well-spoken nerd, with a seemingly genuine good nature and superb comic timing. (Perhaps a career in the foreign service is not quite as nerdy as Mr. Rudd would have us believe.) He is also very, very excited about carbon capture and sequestration, macroeconomic coordination and, well, robots. <br /><br />Kevin Rudd is, after all, extremely concerned about climate change. He described the challenge of mitigating rising global temperatures as &quot;existential,&quot; and he has a firm idea of what needs to be done to achieve that goal. His earnest devotion is frankly confusing in a country where some are still debating the existence of global warming, and I waited for someone in the audience to stand up and proclaim, &quot;The science is still out!&quot; or remind us about dinosaurs.<br /><br />Instead, the Prime Minister of Australia laid out his vision of the future: climate change dampened, pockets full. Mr. Rudd sees &quot;macroeconomic coordination&quot; as the solution to the problem of climate change. With the collapse of what he described as the &quot;debt-driven&quot; economy, Mr. Rudd sees the potential destruction of an ecosystem capable of supporting human life as a fantastic business opportunity, for both the developed and developing worlds. He called for macroeconomic policies that would &quot;put a price on carbon,&quot; and for a response to climate change &quot;grounded in science.&quot;<br /><br />Economically, Mr. Rudd supported the establishment of global carbon markets, which he said will not only create an incentive for companies, individuals and nations to reduce their emissions, but are necessary to prevent retaliatory tariffs between states as resources dwindle. He stressed the necessity of providing transitional support to developing nations, as both a precondition to success and as an incentive for developed nations who have been reticent to participate without commitments from emerging economies. Mr. Rudd urged the world community to provide the resources necessary to achieve the goals laid out in climate change treaties, saying that a reduction in green house gasses will not &quot;result from the signing of an international accord.&quot; <br /><br />Technologically, the Prime Minister is very excited about a number of developments. He&#39;s excited about energy efficiency, which he said should be a core part of the design and construction of buildings, not an afterthought. He&#39;s excited about the carbon capture and sequestration project through which Exxon-Mobil and Chevron are developing Australian natural gas reserves, and about the global technological dominance that Australia may reap from being ahead of the curve. He&#39;s excited about the US$1B solar farm being constructed in his country to displace power generation from dirtier means. After all, said Kevin Rudd, &quot;We don&#39;t lack for the sun, we don&#39;t lack for the land, and indeed, we don&#39;t lack for the desert.&quot; He&#39;s excited about the prospect of finding technological solutions to the climate problem, just as humans increased crop yields through genetics and eradicated polio through virology. <br /><br />The Prime Minister reminded his audience that humans are capable of great creativity and great destruction, and urged everyone, scientists, financiers, even lawyers(!), to devote their individual talents to meeting the challenge of climate change. <br /><br />Prime Minister Rudd did not stay for the panel discussion, and neither did anyone else. He had a dinner invitation from the President of the United States at Phipps Conservatory and I decided to see if I could tag along. Well, not along <span style="font-style:italic;">per se</span>, but at least as far as the security perimeter. Giving up on Flagstaff Hill, which was fenced off and guarded by mounted police, K-9 units and at least one sharpshooter who was not as well hidden as he thought he was, I continued through CMU to Schenley Plaza. There, roughly 50 protesters were gathered in the middle of Schenley Drive, flanked by three times as many bystanders, on-lookers and hangers-on. They wanted to see how close they could get to the corps of riot police who had lined up at the end of the bridge leading to Phipps. The answer, it turned out, was about 15 feet; after that, you get the tear gas. The efficacy of this dispersal method was severely hampered by (1) the fact that it was only smoke, not tear gas (but don&#39;t tell the fleeing crowd!) and (2) the stalwart protester who continued to keep his &quot;Caution: New World Order Ahead&quot; poster held aloft despite being engulfed by the cloud. Reconstituted, the crowd lackadaisically asked the officers just whom they protected, whom they served, and reminded them that these are &quot;our streets.&quot; The police answered by riding their huge horses toward the crowd, successfully pushing us back 100 yards in a most <span style="font-style:italic;">Braveheart</span>-like fashion. <br /><br />And there we stood. For hours. No organized resistance. Very little in the way of chanting, signage, or agitation. Just a small army of riot police, shoulder to shoulder, making sure that Kevin Rudd could eat his dinner in peace, as throngs of bored college kids posed for pictures in front of them with their thumbs up and smiles on their faces.<br />

		<title>BELGIUM: Language Laws and Regional Divisions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amelia Mathias, Pitt Law &#39;11,  spent her summer conducting research at the Institute for European Studies in Brussels, Belgium...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/belgium-3-729960.JPG"><img style="margin: 4pt 10px 10px 4pt; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/belgium-3-729952.JPG" alt="" border="4"></a><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n early spring, I told a close friend in Pittsburgh that I would be spending the summer in Belgium. &quot;It&#39;s good you&#39;re going now,&quot; he told me seriously, &quot;since it&#39;s not going to be around that much longer.&quot; From my then-rudimentary knowledge of Belgian politics, I delivered a little lecture about the cohesive state of Belgium. When I arrived in Brussels, however, it became clear that while my friend&#39;s statement may have been more dramatic than reality warranted, Belgium&#39;s language barrier and the politics behind it were far more pronounced than I had imagined.<br /><br />Belgium is composed of three main population blocks: Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels. Flanders, to the north, is home to the famous cities of Antwerp, Bruges, and Ghent. The people in Flanders speak Dutch, and tend to be a conservative, Catholic people. Wallonia, the region in the south of the country, is composed of a francophone population. While this region is also traditionally Catholic, Wallonia tends to be more liberal, and is run by a socialist government.   Wallonia, however, is more economically depressed than Flanders. Then there is Brussels, the so-called &quot;capital of Europe,&quot; a title it holds as the seat of the European Union and home to thousands of workers from all over the Continent. Brussels is completely surrounded by Flanders; you must drive half an hour to the south before you hit Wallonia. Brussels is primarily francophone, but every language can be heard on the Metro. To get a simple job in a shop on the posh Avenue Louise, one must speak fluent Dutch, French, and English.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Belgium-1-780005.JPG"><img style="margin: 4pt 10px 10px 4pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Belgium-1-779996.JPG" alt="" border="4"></a>The divisive problems among the three regions, particularly between Flanders and Wallonia, have their roots in history.  France has had a strong traditional and cultural influence over the years. The French speakers were generally in charge; there are numerous stories of Dutch men accused of crimes and found guilty because they could not understand a word in their trial. It was only after their execution that their innocence was discovered. These stories reached their height with tales of French commanders in World War I sending their Dutch soldiers to their deaths because they refused to speak the language of the enlisted under their command. Lobbying for inclusion, Dutch speakers&#39; rights were included in the Constitution, but persistent francophone prejudice continued. One might argue now, with the economic predominance of Flanders, that the revenge of the Dutch-speaking provinces is sweet.<br />      <br />In Brussels, a francophone or multilingual island amid the sea of culturally-possessive Flanders, problems are occurring as the city expands into the suburbs. The francophone city-dwellers are searching for a little air and running into the Dutch-dominated villages around the city. In Zaventem, a municipality just outside of Brussels where the main airport is located, francophone families are moving to the pleasant suburbs, but finding that they have a hard time getting the recognition that the Constitution guarantees them as a 30% minority. Parents can lobby for education in French, and it will be granted. Four out of the twenty-nine council posts are reserved for French speakers, but these numbers do not reflect the realities of the population. This is itself a change from a famous 1968 case before the European Court of Human Rights, where French-speaking families in Flanders were told that the Constitution did not guarantee their children the right to be educated in the language of their choice - just the right to be educated in the language of the province they lived in. An international resident of Zaventem told me that when French speakers try to talk to the police or hospital workers in French, the native Dutch speakers will quietly stand and wait for them to switch to Dutch or even English and will not respond in French at all. All this is unlikely to change any time soon, because Belgium is forbidden from performing a language-based census. Numbers are all out of date and hardly representative of the actual population in a given municipality. Even as the population changes, the laws regarding which language governs a town remain static. <br />     <br />But even though the main tension is between the French- and the Dutch-speakers, one also has to mention the small cluster of German-speakers living in the southeast part of the country in the Ardennes Forest. Numbering just 73,000 people, less than one tenth of Belgium&#39;s population, they are the third part of Belgium&#39;s federalist system. Though they maintain such a small portion of the country, their influence and right to their language is witnessed even in Brussels, where ATMs offer German as a language option, and throughout the rest of the country many of the museums and attractions offer German as an option along with English, French and Dutch.        <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Belgium-2-749747.JPG"><img style="margin: 4pt 4pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Belgium-2-749733.JPG" alt="" border="4"></a>The language distinctions are codified in the Belgian Constitution of 1970, which states that &quot;The limits of the four linguistic regions can only be changed or modified by a law adopted by majority vote in each linguistic group in each Chamber, on the condition that the majority of the members of each group are gathered together and from the moment that the total of affirmative votes given by the two linguistic groups is equal to at least two-thirds of the votes expressed.&quot; The chances of this happening and at all changing the uncomfortable but sustainable <span style="font-style:italic;">status quo</span> is slim to none.<br /><br />However, despite all the tension between Flanders and Wallonia, it seems unlikely that the two will split into two countries any time soon. In fact, everyone I have asked seems to think it will never happen. When asked why, their answer is one word: Brussels. The capital city of Belgium is now the &quot;capital of Europe,&quot; and is situated solidly in Flanders territory, not conveniently on the border between Flanders and Wallonia as, say, Washington D.C. is between Maryland and Virginia. The only possible solution floated by Brussels&#39; inhabitants would be to make the city some kind of neutral zone, an official capital of Europe and monument to the nation that was Belgium while making Flanders move its capital to Antwerp or Leuven. Yet the city brings so much to the country and contains so many francophone speakers that it is unlikely that Wallonia or Flanders would be willing to give it up, forcing them to continue to work together as one federalist country for the foreseeable future.<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt" size="2">Sources:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0001.htm#E12E1">Belgian Constitution</a><br /><br /><a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=695402&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">European Court of Human Rights 1968 Belgian Language Case</a><br /><br />Photo Credits: Amelia Mathias</font><br />

		<title>G-20 EXTRA ~ Resistance Project Demonstration Dispersed</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Christian Ehret, Pitt Law &#39;11, observed a G-20 Resistance Project protest held by self-proclaimed anarchists in Pittsburgh on Thursday...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a href="/dateline/massivecrowd.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 172px;" src="/dateline/massivecrowd.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>I ventured down to the G-20 Resistance gathering in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh on Thursday afternoon with the sole intention of finding out what motivated people to be there.  I was rather pessimistic, and expected inarticulate, uninformed statements about the broad state of the world economy and the evils of capitalism.  I had made my mind up before even going: people were planning to protest for the sake of protesting.  A few blocks from the park, I thought my hypothesis of hypocrisy was confirmed when I watched several people put down their signs and pull their bandannas off to go into an Exxon-Mobil mini-mart to purchase snacks and bottled water.<br /><br />Arsenal park was teeming with skinny black jeans and bandannas.  I immediately noticed that the media nearly outnumbered the protesters.  There were television cameras everywhere and I soon found that it was nearly impossible to take a picture of signs or banners without having several reporters or photographers standing in the way.  Legal observers from the ACLU and National Lawyers Guild, along with curious locals, added to the imbalance between participants and onlookers.<br /><br /><a href="/dateline/preacherman.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 172px;" src="/dateline/preacherman.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Seeking more information on my theory about the protesters, I began asking people why they were there.  Many responded that it was merely &quot;something to see,&quot; while others supported particular issues.  The Service Employees International Union had a strong presence with signs regarding healthcare and the effect of the economic crisis on working families. Some attendees gave me generic answers regarding what they perceived as the failure of capitalism and free trade that I feel were taken almost verbatim from the signs and handbills of others.  Two young Filipinos brandishing a flag expressed strong feelings that their country should be represented at the summit.  A preacher in a white suit seemed to be stealing attention away from the others, speaking incoherently into a megaphone as television cameras and journalists swarmed around him.  &quot;Peacelujah!&quot; he yelled. While I desperately tried to interpret his seemingly prophetical bursts of speech, he spoke emphatically about everything from right-wing televangelists to the fact that &quot;our time has come&quot; and &quot;some of us will die&quot; in fighting for what&#39;s right.  &quot;Earthelujah!&quot;<br /><br /><a href="/dateline/lineofpolice.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 172px;" src="/dateline/lineofpolice.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>As the disorganized crowd flowed toward the 40th Street exit of the park, a line of police officers in riot gear blocked the way. At first I felt bad for the officers, who must have been terribly overheated and were being harangued by the crowd.  &quot;You&#39;re not the patriots here, I served!&quot; one man yelled at them. My sympathies subsided, however, after a police officer screamed in my face as my foot touched the street: &quot;You&#39;re not allowed in the street, get off the [expletive deleted] street!&quot; Nothing good could arise if this level of hostility existed before any march even began. The crowd shifted to the other side of the park, where a make-shift parade began and a very opportunistic but risk-taking ice cream truck operator likely made a small fortune.  The march began going up 39th Street and made a right on Liberty Avenue, blocking one of the busiest roads in the area.<br /><br />A police blockade was set-up around 28th and Liberty with a loud broadcasted message:<blockquote>By the order of the City if Pittsburgh chief of police, I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.  You must leave the immediate vicinity.  If you remain in this immediate vicinity, you will be in violation of the Pennsylvania crimes code, no matter what your purpose is.    You must leave.  If you do not disperse, you may be arrested and or subjected to other police action.  Other police action may include actual physical removal, the use of riot control agents and or the use of less than lethal munition which could cause risk of injury to those who remain.</blockquote>Following this message, the unorganized mass of people spread out into the hilly streets of Lawrenceville in no particular direction.  A group of protesters pushed a dumpster down an incline toward another police blockade.  Seconds later, a fog of OC vapor skin-irritant enveloped the area and my coverage for JURIST came to an abrupt end.<br /><br /><a href="/dateline/teargas.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 172px;" src="/dateline/teargas.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Those who suffered the most were the Lawrenceville residents who watched the crowd from their front doors, unable to leave their homes.  &quot;I want nothing to do with this,&quot; one man told me, turning around to go back inside his house and lock the door.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re even protesting about,&quot; another resident told me.  &quot;I know it&#39;s the G-20, but what exactly about it are they protesting?&quot;  I started to respond to his question before realizing that, based on the variety of signs I read and the people I spoke with, I was unable to provide an answer.<br /><br />As I walked back to my car, I reread the police statement that I had jotted down in my notebook.  Everyone must leave, no matter what their purpose? I wondered about those who were not blocking any right-of-ways, including the legal observers and reporters. Aside from those interfering with the flow of traffic, which was more interrupted by the police presence than anything else, did we not have the right to walk on the sidewalk? To peacefully assemble? I went to the protest with preconceived notions about the demonstrators and left only questioning the actions of the city.  The substance of the protesters&#39; messages, or lack-thereof in some cases, seem remarkably less important than their right to express them.  If the Resistance Project was denied permits for their protest, while other groups were granted such permits, how else could they exercise their rights? Was this not, as Justice Holmes once put it, &quot;a marketplace of ideas?&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Discussed in this post:<br /><br /><a href="http://resistg20.org/">G-20 Resistance</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.seiu.org/">Service Employees International Union</a><br /><br />Photo Credits: Christian Ehret</span><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Heidi Boghosian</strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.nlg.org">National Lawyers Guild</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/pittsburgh-police-clash-with-g-20.php">police response</a> to protests at the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh will be remembered as especially brutal, given the debut of military sonic weapons against civilians. Technology used in Iraq, long range acoustic devices (LRADs), are more insidious than other so called less-lethal munitions because they leave no visible marks and can cause permanent hearing loss.<br /><br />Combined with chemical irritants and projectile weapons, law enforcement&#39;s response at the G-20 was a textbook example of unlawful force that violates domestic and international legal norms. Excessive force as a means of crowd control is inappropriate and unlawful in a civilian context. In addition to subjecting protesters to risk of serious injury, police in Pittsburgh also targeted innocent bystanders - some children - to sonic, chemical and projectile weapons in residential neighborhoods and on school campuses.<br /><br />Such gratuitous assaults on protesters sends the message that the thousands of police and military personnel are not engaged in professional crowd control; rather, they are pre-emptive and aggressive techniques to punish protesters and bystanders for exercising their First Amendment rights. These practices violate legally-binding international human rights treaties which the United States has ratified and are inconsistent with standards set out under the <a href="http://www.uncjin.org/Standards/Conduct/compendium.pdf">UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials</a> [PDF file], which states that force should be used only where &quot;strictly necessary&quot; and in proportion to the threat posed.<br /><br />A democracy should not tolerate such abuse of police authority, and the National Lawyers Guild expects that there will be an independent review and assessment of why law enforcement unleashed such excessive and inappropriate force in Pittsburgh. As has consistently happened at other mass assemblies over the past decade, an evaluation of police conduct will likely be criticized after the fact. If anything good comes out of this, it will be that the Pittsburgh experience acts as a reality check and that other cities do not follow suit in such escalation of violence against their residents and visitors.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://gamso-forthedefense.blogspot.com/">Jeffrey M. Gamso</a> [Partner, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Gamso, Helmick &amp; Hoolahan</span>, on behalf of the <a href="http://www.clevedp.org/">Cleveland Coalition Against the Death Penalty</a>]: &quot;Ohio is now uniquely in the position of three badly botched executions in the just over three years.  On May 2, 2006, it took some 87 minutes to effect the execution of Joe Clark, who cried out, &quot;It don&#39;t work, it don&#39;t work&quot; and then was heard moaning and groaning while the execution team worked behind closed curtains to secure adequate veinal access.  On May 24, 2007, it took 113 minutes to secure veinal access and then execute  Christopher Newton.  And of course two hours of failure to secure access and allow Romell Broom&#39;s execution to go forward.  The Governor&#39;s announced plan to try again in a week (a plan stopped when Judge Frost of the Southern District of Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-delays-ohio-execution.php">issued</a> an agreed and now extended stay) was built on fiction and doomed to failure.<br /><br />The fiction of the plan was that somehow Mr. Broom&#39;s veins would be in better shape a week after some 18 sticks than they were before, and that access a team of inadequately qualified prison employees couldn&#39;t achieve on September 15, they would miraculously attain on September 22.  But the plan was also based on the legal fiction that what happened to Mr. Broom had no legal consequence.  The <u>Willie Francis</u> case (<a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/329/459/case.html">Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber</a>) in 1947 predated the <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/356/86/case.html">Trop v. Dulles</a> plurality formulation that the 8th Amendment had to be measured by the &quot;evolving standards of decency that mark a maturing society,&quot; and before those standards had, well, evolved.  But more to the point, as Chief Justice Roberts noted in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/553/07-5439/">Baze v. Rees</a>, Justice Frankfurter&#39;s concurrence in <u>Resweber</u> establishes that a series of abortive attempts at execution would violate the 8th Amendment because they would demonstrate an &quot;objectively intolerable risk of harm.&quot;  So what consequences for Mr. Broom whose veins will not likely be regenerating any time soon?  There is simply no reason to believe that what Ohio couldn&#39;t do competently on September 15, it will be able to do competently in the future.<br /><br />The problem is not just Broom, however.  With three botched executions in three years, what can be expected in the future?  Lawrence Reynolds is due to be executed on October 8, Darryl Durr on November 15, others in the months after that.  What are the odds?  When does unpredictable error become a consequence of reckless indifference?  And how does any of this comport with Ohio&#39;s execution statute (Ohio Rev. Code Section <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2949.22">2949.22</a>, which) uniquely calls for death by lethal injection to be effected &quot;quickly and painlessly?&quot;  We aren&#39;t doing it, at least not consistently.  And we show no ability to do it consistently.<br /><br />Plainly and simply, Ohio needs to give up the effort to kill Romell Broom.  Beyond that, it needs either to give up executions altogether, or at least put them on hold until it can figure out a way to ensure compliance with human decency, the 8th Amendment, and its own law.&quot;<br />

		<title>Obama administration retains expansive view of state secrets privilege in the courts</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ben Wizner</strong> [Staff Attorney, <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a>]: &quot;The Department of Justice&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-announces-state-secrets-reform.php">new policy on state secrets</a> may turn out to be a small step in the right direction.  If it results in fewer - and more nuanced - invocations of the state secrets privilege in future litigation, the Department will deserve some credit.<br /><br />But the new policy will be an empty gesture so long as the Obama administration continues to assert an expansive theory of the state secrets privilege in the courts.  Even as the administration was rolling out its new guidelines to the public, Department of Justice attorneys were invoking the privilege in the courts and demanding the dismissal of lawsuits filed by victims of torture and illegal surveillance.  In these cases, the Obama administration has endorsed the most extreme theory of the state secrets privilege articulated by the Bush administration - i.e., that the privilege can be deployed to terminate entire lawsuits that allege executive lawbreaking even before any evidentiary issues have arisen.  Under this doctrine, the Bush administration engaged in grave human rights violations, declared those activities &quot;state secrets,&quot; and thereby avoided any judicial oversight or accountability.  Accordingly, a broad range of executive misconduct has been shielded from judicial review after the perpetrators themselves have invoked the privilege to avoid adjudication.  Rather than repudiate this practice, the Obama administration has embraced it in the most critical cases, and nothing in these new voluntary guidelines will change that formula for executive-branch impunity.<br /><br />Real reform of the state secrets privilege must affirm the power of the courts to reject false claims of &quot;national security.&quot;  Even the most enlightened executive self-policing is no substitute for enforceable checks and balances.  That is why state secrets reform legislation introduced in the House and Senate - prior versions of which were co-sponsored by then-Senators Biden and Clinton - is so crucial.  First, legislation would ensure that future administrations, not just this one, are bound by the rule of law when invoking state secrets.  Second, the pending legislation would mandate judicial scrutiny of purportedly secret evidence, and would prohibit the dismissal of lawsuits on the basis of executive-branch affidavits alone, adding a necessary check on executive claims of national security.  Voluntary executive-branch guidelines do not and cannot address this critical issue of enhanced judicial scrutiny.  The Obama administration has thus far avoided taking a position on the pending legislation.  We can only hope that the new policy is not intended to undercut and preempt legislation that would permanently address the broader, structural problems.<br /><br />The state secrets privilege allowed the Bush administration to draw a curtain around many of its most lawless and inhumane national security policies.  To date, the Obama administration has chosen to allow that curtain to remain.  Comprehensive legislation, not self-imposed guidelines, will provide the only real and lasting solution.&quot;<br />

		<title>China&#039;s WTO appeal on US media imports is one of many recent worldwide protectionist measures</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cfr.org/bios/2472/edward_alden.html"><strong>Edward Alden</strong></a> [Bernard L. Schwartz Senior Fellow, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/">Council on Foreign Relations</a>]: &quot;Under normal circumstances, China&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/china-appeals-wto-ruling-on-us-media.php">decision to appeal</a> a recent World Trade Organization ruling against Beijing&#39;s restrictions on the import of foreign films, books and music would scarcely have been noticed. In the 13-year history of  the WTO&#39;s experiment with binding dispute settlement, about 70 percent of the panel decisions have been referred to the organization&#39;s highest court, known as the appellate body. In most countries, public opinion does not permit knuckling under to a WTO ruling until all the legal options have been exhausted.<br /><br />Furthermore, China is likely to lose the appeal. In its defense, China is citing the rarely used &quot;public morals&quot; clause that permits  countries in certain cases to block imports or take other discriminatory measures deemed &quot;necessary to protect public morals.&quot;  Certainly there is much coming out of Hollywood that would offend morality almost anywhere, but that claim has only been tested once before and failed miserably. The United States tried the tactic in its effort to block tiny Antigua and Bermuda from offering offshore online gambling to US residents, a plea the appellate body struck down in 2005. (There is a fine account of the dispute in Paul Blustein&#39;s just-published book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Misadventures-Most-Favored-Nations-ebook/dp/B002NT3BS4">Misadventures of the Most Favored Nations</a>, which I highly recommend.)<br /><br />So why all the fuss? The big reason is that, even as the leaders of the G-20 are gathering in Pittsburgh to renew their pledge to eschew protectionism is all its guises, they are doing just the opposite. A copious <a href="http://www.globaltradealert.org/gta-analysis/broken-promises-g20-summit-report-global-trade-alert">report</a> released this week by Global Trade Alert, a group of London-based scholars monitoring recent developments in world trade, warned of a growing &quot;protectionist juggernaut.&quot;  While that is a bit too alarmist, the authors show that the number of beggar-thy-neighbor trade measures has grown considerably in the past year. <br /><br />The United States, despite the controversial recent decision by President Obama to slap high tariffs on imports of Chinese tires, is far from the worst offender.   Depending on the metric, Russia, Germany, Ukraine and China have taken the most protectionist moves, with the US scarcely in the top 10.  But the US, long the flag bearer for trade liberalization, is rightly expected to adhere to a higher standard. And, not surprisingly, the Chinese are determined to discourage any similar actions by the US in the future.<br /><br />In the wake of the tire decision, China announced that it would consider new restriction on imports of American chicken and auto parts.  The US steelworkers union, fresh off the tire victory, is seeking tariffs on imports of paper from China and Indonesia. In this context, the Chinese appeal of the WTO decision on entertainment imports is the latest in what is looking a bit too much like an escalating tit-for-tat between two of the world&#39;s biggest trading powers.<br /><br />The good news so far is that the trade spats have been contained within the rules of the WTO. It is easy to imagine the protectionist free-for-all that might be occurring now had the WTO never been created. But the bad news, as we are seeing, is that there is an awful lot of backsliding that is possible even within the rules of the WTO. All the more reason for President Obama and other G-20 leaders to call a halt in Pittsburgh, and to mean it this time.&quot;<br />

		<title>New state secrets policy is first step towards legislation to check executive discretion in blocking litigation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/detail.asp?id=26"><strong>Sharon Bradford Franklin</strong></a> [Senior Counsel, <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">The Constitution Project</a>]: &quot;On September 23, 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the executive branch has <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-announces-state-secrets-reform.php">adopted a new policy</a> on invocation of the state secrets privilege - a doctrine which protects against disclosure of national security secrets in litigation.  The new policy tightens the standards for when executive agencies may assert the state secrets privilege, requires multiple levels of agency and Justice Department review before such a determination is made, and provides for increased reporting to Congress and agency Inspectors General.  The new policy is a welcome development and an important step toward reforming the state secrets doctrine.  However, it is only a first step, and legislation is still needed to protect the role of the courts in determining whether the state secrets privilege properly applies in given cases.<br /> <br />Both the Bush and Obama administrations have previously relied upon the state secrets privilege to block litigation challenging policies ranging from warrantless wiretapping to extraordinary rendition.  In such cases, both administrations have even claimed that the &quot;very subject matter&quot; of the lawsuit is a state secret.  Both have sought to have these cases dismissed outright, without any review by an independent judge to determine whether there is enough non-privileged evidence for the cases to proceed. <br /> <br />The administration&#39;s new policy represents a long overdue change in how the executive branch approaches cases involving national security issues.  In addition to the more rigorous standards and procedures for invoking the state secrets privilege, the policy indicates a move toward focusing on the evidence at issue in a case, rather than claiming the very subject matter of a suit is a state secret.  Further, the attorney general&#39;s new more stringent standard for when the privilege may be asserted is very similar to the standard of review contained in bills pending before both the House and Senate (the State Secrets Protection Act, <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.984:">H.R. 984</a> and <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.417:">S. 417</a>). <br /> <br />It is still critical, however, that Congress enact legislation to ensure that we properly safeguard actual national security secrets while permitting litigation to proceed wherever possible.  Passage of legislation would ensure that the new standard of review announced in the attorney general&#39;s memorandum is codified into law, and it would provide guidance to courts on the tools available to them in reviewing state secrets claims.  For example, the new executive policy is silent on whether the Justice Department will consent to a hearing - conducted in camera (in judges&#39; chambers) - to enable judges to independently review the evidence asserted to be privileged in order to assess state secrets claims and whether there is sufficient non-privileged evidence available to enable a case to move forward.  The State Secrets Protection Act bills pending in Congress would provide for such hearings, and would also establish a judicial process for developing non-privileged substitutes for evidence that does contain national security secrets. <br /> <br />The attorney general&#39;s announcement yesterday should not end debate on this matter, but rather, demonstrate that it is now Congress&#39; turn to take the next step.  Congress should act to ensure that the new tighter standards are codified, and to establish procedures that will protect the role of courts as an independent check on executive discretion.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.martindale.com/Sean-C-Hayes/34384880-lawyer.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Sean Hayes</span></span></a> [International Corporate Practice Group, <a href="http://www.thekoreanlawblog.com/2009/08/joowon-law.html">Joowon Law Firm</a>]: &quot;As most of us in Korea realize, many &quot;peaceful&quot; protests have too often turned violent at night. <br /><br />In the not so distant past, protests over the importation of US beef led to, amongst other things, numerous injuries to police officers, burned buses, Seoul-wide traffic congestion and lost revenues for businesses.  Many of the protesters that remained at night were simply young intoxicated malcontents with a propensity to violence.  These malcontents were strongly influenced to act by a radical liberal element that is keen to not work within the political system, preferring instead destroy it. <br /><br />Only last month, protests at  Ssangyong Motors, which lasted 76 days, ended in Molotov coctails and bolts from slingshots being flung at the police.  The plant was finally returned to its owners by a commando unit.  <br /><br />The <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ks00000_.html">Korean Constitution</a> declares in Article 21 (1) that: &quot;All citizens shall enjoy freedom of speech and the press, and freedom of assembly and association.&quot; Article 21 (2) follows by noting that: &quot;Licensing or censorship of speech and the press and licensing of assembly and association shall not be recognized.&quot;<br /><br />The language of the Korean Constitution seems to absolutely guarantee that &quot;licensing of assembly and association&quot; is banned. However, as with the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/">First Amendment</a> to the US Constitution, absolute language doesn&#39;t necessarily guarantee that courts will not impose limits on rights and freedoms.<br /><br />Reasonable, time, place, and manner restrictions on assembly must be upheld.  In this charged and often violent Korean protest culture, measures must be taken in order to avoid deaths, destruction of property, and worldwide embarrassment.  <br /><br />The <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/south-korea-court-rules-ban-on.php">Assembly and Demonstration Law</a> is nothing more than a content-neutral reasonable, time, place and manner type of regulation of assembly that should have been upheld.   The &quot;General Traffic Obstruction Law&quot; has also been challenged at the Court.  If that law is not upheld, expect an increase in protests in the near future and good luck getting home on a Friday night.&quot;<br />

		<title>Second Circuit ruling that states can sue power companies over emissions will cause explosion of nuisance suits</title>

They are wrong.<br /><br />The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), one of the defendants in the Second Circuit case, knows this very well. The TVA was sued in a federal district court in North Carolina for creating a public nuisance by emitting pollutants such as ozone that are currently regulated under the federal <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/">Clean Air Act</a>. Under this act, USEPA sets health-based limits on such emissions but doesn&#39;t totally prohibit them. TVA was in full compliance with these federal limits. Earlier this year, the district court judge nevertheless ordered the TVA to install about a billion dollars worth of air pollution controls on its coal-fired electrical power plant to limit emissions even though they are lawful under federal law. The case is now on appeal. But federal regulation did nothing to stop that lawsuit; federal climate change regulation will not stop other lawsuits like the Second Circuit one.<br /><br />Such cases are beginning to proliferate, as the plaintiffs&#39; trial bar senses blood in the water in the form of the billion dollar judgment in the TVA case. But courts are a poor forum in which to litigate climate change. The ultimate issue in such cases is whether man-made emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases cause global warming. The science is enormously complicated, as demonstrated in a recent publication by The Heartland Institute, <a href="http://www.nipccreport.org">Climate Change Reconsidered</a>, collecting thousands of peer-reviewed scientific studies. A judge or jury is ill-equipped to understand and carefully consider it.<br /><br />Nevertheless, such cases are now the new &quot;hot&quot; lawsuits, and the Second Circuit case will fuel this trend. Hopefully, the Supreme Court will shut them down.&quot;<br />

		<title>UK Director of Public Prosecutions&#039; assisted dying guidelines improves patient choice</title>

We at Dignity in Dying hear from many people who, understandably, do not want to suffer unbearably and against their wishes at the end of life.  These interim guidelines allow those who are suffering at the end of their lives, and their loved ones to make decisions knowing what the likely consequences of their actions will be.  Informed choice is much better than a legal grey area.<br /> <br />Motivation was cited by the DPP as being the crucial factor in prosecution decisions, and for the first time compassionate assistance to die for loved ones who request it has been codified as being acceptable.   The factors outlined in the guidance, both for and against prosecution, sensibly allay fears of creating a duty to die whilst not imposing a duty to suffer.  The overwhelming majority of us do not want to see people prosecuted when they have reacted compassionately to a loved one&#39;s request for help to die. <br /> <br />Whilst these guidelines are helpful, they only partially resolve the problem.  The status quo is unacceptable and fundamentally, the law needs to change.  The guidelines clarify the law for the loved ones of those asking for assistance, but they cannot and do not provide a safeguarded means of assisted dying in the UK, therefore we continue to export our terminally ill abroad to die, or condone suicides behind closed doors. <br /> <br />Critics of the DPP, Keir Starmer QC, and his guidelines have said that he has exceeded his authority and that this is an issue for Parliament, but Parliament has failed to address this on a number of occasions. The DPP was instructed by the Law Lords to provide a prosecution policy, and he has done so well within his remit. <br /> <br />In light of Parliament&#39;s reluctance to address this issue time and time again, Dignity in Dying calls on the Government to launch a full and impartial consultation on the issue.  We are confident that evidence from other countries and individual states within the US who have legalised assisted dying shows that a safeguarded assisted dying law not only gives greater choice but also provides better protection against abuse.  Currently, even with the DPP&#39;s guidance, assisted deaths go on unregulated, with investigations occurring retrospectively.  An upfront and safeguarded assisted dying process is the logical progression to a more compassionate approach to end of life.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that justice would be better served by former Bush Administration officials if they would talk to federal prosecutor John Durham about the administrative missteps that led to detainee torture at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay instead of saving their stories for crowds at high-profile conferences....<br /><hr size="1"><br /><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavisnew.jpg" align="left" vspace="2" hspace="0"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" width="5" height="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" width="1" height="1"></td></tr></tbody></table> <font size="3"><strong>U</strong></font>pon returning from "After Guantanamo," a debate held on the eighth anniversary of 9/11 at Case Western Reserve Law School where members of the former administration regaled the audience with stories about the mistakes made and the arrogance demonstrated by persons with whom they had worked on the issues of detention, interrogation, and military commissions, something occurred to me...<br /><br />With the bipartisan appointment of John Durham (first by Mukasey and now by Holder) to investigate and prosecute low-level CIA types with regard to departures from the bad legal advice given to them by the torture lawyers, it would seem preferable for the former administration members to tell their stories to the federal prosecutor rather than to audiences at conferences.  After all, the stories of arrogant disdain for military lawyers ("they can't be good or else they would be in the private sector" was a comment reportedly said by someone of consequence in the prior administration), the sheer lack of knowledge of the basics of military law (<u>Manual for Courts-Martial</u>, anyone?), and the general indifference of those tasked with developing detention, interrogation, and military commission policy in the prior administration to the changes in military law that have occurred since <u>Ex parte Quirin</u> were simply appalling.<br /><br />Names were not named in the conference, but names should be named to John Durham.  He is permitted to "follow the facts wherever they lead," but if those lawyers, other civilians, and uniformed types who know where the dogs are buried refrain from coming forward, they will make the task more arduous than it needs to be.<br /><br />Everyone who has a story is a witness in piecing together what really went on.  Every lawyer has also sworn an oath to be an officer of the court and is under an ethical duty to refrain from abetting crimes.  Help John Durham find the facts. <br /><br />But beyond legal or ethical obligations, the real question is of what these architects of detention, interrogation, and military commission policy are made of.  Are they made of the stuff that led Specialist Darby to clearly see what was wrong with detainee treatment in Abu Ghraib, thus prompting him to provide Military Investigators with the incriminating photos?  Or are these persons made of the stuff of cowards that hope this will all go away if they do not say anything to anyone&#8212; posturing in public and cowering in private?<br /><br />As we all know, in DC there are crimes and there are cover-ups.  Every time a document is released with blackened pages provided by some intelligence or military office of the government, we know that the censorship is based partly on classic bureaucracy; not on national security alone.<br /><br />I would go a step further.  As we all know, a criminal prosecution against six lawyers of the previous administration has started in Spain.  Having seen many of them valiantly defend the apocryphal work they did, surely they would seek to defend their reputations by flying to Spain to voluntarily advocate for their own honor in front of the Spanish court.  Or is that too much to ask of torture lawyers?  I am sure tickets to Spain can be bought at a reasonable price online.<br /><br />If that is too much to ask, then man up and call John Durham; especially if you are a professor playing a role in shaping future lawyers and other students minds.  Surely one can expect these persons to be honorable men and women and help John Durham.  Is that too much to ask?  Or have the mighty been brought low by what they know?<br /><br />If your memory does not serve you as to how to reach John Durham, just try the Department of Justice main switchboard number at 202-514-2000.  I am sure they will put you through.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<title>A Proposal for Breaking the Israel-Palestine Deadlock</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/fulltime/damato/damato.html">Anthony D&#39;Amato</a> of Northwestern University School of Law says that the Obama administration can break the sixty-year deadlock in negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians by supporting the establishment of a special moot court - a quasi-official, transparent, privately funded tribunal that would render a non-binding advisory opinion on the two sides&#39; competing claims...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/damato3.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>S</strong></font>ixty years of negotiations between Israel and Palestine have produced nothing of substance. Yet the Obama administration still harbors the magical belief that forcing the two sides to talk to each other will enable them to resolve their differences. <br /><br />It&#39;s not just that negotiations between Israel and Palestine haven't succeeded, it&#39;s that they cannot succeed. Neither side can afford to be persuaded by rational, logical, or fairness arguments. It would be political suicide for a delegate to concede anything of substance in the negotiations and then go home and tell the public that he was suddenly persuaded that the other side was right. <br /><br />But even if the negotiations involve exchanges and not just assertions, the issues dividing Palestine and Israel are incommensurate. For example, suppose Hamas offers to cease its rocket attacks out of Gaza and asks in return some of the land that Israel is occupying. Israel would undoubtedly reply that the rocket attacks are illegal and therefore Israel is not going to bribe Hamas to stop violating international law. By the same token, suppose Israel offers to move back to the border those portions of its Wall that encroach upon Palestinian territory, in exchange for Palestine rescinding its declaration of permanent war against Israel. Palestine will undoubtedly reply that the International Court of Justice has already advised that the Israeli encroachments are illegal and hence Palestine will not bribe Israel to obey international law. <br /><br />Adding a third-party mediator, like the United States, will not break the negotiating deadlock. Anything the United States proposes, including seemingly neutral matters such as suggesting an agenda for the conference, will be viewed as political by one side or the other. The more neutral a United States proposal, the more deviously political will it be characterized.<br /><br />Perhaps the core reason for the failure of negotiations is suggested by the Latin maxim <em>nemo debet esse iudex in propria causa</em>: no one should be judge in his own cause. In bilateral negotiations there are two judges who are judging their own cause. <br /><br />If instead Israel and Palestine were trying to convince a neutral judge, their arguments would shift from the political to the rational. Fortunately we have a thousand years of experience with neutral adjudication: namely, courtroom trials.<br /><br />I propose the establishment of a Moot Court to adjudicate the issues dividing Israel and Palestine. Its decision of course cannot be legally binding. It would be purely advisory. Nor by any means will the court itself be partisan like the one-sided Russell Tribunal on Palestine now being set up in Belgium. Our new court should be quasi-official: endorsed by governments, financed privately, open and transparent, with full media coverage, opening up a daily world-wide debate on the issues. No court like this has ever been constituted. <br /><br />Israel and Palestine would probably oppose the Moot Court. But their approval should not be sought. The case is not about them; it's about the mutual problem they have failed to solve.<br /><br />Further explanation will be most efficient if I invent some Frequently Asked Questions and then proceed to give answers that will hopefully provoke readers to give answers that are better than mine. <br /><br />(1) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Will it be a private court or a government court?</span> Neither; it will be an in-between court. Governments and NGO's can participate in its creation as well as private individuals and groups. <br /><br />(2) <span style="font-weight:bold;">If its decisions are not binding, will anyone care about its final judgment?</span> The interest in this trial, growing with each day of televised hearings, may be the most watched event of all time. Bloggers and news reporters will argue the merits of the case as it unfolds in the courtroom. Speculation about the final judgment will be immense. The educational value to the world public of the form, substance, and application of law will be unique and incalculable. <br /><br />(3) <span style="font-weight:bold;">How much money will be needed and where will it come from?</span> $50 million will be needed, mostly for technology and translators. Twenty-five foundations and charitable trusts from around the world will be given an opportunity on a first-come-first-served basis to contribute no less and no more than $2 million each. These foundations will be listed prominently as the sponsors of the Court.<br /><br />(4) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Who will establish the Court and pick the judges?</span> A group of Organizers, which can include government officials, foundation sponsors, and prominent international lawyers. George Mitchell, for example, should certainly be one of the organizers. <br /><br />(5) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Who will serve as judges?</span> A panel of seven judges from around the world with reputations for wisdom, justice, and legal ability. Two judges will be partisans of Palestine and Israel. But their participation in the Court's deliberations will assure Israel and Palestine that their positions will be fairly conveyed to the entire panel of judges.<br /><br />(6) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Will Israel and Palestine each appoint a partisan judge?</span> They will have the right to do so, but if they decline, judges will be appointed for them.<br /><br />(7) <span style="font-weight:bold;">What law will govern the trial?</span> The judges will apply international law and international principles of equity.<br /><br />(8) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Plaintiffs have the burden of production. Which country will be the plaintiff?</span> Since Palestine wants to change the status quo more than Israel does, the plaintiff should be Palestine.<br /><br />(9) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Won't Palestine argue that Israel should be Plaintiff because it has the burden of justifying its illegal occupation of Palestinian territory?</span> The Court cannot begin by assuming either side is acting illegally. NOTE: The argument over who is the Plaintiff is just the kind of issue that brings bilateral negotiations to a screeching halt. Fortunately this Moot Court can be set up without necessarily paying attention to protestations coming from Israel or Palestine.<br /><br />(10) <span style="font-weight:bold;">How will the lawyers for Israel and Palestine be chosen?</span> Israel and Palestine will be able to choose their own lead counsel. If they decline to make a choice, the Organizers will choose lead counsel and two assistants each from among the world's best attorneys. Lawyers and judges may select their own clerks, who will be paid a modest salary by the Court. <br /><br />(11) <span style="font-weight:bold;">What will the lawyers and judges be paid?</span> They will be paid a continuation of their usual income stream. <br /><br />(12) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Where will the court be located?</span> It should be near the United Nations. The pre-trial location, which will only consist of a few brief meetings, can take place in any available courtroom in Manhattan, including courtrooms in law schools. The trial itself should take place on the campus of a coll
ege or community college at a reasonable distance from Manhattan. <br /><br />(13) <span style="font-weight:bold;">What about the pre-trial proceedings?</span> The judges should meet with the attorneys to set schedules and deadlines. The plaintiff should be given a month to submit a Complaint; the defendant a month to submit an Answer and Counterclaims if any; the plaintiff two weeks to reply to the counterclaims. Full jurisdiction is presumed. The court should not entertain any motion to strike or dismiss. There is no statute of limitations. No summary judgment, no discovery, no interrogatories. Based on the papers filed, the court should draw up a list of some ten to thirty contentious issues and hold a hearing with the parties as to the sufficiency of the list. The shorter the list, the better the public will be able to keep track of the proceedings.<br /><br />(14) <span style="font-weight:bold;">What will the trial be like?</span> The trial will follow the format of the average civil-law case, but with no jury. The biggest difference is that the case will be divided into the issues on the judges' list. Each issue will be a mini-trial, with witnesses and arguments. Except for questions they may ask, the judges will not indicate their views on the issues. Witnesses may be called, including experts. Hearsay evidence will be allowed and no objections permitted, but the judges will not base any part of their final decision on hearsay evidence. Each side will be given at least a day for their opening statement and their summing-up. If the trial is well-managed it should not take longer than six months.<br /><br />(15) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Why should the Obama administration support this idea?</span> The basic interest of the United States in the Mideast, as consistently expressed by Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and Obama, is the stability of the region. The specific issues dividing Israel and Palestine are not as important as a stable peace. Thus the United States would appear to have more of a stake in the legal process of the proposed Moot Court than in the specific conclusions the Court may reach. And since the Court's final judgment is not binding, it's hard to see that any harm would come out of implementing this proposal.  <br /><br /> <br /><em>Anthony D.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Sam Sasan Shoamanesh, a legal adviser with the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague and co-founder and Associate Editor of <a href="http://globalbrief.ca/">Global Brief</a>, Canada&#39;s first international affairs magazine, says that in order for the ICC to be fully effective in protecting human rights and bringing an end to impunity, Middle Eastern nations and all other states that have not yet ratified the Rome Statute must embrace the ICC.<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/SasanShoamanesh.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->T<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->o date, the Arab world and the nations of what is traditionally known as the 'Middle East' (<span style="font-style:italic;">ash-sharq-l-awsat</span> in Arabic, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ha-Mizrah Ha-Tikhon</span> in Hebrew, <span style="font-style:italic;">Kh&Auml;varmiy&Auml;neh</span> in Persian and <span style="font-style:italic;">Orta Do&Auml;&#376;u</span> in Turkish), have had, for the most part, reservations in joining the International Criminal Court (ICC). The Hague based Court is the first permanent international judicial institution with jurisdiction to try <span style="font-style:italic;">individuals</span> suspected of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and crime of aggression; the latter, once its legal definition is finally adopted (Article 5.2 of the Rome Statute). Many from the region, including Middle Eastern leaders and government officials, simply look at international (legal, financial, political, and military) organizations with great suspicion. They perceive them as mere tools of major 'Western powers', used (according to the argument) to advance the latter's politics and national interests cloaked under the banner of, <span style="font-style:italic;">inter alia</span>, protecting human rights. Bluntly put, these views and perceptions find their historical roots primarily in the experience of colonialism and foreign tampering in the Middle East, as well as in the politicized track record of the UN Security Council. The unfavorable Middle Eastern response towards the warrant of arrest issued by the ICC against the acting President of Sudan, Omar Hassan Ahmad Al-Bashir, is said to emanate from these same deeply entrenched perceptions.<br /><br />Without diving into whether or not such general criticisms are valid, as it relates to the ICC these views are not only ill-founded but sadly are serving to hamper the advancement and protection of human rights for the peoples of the region. And tragically, this in a 'land' that has historically experienced countless conflicts and that continues to lay witness to the suffering of millions of its inhabitants whose fundamental human rights have and continue to be trampled upon. A clearer understanding of the legal machinery and independence of the Court will reveal that there is in fact a symbiotic relationship between the ICC and Middle Eastern states, and more generally all sovereigns earnestly concerned about the cause of human rights and ensuring egregious international crimes do not go unpunished. The opportunity for this mutually fruitful partnership is yet to be fully seized.<br /><br />To date, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is the only state in the region which has ratified the founding treaty of the Court (Rome Statute: <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/EA9AEFF7-5752-4F84-BE94-0A655EB30E16/0/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">EN</a>, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/6A7E88C1-8A44-42F2-896F-D68BB3B2D54F/0/Rome_Statute_French.pdf">FR</a>, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/140176/Rome_Statute_Arabic.pdf">Arabic</a>), thus becoming the sole representative of the 'Middle East' at the ICC.  This <span style="font-style:italic;">status quo</span> must change. This commentary by design is aimed at responding to some of the anxieties and misperceptions which to date have prevented the region&#39;s nations from assuming their rightful places amongst the 110 and growing States Parties of the ICC.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">1.0.      Misconceived reservations about ICC ratification, jurisdiction, and independence</span><br /><br /> Misconceived notions that the Court is political or easily manipulated by the 'Great Powers' representing a threat to state sovereignty are ill-informed and emanate mostly from misapprehensions of the Court's legal machinery. There are, in fact, layers upon layers of protection existing in the legal edifice of the Court serving to guarantee the ICC's independence and respect for state sovereignty.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />1.1.  The complementarity principle</span><br /><br />To cite but a few examples, State Parties to the ICC, in the first instance will always exercise jurisdiction over their nationals even if they are accused of crimes falling within the mandate of the Court. The complementarity test under Article 17 of the Statute, in practice, means the ICC operates as a court of last resort, giving primacy of jurisdiction to national courts (see para. 10 of the Preamble and Article 1 of the Statute), exercising its jurisdiction only if the State Party is "unwilling or unable to genuinely" carry out investigations or prosecute violations of the specific crimes falling within the ambit of the Court's jurisdiction (Article 17.1(a)-(b)). "Sufficient gravity" of the crimes must also exist to warrant the Court's intervention (Article 17.1 (d)).<br /><br />Further, the contention that the complementarity test will favor Western nations that have well established legal systems is not entirely accurate.  The complementarity test is not gauged against a universal gold standard, but rather, guided by the criteria outlined in Article 17 of the Statute, it is applied on a case-by-case basis based on the specificities of the legal system in question. In effect, the Court fully respects the autonomy of national legal systems. Yet of course, the proceedings at the national level must be genuine, impartially and independently carried out "with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice," and they must respect the "principles of due process recognized by international law" (Article 17.2). Otherwise, the state in question will be considered "unwilling" to carry out the investigation and where warranted, the prosecution.  The "inability" to investigate or prosecute test outlined in Article 17.3 of the Statute concerns the "total or substantial collapse or unavailability" of the national judicial system, or relates to situations where the system is "unable to obtain the accused or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings." The legal requirements of Article 17.3 are designed to respond to, for instance, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/1FA7C4C6-DE5F-42B7-8B25-60AA962ED8B6/143594/030905_Policy_Paper.pdf">failed state situations or other cases</a> where internal political dynamics and reality on the ground do not make it possible for lawful prosecutions to be carried out.  Other situations where the state may be considered unable to adequately investigate and prosecute is where the domestic legal environment is operating in the midst of an active conflict or post-conflict situation.  The complementary assessment does not, therefore, aim to scrutinize the substantive nature of a given domestic legal system.<br /><br />Additionally, the complementarity principle in practice would translate into a situation where nations that have ratified, in order to strengthen their primary jurisdiction, will be inclined to initiate legislation and projects aimed at fortifying the domestic legal landscape and incorporating international crimes under the Court's jur
isdiction into domestic law &#8212; clearly a positive ancillary consequence of ratification in the overall aim of promoting human rights.<br /><br />Lastly, it is important to highlight an important point contained in the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/1FA7C4C6-DE5F-42B7-8B25-60AA962ED8B6/143594/030905_Policy_Paper.pdf">Policy Paper of the Office of the Prosecutor</a>.  Guided by the wording of the preamble (para. 4) and other pertinent provisions of the Statute (Article 5.1), ICC prosecutions are solely concerned with "those who bear the greatest responsibility" for the "most serious crimes of concern to the international community" within the Court's jurisdiction. In effect, this means that the Office of the Prosecutor as a <span style="font-style:italic;">general rule</span> will only be interested in the 'big fish' and will not be investigating every potential violation committed by actors positioned lower in the hierarchy. This policy is yet another ICC reality which minimizes the Court's scrutiny into otherwise sovereign domain. The "sufficient gravity" principle encapsulated in Article 17.1(d) of the Statute, again, further confines the intervention of the ICC to only exceptional cases where a clear threshold of "gravity" of the acts constituting the crimes in question and the degree of participation in their commission  have been reached to justify further action by the Court.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />1.2.    Preconditions and exercise of jurisdiction</span><br /><br />The ICC exercises its jurisdiction over natural persons and attributes individual criminal responsibility to those who: either (i) as <span style="font-style:italic;">nationals of a State Party</span> have committed offences within the jurisdiction of the Court, or (ii) <span style="font-style:italic;">committed such crimes in the territory of a State Party</span>. Further, the Court exercises its jurisdiction <span style="font-style:italic;">rationae temporis</span> and without retroactive application. Therefore, the Court can have jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of the Statute (1 July 2002). As it concerns nations that ratify after the entry into force of the Statute, the Court can exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed after the date of ratification by that state. An exception to this rule is provided for in Article 12.3 of the Statute where a state can make a declaration under the provision to bring itself under the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to a crime(s) previously committed (with 1 July 2002 being the cut off date).<br /><br />The Court may exercise its jurisdiction when a situation is referred to the Prosecutor by a State Party or the Security Council, or finally, when the Prosecutor initiates an investigation <span style="font-style:italic;">proprio motu</span> (on its own accord) (Article 13). Where the ICC Prosecutor initiates an investigation on his own, in all such instances, it is up to the Pre-Trial Chamber of the Court consisting of a panel of international judges &#8212; a separate and independent judicial organ &#8212; to review the evidence and determine whether or not the Court has jurisdiction and whether a "reasonable basis" exists for the Prosecutor to proceed with investigations (Article 15.3-4). It is also the Pre-Trial Chamber which decides if a warrant of arrest is to be issued in response to an application filed by the Office of the Prosecutor (Article 58). Even where an investigation is undertaken by the Prosecutor, within a defined period, the State Party whose national is under investigation can inform the Prosecutor it is or will carry out its own investigations of the crimes in question. If done in good faith, the State Party can then undertake the prosecution at the national level. Further, the prohibition against double-jeopardy is entrenched in the ICC Statute, so that a person who has already been tried by a national court for crimes falling within the jurisdiction of the Court cannot be re-prosecuted by the ICC (Article 20). Again, the trial at the national level has to be fair and impartial and not merely a ploy to shield the person from criminal responsibility. <br /><br />More importantly, even when the Security Council refers a situation to the Prosecutor acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter (Article 13(b)) &#8212; as was the case with Sudan for instance &#8212; contrary to popular belief, the Prosecutor is <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> automatically bound to follow the referral. The Office of the Prosecutor will independently assess the information and evidence received from all sources and gauge whether there is a "reasonable basis to proceed" to initiate an investigation (Article 53).  In the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Investigations/">words of the Office of the Prosecutor</a>: "[t]he triggering mechanism does not in any way change the way the Office selects situations, cases or individuals to be investigated. It does not make a difference whether the situation is referred by a State Party or the UNSC [United Nations Security Council]. The selection of situations, cases inside the situations, and persons to be investigated is always an independent prosecutorial decision based on the Statute and the evidence collected."<br /><br />These independence mechanisms are the <span style="font-style:italic;">sine qua non</span> of the Court's legitimacy and credibility.  In sum, the Court operates independently <span style="font-style:italic;">de jure</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span>.<br /><br />The above should therefore clarify for the Middle Eastern critic why at this juncture in the Court's evolution the ICC could, for instance, pursue cases related to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/States+Parties/African%20States">30 African states</a>, or the other <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/">80 nations</a> that have ratified the Court's Statute, but not in other situations. It also bears noting that in the past, the Office of the Prosecutor has <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/04D143C8-19FB-466C-AB77-4CDB2FDEBEF7/143682/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf">scrupulously analyzed allegations of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity allegedly committed in Iraq by the UK army</a> (the UK is a State Party). The Office of the Prosecutor has even determined that based on "all the available information, [&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;] there was a reasonable basis to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, namely willful killing and inhuman treatment" ("War Crimes": Article 8). Yet having conducted a thorough analysis, it concluded that the Article 17 gravity threshold was not met in the case.  "4 to 12 victims of wilful killing and a limited number of victims of inhuman treatment" by the UK army were identified based on the materials before the Office of the Prosecutor. Further, it was determined that the complementarity test was satisfied in the case; meaning that "national proceedings [in the UK] has been initiated with respect to each of the relevant incidents" under study. Additionally, in April 2008, the Chief Prosecutor of the ICC confirmed his office was analyzing the situation in Afghanistan &#8212; a State Party &#8212;, and amassing information to gauge if and when to commence official investigations into alleged crimes committed on Afghan territory.  Recently, he has echoed his previous statement stating that the office is gathering data on possible war crimes committed in Afghanistan relating to both <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/43060b66-9dcc-11de-8de8-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F43060b66-9dcc-11de-8de8-00144feabdc0.html%3Fftcamp%3Drss%26nclick_check%3D1&_i_referer=&ftcamp=rss&nclick_check=1">NATO and Taliban forces</a>.  Again, outside of the African continent, the Office of the Prosecutor is also busy conducting preliminary inquiries in <a href="http://www.icc-cpi
.int/menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/press%20releases%20(2008)/icc%20prosecutor%20confirms%20situation%20in%20georgia%20under%20analysis">Georgia</a> and the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Comm+and+Ref/Palestine/">Gaza Strip</a>. It is interesting to note that the fact-finding mission mandated by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the Gaza War of 2008 has just concluded that there is evidence indicating that both the Israel Defense Forces and Palestinian armed groups committed actions amounting to war crimes and potentially crimes against humanity. The 574-page report of the mission, headed by Justice Richard Goldstone, recommends the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to undertake "credible" investigations and prosecutions into alleged violations and report their progress to the Security Council within six months. More interestingly for the purposes of this commentary, the report concluded that upon expiration of the deadline if the parties have failed to oblige, the Security Council should <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/UNFFMGC_Report.pdf">refer the situation to the ICC Prosecutor</a>. Whether or not this transpires will be known in time, and will depend on the workings of the Security Council.<br /><br />Therefore when objectively examined, the issue is not a question of a 'bias' in the <span style="font-style:italic;">modus operandi</span> of the Court, but simply the reality of the Court's jurisdiction limited primarily by the very fact that Middle Eastern states &#8212; except Jordan &#8212; amongst other nations have to date failed to ratify.  This limiting reality can change for the benefit of all who genuinely value human rights as more nations ratify the Statute.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">2.        Benefits of ratification</span><br /><br />The grim lessons of the region's modern history, further complicated by its geopolitical reality and strategic importance, combine to support the notion that ICC ratification can in fact prove beneficial by acting as a deterrence mechanism and by providing legal recourse in the event that nations from the region fall victim to aggression by neighboring states. Examples of disparaging regional interstate conflicts in recent memory include: Iraq's invasion of Iran and Kuwait in 1980 and 1990 respectively, Israel's offensive on Lebanon in 2006, and the wars waged against Israel in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War or the Yom Kippur War to name a few.  Furthermore, the ICC could protect the region&#39;s states from external threats similar to the Persian Gulf War in 1990 or the 2003 American invasion of Iraq. <br /><br />By becoming a State Party, Middle Eastern states would facilitate the jurisdiction of the Court over crimes covered by the Statute committed by a foreign military force or armed groups on their territory, even if the aggressor(s) are not nationals of a State Party.  A real life example which highlights the importance of ratification is the 2008 South Ossetia War.  Georgia was a State Party at the time the conflict broke out, during which the Russian military was engaged on Georgian territory. The fact that Georgia has ratified the Statute has meant that the Court has territorial jurisdiction and could potentially investigate alleged crimes committed on Georgian territory by all sides to the dispute. This includes the Russian army, notwithstanding the fact that Russia is not a State Party of the Court. The Georgia matter is <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/press%20releases%20(2008)/icc%20prosecutor%20confirms%20situation%20in%20georgia%20under%20analysis">currently under analysis by the Office of the Prosecutor</a>.<br /><br />Of course, ratification would also mean that should States Parties commit the crimes listed in the ICC Statute in their own territory or elsewhere against their own populations or the nationals of another state, whether a State Party or otherwise, their own actions would become subject to examination under the Court's jurisdiction &#8212; again a positive result if we are genuinely committed to protecting human rights and bringing an end to impunity. In each scenario, the complementarity test and other questions of admissibility must be positively answered before the Court will exercise its <span style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span> jurisdiction. Nonetheless, one can see how ratification could (i) have a deterrence value for would-be aggressors, (ii) provide an avenue for judicial recourse for violations committed by internal and external actors, and (iii) help cultivate a culture of human rights and awareness of international criminal law in the region.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />3.       Rights of the defense at the ICC</span><br /><br />Yet another anxiety contributing to reservations of joining the ICC is the question: what happens to the state's nationals once implicated in proceedings before the Court? What kind of legal representation and defense are they afforded? These are legitimate questions that any sovereign should pose before surrendering its nationals to another jurisdiction to be tried.<br /><br />From a legal framework, the Court's legal texts are replete with safeguards concerning the rights of the defense. Fundamental guarantees are found in the Statute, which include, <span style="font-style:italic;">inter alia</span>, the codification of the principles of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ne bis in idem</span> (Article 20); prohibition against the creation of <span style="font-style:italic;">ex post facto</span> laws (Article 22); grounds for excluding criminal responsibility (Article 31); and presumption of innocence (Article 66).  The rights of the accused to a public, impartial and fair hearing, amongst other minimum guarantees are provided in Article 67 of the Statute. Article 67 rights of the defense are consistent with international instruments providing the same guarantees (e.g. Article 14 of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm"><span style="font-style:italic;">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</span></a>, Article 6 of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm"><span style="font-style:italic;">European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</span></a>). The exercise of such rights is effectively assured by the judicial control of the Court's Chambers. Moreover, Rule 20 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Rules of Procedure and Evidence</span> places a positive obligation on the Registrar of the Court to organize "the Registry in a manner that promotes the rights of the defense consistent with the principle of a fair trial."<br /><br />Building on the lessons acquired from the experience of hybrid special courts and the UN <span style="font-style:italic;">ad hoc</span> tribunals, with the aim of achieving 'equality of arms' between the prosecution and the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Defence/">defense</a>, the ICC has in place the most robust systems. From ensuring that defendants freely choose their lead <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Defence/Counsel/">counsel</a> from a pool of qualified independent lawyers, and benefit from capable legal teams reinforced by substantive legal assistance provided by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Defence/Office+of+Public+Counsel+for+the+Defence/">Office of Public Counsel for the Defense</a>, to a structured favorable legal aid scheme and other support services, the defense pillar at the Court is alive and well, and continues to be bolstered.  <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Defence/Counsel/">Admission to the Court's List of Counsel</a> eligible to represent suspects and accused persons in ICC proceedings is open to all lawyers worldwide who meet certain quality assurance requirements (see Rule 22 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Rules of Procedure

Qualified lawyers from the Middle East and beyond ought to apply to the Court's List of Counsel to get involved in ICC proceedings first hand, contribute to the Court's legacy, and carry the knowledge acquired back to their home jurisdictions.  Lawyers need not be citizens of a State Party to apply to the Court's List of Counsel.<br /><br />Since its genesis, the ICC has aimed to be a model judicial institution capable of delivering quality justice. The ICC has in practice demonstrated that it is cognizant of the fact that a strong defense pillar at the Court and the conduct of fair trials before an independent judiciary that pay homage to the rights of the defense are pivotal in ensuring that the virtuous principles and goals defined in the preamble of its Statute can be achieved. Moreover, a viable defense and the conduct of fair trials are critical to achieving universal jurisdiction &#8212; an important aim of the Court. Lastly, trials that are conducted in conformity with the highest judicial standards and respect for due process rights of defendants also prevent the adverse result that would otherwise exist where warranted convictions are obtained, yet victims are re-victimized and their ordeals cheapened by critics of the system who would label the proceedings as partial or tainted with due process failures. The Court is very much in tune with these concerns. While there is always room for improvement, an objective assessment of the record to date illustrates that the Court makes every effort to avoid such an undesirable outcome, ensuring that individuals implicated in proceedings before it benefit from fair trials. The stay of proceedings by Trial Chamber I in the case of <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc511249.PDF">Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo</a> is a case in point. The judges of the Trial Chamber in that case ruled that the Prosecution's inability to disclose to the defense exculpatory materials in its possession obtained through confidential agreements with the United Nations pursuant to Article 54.3(e) of the Statute had worked to the detriment of the rights of the accused to a fair trial.  On appeal, the Trial Chamber's decision to stay the proceedings was <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc578371.pdf">upheld by the Court's Appeals Chamber</a>.  A myriad of other examples are to be found in the growing ICC jurisprudence and in the policies and <span style="font-style:italic;">modus operandi</span> of the Registry of the Court. <br /><br />Consequently, any person ever brought before the Court will be afforded all the requisite facilities, legal assistance, and safeguards in an effort to ensure he/she undergoes a fair trial.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Lack of judges trained in Islamic traditions</span><br /><br />A further expressed concern is that there are no judges at the ICC trained in Islamic law. The argument is as follows: given that ICC judges are not accustomed to the intricacies of Islamic law, they will judge Middle Eastern states &#8212; whose legal systems are for the most part influenced by the Shari'a &#8212; unfairly.  Again this is a misconception. The hierarchy of applicable law at the Court is provided in Article 21 of the Statute, which stipulates that in the first instance, the legal texts of the Court should be applied, second, followed by international treaties and principles and jurisprudence established in international law where appropriate, and lastly, when the other two sources are exhausted, reference can be made to the general principles of law as found in national laws of legal systems of the world. Hence, a judge's religious training or personal background are immaterial to the extent that these have no real bearing on what law should be applied. This means that no matter the personal belief of a particular ICC judge, whether secular, Muslim, Jewish, or Christian, he or she is strictly bound to apply the sources of law defined in Article 21 of the Statute and in the sequence required. At best, a judge's theological training or background at the national level may have a bearing when a last-resort reference is made to national laws. Even then, national laws could be relied upon provided they are not inconsistent with the Statute, "international law and internationally recognized norms and standards."<br /><br />For what it is worth, should any Middle Eastern state become a State Party, it will have the right to nominate its own candidates for election as ICC judges (Article 36). The Statute also requires that judges are selected in view of representation of all legal systems of the world as well as equitable geographical considerations (Article 36(8)). Hence, it is fair to conclude the possibility of having such nominees elected are rather probable. Moreover, membership with the Court will mean Middle Eastern prosecutors, judges, lawyers, and other relevant professional can apply and take up vacancies in all organs of the institution, seeing firsthand how the ICC operates while having the opportunity to contribute to the Court's development.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">5. The 'cultural relativism' hurdle</span><br /><br />International humanitarian law and international criminal law are designed to deter and minimize the suffering and occurrence of war, and to hold those responsible for the commission of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community accountable for their actions.  The unsightly face of war is universal. The same is true for the laws created to bring method to the madness of war.  Hence, to the honest observer, the position that such laws have 'Western' orientations and therefore, should not be applied to Eastern Islamic societies does not withstand the slightest objective scrutiny.  This holds particularly true in light of the fact that the Qur'an itself, apart from embracing the notion of "justice" as one of its core principles, contains countless provisions itemizing unacceptable conduct during hostilities. For instance, under Islamic Law in the 'Siyar' (Arabic for 'behaviour') war can <span style="font-style:italic;">only</span> be waged in self-defence (Qur'an 2:190, 193). Further, Islamic scholars assert that concepts such as the 'principle of distinction', that belligerents must distinguish between civilians and combatants; the principle of 'necessity and proportionality&#39;; the proper treatment of prisoners of war (Qur'an: 9:5, 47:4) and the prohibition against their executions; and the prohibitions against enslavement, plunder, destruction of civilian objects, and the use of poisonous weapons are all Islamic doctrines enshrined in the Qu'ran and the Hadith, oral traditions based on the spoken words and conduct of Prophet Muhammad during his lifetime.<br /><br />To claim, therefore, that certain provisions of the Statute may not be compatible with Islamic law (Shari'a) &#8212; applied strictly in only a handful of Middle Eastern states &#8212; and therefore, they cannot ratify the Statute is a patently untenable position to maintain. In particular when countless States Parties of the ICC have Islamic Constitutions; Islam as their official religion, or as the religion of the maj
ority of their population (circa 50 percent or more). The table below lists these countries, with other relevant details.<br /><br /><object id="_ds_11583399" name="_ds_11583399" width="643" height="510" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://viewer.docstoc.com/"><param name="FlashVars" value="doc_id=11583399&mem_id=844527&doc_type=doc&fullscreen=0&showrelated=0&showotherdocs=0" /><param name="movie" value="http://viewer.docstoc.com/"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /></object><br /><font size=2>*NB: Additionally, two other States Parties to the ICC that have substantial Muslim populations are Bosnia and Herzegovina (40 per cent) as well as Tanzania (35 per cent).</font><br /><br />In view of the above, should Middle Eastern nations adopt a rigid position vis-&Atilde;&nbsp;-vis ratification, while the 110 member states of the Court and growing will embrace the 21st century and reap the protections afforded by the ICC, the region will find itself exposed and isolated from an increasingly interconnected international community. Finding themselves positioned in a historically quarrelsome region, it is in the interests of Middle Eastern nations to recognize that joining the ICC is in fact in their national interests. Should such states wish to import into ICC law elements of, <span style="font-style:italic;">inter alia</span>, Islamic jurisprudence, -rationale and -approach which are <span style="font-style:italic;">in conformity</span> with universally accepted legal norms, they can do so by engagement and involvement, not by alienation and isolation.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">6. Head of state or government immunity </span><br /><br />Article 27 of the Rome Statute pierces the traditional head of state or government immunity by extending the reach of the Court's jurisdiction to all those who commit egregious crimes irrespective of their title or status.  Immunities afforded to heads of states will not bar the Court from the exercise of its jurisdiction.  This rule is in keeping with earlier precedents in the discipline both codified and judicially rendered (see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic;">Genocide Convention</span> (Article IV); <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imtconst.asp#art7">Charter of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremburg</a></span> (Article 7); <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.jus.uio.no/treaties/04/4-06/military-tribunal-far-east.xml">Statutes of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East Charter</a></span> (Article 6); <span style="font-style:italic;">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</span> (Article 7(2));  <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/basicdocs/statute/2007.pdf">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a></span> (Article 6(2)) and the <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=uClnd1MJeEw%3D&">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a></span> (Article 6.2). See similarly Article 6 of the Statute of the <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/BackgroundDocuments/Statutes/Resolution%201757-Agreement-Statue-EN.pdf">Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a></span> with respect to invalidity of amnesties; <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=%2FD7FMJxcHd0%3D&tabid=191">SCSL Appeals Chamber ruling of 31 May 2004</a> re Charles Taylor; <a href="http://test1.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/tdec/en/1110873516829.htm">ICTY Trial Chamber ruling of 8 November 2001</a> re Milosevic, and <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/tdec/en/090708.pdf">ICTY Trial Chamber ruling of 8 July 2009</a> re Karadzic cases to name  a few). Prohibitive non-derogable norms of egregious international crimes like genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are arguably <span style="font-style:italic;">jus cogens<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span> crimes and cannot reasonably be considered as part of a state's legitimate functions to justify immunity protection. <br /><br />While heads of states or other senior officials of governments in the Middle East and elsewhere might feel anxious with respect to this provision, failing to ratify on this ground alone cannot possibly be in line with a genuine commitment to the cause of human rights both domestically and internationally. Surely we can all agree the principle of immunity in international law should not be used as a shield to protect the <span style="font-style:italic;">hostis humanis generis</span> from due prosecutions. <br /><br />To conclude, certainly it is a most notable position to advance that we want justice applied equally to all those who commit crimes which shock the human conscience.  We must equally understand that if there is any international judicial institution which has the right history and founding, and the potential to be a truly international court of criminal justice, it is the ICC. It is not by rejectionism that we can better ensure the balance of international justice and rule of law remains impartial and free from political interference, but by involvement and support for the Court.  It is through ratification and through helping the Court achieve universal jurisdiction that the net of the ICC can be cast ever wider to catch all those who are criminally responsible whether at home or abroad.<br /><br />The Middle East offered the world the first legal code crafted by Urukagina in 2300 B.C.; the Code of Hammurabi (1790 B.C.); the Cyrus Cylinder (539 B.C.), considered to be the first charter of human rights in recorded history, and the Treaty of Kadesh (1274 B.C.), the world's first international peace treaty. The region has been the birthplace of many of the major canons of human morality &#8212; Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam to name a few &#8212; carving human philosophical reflections over the ages into rudimentary yet fundamental questions of 'right' and 'wrong,' detailing codes of acceptable human conduct (i.e. Ten Commandments&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;). In the 21st century, the region can stay true to its prolific beginnings by embracing the International Criminal Court, truly a first in its class and for its time.  By so doing, Middle Eastern states can dramatically change the <span style="font-style:italic;">status quo</span> for the benefit of the region and the cultivation of a culture of respect for human rights globally. With active participation they can help make the international face of the Court shine ever brighter with diversity, all the while assisting it to better achieve the notable aims outlined in its founding treaty.<br /><br />The world is a complex place dominated by realpolitik considerations. By shedding traditional self-defeating rejectionist postures and by espousing the ICC as State Parties, those in power in the Middle East can enhance the region&#39;s standing in the international legal order, and more importantly, they can demonstrate whether they are truly committed to the protection and promotion of the inviolable human rights of their citizens. Imagine an international criminal justice system under which "no ruler, no state, no junta and no army anywhere will be able to abuse human rights with impunity." It is by ratification that Middle Eastern states and all nations that are yet to embrace the ICC can bring us ever closer to this ideal existence. It is only then that we can finally proudly proclaim that we as citizens and nations of the world recognize the inviolability of human rights and will not allow violations and violators to go unpunished.<br />     <br /><br /><em>Sam Sasan Shoamanesh is an international lawyer and has worked for several international legal institutions.

First, Obama announced that the administration would not seek additional authorization from Congress to indefinitely detain terror suspects being held at Guantanamo.  Rather than seek additional authorization, the administration will continue to rely for its power over these individuals on the Congressional authorization to use military force enacted after September 11, 2001 (the AUMF).  Second, the President announced a new policy regarding assertions of the state secrets privilege.  <br /><br /><strong>Indefinite Detention</strong><br /><br />As the U.S. Supreme Court has concluded, the AUMF likely provides the President with the authority he needs to detain the terrorism suspects at Guantanamo.  Many if not all were captured and detained as a consequence of actions that flowed from President Bush's implementation of Congress's directives in the AUMF.  At this point, moreover, Congressional silence on the matter suggests a tacit acknowledgement that the Obama administration's view of the scope of the AUMF, like the Bush administration's, is correct.  <br /><br />To be sure, the Obama administration is departing from the Bush administration in disclaiming reliance upon inherent executive power under the Constitution to justify the indefinite detention of terror suspects.  This is all to the good.  Absent a true emergency situation&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;one in which Congress is effectively disabled from acting to authorize Presidential action&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the argument that the President has the inherent authority to hold individuals indefinitely without charge or trial is dubious.<br /><br />It remains, though, that the administration's current position does not answer the question whether the President will be able to exercise similar power over terror suspects in the future&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;suspects who could not reasonably fall within the scope of the AUMF.  That we will capture such individuals is more than an idle possibility.  Congress would be within its constitutionally-assigned role to begin to develop a framework for authorizing this and future Presidents to detain terror suspects, providing flexible guidance as to the circumstances in which this power will exist as well as its operative limits. <br /><br />At present, neither the President nor the Congress quite knows what to do with the detainees at Guantanamo who for various reasons are not eligible for trial.  This is a national embarrassment, and it might have been avoided if President Obama's predecessor had recognized the role Congress should play in creating a structure for Presidential action.  Congressional involvement might not have resulted in the blank check of authority President Bush appeared to desire, but engagement in the democratic process itself would have created a mechanism for greater accountability in respect to the measures the President ultimately elected to pursue.  <br /><br />Further, it might just have avoided the United States being responsible for a couple dozen individuals spending the rest of their days in physical isolation and legal limbo&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;suspected of the most profound wrongdoing, but ineligible for the most basic determinations of guilt and punishment.<br /><br /><strong>State Secrets</strong><br /><br />In the second development, Attorney General Eric Holder announced a series of new procedures that must be followed before an executive agency of the federal government can assert the state secrets privilege in any litigation.  President Obama's predecessor was criticized for routinely invoking the state secrets privilege in a number of lawsuits over that administration's domestic electronic surveillance program and its practice of extraordinary renditions.  Many hoped President Obama would reverse or at least limit the controversial practice of asserting the privilege in these and like cases.  But President Obama continued the practice of his predecessor in asserting the privilege, effectively shutting down the litigation of many controversial cases.<br /><br />Perhaps in response to that criticism and to make good on his campaign promises, the President's Attorney General has implemented a new process for internally evaluating the legitimate invocation of the state secrets privilege.  Under this new process, all government agencies, including the intelligence community, must convince a team of Justice Department lawyers and the Attorney General that the release of information would present a significant harm to national defense or foreign relations.  This is contrary to the current practice, which permits the head of a department or agency to make the determination that disclosure of information would be harmful to national defense or foreign relations.<br /><br />There is no doubt that this new procedure, which goes into effect on 1 October 2009, could make it more difficult for an agency to invoke the state secrets privilege.  First, the Attorney General, an official who is at least somewhat removed from the requesting agency, theoretically can make a more independent assessment of the issue.  Second, a higher standard of harm must be shown in order for the privilege to be asserted.  This procedure has been recognized as a step in the right direction by the American Civil Liberties Union and others who have been litigating for the release of protected information.<br /><br />It is important, however, not to miss what is going on here.  By unilaterally declaring a new policy for the implementation of the state secrets privilege, the President seems to be tacitly acknowledging that his predecessor asserted the privilege in situations where it was not justified.  <br /><br />At the same time, if the President alone can set the terms, scope, and procedure for how the privilege is to be invoked, what assurances do we have that this President is invoking it in a more legitimate way and, more to the point, what is to prevent this or some future President from again changing direction and improperly asserting the privilege?  By keeping the decision on this issue within the sole prerogative of the Executive, Mr. Obama looks much like his predecessor.<br /><br />Like the issue of indefinite detention, this is a situation that calls out for congressional action.  Given the murky origins of the state secrets privilege, Congress can and should accept responsibility for codifying its dimensions.  Codification through the deliberative process, too, would allow for greater accountability through Congress and the courts.<br /><br />The true benefit of congressional involvement in national security matters is that adherence and respect for our constitutional values will not depend solely upon the personality of the person who occupies the Oval Office or upon the nature of the immediate crisis at hand.  Rather, adherence to these constitutional values will be a function of the full engagement in the deliberative process of both political branches of our government.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Lawrence Friedman t

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that to really deliver on his recent declaration at the UN that &quot;international law is not an empty promise, and that Treaties will be enforced,&quot; President Obama should have pledged aggressive action to withdraw erroneous US reservations, understandings, and declarations and to enact new legislation showing real domestic commitment to the international rule of law....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/paustbig.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->P<!-- odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->resident Obama's historic remarks at the United Nations on September 23rd entitled "<a href="http://www.unausa.org/Document.Doc?id=471">Responsibility for our Common Future</a>" are of particular relevance for those who have been waiting for the United States to comply more fully with its treaty obligations in the areas of human rights law and international criminal law.  The President noted that some believe more generally that "America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others," and that with respect to international law, "[t]he world must stand together to demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise, and that Treaties will be enforced."  <br /><br />With apologies to the President, I offer (fictitious) follow-up remarks that were not recorded:<blockquote>Today, I sent formal notice to the U.N. Secretary-General that the United States withdraws its erroneous prior "understanding" that Article II of the Genocide Convention merely reaches prohibited conduct when there is a specific intent to destroy a relevant group in whole or in "substantial" part.  The treaty expressly covers an intent to destroy a relevant group "in part" and does not contain the word "substantial," nor does any other international criminal law instrument that defines the crime of genocide as it exists under customary international law (such as the statutes of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia [ICTY], the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda [ICTR], and the International Criminal Court [ICC]). <br /><br />Clearly the unilateral prior understanding was in error.  "The people of the world want change.  They will not tolerate those who are on the wrong side of history" and "transformative change can be forged by those who choose the side of justice."  The United States will now assure that the Genocide Convention is "not an empty promise."  In order to permit enforcement of our treaty obligations under the Convention (which are otherwise later in time and which prevail against inconsistent legislation), I have asked Congress to delete Section 1093(8) of the U.S. genocide legislation.  It is clearly incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty and nearly assures that the United States will not be able to prosecute the crime of genocide and fulfill U.S. obligations under the treaty [see, e.g., <a href="/pdf/2009Vermont.pdf">33 Vermont L. Rev. 717 (2009)</a>].  Under present legislation, a perpetrator would have to have an intent to destroy "part of a group of such numerical significance that the destruction or loss of that part would cause the destruction of the group as a viable entity."  This is clearly improper, it could make our commitment under the treaty an empty promise, and it places the United States "on the wrong side of history."<br /><br />I have also asked Congress to finally enact legislation that incorporates "crimes against humanity" by reference, as we have done with respect to piracy and at least one set of laws concerning all violations of the laws of war.<br /><br />With respect to U.S. obligations under human rights law, I have sent formal notice to the Secretary-General that the United States withdraws the prior U.S. Declaration No. 1 concerning partial non-self-execution of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (which, in any event, did not apply to the mandate in Article 50), since the international community has long recognized that it is substantially incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty, <span style="font-style:italic;">void ab initio</span> as a matter of law, and of no lawful effect. <br /><br />I have also withdrawn the attempted reservation to the Convention Against Torture that had declared erroneously that the U.S. "considers itself bound by the obligation under Article 16 ... only insofar as" the treaty's prohibitions of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment match what is covered under the U.S. Constitution.  The unilateral consideration was in error and, as the international community has long understood, incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty and, therefore, has been <span style="font-style:italic;">void ab initio</span> as a matter of law.  I have withdrawn a similar putative reservation to the International Covenant that had rested on the same erroneous consideration.  I will also ask Congress to pass new legislation that assures full coverage of the Convention Against Torture's prohibitions of torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.  We also hereby make known to the world that we formally recognize that human rights law applies during times of armed conflict and that Article 2, paragraph 2 of the Convention Against Torture expressly affirms that "a state of war or a threat of war" cannot obviate the treaty-based prohibition of torture.  We will fully comply with our obligations under all relevant treaties, including that of every member of the United Nations to assure "universal respect for, and observance of, human rights."<br /><br />With respect to U.S. obligations under international criminal law concerning genocide and crimes against humanity and the obligations of the U.S. under human rights law, "[w]e have reached a pivotal moment.  The United States stands ready to begin a new chapter of international cooperation &#8212; one that recognizes the rights and responsibilities of all nations."</blockquote> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Jordan J. Paust is the Mike &amp; Teresa Baker Law Center Professor at the University of Houston.  His suggestions for presidential withdrawals of erroneous putative reservations, understandings, and declarations and for new legislation appear in recent writings such as "The Absolute Prohibition of Torture and Necessary and Appropriate Sanctions," 43 Valp. L. Rev. 1535, 1570-73 (2009); and "The Need for New U.S. Legislation for Prosecution of Genocide and Other Crimes Against Humanity," 33 Vt. L. Rev. 717 (2009).</span><br />

		<title>LIBERIA: Destruction of Documents Undermines Common Law System</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adrienne Lester, Pitt Law &#39;11, interned at the Honorable House of Representatives for the Republic of Liberia this summer...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Liberia-210-772655.JPG"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Liberia-210-772285.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">W</span>est Africa evokes images of Juju child soldiers, dismembered limbs, and volatile men in short-sleeved safari suits with aviator sunglasses. When I had the opportunity to intern with the House of Representatives for the Republic of Liberia in the summer of 2009, I accepted with a mixture of excitement and uncertainty. However, planning for an internship in the world&#39;s fourth least-developed nation (as determined by the UN Development Index) proved to be quite an endeavor unto itself. There are few resources about Liberia online or in print, and there is even less information coming out of the country.<br /><br />Liberia has been at war for nearly two decades, a fact I knew prior to my departure but which was resoundingly affirmed within moments of my arrival. However, the most significant casualty of the violent civil war has been the legal system, founded on common law tradition. Due to the physical destruction of valuable documents, including statutes and court decisions, the judiciary cannot utilize what would otherwise be its greatest tool for sustaining the rule of law: precedent. This situation severely threatens the consistency and reliability of the law within Liberia.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Liberia-204-738635.JPG"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Liberia-204-738279.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>The civil war involved intermittent fighting from the Doe Regime of 1980 up to the interim government established in 2003. During this time, Liberia experienced a series of autocratic regimes with corresponding rebel forces. This period was characterized by horrific ethnic violence, rapidly-shifting political dynamics, and the wholesale collapse of the rule of law. The event with potentially the largest impact on the legal system of Liberia was the looting and destruction of the archives of the National Legislature. As a result, documents are either completely missing, or as with the Culture and Tourism statutes, only partially intact.<br /><br />A major complication of my internship was determining where genuine gaps in the law exist, because Liberia lacks a centralized archival system. Currently, there are at least four archives in Liberia: The House of Representatives, the Senate, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the University of Liberia. There is no central body which has cataloged the remnants of Liberian archives or which tracks the loaning of documents. Also, there is no internal organization of documents within the archives, leading to stacks of papers and books strewn about on the floor. Another, perhaps obvious, observation is that electronic management of governmental documents is non-existent. Electricity from generators is inconsistent and computers are too expensive for the government of a country staggering under $1.8 billion in debt - 123% of the GDP.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Liberia-410-796911.JPG"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Liberia-410-796532.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>Allegations circulate regarding the smuggling of forged statutes into the archives for socio-political gain. With the post-conflict limitations, it would be difficult to determine the legitimacy of the entire archive, let alone the fallibility of one document in particular. Additionally, this scenario further undermines the legitimacy of the Liberian government in the minds of the people, because these stories are covered regularly in the Liberian press. Thus, when statutes and case law are applied in the courts, there is a sentiment that the laws are unreliable and may serve the personal, corrupt interests of others.<br /><br />A common solution in post-conflict countries is to use laws from other, established legal systems. In Liberia, US law serves a gap-filling function: if there is no Liberian precedent on point, US law is applied. While both countries have common law legal systems, they have major differences in governmental structure and culture. Thus, there are dangers in copying without understanding the cultural foundation, legislative history, or precedent. The resulting law may be ineffective in regulating behavior, and may remain on the books without being enforced.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Liberia-270-721414.JPG"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Liberia-270-721045.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>Working in the Liberian context necessitated creative legal research and drafting. For instance, I was instructed to draft an amendment to the definition of Sexual Harassment in the Code of Conduct for all Public Servants for the Republic of Liberia. However, instead of confining research to the Penal Code&#39;s sections dealing with rape, I had to broaden my the scope to include international legal sources. Definitions from African nations, the European Union, the United Nations, as well as the United States were examined and synthesized. The result was a definition that took advantage of established legal orders, but was also sensitive to the Liberian cultural context.<br /><br />Despite obstacles to precedent and legal research, post-conflict recovery in Liberia boasts a number of accomplishments. Most notably, the elections of 2005 produced the first democratically-elected female head of state in Africa - Her Excellency Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.  A more recent milestone, and one I experienced during my internship, was the release of the official report from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This report represents the next step towards accountability for war crimes committed in Liberia. As the country prepares for its second democratic election in 2012, the burgeoning spirit of democracy in this coastal African country will be tested, and hopefully prevail, creating fresh images of West Africa.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Sources:<br /><br />Jeremy I.

		<title>G-20 EXTRA ~ Anarchists in Pittsburgh</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ingrid Burke, Pitt Law &#39;11, Lynsie Clott, and Aaron Freudenthal attended licensed and unlicensed protests primarily organized by self-proclaimed anarchist groups during the G-20 Summit....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it&quot;</span><br />-Beatrice Hall, <u>Friends of Voltaire</u><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/an1-758699.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 200px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/an1-758677.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>The City of Pittsburgh undertook an enormous security burden by agreeing to host the G-20 summit.  For two days, the heads of the EU and the 19 wealthiest nations were in the city.  Regardless of the popularity each might enjoy both domestically and internationally, each has their share of enemies by virtue of policies they&#39;ve inherited or implemented.  It was clear from the start that the city and federal security forces would be expected to take any measures necessary to ensure the well-being of the officials specifically and Pittsburgh in general.  <br /><br />In the days leading up to the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh, many interest groups took advantage of the opportunity to draw attention to their various causes.  I had the chance to learn about several of these groups by attending events and speaking with  organizers.  Some of these experiences were very informative, but of all the groups I spent time with, one made an unforgettable impact: the anarchists. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/an2-789984.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/an2-789961.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>To be honest, they were the group I had been least interested in covering.  Before last week, the thought of anarchy evoked in my mind images of angst-ridden preteens with overly simplistic conceptions of society and governance.  After two experiences among the anarchists, my sentiments changed.  My personal views are diametrically opposed to those of the anarchists, but I can&#39;t deny that their presence in Pittsburgh shed light on the free speech issues underlying several of the measures taken by Pittsburgh officials.  In order to tell the anarchists&#39; story in the context of these issues, I&#39;ve enlisted the help of a couple of insiders: social movement researchers Lynsie Clott and Aaron Freudenthal. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Background</span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/an43-768614.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/an43-768595.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>The G-20 summit is notorious for attracting the condemnation of protesters.  Based on concerns of this nature, the City of Pittsburgh was very conservative in granting licenses to interest groups that wished to engage in various forms of public demonstration.  This conservatism led to a lawsuit initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) against the City.  The suit culminated in the granting of a license to advocacy group Code Pink to set up a tent city demonstration in Pittsburgh&#39;s Point State Park, but stopped short of granting a permit to another advocacy group, the Thomas Merton Center, or granting permission to camp in public parks during the summit.  The city&#39;s refusal of licenses has provoked a great deal of criticism with regard to the protection of protesters&#39; free speech.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Thursday: the unlicensed protest, by Aaron and Lynsie<br /></span><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/a6-751949.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 152px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/a6-751946.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>A group of anarchists organized the Arsenal Park march on Thursday, the first day of the summit.  Historically there has been contention between anti-capitalist groups and the state, thus it was not surprising when this march was not granted a permit by the city.  Despite their lack of a license, the anarchists organized themselves and reached out to other political interest groups in order to contribute to their cause. This mass action created a feeling of solidarity within the grassroots community, but the resulting hodgepodge of messages was confusing to onlookers. This confusion was perpetuated by video clips on the evening news as it is difficult for anyone to delineate their political motivations in a sound bite. <br /><br />After personally engaging in direct action with anarchist and other anti-capitalist organizations for several years, we have gained a better understanding of their philosophies.  We hope to humanize these people by sharing our experiences, despite our personal feelings about their tactics.  Anarchists and anti-capitalist groups today are mostly made up of young and educated middle- to upper-class individuals with a passion for becoming the voice for disenfranchised and disadvantaged people worldwide.  While they are angry with the current economic and political climate set by the political elites, they refuse to abandon their principles of non-violence.  This is why they oppose the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.  They feel that direct action and free speech are the only effective democratic processes because the state&#39;s role in capitalism is to protect the interest of the &quot;haves&quot; at the cost of the &quot;have nots.&quot;  Activists point to instances when our government was willing to deploy brutal police forces in order to restrain citizens&#39; rights to free speech, while it also turned a blind eye to white collar crimes.  This belief is echoed in the protester&#39;s chant, &quot;This is what a police state looks like!&quot;<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/an7-745825.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 133px; height: 200px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/an7-745823.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Those who watched the news coverage of the G-20 resistance march received a slanted view of the real events.  Our story from the front lines is very different than that portrayed in the news.  The actions of the protesters we witnessed were not filled with violence and destruction, but rather with solidarity, compassion, and commitment.  Prior to the protest, Arsenal Park became a community gathering place.  One masked anarchist wearing goggles ran around offering fellow protesters sandwiches and water.  Groups of friends painted each other faces, while others danced or played music.  Members peacefully linked arms and watched as a mother taught her young daughter how to use a discarded car bumper as a drum.  <br /><br />Upon their arrival at Arsenal Park, the riot-gear-clad police confronted the protesters by blockading one side of the park, but protesters circumvented police by shifting over a couple of blocks.  Soon, instructional chants such as, &quot;Slow it down, tighten it up&quot; were used. The police then shot pepper spray into the crowd, splitting up the group.  &quot;Masks up, goggles on,&quot; began to echo from the cloud of gas shortly thereafter.  We witnessed protesters running to the aid of anyone who had fallen and was choking or in need of an eye flush. Dumpsters were pulled into streets to obstruct sonic cannons.  While some rogue individuals engaged in the destruction of property, the majority of protesters condemned their actions and attempted to prevent further damage, as de
monstrated by one runaway dumpster headed towards a parked car.  Five individuals placed themselves between the dumpster and the car in order to protect it. We witnessed National Guard personnel in unmarked vehicles randomly grabbing individuals and hauling them away.  No <u>Miranda</u> rights! They simply disappeared.  Many protesters complained about being chased for hours and corralled into suburban areas. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/an5-790037.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 200px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/an5-790018.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>More locals&#39; daily routines were disrupted by the inconvenience of the G20 summit, blockades, overly zealous police, and military than by a few hundred protesters. In fact, near the Children&#39;s Hospital an ambulance needed to get by the protesters.  We were able to clear a path faster than most cars do for an ambulance.  The protesters&#39; message was directed at the G-20 summit and at particular businesses downtown, not at locals or small businesses. In an attempt to placate Lawrenceville and Bloomfield neighbors, protesters chanted, &quot;We love Pittsburgh, not the G-20.&quot;<br /><br />We have developed respect for these interest groups, who have a dedication to justice, peace, equality, and community.  No one can expect to understand or even begin to empathize with these protesters when most citizens have little knowledge of what the G-20 is or what it is capable of doing.  If the G-20 leaders were more forthcoming and people educated themselves about the summit, the anarchists&#39; actions might seem less reckless.             <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Friday, by Ingrid</span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/IMGP2355-778654.JPG"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/IMGP2355-778281.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>I was apprehensive about going to the licensed protest on Friday.  I&#39;d missed Thursday&#39;s activities and had only news reports and frantic text messages from friends to influence me.  Not wishing to explain an arrest to the state bar association&#39;s Character and Fitness evaluators two years down the line, I planned to get a few good pictures and then get out of there.  Lynsie then convinced me to join the anarchists who had dominated the middle section of the crowd that filled Fifth Avenue.  As we approached, she explained that the scarf wrapped around every anarchist&#39;s face could be utilized as a makeshift gas mask.  Similarly, goggles were strapped on in order to preserve eyesight in such instances.  I&#39;d always assumed both were basically popular for their capacity to make just about anyone look tough.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/an22-739399.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 200px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/an22-739382.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>During our march downtown, I was surprised by the sense of community amongst the anarchists.  A number of people handed out water and snacks.  Cheers such as, &quot;You&#39;re sexy, you&#39;re cute, take off that riot suit!&quot; and &quot;Get out of your uniforms and into the streets!&quot; conveyed the sense that these people were idealists rather than mere troublemakers.  They truly believe in the utopia that they fight for, and envision a world without bureaucracies where individuals flourish in the context of small communities and where social imbalances and injustice are things of the past.  They want to include everyone in this world, even the uniformed men waving night sticks at them from the sidelines.   <br /><br />While I don&#39;t share their views, I do respect the fact that they have a vision that they&#39;re willing to fight for.  Most of the people who were marching that afternoon did so without inflicting harm on anyone or anything.  In some respects, these people are doing a favor to everyone out there with ideals, or even more broadly - anyone unwilling to commit to a future spent blindly following the orders sent from whatever administration is in power.  Free speech comes at a price, and we each must accept that right as enjoyed by our ideological adversaries.  Regardless of our political stances, the anarchists who came from afar to disrupt the G-20 did so despite an ordinance aimed at silencing free speech in the name of security.  And while the ordinance as well as their actions are debatable, in the end they risked a great deal to advocate for a constitutionally-protected right, a fight that works to the benefit of all citizens.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ingrid Burke, Pitt Law &#39;11; and Rick Grubb, Pitt Law &#39;10; attended a University of Pittsburgh speech by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev speech during the G-20 summit...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/medvedev-1-783833.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 256px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/medvedev-1-783417.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Russian President Dmitry Medvedev came to the University of Pittsburgh during the G-20 summit to give some remarks of his own on the 50th anniversary of President Nikita Khrushchev&#39;s 1959 visit to the city. The format was very casual and Medvedev spoke briefly about the timing of his visit, acknolwedging the divide between Khrushchev&#39;s ideology and his own. Often, question-and-answer sessions with heads of state are heavily planned, with pre-screened questions and a moderator to avoid any unwanted surprises.  Instead, Medvedev began calling on members of the audience directly. Surprisingly, he displayed a willingness to answer any and every question asked.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">Russia and International Relations: Rick Grubb</font><br /><br />The first question dove directly into matters dealing with relations between Russia and Georgia.  Medvedev noted that the two nations share a long, close history with many similar traditions, but that he could not and would not work with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili.  He repeated his allegations that Georgian aggression was the cause of last year&#39;s hostilities, but stated that politicians could not spoil the personal relationships between the two populations.  I anticipated that Medvedev would receive some validation of his oft-repeated assertions of Georgian aggression from the EU&#39;s report on last summer&#39;s conflict.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/medvedev-3-762094.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/medvedev-3-761744.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Mirroring the query about Georgia, Medvedev answered two questions pertaining to Russia&#39;s relations with Ukraine and Belarus.  He was quick to note that Russia stands in a sisterly relationship with these states, responding to an assertion made by one of the questioners, who stated that Russia is the &quot;big sister&quot;.  Medvedev patterned his response after his statements on Georgia, speaking about the shared history and close relations of each nation&#39;s respective populations.  He did distinguish the two situations in one area, however. He attributed the difficulties with Belarus to emotional responses to their own national interests, whereas he believed that in Ukraine the conflict was due to President Yushchenko&#39;s failure to build a relationship.  Medvedev did mention that he planned on meeting with Belarussian President Aleksandr Lukashenko in the near future. In contrast to this policy of engagement, Medvedev mentioned no plans for Ukraine beyond what some have called his interventionist letter to President Yushchenko and a video of his opinions posted on his blog.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">Judicial Reform in Russia: Ingrid Burke</font><br /><br />I had the opportunity to personally ask President Medvedev about his plans for judicial reform and his thoughts on the current state of Russia&#39;s justice system. He was glad to discuss the issue, which has been very important to him due to his legal training and his work in the field. He started by explaining that the Russian Court is seriously outdated and in need of modernization in order to restore the faith of Russian and international critics regarding the respectability of the Court. As it stands, people are highly reluctant to turn to the courts in Russia in order to resolve their problems. They will turn to any number of other institutions for help, but the courts are so devoid of respect that many people refuse to believe that any judicial proceeding will end with favorable results. In order to address this problem, he has recently implemented a program to promote judicial independence. Currently, judges are too easily influenced by external sources, whether in the form of local or federal government actors or agencies, or by businesses and other wealthy individuals. Once external influences are removed from the equation, Medvedev feels confident that faith in the justice system will be restored. In order to curb external influences, he hopes to increase the salaries of judges, thereby decreasing any willingness to be bribed. Furthermore, the Duma has recently passed a series of anti-corruption laws, including one aimed specifically at the judiciary. While the problems plaguing the justice system are complex and numerous, and while judicial reform will be extraordinarily difficult, President Medvedev insists that reform is absolutely necessary and will occur.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">Iran Sanctions: Rick Grubb</font><br /><br />President Medvedev also fielded an audience member&#39;s inquiry regarding the interplay of the recent decision by the Obama administration on ABM bases in Eastern Europe and possible UN sanctions on Iran over its questionable nuclear program.  The questioner theorized that the shift in US policy was part of a deal that would see Russia shifting its own position to support sanctions on Iran at the Security Council level.  Medvedev immediately responded that the Obama administration&#39;s decision was entirely based on its own assessment of the strategic interests of the United States. Further, it was not part of a larger Russo-American policy alignment.  He then gave a somewhat opaque answer to the question of Russian support for sanctions on Iran, stating that he supported all countries&#39; &#8212; including Iran&#39;s &#8212; rights to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.  He premised his answer with a statement on the shared responsibility of all state actors in upholding international law, thereby promoting the safety of individuals around the world. At the same time, he emphasized the importance of developing nuclear energy in a peaceful manner, and in ensuring that all states are free to develop peaceful nuclear energy programs. He remains skeptical that Iran&#39;s nuclear program is peaceful in nature. Medvedev qualified his answer by saying that although he would not get into a discussion of the effectiveness of sanction regimes, sanctions have not been the most effective tools in the past, and he would rather create positive incentives for Iran.  Regarding nuclear weapons proliferation, however, Medvedev seemed to hint that sanctions could be utilized when other viable options have failed.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">Plans for Economic Crisis and the G-20 Summit: Ingrid Burke and Rick Grubb</font><br /><br />When asked for his plans on solving the global financial crisis, Medvedev explained that his studies in civil and commercial law had given him a complex understanding of economics. He refused, however, to disclose the plans that this complex understanding had led to due to their sensitive nature. Despite his apprehensions prior to the first G-20 summit in Washington DC last year, he had every faith that the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh would lead the way to global economic recovery. He felt that if the work of the G-20 were ultimately to culminate in building the foundations of a new structure that would reshape the global economy, the G-20 would have proven to be a success.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/medvedev-2-768743.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/medvedev-2-768464.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Medvedev said
he did not want to over-dramatize the economic situation and stated that there were signs of small improvements emerging.  He also spoke of legislation to create jobs as part of his domestic response to Russia&#39;s economic problem. He pushed the legislation through the Duma earlier this summer.  Medvedev did inject personality and humor into the event when he told the crowd he could not reveal his suggestions for the global economy, fearing another head of state might steal his good ideas. Despite this, he did briefly mention that there is no &quot;magic answer&quot; to the problems. He did assert that the architecture of the world economy, in place since the Brenton Woods Agreement, should be updated to reflect the realities of today.  President Medvedev pointed out that the growth and development of the world economy needs commensurate changes in the framework it is built upon. Yet, he did not specify what form these changes may assume.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">US-Russia Relations: Ingrid Burke</font><br /><br />Medvedev also reflected on the current state of relations between the US and Russia, noting that while there are still differences in opinion, disagreements create dialectics which in turn become progress. When asked later for his five-year plan regarding US relations, Medvedev&#39;s disdain for the Bush administration was made clear with the statement, &quot;One year ago...[US] relations hit the dead end. They almost slid to the level of the Cold War.&quot; He is, however, very comfortable with President Obama, feeling that they are peers. When Medvedev was a law student at the University of Saint Petersburg, he used to read the <u>Harvard Law Review</u>, which was edited by Obama, also a law student at the time. He stated that he appreciates the fact that dialogues with Obama are truly dialogues, and that conversations with him do not feel rehearsed and therefore futile. He said that Obama&#39;s legal training is apparent in every discussion, as reflected by his active listening and his interlocutory prowess. He further praised Obama for his proactive efforts to defend US interests with regard to anti-ballistic missile defense sites, despite the opposition he faced initially from Russia, Europe, and China.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">Medvedev&#39;s Re-Election Plans: Ingrid Burke</font><br /><br />When asked whether he would consider running for reelection in 2012, President Medvedev said that as long as the Russian population trusts him and as long as he maintains their support, he sees no reason not to run. When asked the same question with regard to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, he declined to answer but hinted that Putin tends to share his perspective on the matter of reelection. Another audience member then asked whether he and Putin might consider swapping roles in 2012, and Medvedev said that he does not like to make guesses about what the future will hold, but he is willing to take on any role so long as his doing so will benefit his people.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion: Rick Grubb</span><br /><br />Among the various questions touching on serious policy areas, President Medvedev also fielded a number of &quot;lighter&quot; questions ranging from Russian cultural visits to Pittsburgh, to advice for students, to love.  It was a pleasant surprise to hear questions such as these and their candid responses.  Combined with his willingness to utilize humor and his hands-on approach to the event, it was a pleasant contrast to the serious and scripted nature of the week&#39;s affairs, while still maintaining the worthwhile insights that a prominent head of state brings to such occasions.  Here&#39;s hoping that the University of Pittsburgh will not have to wait fifty more years until the future leaders of Russia return to speak.<br />

		<title>PALAU: Jury Trials Come to the South Pacific</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tom Carpenter, Pitt Law &#39;11, spent his summer as a Legal Extern at the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic of Palau...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Palm-Tree-722046.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Palm-Tree-721960.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><strong>T</strong>he most recent general election in the Republic of Palau, held on November 4, 2008, was a historic event for the small island nation.  In addition to electing a new President, Vice President, senators, and delegates, the people of Palau passed 22 constitutional amendments.  The amendments included a ban on gay marriage, the establishment of Palauan as the prevailing language of the Constitution of Palau, and the setting of eligibility requirements for public officials.<br /><br />One newly-passed amendment in particular will substantially alter the Palauan legal system, which is largely based on the legal system of the United States. Palau shared a close relationship with the US after American forces liberated the island from Japanese occupation during World War II, and voted for full independence from the United States in 1994. The Ninth Amendment to the Constitution of Palau allows the Olbiil Era Kelulau (OEK), the legislative branch of the Palauan government, to provide jury trials in criminal and civil cases.  In order for a jury trial to be appropriate in a criminal case, the alleged offense must have been committed after December 31, 2009, and must be punishable by imprisonment of 12 years or more.   The amendment provides no such limitations on jury trials in civil cases.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/DSC01753-774281.JPG"><img style="float:left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 267px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/DSC01753-774045.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a>The former judicial system consisted of a trial court and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Palau, which served as an appellate court.  Four judges preside over these courts and split the case load evenly at the trial level.  If an appeal is taken by the Supreme Court it is heard by the three judges who did not hear the case at the trial level.  In addition to the trial and Supreme courts, there is a separate trial court that only hears land disputes.  This land court has several of its own judges, and as with the general trial court, appeals from the land court are taken to the Supreme Court.  Currently, this system is still in place, and it will remain so until the OEK passes a bill to implement jury trials.<br /><br />The Palauan Senate, which along with the House of Delegates makes up the OEK, has wasted no time in preparing a bill for the provision of jury trials.  While the bill is still in the early stages of the legislative process, it passed its first reading in the Senate this past January.  In its current form the bill requires juries consisting of six jurors to reach unanimous verdicts in all cases in which the parties elect for trial by jury. A jury trial can only be waived if the defendant does so in writing, the prosecuting attorney for the Republic of Palau consents to the waiver, and the court approves the waiver. <br /><br />The bill also establishes guidelines for examining and selecting potential jurors.  According to the most recent version of the bill, objections to potential jurors by the parties in dispute are appropriate where the potential juror is related to key individuals involved in the trial, has served on another jury that has heard evidence concerning the offense charged, or &quot;has a state of mind&quot; that would preclude him or her from being a fair and impartial juror. Admittedly, this language is broad and confusing, and raised some troubling questions in my mind about the jury selection process.  How closely must a potential juror be related to a key individual before an objection is appropriate?  Who qualifies as a &quot;key individual?&quot;  What does the OEK mean when it states that an objection is appropriate when a potential juror has heard evidence concerning the offense charged?  What &quot;state of mind&quot; will preclude a juror from being fair and impartial?  Unfortunately the OEK has not answered these questions, and has left that complex task to the courts.  Another task left to the courts, specifically the Supreme Court, is the promulgation of rules and regulations for the implementation of the bill.<br /><br />After passing the bill on the first reading, the Senate solicited comments on the bill from the Supreme Court, the Attorney General&#39;s Office of the Republic of Palau, and the Palau Bar Association. So far, the Supreme Court is the only organization to have responded.  Since Palau has had no experience concerning jury trials, the Supreme Court looked to Guam and US jurisdictions for guidance. In its commentary, the Supreme Court recommended establishing qualifications for jurors, since the current bill includes no mention of juror qualifications, and only describes situations when an objection against a potential juror can be made.  Another recommendation was to include mandatory jury fees to be paid to individuals on jury duty, thus encouraging them to be jurors. However, the Court failed to specify how the fees should be funded.  Similarly, the Court also recommended that the Senate include statutory protection of the juror&#39;s employment while serving on jury duty.  The Court&#39;s recommendation recognizes that jury service can be an inconvenience, especially for employers, and statutory protection for employees serving as jurors would further encourage citizens to perform their civic duty.<br /><br />The Supreme Court&#39;s commentary on the bill deviated from the concepts followed in Guam and many US jurisdictions on the issue of requirements for the valid waiver of a jury trial by the parties in dispute.  The Court indicated a belief that as long as a judge has the discretion to reject a defendant&#39;s waiver of a jury trial in the interest of justice, there is no reason to require the prosecuting attorney to approve the waiver.  The Court also expressed its belief that a unanimous verdict should not be required from a sitting jury, and that there should be no minimum size requirement for a jury.  However, the Court stopped short of making recommendations to the Senate on these issues.<br /><br />While the transition to jury trials has so far presented no insurmountable obstacles, there are many significant issues facing the Palauan legal community.  One of the biggest hurdles to overcome is integrating jury instructions into the legal system.  The law concerning jury instructions must be developed from its infancy, and lawyers and judges must learn, or at least re-learn, how jury instructions fit into the litigation process.  Comprehensive, legally accurate, and easily-understood instructions must be drafted, and Palauan law must be developed to allow appeals alleging defects in the jury instruction process. <br /><br />Another significant hurdle for Palau to overcome is the strain that will be placed on the judicial system by the increased time and money required for jury trials.  With only a trial division and the Supreme Court, and only four judges to oversee both, the judicial system is stretched thin and can ill afford the lengthy trials that juries will surely bring.  While there is a separate land court with several judges, it is just as busy as the other courts.  In addition to the judicial system, the Attorney General&#39;s Office will also feel the strain of the impending jury trials.  The Office has only six attorneys and two investigators, and is already overworked.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/DSC01719-792652.JPG"><img style="float:right; marg
in: 4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 236px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/DSC01719-792305.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a>Additionally, the increased costs of jury trials will place a strain on the government as a whole.  This strain will be especially difficult to absorb given the current global financial crisis, which has greatly affected Palau.  Increased costs will likely come in the form of higher administrative and overhead expenses brought on the by the increased time commitment jury trials require.  The private sector, with the exception of attorneys, will also feel a financial strain.  Jury trials will increase the amount of hours an attorney works, thus increasing the fee charged to his or her client.<br /><br />In addition to the general problem of increased time and costs, Palau faces unique problems in its implementation of jury trials due to the country&#39;s size and demographics.  With a land area roughly twice the size of Washington, DC, and a population of approximately 21,000, of which around 3,000 are immigrants and about 5,000 are children, Palau has a very small pool of potential jurors.  Compounding this problem are the strong and extensive family ties that run through the nation, and the strong allegiances created by the traditional clan system.  These issues have caused great concern that fair and impartial juries will be almost impossible to convene, and that as a result, criminal convictions will be very rare.  A related concern is that jurors will be bribed. While this is a concern in any system utilizing juries, Palau is particularly susceptible to this concern because of its strong familial and clan allegiances.  These allegiances, coupled with Palau&#39;s small population and geographical size, provide easy access to jurors thus increasing the potential for bribery.<br /><br />Another problem is that because Palau is so geographically small, with courthouses only in the main city of Koror and the national capital in Melekeok State, it is impossible to remove a high-profile trial out of a potentially unfair venue as is done in the US.  This procedure is followed in the US because extensive media coverage of a trial, or events leading up to a trial, can create a bias in the local jury pool.  By moving the trial to a venue where the media coverage has been slim, or ideally none, this bias is eliminated.  In Palau the potential for a media created bias is even higher than in the US because Palau is so small, and there is no alternate venue to move to thereby eliminating the bias.<br /><br />A unique concern at the Attorney General&#39;s Office is that the Republic of Palau is statutorily barred from appealing court decisions from the trial level. Therefore, if the government were to lose a case because of what they believe was a defect in the jury selection or instruction process, they would be bound by the result and unable to appeal. The fact that the government cannot appeal from the trial level is already a problem, and adding jury trials would compound this problem because it would lead to more situations where a government appeal is warranted but prohibited.<br /><br />The Palauan legal system is substantially based on the United States system, but until now has lacked an element fundamental to this nation&#39;s notions of justice.  By implementing jury trials, Palau has embraced that missing element.  While the implementation process will be unique because of Palau&#39;s own characteristics and challenges, the experience can serve as a model for other nations both in the Pacific region and around the world seeking to implement jury trials in their legal systems. <br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt" size="2">Mentioned in the article:<br /><br />Palau Senate Bill 8-31, Eighth OEK, First Regular Session January 2009<br /><br />Official Comments to Senate Bill 8-31, provided by Arthur Ngiraklsong Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Palau<br /><br />Photo Credits: Tom Carpenter</font><br />

		<title>PITTSBURGH: Sulmasy on National Security Courts</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joseph Schaeffer, Pitt Law &#39;12, attended a talk on a proposed national security court system given by US Coast Guard Captain Glenn Sulmasy*, a law professor at the US Coast Guard Academy and a National Security and Human Rights Fellow at Harvard University...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><b>O</b>ver the past seven years the Guantanamo Bay detention facility has excited more controversy than perhaps any other aspect of the &quot;War on Terror&quot; except Operation Iraqi Freedom. Positions have hardened, battle lines have been drawn, and compromise seems remote. On the one side are those who support trying detainees in a system of military commissions. On the other side are those who propose trying the detainees in the American civilian court system.** Enter Captain Glenn Sulmasy with a third system of &quot;national security courts&quot; and a plan that he says reconciles the policy goals of both sides into a workable structure. Anxious to learn more about his proposed solution, I attended his talk, which he focused on principles and ideas set forth in his new book, <u>The National Security Court System: A Natural Evolution of Justice in an Age of Terror.</u><br /><br />Sulmasy began with the obligatory praise of the groups which had invited him, the Pitt Law Federalist Society and the Pitt Law Veterans Society, and moved on quickly to his four proposals for the &quot;War on Terror.&quot; It appeared that he was not only prepared to propose a solution for the Guantanamo detainees, but also for the problems with the War on Terror, in general. The audience would have to wait to learn more about national security courts.<br /><br />First, Sulmasy proposed changing the name of the &quot;War on Terror&quot; to the &quot;War on al Qaeda.&quot; By specifying an enemy, the United States would gain the possibility of eventually claiming victory rather than continuing to fight against indeterminate forces. Specificity would also prevent states like Iran from attempting to gain politically by framing themselves as victims of American aggression. Second, Sulmasy proposed that the United States call for an international conference treating the rights of detainees under existing agreements, such as the Geneva Conventions. Not only would the United States gain good will through such a proposal, but it would remove uncertainty about detainee rights which exists under current agreements. Sulmasy joked that, knowing the international community, the negotiations could take years or even decades, eliciting a laugh from the audience. Third, Sulmasy argued for the necessity of a military surge in Afghanistan similar to that employed in Iraq. Fourth, Sulmasy proposed a National Security Court System (NSCS) to try the detainees captured in the War on Terror.<br /><br />But all this was only a preview of what was to come. Sulmasy felt obligated to rebut the feasibility of the military commission and the civilian court system alternatives, perhaps to preempt criticisms that his third way is unnecessary. According to Sulmasy, the primary defect of the civilian court system consists of its strict evidentiary and procedural requirements. While this might initially seem counter-intuitive, it actually makes quite a bit of sense. Guantanamo detainees were not captured according to civilian evidentiary and procedural requirements. Trial courts could deal with this by either acquitting detainees en masse or relaxing evidentiary and procedural requirements, thereby raising constitutional issues and weakening the protections afforded all Americans. Neither of these options seems particularly attractive. Sulmasy also argued that civilian court judges lack the requisite experience to try national security cases and that it would be difficult to find impartial jurors. Turning to military commissions, Sulmasy defended their use while simultaneously acknowledging their impracticability. Arguing that military commissions are both constitutional and just, since most detainees have more rights than in their home countries, Sulmasy nonetheless acknowledged that the previous administration&#39;s public relations blunders meant that the military commission would need to be abandoned. One could argue that this was a gross understatement, but Sulmasy seemed anxious to move on. It was time to discuss his proposed National Security Court System.<br /><br />A National Security Court System would be established by Congress under its Article III powers, similar in nature to current specialty taxation, bankruptcy, and FISA courts. The NSCS would be firmly in the public sphere, overseen by the Department of Justice rather than the Department of Defense, and proceedings would be presumptively open. As explained by Sulmasy, this means that the press, international observers, etc., would have access to the proceedings, except where classification and national security issues mandated otherwise. Detainees would be represented by either Judge Advocate Generals or federal public defenders and would be guaranteed a habeas corpus hearing within three months of capture and full trial within one year of capture. Detainees would not receive the full benefit of American constitutional protections, but would rather be subject to lessened evidentiary and procedural requirements. Sulmasy acknowledged the controversiality of these lessened protections without prompt, but argued again that the majority of detainees still would have more rights than in their home countries. The trials would occur on military bases for security reasons and would be chaired by special military National Security Court judges. Finally, the NSCS would be established with a sunset provision, which Sulmasy proposed setting at five years, in order to force Congress to reevaluate its efficacy and Constitutionality at some future point.<br /><br />Sulmasy raised several interesting points during his talk, particularly the Catch-22 presented by trying alleged terrorists in civilian courts. Should the courts strictly apply procedural and evidentiary rules, thereby freeing possibly dangerous individuals, or should the courts relax these rules to secure convictions, thereby weakening these Constitutional protections for all Americans? While I left Sulmasy&#39;s talk with a new perspective on the difficulty faced by policymakers tasked with solving this issue, I was unconvinced by Sulmasy&#39;s solution. I remain unpersuaded that the National Security Court System is much more than military commissions in civilian disguise.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">* Capt. Sulmasy has <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Sulmasy">written</a> opinion pieces for JURIST Forum. <br /><br />** On Thursday, October 15th, the House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/houses-passes-bill-allowing-transfer-of.php">passed legislation</a> that would permit Guantanamo detainees to be subject to trial in federal courts on American soil.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Legislation is still required to strengthen new policy on use of state secrets privilege</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cato.org/people/julian-sanchez"><strong>Julian Sanchez</strong></a> [Research Fellow, <a href="http://www.cato.org/">Cato Institute</a>]: &quot;The administration&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-announces-state-secrets-reform.php">new policy</a> on invocation of the state secrets privilege does set a higher transparency standard, but that&#39;s largely because their predecessors had to enlist Otto Lidenbrock to get it to the low point it hit in the last administration. But to the extent the checks here remain internal to the executive branch and the Justice Department, it&#39;s not clear how much of a difference it will make, especially since their position appears to be that the new policy is no obstacle to the broad invocation of state secrets to bar, entirely, lawsuits already underway involving interrogation policies and warrantless wiretaps.  If the effect is just that attorneys will have to do a find-replace and insert &quot;substantial&quot; before &quot;harm&quot; in all their state secrets motions, nobody should be terribly impressed.<br /><br />What could make a difference is the requirement that an agency seeking to invoke the privilege prepare a detailed declaration specifying the harm that is feared as a result of disclosure, and an explanation of the rationale linking the harm to the particular information withheld.  Though the attorney general&#39;s memorandum doesn&#39;t explicitly say so, my understanding is that this is meant to be submitted to any judge before whom the privilege is invoked.  This might do something to deter specious invocations, and perhaps prompt judges to raise questions when the link between the harm and the sensitive information is conspicuously strained.<br /><br />Even assuming a greater commitment to limiting use of the privilege - something for which the evidence is as yet scanty in actual litigation - guidelines implemented by one attorney general can just as easily be reversed by the next one. (Or, for that matter, by the same one if they prove inconvenient.)  So I see no reason to back off the effort to codify some restrictions in legislation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Khalid Sekander</span> [Senior Social Scientist, <a href="http://www.army.mil/">US Army</a>, Human Terrain Systems, NATO/ISAF HQ]: &quot;Mr. Barakzai <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/afghanistan-national-resigns-from-un.php">resigned</a> from the <a href="http://www.ecc.org.af/en/">Electoral Complaint Commission</a> (ECC) because he views foreign interference as a negative consequence to the Afghan democratic experiment. Meanwhile, Peter Galbraith, former deputy of the <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/default.aspx?/">United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA), recently stated that UNAMA head Kal Eide is favorable to the Karzai government by covering-up allegations of voter fraud, primarily ghost voting sites and ballot stuffing. The final decision on the August 2009 presidential elections remains with the<a href="http://www.iec.org.af/"> Independent Elections Commission</a> (IEC), but the ECC is the body that will make the decision as to whether voter fraud existed.<br /> <br />The ECC is comprised of non-Afghans, and under the Elections Law it is these non-Afghans who will make the decision as to whether voter fraud existed in the August 2009 presidential elections. In case the ECC substantiates voter fraud, then those votes will not be counted. This means that Karzai&#39;s 54% lead will dwindle below 50%, thereby, forcing a presidential run-off.<br /> <br />The ECC is the international community&#39;s (IC) tool to bring pressure on the Karzai government to control systemic corruption rampant throughout the government.  Most Afghans and some in the IC see the Afghan government as nothing more than a criminal syndicate. If the ECC decides that a run-off is necessary, then the integrity of the democratic experiment in Afghanistan may be at risk since most Afghans seem to indicate their unwillingness to vote in a presidential run-off for obvious reasons (lack of confidence in the government and Taliban intimidation).<br /> <br />The conundrum for the international community is that if the ECC uses voter fraud as a reason to pressure Karzai&#39;s government to eliminate corruption, then a run-off is very likely. However, the international community, ECC, et al., will also risk the failure of the democratic experiment in Afghanistan if it uses voter fraud as the underlying issue to pressure the government on anti-corruption measures since most Afghans will likely not go out to vote in the run-off for obvious security and political reasons.&quot;<br />

		<title>Reluctance to prosecute Chirac reflects French fear of weakened presidency</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/french/staff/gr.html"><strong>Gino Raymond</strong></a> [Professor of Modern French Studies, <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/">University of Bristol, U.K</a>.]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/france-prosecutors-ask-judge-to-drop.php">recommendation</a> that charges against Jacques Chirac be dropped should come as no surprise. In theory, the judge responsible for the final decision, Xavi&egrave;re Simeoni, is not obliged to abide by the finding of the prosecuting authorities, but to do otherwise would be an extraordinary surprise.<br /><br />In purely pragmatic terms, prosecuting Chirac would lift the lid on a system in which, until very recently, transparency with regard to political funding was an alien concept. It is tacitly acknowledged that all the major parties in France traded favours for funding, whether it was in the form of municipal contracts, local government sinecures, or access to grace and favour apartments at peppercorn rents (or even no rent at all). Very few French politicians who have been in power, or who aspire to power, would want the damage that could be done to the credibility of the system if Chirac were put on trial.<br /><br />Now that he is out of power, &quot;le bulldozer,&quot; as Jacques Chirac was nicknamed because of his unrelenting ambition, is widely regarded as a benign and grandfatherly figure in France. But there are deep cultural reasons that explain the indulgence of the French towards their presidents, especially during the life of the Fifth Republic. When Charles de Gaulle returned to power in 1958, it was very much in the style of a providential leader who, like French providential leaders in the past, had to rescue the nation from a disaster that the other institutions of the state were incapable of managing. In de Gaulle&#39;s case in 1958, the crisis was the Algerian war of independence. The fact that de Gaulle had also been the providential leader of the Resistance during World War II strengthened his hand further when he shaped a new constitution that would give the president more power and prestige that any other leader among the world&#39;s major democracies.<br /><br />French presidents continue to be pressed from the Gaullist mould and enjoy the kind of prerogatives that are unique to France. Whether it is lasting rumours about President Val&eacute;ry Giscard D&#39;Estaing&#39;s acceptance of an illicit gift of diamonds from the African tyrant, Jean-Bedel Bokassa, in the 1970s, or the fact that President Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand effectively raised a second family in the Elys&eacute;e palace in the 1980s, at the expense of the state, while pursuing his public duties with his official family (also with taxpayers&#39; money), these things never prompted the kind of backlash that would have occurred in other mature democracies. It may be that in the French national psyche, there is a subliminal anxiety about the durability of the Republic&#39;s institutions in times of crisis that makes the citizens fearful of bringing down the figure who is the guardian of the nation&#39;s eternal interests.<br /><br />The decision regarding Chirac comes at a time when President Nicolas Sarkozy, the ultimate guarantor of the integrity of the Republic&#39;s institutions, is commenting freely to the press on the court case currently underway called &quot;l&#39;Affaire Clearstream,&quot; in which the former Prime Minister, Dominique de Villepin, is accused of plotting to smear Sarkozy before he became President. The fact that Sarkozy sees no hindrance to his public pronouncements on the case evokes the misgivings that some French political scientists expressed when the role of the president was defined in the constitution of the Fifth Republic, calling it a blueprint for a &quot;monarque r&eacute;publicain,&quot; -  a republican monarch.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.nimj.org/myGrid.aspx?base=Staff"><strong>Michelle McCluer</strong></a> [Director, <a href="http://www.nimj.org/home.aspx">National Institute of Military Justice</a>]: &quot;Congress appears ready to <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/house-passes-amendments-to-military.php">enact changes</a> to the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ366.109.pdf">2006 Military Commissions Act</a> [PDF file].  After the opening days of the Obama Administration, it feels strange to be writing about the future of military commissions, but it seems that military commissions will continue plodding along.  While I would have preferred to have seen military commissions relegated to historical treatises, the current revisions proposed by Congress move the commissions in the right direction, albeit not as much as anticipated.  Assuming the proposed legislation becomes law, here is a run-down of the changes and their impact on detainee prosecutions.<br /><br />The expected-to-be-passed bill begins by tweaking the definition of those individuals eligible for trial before military commissions, notably deleting the Taliban and scrapping the phrase &quot;unlawful enemy combatants.&quot;  Whether the new definition of &quot;unprivileged enemy combatants&quot; will have much effect in practice remains to be seen.  Many hoped that &quot;voluntary&quot; statements would become the standard for the admissibility of detainees&#39; declarations.  Unfortunately, the bill allows wiggle room for less-than-voluntary statements, which could result in the admission of statements obtained by coercive means.  The good news is that the revised MCA is likely to have much more palatable rules against the admissibility of statements made as the result of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment than appeared in the original.<br /><br />Perhaps the least controversial amendment to the MCA involves defense resources.  Defense resources, or, more accurately, the lack thereof, was a key issue on which all involved in the commissions agreed, to some extent.  The proposed legislation underscores that the defense should have access to resources &quot;comparable&quot; to those available in Article III courts and spells out increased discovery responsibilities for exculpatory evidence.  Detainees in capital cases would not necessarily get &quot;death-qualified&quot; counsel, but there would be a push to ensure they had &quot;learned&quot; counsel.  That&#39;s not exactly a confidence-inspiring qualification, considering the stakes.<br /><br />One of the most fiercely opposed provisions to remain, despite the Administration&#39;s and many non-governmental organizations&#39; objections, is the continued inclusion of &quot;providing material support for terrorism&quot; as a crime triable by the military commissions.  I hope prosecutors will exercise their discretion and find it unwise to charge this offense in a war crimes tribunal.<br /><br />Inexplicably, Congress rejected a proposed amendment which would send military commission appeals to the Article I Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces - the nation&#39;s highest military court - which, not surprisingly, specializes in cases arising out of the military justice system.  Instead, lawmakers chose to keep the recently created, and largely untested, Court of Military Commission Review as the first level of appeals for the detainee cases, with the Article III US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit providing the second appellate tier, and then the US Supreme Court as the final arbiter.  Ironically, detainees will get more appellate rights than do those service members fighting around the globe.<br /><br />Soon we&#39;ll know whether this latest attempt at getting the commission process right succeeds.  I&#39;m not overly optimistic.&quot;<br />

		<title>China&#039;s rigged trials against Uyghurs merits more attention from world community</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Mehmet Tohti</strong> [Former Vice President, <a href="http://www.uyghurcongress.org/En/home.asp">World Uyghur Congres</a>s]: &quot;A recent report <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/china-xinjiang-riot-trials-fail-to-meet.php">released</a> by Human Rights Watch over the inadequacy and unfairness of the trials of Urumqi protestors has brought our memory back to the July 5 massacre committed by the Chinese military and government backed Han Chinese mobsters.  Mass arrests and manhunts started as early as the evening of July 5 after the suppression order issued by Wang Lequan, Communist party chief in the Uyghur Autonomous region, employed the rarely used word of &quot;zhenya&quot; which translated roughly to &quot;kill to clean&quot; or &quot;complete suppression&quot; in comparison to &quot;ping xi&quot; (to silence)that was used for the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and the Tibetan uprising of March 2008.  When the Chinese military receives an order with &quot;zhenya&quot; usually there will be no limits to their actions. That&#39;s what &quot;zhenya&quot; means and that is why it has rarely been used.  This is a key word that could reflect the scale of suppression directed against Uyghurs that resulted in an unknown number of killings, arrests and disappearances that still question our minds.<br /><br />The Chinese government&#39;s complete blockage of communications in East Turkistan since July 5 has caused grave concerns and raised serious questions for many experts as to whether China is hiding something from the outside world.  This blockage has been harshly enforced by the government and includes the shutdown of landline telephone services, wireless telephone, and Internet and text messaging.  The initial government excuse of &quot;shutting down communication to prevent further spread of riots across the region&quot; is no longer a valid one. And what could be the excuse for government keeping the entire Uyghur region in a state of complete communication blackout until today?  Is it something to do with hiding the truth from outside and fearing exposure by the victims&#39; families?<br /><br />In addition to the communication shutdown, authorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/separatisttalk-10022009101223.html">passed a law</a> during the first week of October that bans people from saying anything that &quot;damages national Unity, incites separatism, or harms social stability.&quot;  This vaguely worded bill has been implemented throughout East Turkistan to silence the outspoken parents, widows and family members of Uyghurs who have gone missing since July 5, 2009.  In Kashgar, Hoten and other areas, local authorities even banned talk of the July 5 events themselves and have arrested violators.<br /><br />Today Uyghur family members are constantly threatened, harassed and even prosecuted for inquiring about the location of loved ones, as we seen in the recent example of two Uyghurs who were <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/leak-09232009134238.html">arrested</a> on charges of &quot;State Secrete leakage&quot; for reporting the death of one Uyghur man under police custody after his detention under an alleged July 5 connection.  His father <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/burial-09212009131445.html">revealed</a> that his son was killed by police torture and armed military personnel surrounded his house and actually forced the burial of his son without any traditional ceremony for fear of possible public exposure of this news.<br /><br />Brad Adams, Asia Director at <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>, is absolutely right when he <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6006ea46-bea1-11de-b4ab-00144feab49a.html">said</a> that &quot;the cases documented are likely just the tip of the iceberg.&quot;  In my previous Hotline <a href="/hotline/2009/07/chinas-oppression-of-uyghurs-remains.php">comment</a>, I mentioned the more than 1000 deaths and subsequent arrest of as many as 10,000 Uyghurs on the basis of eyewitness testimonies.  Recently one of my friends in mainland China told me that the small city of Artush alone received more than 179 dead bodies of Uyghurs from Urumqi in mid-July.  Further, Canadian student Sakine Zulang has <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/citizenbytes/2009/10/my_own_personal_holocaust_a_yo.html">described</a> her horrible experiences in the streets of Urumqi.<br /><br />The Chinese government and official media also have given conflicting accounts of the total number of arrests made after the Urumqi massacre without mentioning the total Uyghur death toll. An official Xinhua News<a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/07/content_11664739.htm"> report </a>on July 7, 2009, put the number of arrests as many as 1434 while the other day same Xinhua News Agency was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hmOFVZLGA44SS4AohdAQ-Mh05JFw">quoted</a> by Communist Party officials giving a much smaller number of more than 700 arrests.  Meanwhile, at the outset the government denied the military employed violence against Uyghur protestors, but later on the puppet governor of the Uyghur Autonomous region <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLI462648">disclosed</a> twelve deaths by gunfire.<br /><br />Ekrem (his full name remains undisclosed out of fear of retaliation), recently arrived in Toronto from Urumqi and told me that starting at 10pm on July 5, electricity in the Uyghur area of Urumqi city was suddenly switched off and nonstop gunfire continued until dawn. In the early morning firefighter trucks washed out all the neighborhood streets.  The Uyghur area of Urumqi city used to be very active with thousands of Uyghur vendors, sellers, shoe shiners and small business owners from morning to evening.  It is now deserted and in a state of absolute silence.  Another area called Horse Race Square, (Sai ma chang in Chinese), the place where Uyghur women took to the streets on July 7 to demand the release of their arrested husbands, has now also became empty as the government forced all women to return their hometowns.<br /><br />Then on July 7, the Chinese secret service organized nearly 10,000 ethnic Han mobsters armed with axes, iron bars and other tools to &quot;show their teeth&quot; to Uyghurs in Urumqi. Exact numbers of the death toll has never been reported.<br /><br />It seems to me that the Chinese government wants to be certain it has cut off and silenced all voices from the victim families before they attempt to reopen communications in East Turkistan.  Thus the international community has a responsibility to put pressure on the Chinese government to open the communication service for Uyghurs and launch serious inquiries about the tragic outcome of the July 5 massacre because it is no less significant than the Gaza incursion or other such human rights tragedies.&quot;<br />

		<title>Guantanamo detainee al Mutairi&#039;s release a welcome blow to government detention power</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/rona_g.aspx"><strong>Gabor Rona</strong></a> [International Legal Director, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.aspx">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;On October 9, the Department of Justice announced the <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/guantanamo-detainee-repatriated-to.php">transfer</a> of Guantanamo detainee Khalid Abdullah Mishal al Mutairi, to his home state, Kuwait. &quot;On July 29, 2009, a federal court ruled that al Mutairi may no longer be detained under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) and ordered the government to release him from detention at Guantanamo Bay,&quot; said the Department of Justice press release.<br /><br />&quot;May no longer be detained&quot; is disingenuous spin, consistent with the Bush administration&#39;s Defense Department&#39;s traditional and casual insistence that those found to have been wrongly detained are &quot;no longer enemy combatants.&quot; What Judge Kollar-Kotelly found was that &quot;there is nothing in the record beyond speculation that Al Mutairi did, in fact, train or otherwise become a part of (al Wafa or al Qaida).&quot; But perhaps the most ominous (for the government, that is) part of the ruling was her rejection of the government&#39;s expansive theory of detention powers. She wrote:<br /><blockquote>The Court agrees that the President has the authority to detain individuals who are &quot;part of&quot; the Taliban, Al Qaeda or associated enemy forces, but rejects the Government&#39;s definition insofar as it asserts the authority to detain individuals who only &quot;substantially supported&quot; enemy forces or who have &quot;directly supported hostilities&quot; in aid of enemy forces. While evidence of such support is undoubtedly probative of whether an individual is part of an enemy force, it may not by itself provide the grounds for detention.</blockquote><br />The Supreme Court in <u>Boumediene</u> did not assign a detention standard to the habeas cases brought by Guantanamo detainees. District Judges have had to pave their own way. But if anything like Judge Kollar-Kotelly&#39;s vision sticks, the government can expect to continue to lose many more habeas claims than it wins.<br /><br />Al Mutairi is not the intractable case. He was returned to his country of origin. But his case does suggest several insights into what the United States must do to dispose of the remaining 200 or so Guantanamo detainees, many of whom cannot be repatriated due to non-refoulement obligations, and to solve the problem of bringing the suspected criminals among them to justice.<br /><br />I use the term dispose, with all its distasteful implications, purposefully. Innocent Guantanamo detainees are the bastard offspring of America&#39;s &quot;war on terror.&quot; They pay a price not for what they did, but for our desire to bury the injustices to which we have relentlessly subjected them. Guilty detainees evoke less sympathy, but the rights to fair trial and freedom from arbitrary detention do not discriminate between innocent and guilty, except in the Bizarro world of those who first label a man a terrorist and therefore determine that he&#39;s not entitled to the same judicial guarantees as we accord suspected child rapists and serial killers, in order to determine if he is, indeed, a terrorist.<br /><br />As to both innocent detainees deserving of resettlement and those rightly suspected of crimes for which they should be tried, the administration&#39;s noble and rational task of emptying Guantanamo could benefit from more responsible reporting by mainstream media and more displays of courage by our elected officials.   <br /><br />The Toronto Star reported on October 11 that an unnamed US official found it &quot;puzzling&quot; for Canada to publically reject the notion of accepting any Guantanamo detainees. Although Canada&#39;s reticence to consider accepting even its own national, Omar Kahdr, is irresponsible as well as puzzling, what is even more striking is the expectation of American officials that other countries should take detainees cleared for release while the US refuses to accept any. Of course, other countries&#39; leaders may not be facing the amount of political baggage heaped upon the Obama administration by the domestic fear-mongering lobby. Even as to &quot;cleared&quot; detainees, such as al Mutairi, the notion of &quot;worst of the worst&quot; dies hard when opponents of the administration&#39;s plans to close Guantanamo still refer to all the detainees as &quot;terrorists&quot; (or worse yet, &quot;the terrorists&quot;). But there is overwhelming evidence that many of the detainees are not terrorists; that instead, they are the victims of arbitrary detention. This notion began to take root after Prof. Mark Denbeaux of Seton Hall Law School released his first study of the detainee population in February 2006, which suggested that the majority of detentions were supported neither by evidence of membership in al Qaida or the Taliban, nor by evidence of hostile acts against US or coalition forces. More recently, the government&#39;s pitiful won/lost record to date in habeas cases (8/30) mirrors Denbeaux&#39;s findings. All this suggests there must be some explanation for US reluctance to accept detainees other than that they are the &quot;worst of the worst.&quot; One possibility, as mentioned, is that we do not want the living proof of our misconduct in our midst.<br /><br />Another possibility is that the press is not meeting its obligation to inject truth into a debate being hijacked by fear mongers. While the mainstream media dutifully report the resistance to bringing any detainees to US soil &#8212; even suspected criminals for trial, let alone exonerated ones for resettlement &#8212; the fact that so many have been wrongly deprived of liberty from the get go remains comparatively unreported. More specifically, the rightful scorn with which habeas judges have reacted to the paltry evidence offered by the government in so many cases is little noted, except in the blogosphere. And while retired military leaders, whose efforts have been organized by Human Rights First, have received some ink for their advocacy in support of Guantanamo&#39;s closure, it has mostly been in the context of transferring those suspected of crimes to continued detention for trial in the United States, proper.<br /> <br />Yet another factor is the cold calculation no doubt made by many in elected office that rectitude is politically too risky. The President&#39;s Detention Task Force, in its Preliminary Report of July 20, 2009 expressed its preference for a presumption in favor of federal court trials, rather than military commissions. But on the tender question of the moral obligation to resettle innocent detainees in the United States, the administration has been less vocal, particularly after the craven backlash that began and continues in Congress about the dangers of bringing &quot;the terrorists&quot; into &quot;your backyard.&quot;<br /> <br />How disappointing that the administration did not conduct a stronger full court press for resettlement of the Uighurs in Washington, D.C., where a Uighur community exists and had extended a willing hand.  Had President Obama and others spoken more forcefully of our moral obligation to solve the problem we created, many things might now be different. Perhaps other countries would have more willingly stepped up to the plate for other detainees. The &quot;keep Gitmo alive&quot; lobby could have better been confronted by the human face of its erroneous and unjust assumptions. The notion that Guantanamo detainees are all, somehow, less deserving of a fair shake than our home-grown &quot;worst of the worst&quot; would be unmarketable. And thus, resistance to bringing the accused 9/11 co-conspirators to US soil for trial in federal courts would diminish, thereby lessening the felt need to continue operating our kangaroo-court system of military commissions. And we might not now have so many misguided souls in Congress oblivious to both the systemic failure of military commissions (3 convictions, only one of which was in a contested trial) and the nearly 200 individuals tried for terrorism offenses in our federal courts during the last decade,  and expressing their resolve that military commissions are more appropriate than federal courts. Also, there would be one less category of individual to put in the &quot;can&#39;t try &#39;em, but can&#39;t release &#39;em&quot; basket.<br /> <br />Most of all, we might now have been looking at a date more certain for the end of Guantanamo as a lightning rod for anti-Americanism and for the beginning of America&#39;s trek back to its previous position of authority as an advocate for human rights worldwide.<br /> <br />Maybe it&#39;s too late to mount a successful campaign to resettle in the United States those innocent detainees who cannot be repatriated. But it&#39;s not too late for the administration to stop defending indefensible positions on detention authority and for the mainstream media come clean as it has not done to date with the American people, and thereby the world, about the human cost of the unlawful, unjust and counterproductive adventure that was, and is, Guantanamo.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/bios/joe-stork"><strong>Joe Stork</strong></a> [Deputy Director, Middle East and North Africa Division, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;President Obama and his team have another opportunity to do the right thing regarding the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/UNFFMGC_Report.pdf">report</a> [PDF file] of the UN Fact-Finding Commission on the Gaza Conflict when the UN Security Council meets on October 14 for an open debate on the Middle East. The Commission&#39;s report and recommendations will be a major item on the agenda.<br /><br />The Commission, headed by Judge Richard Goldstone, concluded that both Israel and Hamas were responsible for serious violations of the laws of war, in some cases amounting to war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity. The report urged both parties to conduct impartial and thorough investigations into allegations of wrongdoing over the coming six months, and to initiate prosecutions or disciplinary measures as appropriate. Noting that neither side has to date displayed the political will  or the ability  to carry out such investigations, the Commission asked the Security Council to monitor their compliance and, if they failed to take these steps, refer the report to the International Criminal Court in the Hague.<br /><br />Obama&#39;s team dismissed the report as &quot;unbalanced&quot; and &quot;unacceptable,&quot; and, in a breathtakingly cynical step, said it would ensure that the report would never leave the realm of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva &#8212; the very body that Washington, with justification, has criticized as biased on matters relating to Israel. When it looked like the 12th HRC session would pass a Palestinian-sponsored resolution endorsing the report &quot;in its entirety&quot; - i.e., including the condemnation of the actions of Palestinian armed groups and requesting UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to bring the report to the Security Council - Washington did some high-level arm-twisting with the Palestinian Authority (PA) leadership in Ramallah, and the PA instructed its Geneva delegation to <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/palestine-authority-criticized-for.php">withdraw the resolution</a>. When this caused a political firestorm in the West Bank and in Palestinian communities elsewhere, the PA then did another volte-face and, through Libya, currently a member of the Security Council, proposed that the Security Council discuss the report.<br /><br />The Obama administration&#39;s posture to date has been disastrous for several reasons. First, it promotes the notion that justice and accountability measures impede progress in the &quot;peace process.&quot; This is contrary to experience elsewhere, and contrary to the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/10/01/why-no-justice-gaza-israel-different-and-so">US approach</a> in other conflict and post-conflict situations. Second, it appears to endorse the dreadful position of the current Israeli government, that when &quot;democracies&quot; combat &quot;terrorism&quot; international humanitarian law and human rights law are irrelevant and international scrutiny unacceptable. Here, too, US denigration of the Goldstone report contradicts the administration&#39;s message to the rest of the world with its renunciation of torture and efforts to close Guantanamo.<br /> <br />When the Security Council meets this week, the United States, and those European allies who did nothing to counter the US approach at the HRC, should (1) express their concern about laws-of-war violations and impunity by all parties to the conflict, as documented by the Goldstone report; (2) go firmly on record that justice and accountability are essential to end the cycle of abuse and reprisal that, as much as anything else, fuels the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; (3) emphatically state that whatever the justification for the use of lethal force, whether to combat terrorism or to resist military occupation, warring parties must respect the core principles of international humanitarian law that prohibit attacks that target or cause indiscriminate or disproportionate harm to civilians or civilian objects; and (4) create an independent committee of experts to monitor how Israel and the Hamas authorities conduct investigations over the next six months into alleged wrongdoing by their respective forces.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mepc.org/resources/bahry.asp"><strong>Louay Bahry</strong></a> [Professor of Political Science, <a href="http://www.utk.edu/">University of Tennessee</a>]: &quot;The new Supreme Constitutional Court in Qatar, established by Law No. 12 of 2008 was supposed to start functioning on October 1, 2008, but was postponed for &quot;administrative&quot; reasons. On September 27, 2009 it finally <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/qatar-establishes-constitutional-court.php">came into being</a> when its head, Mr. Mubarak al-Asiri, Head of the Judiciary Supreme Council, was nominated by Amiri decree. Six other members have yet to be nominated. All must be at least 40 years old and have 15 years legal experience.<br /> <br />The main purpose of the court is to make sure that existing laws in Qatar comply with the provisions of the constitution issued in 2005.  It will also function as a court of last appeal in Qatar. Either the defense or prosecution in lower court cases can appeal to the Supreme Court if they feel that the decision of such a  court is not in keeping with the law or has misinterpreted the law. Qatar sees the court as a big step forward in the modernization of its institutions. <br /><br />It is worth noting how &quot;law&quot; is currently made in Qatar. While the constitution provides for a 45 member elected assembly (two thirds elected; one third appointed) to participate in making law, no such election has been held or announced, four years after the constitution was promulgated. For the time being, the country has a &quot;consultative body&quot; of 35 members, all appointed by the Amir. It will be interesting to see how the new court will handle any challenges to the existing laws.  <br /><br />Article 6 of the <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/qa00000_.html">Qatari constitution</a> also specifies that &quot;the state shall respect and strive to implement all international agreements, charters and conventions it is party thereof.&quot;  This may open the possibility of some challenges to Qatari law and practice to accord with international standards, particularly if a local plaintiff challenges a lower court ruling.  For example, Qatar is a member of the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm">International Labor Organization</a> and has, presumably, agreed to its rules. Human rights organizations and the ILO have criticized the  sponsorship (kafala) system under which most foreign laborers (now 800,000) work in Qatar (and the rest of the GCC countries). Under this system every foreigner who works in the country is sponsored by a national who has control over visas for his entry, the duration of his work, conditions, salary, dismissal and even expulsion. The system has been compared to slavery. The ILO has asked the six GCC countries to abolish or modify this system. While Bahrain just announced in April that it would end the system, and other GCC countries are considering modification, Qatar is still holding onto it. Could a worker in Qatar use this new court to challenge his or her status (belonging  to a sponsor or kafeel) by claiming that parts of Qatar&#39;s labor laws do not accord with ILO standards or rules?  If so, the potential for future modernization of Qatar institutions could become real.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.samefacts.com"><strong>Mark Kleiman</strong></a> [Professor of Public Policy, <a href="http://www.spa.ucla.edu/main.cfm">UCLA</a>]: &quot;The Justice Department <a href="http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/192">will not pursue</a> people using or selling cannabis in compliance with state &quot;medical marijuana&quot; laws, even though those activities remain forbidden by the Controlled Substances Act.  That <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/doj-directs-prosecutors-to-end-raids-on.php">policy</a> ends more than a decade of federal efforts to overturn state efforts to make cannabis available to patients.  In effect, the Attorney General has decided that although the Federal government has the power (affirmed by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1454.ZO.html">Gonzales v. Raich</a>) to enforce the CSA in such cases, prudence and comity argue that it should not use that power.<br /><br />In states such as New Mexico and Rhode Island, which are attempting to establish well-controlled processes to get cannabis to patients, the announcement removes the specter of Federal intervention, and may even allow providers there to establish overt growing operations rather than buying supplies from what remains a completely illegal growing industry. <br /><br />In California, where the legal status of the more than 1,000 &quot;dispensaries&quot; remains in dispute, it may be hard to figure out which activities are actually in full compliance with state law and therefore exempt from Federal enforcement actions under the new policy. <br /><br />Neither &quot;medical marijuana&quot; advocates nor Federal officials seem to have any interest in handling this problem correctly, by doing the clinical research required to establish the safety and efficacy of some standardized cannabis product for some specified medical condition, thus making it a prescription drug and a Schedule II controlled substance, available by prescription and sold through pharmacies.  The <a href="http://www.nida.nih.gov/">National Institute on Drug Abuse</a> continues to use its legal monopoly on research cannabis to obstruct the necessary studies, and the advocates so far have not been willing to spend any fraction of the millions of dollars spent on litigation and the promotion of ballot initiatives to performing research abroad, where research cannabis is easily available.  <br /><br />Ironically, cannabis as a prescription drug would be much less available in California than it is today.  If medical need could be met though ordinary pharmacies, there would be no justification for the proliferation of retail cannabis outlets.  Actual prescriptions for the drug would be much harder to obtain than the transparently pretextual &quot;recommendations&quot; now being issued by the bushel to any &quot;patient&quot; with $75 and willing to say he is &quot;anxious&quot; and therefore needs cannabis for the treatment of anxiety.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Mark Kleiman is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/When-Brute-Force-Fails-Punishment/dp/0691142084">When Brute Force Fails: How to Have Less Crime and Less Punishment</a></span>.<br />

		<title>Israel should use delay in UN vote on Goldstone report to investigate own conduct</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.btselem.org/english/About_BTselem/Staff_Members.asp"><strong>Jessica Montell</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.btselem.org">B&#39;Tselem</a>]: &quot;In the recent session of the UN Human Rights Council, the US and Israel - each for their own, somewhat disingenuous reasons - argued that a peace process is incompatible with international scrutiny of war crimes in the Cast Lead operation, and that the former is to be preferred over the later.  Heavy US pressure reportedly convinced the <a href="/paperchase/2009_10_05_indexarch.php">Palestinian Authority to withdraw its motion</a> for the Council to endorse the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/UNFFMGC_Report.pdf">Goldstone report</a> [PDF file]. The issue is now postponed until the next Council session in March.  <br /> <br />So Israel now has a six-month hiatus until the issue is again up for discussion at the Council.  This hiatus may prove helpful in encouraging Israel to ensure some domestic accountability for its conduct in Operation Cast Lead.<br /> <br />The Goldstone report has re-ignited the dormant Israeli conversation regarding accountability for Cast Lead.  Admittedly, the conversation is heavily skewed toward denial rather than soul-searching. Most of the speeches, newspaper columns and blogs focus on the problems with the fact-finding mission and the report, the biases of the UN Human Rights Council, and the strategies to deflect international criticism.  At the same time, the fact that the issue is back in the public debate is welcome, and here and there amidst the denial, one can also find voices calling for Israel to conduct its own independent investigation into Cast Lead.<br /> <br />This is what the human rights community has been calling for all along.  This is also the bottom line of the Goldstone report: justice must be done at home.  Only if domestic accountability mechanisms are impossible does the international community step in to fill the vacuum.  To date, Israel has opened a limited number of military police investigations into soldiers&#39; conduct in Cast Lead.  These include documentation by B&#39;Tselem and others that soldiers used Palestinian civilians as human shields, and also Palestinian civilians killed while waving white flags.  However, there have been no criminal investigations opened into the larger questions regarding the overall aims and policies concerning the fighting: were civilian buildings and infrastructure defined as legitimate military targets and if so, by whom?  Were soldiers properly instructed regarding the obligation to safeguard civilians? Why were civil police forces targeted on the first day of the operation?<br /> <br />These and other pressing questions cannot be answered by isolated military police investigations; they require investigation into decisions made by the highest military and civilian echelons.  For this reason, Israeli human rights organizations have called for the establishment of a comprehensive, independent, impartial inquiry, a call that has so far been rejected.  But perhaps now, with six-months until the issue may be referred to the Security Council and even the International Criminal Court, Israel will reconsider this rejection and understand that domestic accountability is in Israel&#39;s own self-interest.&quot;<br />

		<title>Hate crime and anti-discrimination laws still needed to protect LGBT community</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.hrc.org/about_us/6080.htm">Brian Moulton</a> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">Michelle Litteken</span> [Chief Legislative Counsel and Staff Counsel, <a href="http://hrc.org">Human Rights Campaign</a>]: &quot;The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) applauds the Department of Justice&#39;s (DOJ) <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iDgSxLs3-yd9wmd1yicU0idUgQgQD9BB39OO1">statement</a> regarding <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/doj-official-pledges-to-fight.php">increased efforts to fight LGBT discrimination</a>. In his speech to the Civil Rights Division, Assistant Attorney General Tom Perez said that the Department must &quot;ensure that there&#39;s a level playing field in which our LGBT brothers and sisters are judged by the content of their character.&quot; Mr. Perez&#39;s speech gives the LGBT community hope that this administration will work to address the inequities LGBT people face on a daily basis.<br /><br />At the same time, we recognize that these statements are insufficient without a legal basis for action; in order to protect us, the Civil Rights Division needs laws to enforce.  HRC advocates every day for legislation that would bring LGBT people closer to full equality, including critical protections in the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act and the <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c107:1:./temp/~c107LXgZD5::">Employment Non-Discrimination Act</a>.<br /><br />Soon, the Civil Rights Division will be able to work with state and local law enforcement to ensure that hate crimes against LGBT people are fully investigated and prosecuted.  In the coming weeks, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act will become law, expanding federal hate crimes law to cover bias-motivated violence based on sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and disability.  The need to protect LGBT people is clear - according to FBI statistics, 15.9% of hate crime victims were targeted because of their sexual orientation in 2007 alone.  One of the key reasons the hate crimes measure is so close to enactment - after 12 years of advocacy before Congress - is because the Obama administration has called for, and worked for, its passage.          <br /><br />Workplace discrimination is a similarly pervasive and disruptive problem facing LGBT people.  While federal laws protect employees from workplace discrimination based on race, gender, age, religion, and disability, there are no clear protections for LGBT employees. As a result, in 29 states, an employee fired because of his sexual orientation would be left without any recourse; the same is true in 38 states for an employee denied a promotion because of her gender identity.  The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) would address this inequity by providing basic protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in employment.  As with hate crimes legislation, the leadership and advocacy of the administration will be critical in the effort to pass this critical bill.  Until then, the Justice Department will not have the tools to turn the level playing field that Mr. Perez envisions into a reality for LGBT Americans.   <br /><br />HRC thanks the administration for its commitment to LGBT equality, as voiced by President Obama, Assistant Attorney General Perez, and many others.  Real change will also require hard work and true leadership on Capitol Hill to see these critical protections become law.  We look forward to working with our many allies in the administration to make that happen. &quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/professionals-762.html"><strong>Stewart Baker</strong></a> [Partner, <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/">Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP</a>]: &quot;The US Senate Judiciary Committee&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/senate-committee-approves.php">decision</a> to reauthorize three provisions of the USA Patriot Act until 2013 is prudent.  The parts of the Act set to expire this year include provisions that allow federal authorities to compel production of business, medical and library records, to conduct &quot;roving&quot; wiretaps, and to designate suspects as &quot;lone wolf&quot; agents of foreign powers.  <br /><br />Notwithstanding its demonization by opponents, the <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/terrorism/hr3162.html">USA PATRIOT Act</a> was a relatively modest set of changes that cleaned up and consolidated antiterrorism authorities.  It allowed federal agencies to share information they were in large part already authorized to obtain.  The Obama Administration deserves credit for recognizing the reality that these are authorities it will need to investigate and thwart terrorist plots.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s being asked to accept new restrictions as part of the process, and some of those restrictions are dangerous.<br /><br />Senator Feingold in particular has introduced - and the Senate Judiciary has approved - an amendment that puts dangerous limits on information sharing.  It would require the FBI to &quot;prohibit the dissemination...of nonpublicly available information&quot; derived from national security letters.  While the amendment allows exceptions to accommodate &quot;the need to disseminate foreign intelligence&quot; the effect of this amendment is almost certain to be a <a href="http://www.skatingonstilts.com/skating-on-stilts/2009/10/is-senate-judiciary-rebuilding-the-wall.html">new wall</a> between the FBI and other agencies &#8212; just the kind of thing that served us so poorly in the run-up to 9/11.&quot;<br />

		<title>Pittsburgh&#039;s Police State: Giving the First Amendment a Beating at the G-20</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Witold (&quot;Vic&quot;) Walczak, Legal Director for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Pennsylvania, says that the First Amendment took a serious beating at the recent G-20 summit in Pittsburgh when police and National Guard troops silenced demonstrators using tactics reminiscent of repression methods used in martial law-era Poland in the early 1980s...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/vicwalczak.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->L<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->aw enforcement officials have, over the past decade, used gatherings of national and international leaders as license to suspend civil liberties.  During the recent  G-20 Summit, Pittsburgh proved to be no exception.  The city was transformed into a police state where our most cherished freedoms, especially the freedom to dissent, were subject to the martial law-type tactics I witnessed behind the Iron Curtain. <br /><br />While world leaders were quietly secluded behind closed doors, 8-foot-high steel and mesh fences lined most downtown streets.  Six thousand police and National Guard troops manned checkpoints, roamed the streets in armored humvees, and were visible everywhere in large groups. In this militarized ghost town, neither common folk nor demonstrators ever got close to the dignitaries.<br /><br />Before the Summit, local officials paid lip service to the First Amendment. But just as in Poland under martial law in the early 1980&#39;s, where only carefully controlled demonstrations sanctioned by communist-party bosses were allowed, protesters who lacked political ties to the establishment in Pittsburgh last week were threatened, harassed, and outright prohibited from peacefully expressing their opposition to G-20 policies. <br /><br />The gamesmanship began early.  Initially resistant to allowing any demonstrations during the Summit, the City eventually relented and permitted several mainstream groups, including former Vice President Al Gore's climate group, to hold events in a local park.<br /> <br />But when two less politically-connected groups, Codepink and Three Rivers Climate Convergence (3RCC), renewed their requests to use the same park, the City refused. The rich and powerful were welcome in Pittsburgh, but those with edgier critical messages were not. <br /><br />A federal judge eventually ordered the City to issue permits to Codepink and 3RCC, ruling that no good reason existed for precluding them.  Unfortunately, the mistreatment and harassment of 3RCC and other protesters didn't end with the judge's order.  <br /><br />Police vehicles blocked 3RCC's educational and food buses, preventing them from going to the demonstration.  City officials permitted the group to leave its tent, artwork, and literature in the park overnight, but would not allow anyone to stand guard- claiming that standing guard would constitute illegal camping.  The next day everything was gone.  In a moment of surprising candor, the City's spokeswoman admitted to a local reporter that the Public Works department had confiscated 3RCC's property.  With all necessary props gone, the climate-justice demonstrations never materialized.<br /><br />Despite this intensive scrutiny, which included dozens of warrantless raids on activists' homes and meeting places and countless pretextual traffic stops, only one person was arrested prior to the Summit &#8212; for giving a nickname instead of her birth name. <br /><br />In the eeriest parallel to my experiences in martial law Poland, on two consecutive evenings the police inexplicably deemed assemblies of people peacefully gathered in a large, grassy University of Pittsburgh plaza to be "unlawful" and ordered everyone to disperse immediately.  Police used an "LRAD" (first-ever civilian use of a military sonic weapon that can cause permanent hearing loss), shot pepper spray into dormitory stairwells, and fired rubber bullets and beanbags at fleeing students and curiosity seekers. <br /><br />When those assembled tried to follow dispersal orders, many ran into the nearly 1000 riot police that encircled the group.  The 100-plus arrestees included many curious, non-participating Pitt students and a few journalists.  In this police state, apparently, government-sanctioned assemblies are allowed, but spontaneous demonstrations or gatherings, even peaceful ones, are not.<br /><br />During the Summit, as expected, a few out-of-town kids broke a dozen windows.  Police presence at the crime scenes were minimal, primarily because just a few blocks away the massive manpower surge was suppressing the peaceful gathering at the University.  If a few of those police officers had simply stood on street corners around the area, even that little damage would have been minimized,  Officers who happened to be standing in front of a targeted coffee shop during the two-person rampage discouraged any vandalism. <br /><br />Pittsburgh's use of harassment, intimidation, trickery, and indiscriminate arrests against demonstrators was fairly typical of the recent handling of other large important gatherings at the hands of various groups of law enforcement officials.   At times when the imperative to allow freedom of speech and assembly is greatest &#8212; when national and international leaders convene &#8212; we impose martial law.  Surely a more balanced model that provides security and respects civil liberties is possible.<br /><br /><br /><em>Witold J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Mark Brown, holder of the Newton D. Baker/Baker and Hostetler Chair at Capital University School of Law, says that in the midst of the current furor over health care reform legislation we should remember that America&#39;s own revered Founding Fathers authorized, and sometimes embraced, governmental programs that offered essential services to the masses at low or no cost... <br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/mbrown.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he ongoing debate over health-care reform has generated renewed interest in &quot;socialism.&quot;  Some claim that governmental competition in the health insurance industry is socialism; others insist it is not.  For many on both sides of this divide, it seems, whether a "public option" is legitimate depends on how this definitional question is answered.  After all, everyone knows that socialism is unconstitutional.  It clearly contradicts the ideals of our Founding Fathers.<br /><br />Actually, it doesn't.  Here's a shock.  Many of our Founding Fathers were socialists.  They believed that "essential" services should be provided by government to the public at large for little or no remuneration. The costs of these services would be shared by the whole.  This, by most modern accounts, is socialism.<br /><br />The Constitution of the United States, drafted in the summer of 1787 in Philadelphia by some of the smartest men on this side of the Pond, proves this to be true.  In that cherished document, the Founding Fathers demanded socialism.  Section 8 of Article I, for example, empowers Congress "To establish Post Offices and post Roads."  That same Section also authorizes Congress "To raise and support Armies," and even "To provide and maintain a Navy."  Although the text does not preclude privatization of these public institutions &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; indeed, they continue to include entrepreneurial elements to this day &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the Framers understood that they would certainly have public, social elements as well.  Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; among others &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; all signed this document.  They agreed that the new national government would facilitate communication and defense through taxation.  They agreed that these essential services would not have to be purchased on the open market. They agreed that these services would not be limited to those who could pay fair market value.<br /><br />The author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson (who skipped the Constitutional Convention in favor of traipsing off to Paris during that hot summer in 1787), also supported the fledgling Nation's foray into socialism.  Perhaps the greatest of all of America's socialized institutions, the Nation's modern highway system, was begun in 1806 by then-President Jefferson's authorization of the Cumberland (National) Road.  Transportation, too, was deemed to be one of the Nation's essential services that could not be relegated to private industry. <br /><br />The Congress did President Jefferson one better.  It socialized the great bulk of America's navigable waterways in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.  The founding generation recognized early on that the national government needed the power regulate interstate commerce&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;this was written into Article I of the 1787 Constitution&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and waterways provided the most important channel of commerce.  The national government, using this authority, opened America's internal waterways to commerce.  These immense "social" highways proved a boon to entrepreneurial activities (and perhaps saved the Nation).<br /><br />Communication, transportation and mutual defense provide only the most obvious examples of the Founding Father's interests in socialized institutions.   Contrary to some popular reports, many in the founding generation had "republican," communitarian leanings.  Our forefathers were not devout disciples of Adam Smith, let alone Herbert Spencer (who in the mid-nineteenth century infamously coined the phrase, "survival of the fittest").  They were pragmatists, capitalists and socialists, willing to try whatever was necessary to insure that the American experiment did not fail. <br /><br />Of course, the Founding generation did not believe that every human endeavor benefited from governmental competition.  The founding generation's socialism only went so far.  The Founders believed in private enterprise.  <br /><br />But it was not long before the Founders' sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters, discovered the benefits of extending socialism beyond communication, transportation and national defense.  Libraries, fire protection, police protection and education were all socialized to some extent in the nineteenth century.  None of these developments replaced private enterprise&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;they merely insured that more Americans reaped the benefits.<br /><br />Would the Founders have objected to these modern developments?  No clear answer exists.   Private educational institutions were known to the founding generation, and it obviously did not make any concerted effort to extend this benefit to the masses.  But formal education was relatively unimportant in the late eighteenth century.  I cannot believe that those Founders who favored a socialized communication network &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the Post Office &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; would have necessarily frowned on an additional public institution designed to convey information.  Nothing in the document signed in Philadelphia in 1787, at least, prohibits governments from opening public schools.<br /><br />What about medicine?  Would the Framers have objected to governmental competition in the health care context?  At the turn of the eighteenth century, of course, the medical profession bordered on witchcraft; few Founders would have wished it on anyone.  (George Washington, remember, was bled to death by his doctors.  Dr. Benjamin Rush, another important Founder, routinely prescribed mercury for anything and everything.)  Assuming that they thought the medical profession could do any good&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;which is doubtful&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;no one can say with any certainty whether the Founding Fathers would have rejected measures that made it more accessible.  All we know is they wrote nothing into the Constitution to prohibit socialized medicine. <br /><br />History teaches us that the Framers were not averse to socialism.  They authorized, and sometimes embraced, governmental programs that offered essential services to the masses at low or no cost.  Communication, transportation, and defense were what the Founders deemed essential at the end of the eighteenth century.  That was their time.  They did not call it socialism.  They called it good government.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Mark R. Brown is the Newton D. Baker/Baker and Hostetler Chair at Capital University Law School. </em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Margaret Maffai of the <a href="http://www.cihrs.org/english/">Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies</a> says that to prevent governments from hiring private military contractors to dodge their international human rights obligations, lawmakers in countries such as the US must ensure that no corporation or private contract employee can escape prosecution for human rights violations when they occur....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/margaretmaffai.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he American public and&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;to some extent&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;lawmakers snapped to belated attention in September of 2007 when a small force of private military contractors opened fire on a busy Baghdad traffic square, killing at least 14 civilians and wounding 20 more.  A year later, the US Justice Department dutifully brought charges against the six shooters; Blackwater changed its name to Xe Services; and founder Erik Prince resigned amid some truly bizarre accusations including the murder of a whistleblower, a crusade to wipe out Muslims, arms smuggling, and a secret contract with the CIA to assassinate Al-Qaeda leaders.  So that's it, right?  Renegade mercenaries brought to justice, the poster child for shadowy military corporations is no more, and the square-jawed, ex-Navy SEAL quietly ducked out of the CEO seat.  Justice served.  Problem solved.<br /><br />Not exactly.  Though most lawmakers and American citizens recognize, at least on a rational level, that Blackwater is not the beginning and end of the problem of private military and security companies (PMSCs), the indictment of the six gunmen implicated in the Nisour Square shooting seemed to bring a collective sigh of relief&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;and subsequent legislative stagnation.  In truth, contractors are not unique to the Iraq War.  They are not unique to the United States.  They are not even unique to this century.  Rather, PMSCs, operate in every corner of the globe, performing every conceivable support function from food service to infrastructure construction, to building security, to human resources management, to policing, interrogation, and intelligence.  States have gradually surrendered their abilities to self-sufficiently perform their responsibilities in the areas of national defense and security in favor of employing private forces.  Yet the international community and the individual national governments that employ contractors seem content to ignore this growing threat to human rights and state sovereignty, or at least pretend the threat has abated.<br /><br />This find-sand-insert-head mentality denies the reality that PMSCs are so thoroughly intertwined with essential government functions the world over that even the most basic security, humanitarian, and infrastructure-building activities would be unsustainable without their support.  Private companies, including one implicated in sex-trafficking in Bosnia in 2000, are still actively engaged in training Iraqi police forces and operating Iraqi prisons.  South American countries including Chile and Columbia augment regular police forces with private security employees armed both literally (with deadly weapons) and figuratively (with the right to use force against citizens).  Prison systems in the U.K., the U.S., and Australia have shifted over the past three decades to privately-run prisons which have been accused by human rights groups of providing insufficient protections for prisoners' basic health, safety, and civil rights.  Conflict between environmental protestors and private guards hired to secure business interests such as oil pipelines in Asia, Africa, and South America have resulted in violence.  Though Blackwater made a convincing and convenient symbolic foe for the American justice system, which came late to the game and seems to have left early, it is hardly the be-all and end-all of corporate powers engaged in activities that threaten human rights and the State monopoly on the use of force.  <br /><br />To attempt to resolve the legal problems inherent in surrendering the State monopoly on the use of force to private companies with the indictment of six young men is to attempt to banish the Staten Island landfill with a few puffs of Febreze.  Individual accountability is admirable and necessary, but it is no substitute for criminal and civil liability for corporate decision makers for and companies themselves.  Moreover, providing criminal consequences solely for individual employees ignores the fact that many employees are, themselves, the victims of human rights violations such as fraudulent hiring practices, human trafficking, false imprisonment, and forced labor.<br /><br />Even those measures aimed at prosecuting individuals for human rights violations have proven scattershot at best.  The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA), which grants federal jurisdiction over civilians charged with certain felony criminal acts committed abroad, has resulted in only a handful of prosecutions.  MEJA applies only to contractors "supporting the mission of the Department of Defense overseas," and therefore does not clearly extend to State Department contractors such as Blackwater.  Similarly, a 2006 Department of Defense rule that makes DOD contractors subject to prosecution in military courts martial fails to reach State Department contractors such as Blackwater.  Moreover, Reid v. Covert, a 1954 case, held that it is unconstitutional to prosecute American civilians in military courts martial.  The case has not been overturned and the constitutionality of the new DOD rule has yet to be tested.<br /><br />The only reasonable approach to regulating transnational corporations integrated at every level of state, local, and national government is an international commitment to devising comprehensive legislation that provides for criminal and civil accountability for individuals and corporate entities complicit in human rights violations.  Most importantly, lawmakers should place clear limitations on the activities in which contractors may engage.  There are some activities that are simply not appropriate for outsourcing.  Elected representatives, not military commanders, must make rational, responsible decisions based on solid fact-finding about where to draw that line.  Key government functions such as interrogation of prisoners, intelligence gathering and counterintelligence operations, and armed interaction with civilians in a foreign battle space are currently performed by private employees.  Those with the power to guide corporate and governmental accountability need to consciously decide whether this is acceptable (it isn't) and firmly impose boundaries on the private performance of inherently governmental functions.  <br /><br />The international community will have the opportunity to take on these definitional challenges within the next several years.  The United Nations Working Group on the Use of Mercenaries as a Means of Violating Human Rights and Impeding the Exercise of the Right of Peoples to Self-Determination&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;in consultation with researchers, watchdog groups, industry representatives, and other civil society groups&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;has issued a <a href="http://mgimo.ru/files/121626/draft.pdf"><em>Draft International Convention on the Regulation, Oversight and Monitoring of Private Military and Security Companies</em></a>.  The Working Group will be approaching states in 2010 in a collaborative process to produce the official draft of the convention, which will be presented to the U.N. Human Rights Council for its consideration in September 2010.  Although engaging with other countries in a common effort to address a common challenge represents a necessary commitment to ensuring that the rule of law follows corporations wherever they operate, I would ask that the United States go one
 step farther.  <br /><br />As a source country for many of the PMSCs operating in conflict areas and in the developing world, I would ask U.S. lawmakers to ensure that even while the legal status of paid soldiers is debated on the international stage, no U.S. corporation, and no U.S. employee will escape prosecution for human rights violations.  Draft a comprehensive piece of legislation that spells out decisively what activities are permissible for outsourcing to private companies and reserves to the State&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and to the State alone&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the legitimate use of force.  Kick up investigations into corruption, waste, and fraud in contract bidding and performance.  Require companies that wish to bid on government contracts to enforce policies and procedures that ensure compliance with international human rights law and the law of armed conflict and train employees to respect local cultural and religious norms.  Increase economic sanctions and exposure to civil liability for corporations that fail to comply with these minimum standards.  As we increase our military and private military presence in Afghanistan, ostensibly to combat terrorism and restore the rule of law, we owe it to our national integrity to ensure that every representative of American force abroad operates within the reach of justice.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Margaret Maffai is currently working as a Program Development Officer for the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, an Egyptian human rights NGO located in Cairo, Egypt.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistani officials announced last week that murder charges had been filed earlier this month against the nation&#39;s former president, Pervez Musharraf, who is now on a speaking tour in the US and the UK.  Andrew Gilmore, Pitt Law &#39;10, attended one of his lectures in late September...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><strong>H</strong>aving extensively covered the recent legal and political trials and tribulations of Pakistan over the past two years for JURIST&#39;s Paper Chase news service, I was thrilled to learn earlier this autumn that former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf would be coming to Pittsburgh in late September. His lecture, &quot;The World As I See It,&quot; was part of the Robert Morris University &quot;Pittsburgh Speakers Series,&quot; and took place at downtown Pittsburgh&#39;s historic Heinz Hall on a rainy night. As I took my seat, I noticed a palpable sense of excitement emanating from the crowd.  After all, it isn&#39;t every day that an American gets to hear the world view of a recently-retired head of state, and Pakistan is a major US partner in the &quot;War on Terror.&quot;  In addition, Musharraf has an especially checkered history of coup-leading and alleged human rights violations.<br /><br />The lecture started, as such things often do, with an introduction by a local public radio personality, who highlighted Musharraf&#39;s experience and recent past activities in Pakistan. Curiously, I thought, very little mention was made of the controversial issues which arose during Musharraf&#39;s tenure as Pakistan&#39;s president.  Nothing was said of the impact of the anti-Musharraf lawyers&#39; movement, nor of the alleged pro-Taliban activities at the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, or the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.<br /><br />When Musharraf took the stage, he wasted no time in outlining &quot;The World As I See It,&quot; telling the audience that his talk was basically broken up into four sections of concern: political disputes leading to international disharmony, the menace of terrorism and extremism, nuclear concerns, and the developmental inequities among states. He started with the issue of political disputes, and essentially incorporated the other topics into it, rather than expounding upon them as separate and distinct areas.<br /><br />After his outline of the speech, I was even more interested to hear the insights he would bring to the ongoing discussion of these important topics. However, it was at this point that the speech turned into an apology - what seemed to me to be an attempt by Musharraf to justify his actions and address criticisms lodged against him by various parties, both internationally and in Pakistan.<br /><br />The former president rooted his world view in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, characterizing it as a great source of destabilization in the Middle East as well as the greater Muslim world, saying that all Muslims are emotionally invested in the conflict, regardless of their national identities or affiliations. He went on to say that nearly all of the world&#39;s Muslim extremist and terrorist organizations have been inspired by the conflict on some level, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and al-Qaeda. Whether true or not, I found this to be an interesting idea, but Musharraf&#39;s theory that this single conflict was responsible, at least to some extent, for most of the groups making up the &quot;others&quot; in the &quot;War on Terror&quot; seemed too facile.  Portraying this conflict as the backdrop against which Muslim-Western relations should be viewed over-simplifies matters.<br /><br />Musharraf then moved on, discussing the Indian-Pakistani conflict over Kashmir. Like the Palestinian-Israeli conflict writ smaller, he attributed extremist and terrorist organizations and activity in the Indian subcontinent to this unresolved dispute. Specifically, he identified the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba as the immediate progeny of the dispute, and based the group&#39;s founding on the disharmony and instability created in Kashmir.<br /><br />It was at this point that he launched into one of the most intriguing parts of his lecture. Weaving into the discussion the previously-mentioned Palestinian-Israeli and Indian-Pakistani conflicts, he elaborated on the &quot;Muslim perception&quot; of world events from 1979 to the present day. Mentioning Kosovo, Bosnia, Croatia, Chechnya, Iran, and Iraq, Mr. Musharraf stated that because these conflicts all occurred in Muslim lands, and because atrocities of varying degrees were perpetrated against Muslims, Muslims have come to believe that they are being targeted by &quot;others.&quot; While Mr. Musharraf stated that this &quot;might not be true,&quot; he argued that here, as in many other cases, &quot;perceptions are more dangerous than facts.&quot; My first reaction to this idea was one of sympathy, reached by placing myself in the shoes of those whom he described: if I looked around and saw my fellow Muslims as the only ones attacked around the world, I would probably feel persecuted, too. However, that sentiment was quickly replaced by disbelief. How, I wondered (and still wonder), could a sane person look at world events and think that the only conflicts or atrocities committed between 1979 and the present day were against Muslims? I thought of Cold War proxy conflicts in Latin America; Protestant-Catholic wars of attrition in Ireland; the millions raped, tortured and murdered in the Congo; the innocent victims of the Rwandan and Sudanese genocides; the wars in Southeast Asia. All of these events happened after 1979, yet everyone is out to get the Muslims? Mr. Musharraf&#39;s words insinuated what remained unsaid: he believes that the West&#39;s involvement in world events is biased against Muslims and is the reason for 9/11, and for the ongoing fight against terrorism and extremism. Mr. Musharraf&#39;s words stayed with me: perceptions are indeed more dangerous than facts.<br /><br />Musharraf then walked the audience through his country&#39;s role in the defeat of the Soviet Red Army in Afghanistan, including the arming of the Taliban and the <em>mujaheddin</em>. Here again, he put the blame for 9/11 and the fight against terrorism and extremism squarely at the foot of the West, specifically the US. After arming and funding the Taliban, according to him, the West and the US left Pakistan &quot;high and dry.&quot; In 1989, the US and the West celebrated the end of the Cold War and their defeat of the Soviets, while what Musharraf argued was the main reason for the Soviet collapse - the &quot;Pakistani&quot; victory over the Soviets in Afghanistan - was ignored. He said there was no question of any funding for rebuilding Afghanistan, no &quot;mini-mini-Marshall Plan,&quot; as he put it, drawing a hearty laugh from the crowd. Essentially, he said, the US ignored the Taliban, left them to themselves in Afghanistan, armed to the teeth with weapons and an extremist version of Islam provided by the foreign fighters recruited to battle the Soviets, and it was there, with nothing to do, that they coalesced and became al-Qaeda. It was here, Mr. Musharraf stated, that the West made its first blunder: ignoring the <em>mujaheddin</em> and the rebuilding of Afghanistan, and allowed the Taliban/al-Qaeda to emerge from the wreckage of the Soviet defeat. I found it difficult to argue against this theory.<br /><br />The former president took a more controversial argument in presenting what he believed was the West&#39;s second blunder, arguing that the West and the rest of the world should have recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. This approach, he explained, would have opened up the country to foreign missions and embassies as well as the presence of more international organizations - allowing the West and the rest of the world to influence the Taliban from the inside. He believes that this tactic would have presented an easy solution to the Taliban&#39;s destruction of the giant Buddha statutes, and might even have allowed the West and the US
to seize Osama bin Laden from the Taliban, in exchange for political or financial concessions.<br /><br />After having spent a considerable time talking about political disputes and their affect on world events, Musharraf turned to what he perceived to be the elements of Muslim extremism - al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the &quot;Talibanization&quot; of central Pakistan and creeping extremism in that region, and the misuse of schools for extremist purposes. I found this portion of his talk quite informative, as he discussed the intricacies of the Pakistan-Afghanistan relationship, including the great influence of the majority Pashtun tribe over the Taliban. I particularly enjoyed hearing his insights about the tactics male Arab <em>mujaheddin</em> fighters used to integrate themselves into the social and tribal fabric of Afghanistan and Pakistan&#39;s Federally Administered Tribal Areas, including marrying and starting families with local women, as a way to ensure the loyalty of the tribal groups and protect themselves from Western and Pakistani forces.<br /><br />Having touched on the Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir, Musharraf spoke briefly about the nuclear issue. This seemed to me to be more of a message of reassurance to his American audience, soothing words to tell us that he had seen to it during his presidency to safeguard Pakistan&#39;s nuclear assets by creating two army corps to control the country&#39;s nuclear material. While his words addressed the issue of Pakistan&#39;s physical nuclear assets, Musharraf never spoke about the dissemination of Pakistan&#39;s nuclear technology to North Korea, Iran, and Libya by its eminent nuclear scientist, A.Q. Khan.<br /><br />After having spent the majority of his lecture on security issues, Musharraf fleetingly addressed developmental inequities among nations, but stressed the importance of this issue, calling it a major problem in the developing world that has led to great political and environmental chaos. With the increasing availability of information via television and the internet, as well as the prosperity globalization has bestowed on limited segments of the societies of developing countries, the &quot;have-nots,&quot; living amid abject poverty, illiteracy and desperate living conditions, are able to see first-hand the luxurious lives of the &quot;haves.&quot; This in turn has lead to mass urbanization in developing countries, as the rural poor flee their homes for a better life in the cities. Musharraf cited the explosion of population growth in developing countries as a result of this mass urbanization, as opposed to zero or negative population growth in the developed world.<br /><br />He proposed a number of solutions to this problem, which I found to be quite interesting. Describing foreign sovereign debt and debt service payments as the &quot;biggest drag&quot; on developing countries, Musharraf called for the forgiveness of the debts of well-performing developing countries. Displaying a shrewd sense of timing, he characterized the forgiveness of these debts as being much less costly than other nations&#39; shoring up of domestic corporations in the wake of the recent global financial crisis. He also proposed politically controlling &quot;unscrupulous&quot; developing country leaders who steal their countries&#39; wealth and transfer it to European banks for their own personal and familial profit. Finally, and to my mind, convincingly, he called on the global community to &quot;share knowledge for the mutual development of mankind, including the development of the developing world.&quot;<br /><br />Perhaps the most surreal event of the night happened during the question and answer session. At the beginning of the evening, ushers collected questions written by audience members on slips of paper contained in the program pamphlets. My question was one of those read out loud on stage for Musharraf to answer: &quot;Please discuss your thoughts on the Pakistan lawyers&#39; movement and its role in opposition to your removal of Pakistan Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudry, and declaration of emergency rule and suspension of the Pakistan constitution in November 2007.&quot; His answer to that question was wholly unsatisfying. In a soft tone, he mumbled that he suspended Chief Justice Chaudry because there were &quot;allegations&quot; made against him by then-prime minister Shaukat Aziz, and that those unspecified &quot;allegations&quot; were referred to him. Again, Musharraf nearly mumbled that he only sent those &quot;allegations&quot; on to the Supreme Judicial Council, as he was required to do by the constitution, and that in response, the lawyers &quot;came onto the streets, and the situation was politicized.&quot; Almost completely glossing over the turbulent late spring, summer, and fall of 2007, he said that &quot;Bhutto came [to Pakistan], got assassinated, and I felt I had to resign.&quot; And that was it. No mention of the declaration of emergency rule, no mention of the numerous other judges he himself suspended along with the Chief Justice, and certainly no mention by of his own affirmative act of suspending the constitution. No matter, though, as he told the audience in his final comment of the night: &quot;Whatever I did, whatever actions I took, were validated by the National Assembly of Pakistan and the Supreme Court of Pakistan.&quot; Well, then. A marginalized legislative body and a stacked high court can&#39;t be wrong, can they?<br /><br />While I enjoyed Musharraf&#39;s lecture, I was left disappointed by his refusal to speak frankly about the events that led to his resignation. Even though he is the former president of Pakistan, he seemed to speak as if he were still an active political figure, but perhaps he is. Two comments struck me in particular, as they relate to the future of Musharraf and Pakistan. While speaking of Pakistan&#39;s protection of its nuclear assets, he stated unequivocally that &quot;religious groups will never control Pakistan.&quot; Somewhat more ominously, when discussing Taliban incursions into the Swat valley of central Pakistan, he took great pains to stress to the audience that &quot;the whole nation is behind the Army to eliminate the Taliban&quot; and that &quot;the whole country is behind the Army, after their success in Swat, to eliminate the Taliban threat.&quot; Coming from a former Army general, commander of the armed forces, and a military officer who seized control of Pakistan from a civilian government in a bloodless coup, I found those statements impossible to ignore. After hearing from Musharraf, I didn&#39;t leave with a clear idea of where Pakistan is headed, but I did get a better sense of its recent past.<br />

		<title>IRAQ: Parliamentary Immunity in a Recovering Nation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sara Burhan Abdullah, Pitt Law LLM &#39;08 and JD &#39;12, writes about an experience in her home country of Iraq...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font>s an Iraqi lawyer and US law student, I often check some of the Iraqi websites meant to inform people about draft laws being put before the Iraqi Parliament.  One day, I was reading through one such website when my eyes caught a brief report on the October 6, 2009 session of Parliament. One comment detailed the Speaker&#39;s support for a request made by a Member of Parliament (MP) to summon the Minister of Transportation for questioning. The Ministry of Transportation had issued a regulation that requires the search of all Iraqi citizens - including the Iraqi MPs - at the Baghdad International Airport.  The member who called for the questioning insisted that the requirement of a search was a violation of the immunity of MPs under the Iraqi Constitution.<br /><br />The Iraqi Constitution affords the MPs the ability to question the prime minister as well as the ministers on matters within the relevant minister&#39;s portfolio. At least 25 members must agree with such questioning and an additional article gives MPs immunity from prosecution based on statements made while Parliament is in session, and guarantees that MPs can not be arrested for felonies during legislative sessions unless plainly caught in the act.  This provision can be waived by an absolute majority of Parliament if an MP has been indicted.<br /><br />The immunity is therefore rather narrowly limited to statements made during session. Furthermore, the prevention of arrest is only temporary, and ends once the legislative session ends, at which time the MP could legally be held accountable and arrested for the earlier crime.  It is unfortunate, then, that a statute originally intended only to prevent executive interference in legislative operations is now being interpreted by an MP as a &quot;free pass&quot; to effectively place members above the law.  It is even more shocking that before the requisite 25 members favored the questioning, the Speaker supported the motion without hesitation.<br /><br />It is in these kinds of situations where the legal community must raise these vital issues and criticize the MPs in order to bring a central fact to their attention: that the Constitution has not put them above their fellow citizens. This broad assertion of immunity is an insult to the rule of law, where the rulers and the ruled should be subject to the same legal restrictions. The legal community should inform the public on the misuse of the powers that have been placed in the hands of political and governmental officials through the application of bad legal arguments. These MPs should know that being searched in a public place by the police is in the interest of all individuals without distinction, particularly for a country such as Iraq, given its current situation.<br /><br />The time has come for the legal community and educators to stand against these kinds of measures, turning the public&#39;s attention to those who should represent them, how these representatives should act, and the true meaning of the rule of law.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">See also: <br /><a href="http://www.uniraq.org/documents/iraqi_constitution.pdf"><br />Iraqi Constitution</a><br /></span><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anna Kavalauskas, Pitt Law &#39;12, attended a talk on the impact of Mexicans&#39; migration in the US, given by Witness for Peace spokesperson Paola Gutierrez Galindo...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Migration1-795994.png"><img style="float:right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 267px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Migration1-793605.png" border="0" alt="" /></a><font>T</font>ension surrounding Mexican immigration is growing, and I think almost everyone involved in the debate would say that the system is broken, especially Paola Gutierrez Galindo. From Oaxaca, Mexico, Galindo holds a degree in Indigenous Law and the focus of her current research is the impact of migration on identity and family in Oaxacan indigenous communities.  At a recent presentation hosted by the University of Pittsburgh Center for Latin American Studies, she explained her concern about migration as a Mexican worried about the demise of her community, a view unfamiliar to many Americans.  She spoke in Spanish and a translator stood at her side. As a former English as a Second Language (ESL) teacher, I was interested to hear Galindo&#39;s perspective, and she had tears in her eyes as she described her fractured family. Her sister left over ten years ago and has since had children. They are natural-born US citizens, but she is still undocumented and cannot contact her family or return to Mexico. Her uncle&#39;s wife left him while he traveled back and forth between the two countries for work.<br /> <br />In the US, the immigration debate begins with genuine concerns, but it can quickly turn into something else.  Those supporting stricter immigration laws cite unfairness as the basis of their argument.  Illegal and legal immigrants take advantage of job opportunities and may benefit from free immunizations, tuition breaks and workers compensation. Galindo agrees with the basic sentiment that something needs to be done, but in her opinion, neither building a wall, nor opening the doors for complete amnesty are real or viable solutions. The best answers first explore why so many Mexicans have chosen to leave their home communities to live and work in the US and also communicate how this is detrimental to both the US and Mexico. <br /><br />So why have nearly 13 million Mexicans made the decision to leave home and work in a country with increasing anti-immigration hostility?  Galindo affirmed what I had believed to be true, that Mexicans come to the US mainly for employment opportunities, better pay, and to reconnect with family already living abroad.  In some cases, families are desperately looking for a solution to low wages and high prices. In other situations, migration is a family tradition. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/migrationpic4-766467.png"><img style="float:left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/migrationpic4-764648.png" border="0" alt="" /></a>To Galindo&#39;s dismay, her Oaxacan community is diminishing. Many of those who return for holidays do so with American accents and clothes.  There is a disconnect between the visitors and those who remain in Oaxaca, and the gap is wider than just a preference for shoes instead of sandals, or English instead of the Oaxacan dialect.  She will tell you that once vibrant and lively communities are eroding and school enrollment numbers are dwindling. As part of her outreach, Galindo travels to schools to explain the dangers and loneliness of emigrating, and more importantly, the importance of community, heritage and tradition.<br /> <br />According to Galdino, the biggest culprit is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and reform is in order.  She spoke of the recurring economic crises in Mexico since NAFTA&#39;s inception in 1994, and the acute crises in the countryside.  Although many rural Mexicans believed that NAFTA would make business people out of farmers and move the country to first-world status with a reciprocal relationship between imports and exports, this has hardly been achieved.   Mexico has failed to industrialize and there has been a loss of secure prices and agricultural products as well as a liberalized entry of US products.  Far from benefiting the majority of Mexicans, Galindo argues that NAFTA has caused irreparable harm.  Mexicans wearing traditional dress sip Coca Cola, and when those working in the US send money home, it is very often spent on American products such as corn and rice, which are staple foods.<br /> <br />At this point, a joke about American Mexican restaurants broke the otherwise somber tone of the presentation. Everyone seemed to agree that the food you find here just really can&#39;t compare to the real thing. Galindo described how Mexican farming is inconsistent with the idea of mass production. Food is organically grown and cannot easily be packaged and shipped north without quickly rotting.  Respecting nature while farming is slow and expensive, and much of the once communal land has been privatized.  The only people Galindo sees benefiting in Mexico are the presidents who supported NAFTA and the businesses increasing their profits.<br /> <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/migrationpic5-708881.png"><img style="float:right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 270px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/migrationpic5-707799.png" border="0" alt="" /></a>The Trade, Reform, Accountability, Development, and Employment Act (TRADE Act) of 2009 is a bill currently in Congress, where more than half the House Democrats have supported it from the beginning. The TRADE Act calls for an important re-evaluation of NAFTA, including a comprehensive review of existing trade agreements and renegotiation to set terms for future trade agreements. Additionally, the Act proposes the role of Congress in trade policy-making should be strengthened.  If this bill were passed, Galindo&#39;s talking points would reach a greater public and the action that she hopes for would begin.  Job loss in the US, agricultural dumping in Mexico, and migration trends would be assessed. In addition to the TRADE Act, Galindo stressed that everyone can get politically and socially involved and ultimately work to push for representation of the countryside in both the US and Mexico.<br /> <br />It was interesting to hear Galindo&#39;s perspective on immigration, precisely because she dislikes the idea of Mexicans leaving to work in the US.  Her travel to universities on the east coast with the non-profit group Witness for Peace marked her first time in this country.  I believe that it is important to engage in discussions such as these because immigrants, both legal and illegal, make up a significant portion of the American population. The very human desire and need for stability, both at work and at home, is driving Mexicans north and Americans apart.<br /> <br /><font size="2">Mentioned in this article:<br /><a href="http://www.witnessforpeace.org/"><br />Witness for Peace </a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/TRADEAct2009_Final_House.pdf">TRADE Act of 2009</a><br /><br />Photos courtesy of Witness for Peace<br /></font><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kristine Long, Pitt Law &#39;11, and Joseph Schaeffer, Pitt Law &#39;12, attended the 18th Annual McLean Lecture on World Law, <i>Nationalism, Constitutionalism and the Future of the European Union</i>, presented by Sir David Edward at the University of Pittsburgh...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><br /><b>Kristine Long</b><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/dateline/uploaded_images/DSC05010-760881.JPG"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/dateline/uploaded_images/DSC05010-760436.JPG" alt="" border="0"></a> <font>R</font>ather fortuitously, I was able to go with Professor Ron Brand, Director of the Center for International Legal Education, to pick up Sir David Edward from his hotel before his lecture. Prior to meeting him, his reputation as a respected judge and scholar made him both impressive and intimidating. Yet, in the car ride, he was engaging and had a sincere interest in Pittsburgh, student life, and the law school. His demeanor was unchanged when he began his lecture, <i>Nationalism, Constitutionalism, and the Future of the European Union</i>. Even though his topic was daunting, Sir David had a warm and engaging tone that prevented his talk from becoming a stuffy lecture on national egotism.<br /><br /><b>Joseph Schaeffer</b><br /><br />I didn&#39;t know what to expect from Sir David before he began his lecture, but I learned that he is a man of many talents: he is a respected jurist, historian, and humorist. He opened by noting that he was in Pittsburgh due to his work with the Carnegie Foundation, joking that he felt obligated to give back to the city, since he was &quot;spending funds that originated in Pittsburgh&quot; to help his home country of Scotland. Sir David seemed to have a deep interest in his topic, which he stated was inspired by two seemingly-unrelated events: the death of former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and the German Constitutional Court&#39;s judgment on the Lisbon Treaty, whose aim is to create more efficiency and cohesiveness throughout the EU.<br /><br /><b>Kristine Long</b><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/dateline/uploaded_images/DSC05024-739253.JPG"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/DSC05024-738804.JPG" alt="" border="0"></a>Sir David posed an initial question to the audience: &quot;What is the dream of the European Union?&quot; At first, it could be argued that the EU was attempting to create a version of the &quot;United States of Europe,&quot; relying on the belief of incremental integration. Returning to his inspirations, he noted that McNamara believed in such a dream when he was the Secretary of Defense, but gave up on the notion due to the Vietnam War. What McNamara did come to believe in, however, were 11 short lessons. Sir David started by focusing on Lesson Three, which argues that the US underestimated the power nationalism has to motivate a people to fight and die for their beliefs and values. In fewer than 15 words, McNamara and Sir David captured the importance of nationalism, a factor that cannot be discounted when discussing international ideology.<br /><br /><b>Joseph Schaeffer</b><br /><br />Continuing from this first inspiration, Sir David discussed the American-centric versus Eurocentric perception of the &quot;nation.&quot; Quoting Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, he argued that the American idea of the &quot;nation&quot; is that of a people created by joint experiences, constantly in flux. In contrast, the European idea of the nation is that of a historically-evolved, stable group bound together by common language and culture, among other factors. He implied that Europe consequently places a stronger emphasis on nationalism, and he ran through approximately 400 years of European history in order to prove his conclusion: despite numerous wars, Europe&#39;s current geographical composition has a strong correlation with its linguistic composition.<br /><br />Throughout his lecture, Sir David led the audience on an extended journey from America to Europe &#8212; although his tone was conversational, each of his slides strategically added layers of content which eventually led the audience to realize that any discussion about nations would require delicate handling and balanced discussion of differing opinions.  Despite the strength of nationalism in Europe, there are still elements of instability, particularly ethnic tensions, immigration, Euroskepticism, disparities of wealth, and structural imbalances. Returning to McNamara, there is also the divisive force of nationalism, which Sir David implied served as a bar to greater European unity. His position on nationalism was made explicit during the question and answer period, when he responded to a question about the Euroskepticism of England&#39;s Tories by stating that they were simply &quot;irrational.&quot;<br /><br /><b>Kristine Long</b><br /><br />One of the most alarming elements of instability that Sir David discussed was the lack of representation in the EU. Currently, representation in the EU legislative bodies is largely non-proportional. Germany is by far the largest member of the EU with a population of over 70 million, but a vast majority of the EU members states have far smaller populations (ranging from several hundred thousand to a few million). While there are vastly different population levels, larger states do not necessarily have a greater share of the votes. Germany currently has 24 votes, while other states have from 2-12 votes. This imbalance would be exacerbated by the accession of Turkey to the EU, since Turkey would then become the largest state in the EU. According to Sir Edward, Turkey&#39;s entrance to the EU is inevitable, and will bring many related problems.<br /><br /><b>Joseph Schaeffer</b><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" /dateline/uploaded_images/DSC05012-710296.JPG"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/dateline/uploaded_images/DSC05012-709843.JPG" alt="" border="0"></a>Sir David moved on from his discussion of nationalism when he questioned whether constitutionalism would be a cure to the structural imbalances. Again, he discussed the benefits of a constitution, but also noted its drawbacks. Probably the most amusing moment of the lecture was when Sir David wondered (in the words of Georgetown Professor Michael Seidman) whether these changes would not simply &quot;put the lipstick of disinterested constitutionalism on the pig of raw politics.&quot; He then discussed the impact of the German Constitutional Court ruling on the constitutionality of the Lisbon Treaty under German Law, interpreting the court&#39;s ruling as an imposition of strict limits on the applicability of EU law. In yet another humorous turn of phrase, Sir David felt the German court&#39;s holding on the EU issue was &quot;Thus far shalt thou come and no further.&quot; The German court held that the Treaty was not representative of the German people and that, at the extremes, Germany might declare EU law inapplicable or even refuse to participate in the EU. As Sir David noted, there is a real concern that states&#39; exercise of nullification powers might lead to further instability. Finally, he concluded by connecting the portion of his talk on constitutionalism to the portion on nationalism, asking whether the German court&#39;s decision was a sign of national egotism or a legitimate concern.<br /><br /><b>Joseph Schaeffer</b><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/dateline/uploaded_images/DSC05028-779546.JPG"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/dateline/uploaded_images/DSC05028-779133.JPG" alt="" border="0">
</a>Sir David left some questions open for the audience, which was perhaps fair because he spent the majority of his allotted time speaking not only on nationalism, constitutionalism and the EU, but also on American federalism and European history. Sir David was a most impressive speaker because of his breadth of knowledge in a vast array of topics. In forty minutes he talked about American law, (citing Oliver Wendell Holmes and the US constitution) political theory, (quoting from Stalin and McNamara) and literature - all in addition to his already extensive coverage about the EU.<br /><br /><b>Kristine Long</b><br /><br />Sir David gave a fascinating lecture and truly lived up to the expectations of the McLean Lecture Series, which seeks to create public dialogue about the need for world peace through the mechanism of world law. He gave a balanced and honest discussion about the state of the EU, which is not an easy task. It is difficult to write a truthful history of any nation because people do not want to hear about their own shortcomings, but Sir David acknowledged that the EU, like any nation, has both its strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br /><font size="2">Mentioned in this article:<br /><a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/academics/cile"><br />Center for International Legal Education (CILE) </a><br /><br /><a href="http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/07/07/jonathon-narvey-rovbert-mcnamara-s-11-lessons.aspx">11 Lessons from the Vietnam War</a><br /><br /><a href="http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/full_text/index_en.htm">The Lisbon Treaty</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.eurunion.org/eu/">The European Union</a><br /><br />Photo Credits: Kerry Ann Stare courtesy of CILE<br /></font></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Compensation regulation obscures role of housing policy in recent economic collapse</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://public.tepper.cmu.edu/facultydirectory/FacultyDirectoryProfile.aspx?id=98"><strong>Allan Meltzer</strong></a> [Professor of Political Economy, <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>]: &quot;Congress and the administration typically try to find scapegoats to satisfy the public that they are dong something about failed policies.  In the 1980s, the alleged culprits were venal operators of a few savings and loans.  This time it is the greedy bankers.  I agree that the incentives in most bank compensation arrangements should be changed.  But to think that <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/treasury-issues-rulings-restricting.php">compensation arrangements</a> were a major reason for the the financial and housing crisis  is wrong and misleading.  Other banks  had similar compensation practices, but all banks did not take excessive risks.  JP Morgan Chase is an example, and  here in Pittsburgh we have PNC Bank, now the fifth or sixth largest.  It did not accept excessive risk and borrowed from the TARP to reduce the cost of buying another failing bank.<br /><br />As many have pointed out, compensation should be aligned with long term risk.  That would increase the incentive for more prudent behavior by many.  Bankers and traders should do more and better due diligence instead of taking the ratings given by the rating agencies.  That would lower risk by making the trader bear the cost.  In too many cases, they faced a choice of taking on risk to boost the firm&#39;s short-term profits or losing their jobs.  That&#39;s a poor incentive system.<br /><br />The major faults with concentration on compensation is that it panders to public belief that something important is being done.  The larger problem is that the ruckus about compensation obscures the more serious problem - housing policy.  Before the crisis many critics warned that the government&#39;s housing policy would bring a disaster.  My AEI colleague Peter Wallison, a former Treasury General Counsel, warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac countless times.  Bill Poole, former President of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank wrote and spoke about the problem with housing policy.  Alan Greenspan testified about the problem. And there were other warnings. The House Financial Service Committee would not act.  Congressman Barney Frank, now the committee&#39;s chair, dismissed the warnings and continued the misguided policies.<br /><br />Housing policy encouraged buyers to purchase with no down payment and no credit record.  For many buyers, the mortgages required payment of interest only.  This was supposed to encourage home ownership by the disadvantaged.  With no down payment and interest only loans, it is hard to claim that the buyers owned anything.  For many it was simply cheaper than paying rent and gave the hope of a capital gain when the property sold.  A badly mistaken policy should end.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are interest subsidy programs.  They should be closed, and the subsidies should be on the budget.  That is the honest way and the proper procedure for subsidies in a democracy. <br /><br />Large banks were &quot;too big to fail.&quot;  Many took risks believing that they made the profits and the public took the losses.  That policy, in place for 30 or more years, should end.  If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big.  Should the government limit the size? Yes, it should let the bank choose its size but require that the bank&#39;s capital has to increase more than in proportion to the increase in its assets.  That way, the bank protects the public and, no less important, the banker has to wonder every day about the risks on his or her balance sheet.  That is where concern should concentrate.  Incentives work far better than regulation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.heritage.org/About/Staff/BruceKlingner.cfm"><strong>Bruce Klingner</strong></a> [Senior Research Fellow, Northeast Asia, <a href="http://www.heritage.org/">The Heritage Foundation</a>]: &quot;North Korea has repeatedly been cited by the US government, United Nations, and independent human rights groups as one of the most <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-rights-investigator-cites-north.php">egregious violators</a> of human rights. North Korean citizens face abysmal living conditions, pervasive government surveillance, and a total lack of political and religious freedom. Overlaid on this depressing situation is a justice system that allows several generations of relatives to be sent to prison for the political crimes of an individual such as criticizing the leadership, including the &quot;crime&quot; of sitting on a newspaper photograph of leader Kim Jong-il. North Korea has a gulag prison system - some of the camps are the size of the District of Columbia - with atrocities that rival those of Nazi Germany, including forced abortions and medical experimentation.<br /><br />While there is unanimity of view on the human rights depravities of the North Korean regime, there is disagreement on how best to improve conditions for North Koreans. Some advocate a policy of &quot;name and blame&quot; where North Korean human rights abuses are highlighted and condemned in international venue, including <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-investigator-condemns-north-korea.php">reports</a> by UN Special Rapporteur for North Korea Vitit Muntarbhorn. Some human rights advocates favor incorporating human rights in any engagement with North Korea, including the Six Party Talks nuclear negotiations. Activist human rights groups advocate using tactics that weakened support for the Soviet Union and East European regimes by forcing the introduction of news from the outside world into North Korea. This has been done in a variety of means, including broadcasting radio transmissions; smuggling in radios and Bibles; and using balloons to carry information on the abuses of the North Korean regime.<br /><br />Others argue that such a confrontational approach is ineffective and only causes North Korea to further isolate itself. During the ten years of progressive administrations in South Korea under Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, Seoul refrained from any criticism of North Korea for fear it would undermine Seoul&#39;s engagement policy toward the North. Those governments sought to bring about change in the nature of the North Korean regime by providing unconditional aid and benefits in hopes of lowering tension and Pyongyang&#39;s claimed feeling of being threatened. Ironically, those South Korean administrations were staffed by human rights advocates who had rebelled against South Korea&#39;s authoritarian governments and yet were blatantly silent about far more horrendous acts by Pyongyang. Seoul was harshly criticized by the international community for repeatedly refusing to sign the annual UN resolution condemning North Korean human rights violations.<br /><br />The Obama administration has yet to make known its view on how to prioritize reducing North Korean security threats, including its nuclear and missile forces, against improving human rights in the North. While human rights advocates would hope to insert humanitarian issues into any forum with North Korea, the predominant view will be to not risk derailing potential progress in denuclearizing North Korea by incorporating &quot;extraneous&quot; contentious issues. As such, human rights and security issues will likely continue to be addressed in separate venues, though long-term issues such as formalizing diplomatic relations with North Korea will more directly address Pyongyang&#39;s human rights abuses.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong><a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/detail.asp?id=23">Virginia Sloan</a></strong></a> [President, <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">The Constitution Project</a>]: &quot;The recent uproar surrounding Ohio&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-delays-ohio-execution.php">failed attempt</a> to execute Romell Broom, who was convicted of murdering Tryna Middleton, highlights the continuing problems with lethal injection in Ohio, and elsewhere around the country. If the state is to continue using the death penalty, the state must comply with the &quot;quick and painless&quot; standard mandated by Ohio state law, as well as the mandates of the US Constitution. Executions must not resume unless the state is able to guarantee that execution teams are properly trained to carry out their purpose and that a contingency plan is in place to address unexpected problems, including when &#8212; as was the case with Romell Broom - peripheral vein access becomes difficult or impossible.<br /><br />The September 20th fiasco is the most recent of several botched executions in Ohio, which uses the controversial &quot;three-drug cocktail&quot; lethal injection. The executions of Joseph Clark in 2006, and that of Christopher Newton the following year, were ultimately successful but were delayed significantly because of difficulties in locating veins suitable for injection, an increasingly evident and inherent flaw in lethal injection protocols around the country. Following the Clark and Newton executions, Ohio officials vehemently defended the state&#39;s execution procedures and dismissed any need for improvements. The failed attempt to execute Mr. Broom on September 20th clearly demonstrates otherwise. <br /><br />The <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/federal-court-grants-stay-of-execution.php">recent stays of execution</a> granted to Mr. Broom and Ohio death row inmates Kenneth Biros, Darryl Durr, and Lawrence Reynolds, are a step in the right direction. It is now clear that a thorough review must take place before the state decides whether to resume executions. Lethal injections are the most widespread method of execution in the US and, at a minimum, new safeguards are absolutely necessary to ensure that any executions are constitutionally sound.<br /> <br />The problems with capital punishment, including those in Ohio, are of concern not just to opponents of capital punishment. In 2005, the Constitution Project&#39;s bipartisan, blue-ribbon committee of death penalty supporters and opponents released <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/MandatoryJusticeRevisited.pdf">Mandatory Justice: the Death Penalty Revisited</a> [PDF file], an update to the 2001 ground-breaking report <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/MandatoryJustice.pdf">Mandatory Justice: Eighteen Reforms to the Death Penalty</a> [PDF file]. Both addressed the profound risk of wrongful convictions and executions created by the country&#39;s capital punishment system, and crafted consensus recommendations for a variety of urgently-needed reforms.

Moreover, in the twelve months since the EU last reviewed its sanctions policy toward Uzbekistan, Tashkent&#39;s rights record only deteriorated further.<br /><br />By dropping the sanctions under these circumstances, the EU failed to stay true to its own reform demands, leaving in the lurch the more than one dozen human rights activists whom the Uzbek government continues to imprison on politically motivated grounds, and severely undermining its own credibility as a principled promoter of human rights.<br /><br />The detrimental effects of this move on the cause of human rights in Uzbekistan and beyond should not be underestimated. It tells the Uzbek government, and repressive leaders around the world, that the EU is not serious when it urges rights reform, that defying the EU&#39;s reform demands carries no consequences because it will ultimately back down. It also tells victims of human rights abuse that they cannot count on the EU to stand up in their defense, even when they suffer repression solely because they had the courage to promote the very values the EU purports to stand for.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Geoffrey Lomax</strong> [Senior Officer for Medical Standards, <a href="http://www.cirm.ca.gov/">California Institute for Regenerate Medicine</a>]: &quot;CIRM welcomes Chief Judge Royce C. Lamberth&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/federal-judge-dismisses-stem-cell.php">dismissal</a> of <u>Sherely v. Sebelius</u>.   The <a href="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institute of Health</a> (NIH) Guidelines for Human Stem Cell Research represent sound public policy consistent with the approach adopted by CIRM, other states and the international community. The NIH Guidelines support autonomy by offering individuals with embryos leftover from in vitro fertilization an option other than disposal. <br /> <br />Given these embryos would otherwise be discarded, it difficult to understand how the plaintiffs are harmed by NIH policy. Further, the assertion that the policy harms &quot;adult&quot; stem cell researchers by creating competition for research funds is fallacious. The plaintiffs attempt to perpetuate a false dichotomy. CIRM&#39;s <a href="http://www.cirm.ca.gov/PressRelease_102809">Disease Team Awards</a>, recommended by an expert peer review panel, include funding of research involving therapies derived from both &quot;adult&quot; and &quot;embryonic&quot; stem cells.<br /> <br />Creating artificial distinctions and then imposing restrictions is truly harmful both to patients in need of cures and society as a whole.   The results of the Disease Team competition demonstrate how regenerative medicine requires an environment where researchers can draw on the all tools available to address human disease. Having patient-appropriate cells or cell-products - from either adult or embryonic sources - is the key to therapies and cures. The new Guidelines support this approach and enable NIH researchers to effectively pursue this mission in a responsible and ethical manner.&quot;<br />

		<title>Third Circuit favors free speech in striking down broad abortion clinic protest zones</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/whatwedo/Litigation/Expertise.aspx">David Cortman</a></strong> [Senior Legal Counsel, <a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/main/default.aspx">Alliance Defense Fund</a>]: &quot;Over the last several years, the government has increasingly restricted pro-life speech, particularly when it occurs on public sidewalks outside abortion clinics.  These restrictions are, at best, highly suspect under the First Amendment - and, at worst, completely unconstitutional.  And that was no less the case in the most <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/081819p.pdf">recent decision</a> [PDF file] from the 3rd Circuit in <u>Brown v. City of Pittsburgh</u> that <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/third-circuit-strikes-down-abortion.php">struck down</a> a very bad ordinance restricting free speech.<br /><br />Historically, the Supreme Court has gone out of its way to protect speech, especially when it occurs in a public forum, such as in a park or on a public sidewalk.  Even during the civil rights protests and labor union pickets of the past, the Court was always careful to carve out protected speech from unprotected conduct.  No more.               <br /><br />In what&#39;s commonly referred to in some circles as the &quot;abortion distortion,&quot; the courts have abandoned their zealous protection of speech and thrown out the proverbial baby with the bathwater.  Now, with the blessings of the courts, no longer are such regulations limited to prohibiting only unprotected conduct, they are prohibiting pure speech.  And on a public sidewalk, no less.<br /><br />Ignoring its own precedent, the Supreme Court, within the recent past, has upheld fixed buffer zones of varying distances which emanate from clinic entrances.  These zones generally prohibit pro-life advocates from speaking anywhere in the zone, usually because they are prohibited from even entering the area.  Interestingly, clinic workers are often exempt from those restrictions, either as written in the law (as was the case with Pittsburgh&#39;s <a href="http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/city_clerk/assets/ordinances/2005/05-Ord49.pdf">ordinance</a> [PDF file], which stated that no one was permitted to picket or demonstrate in the zone but then exempted clinic workers from this prohibition) or as a matter of practice.<br /><br />The Supreme Court has also upheld what is known as a floating bubble zone.  This restriction prohibits anyone (which, in practice, means pro-life advocates) from approaching any person closer than eight feet (hence, the floating bubble) for the purpose of leafleting or engaging in protest, education, or counseling (making it obvious where such &quot;neutral&quot; laws are aimed).  Even without any expertise or legal background, it is easy for any person to see that these laws are designed to prohibit speech, not unprotected forms of conduct.<br /><br />While arguing against Pittsburgh&#39;s defective ordinance on behalf of pro-life nurse Mary Kathryn Brown, I was asked by the 3rd Circuit judges how I would go about drafting such legislation.  I responded that it is rather simple, actually:  prohibit unprotected conduct (such as blocking, violence, and assaults) without regard to speech.  Such a solution honors the Constitution and protects speech while at the same time protects women from any bad behavior.  Everyone wins.<br /><br />With that background, let&#39;s look at what the 3rd Circuit in the end called &quot;unprecedented&quot; restrictions that the City of Pittsburgh enacted.  In an aggressive move to further push the envelope, the city, with advice and encouragement of attorneys supporting the abortion clinics, enacted a law that far surpassed any regulation that had ever before been upheld.  They combined both a fixed zone with a floating zone.  Considering that each zone either completely eliminates or severely hampers speech, speech hasn&#39;t got a chance when both are joined.<br /><br />Did you ever try to hand out leaflets from over eight feet away from someone whom you are not allowed to approach?  Not so simple.  Or try to have a caring conversation beyond eight feet away from a person walking down the sidewalk while avoiding people, trees, mailboxes, or being pushed into the bus lane due to the width of the sidewalks?  Kind of dangerous.<br /><br />The city ridiculed Mary Kathryn Brown for having no &quot;right&quot; to speak to someone in a caring way.  Well, at least they acknowledge she likes the compassionate approach.  After all, if you are reaching out to women in love to encourage them to save their child from abortion, it&#39;s a good idea to be compassionate.  Ironically, the law that the city touts as having the purpose of reducing an aggressive atmosphere actually serves to elevate it, as it encourages yelling and the use of amplification just to be heard.<br /><br />Pittsburgh&#39;s law, in the opinion of the Alliance Defense Fund, and as the 3rd Circuit agreed, went too far.  The court&#39;s opinion is extremely important as government bodies more frequently restrict protected speech on public sidewalks.  The opinion serves to draw a line in the sand that municipalities may not cross.<br /><br />Thankfully, there is a point where speech remains protected and, although not where it should be, it&#39;s a start to regaining free speech protections which the &quot;abortion distortion&quot; has served to chip away at the Constitution.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Mr. Cortman represented the plaintiff in <u>Brown v. City of Pittsburgh</u> before the US Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit</span>.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.azleg.gov/OMBUDSMAN/staff.asp"><strong>Elizabeth Hill</strong></a> [Arizona&#39;s Assistant <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/OMBUDSMAN/default.asp">Ombudsman</a>, Public Access]: &quot;Arizona is beginning to embrace the electronic world in which we conduct our public business.  On October 29, 2009, in <a href="http://www.supreme.state.az.us/opin/pdf2009/CV090036PR.pdf">Lake v. City of Phoenix</a> [PDF file], the Arizona Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/arizona-supreme-court-rules-electronic.php">held</a> that &quot;when a public entity maintains a public record in an electronic format, the electronic version of the record, including any embedded metadata is subject to disclosure under Arizona&#39;s public records law.&quot; Seems straightforward enough, right?  I am not so sure.  <br /><br />It is well-established that public records <a href="http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/41/01350.htm">include</a> electronic records created or received by a public entity in the course of conducting public business.  However, in Arizona, access to electronic records has remained a gray area.  Issues related to choice of format, inspection of electronic records, access to data contained in databases, redaction of electronic records, and fees for providing electronic copies of public records, simply have not been addressed by the Legislature or the courts.<br /><br />Conversely, during the past couple of decades, the federal government and a majority of states have addressed access to electronic records in one way or another.  In fact, upon request, the federal government and majority of states require that public entities furnish electronic records in the electronic format in which the record is maintained.  Like the recent Arizona Supreme Court Opinion, the Washington Court of Appeals specifically addressed metadata and held that metadata describing the history, tracking, and management associated with email sent by a private citizen to deputy mayor was a public record within scope of the public records act.  <u>O&#39;Neill v. City of Shoreline</u>.<br /><br />However, although Arizona&#39;s highest court tackled the issue of whether metadata embedded in an electronic document must be disclosed upon request, the opinion&#39;s simplicity raises some important questions.  In an apparent effort to dispel agency concern regarding harassment and burdensome requests the Court states, &quot;not every public records request will require disclosure of the native file.  Public entities may provide paper copies if the nature of the request precludes any need for the electronic version.&quot;  How will the public entity know, or otherwise determine, whether the nature of any given request precludes the need for the electronic version given the fact that persons requesting records for a non-commercial purpose are under no obligation to set forth the purpose for which copies of the records will be used?  The Court&#39;s determination is problematic and seems contrary to the presumption favoring disclosure.<br /><br />The Court also provides that &quot;[p]ublic records requests that are unduly burdensome or harassing can be addressed under existing law, which recognizes that disclosure may be refused based on concerns of privacy, confidentiality, or the best interests of the state.&quot;  Currently, however, the public record statutes do not address burdensome requests.  Is the Court suggesting that public entities have discretion to deny access to requests it deems burdensome or harassing under the guise that compliance is detrimental to the best interests of the public entity?  If so, what are the standards for denying access?  This is a matter best addressed by the Arizona Legislature. <br /><br />In addition, the Court&#39;s holding refers to public records maintained in an electronic format.  Some have asked whether this requires access to the record in the format it is ultimately maintained or the format in which it was created.  I believe it is the former.  The Court did not decide when, or if, a public entity is required to retain public records in an electronic format.  Indeed, electronic records may be converted to alternative formats so long as they are retained pursuant to the applicable retention and destruction schedule approved by Arizona State Library, Archives, and Public Records.  Accordingly, public records should be available for inspection and copying in the format in which the record exists at the time of the request.     <br /><br />Thus, although Arizona is finally entering the 21st Century and addressing access to electronic records, it has a long way to go.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/experts/index.cfm?fa=expert_view&expert_id=24"><strong>Marina Ottaway</strong></a> [Director, Middle East Program, <a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/">Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</a>]: &quot;The new election law <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/iraq-parliament-passes-controversial.php">approved</a> by the Iraqi parliament on November 8 has both positive and negative features. On the positive side, it will allow the voting to take place before the mandate of the present parliament expires and will thus prevent a constitutional crisis. The law has also avoided embedding confessionalism in the political system of Iraq, as other proposals under discussion would have done. On the negative side, however, the law does not address the substance of the problem of Kirkuk - the obstacle on which the legislation almost foundered - but simply postpones any discussion of it, creating a real possibility of post-election conflict. And the choice of a system of proportional representation with no minimum threshold for parliamentary representation and open lists is likely to contribute to the fragmentation of an already badly fragmented political spectrum - 296 parties and independent candidates have registered to participate in the elections.<br /><br />The main obstacle to the passage of a new election law was the determination of who has the right to vote in Kirkuk, a city where Arabs, Kurds and Turkmens claim to have been the majority until Saddam Hussein&#39;s machinations and subsequent conflicts changed the population balance. Kurds argue that Kurds who were expelled have the right to return and thus to vote in Kirkuk, and many in fact have moved into the city since 2003. Arabs and Turkmens believe that many of the newcomers have simply been relocated there by the Kurdish parties and the Kurdistan regional government in order to facilitate the eventual annexation of Kirkuk by Kurdistan. Against this background, the composition of voter lists in Kirkuk became a bone of contention. Kurds argued that the voter list should reflect the 2009 population, while Arab and Turkmens favored using the lists prepared in 2004, which they claim reflect the natural composition of the population, before Kurds artificially inflated their numbers. Failure to solve the problem prevented provincial council elections to be held in Kirkuk and the surrounding Tamim province in 2009. <br /><br />The compromise reached on November 8 is that voting will take place on the basis of 2009 lists, as Kurds demanded. As a concession to Arabs and Turkmens, however, in jurisdictions where population has increased by more than 5 percent a year since 2003, election results can be challenged and a process can be set up to verify that all those who voted had actually the right to do so - the law does not specify which criteria can be used to determine who had the right to vote where. It is clear that the potential for conflict after the elections is enormous. But while the law thus is quite problematic, simply postponing rather than solving the problem, it is less so than alternative solutions that were considered, including that of apportioning seats in Kirkuk among population groups, or of creating &quot;compensatory&quot; seats reserved for Arabs and Turkmens in order to make up for the increased migration of Kurds into the city. Such solutions would have embedded confessionalism in the Iraqi political system, creating precedent that would have been very difficult to overcome.<br /><br />The decision to adopt an open lists system - allowing voters to choose not only a party but also specific candidates within it - was  strongly encouraged as more democratic by the United States and international NGOs. When lists are closed, party bosses can decide which candidates in their party will probably be seated simply by placing them higher or lower on the list. If the list is open, voters&#39; choices can modify the order. Iraq parliamentary elections of December 2005 were based on closed lists, the provincial council elections of January 2009 on open lists. There is no denying that the open list system decreases the power of party bosses and increases that of voters. In Iraq today, however, the main problem is less the excessive power of party bosses, but the tendency of all organizations to splinter. The open lists system may further weaken the parties, further complicating what will certainly be a very complicated process of cabinet formation after the elections.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Stephan Kinsella</strong> [General Counsel for <a href="http://www.ao-inc.com/">Applied Optoelectronics</a> and Editor of <a href="http://www.libertarianpapers.org/">Libertarian Papers</a>]: &quot;A recent lawsuit filed by Nokia against Apple alleges that the iPhone infringes 10 of Nokia&#39;s patents. Nokia is probably &quot;seeking between $200 and $400 million in damages from Apple,&quot; which JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/nokia-sues-apple-alleging-iphone-patent.php">characterizes</a> as &quot;a relatively low amount to seek from a company that expects revenues...of over $11 billion this year.&quot; It doesn&#39;t seem trivial to me, given that $400 million is a good chunk - say, 5 to 10% or so - of Apple&#39;s profits. And Nokia&#39;s is <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20091022/1102066639.shtml">not the only</a> lawsuit Apple faces. Half a billion here, half a billion there, and pretty soon you&#39;re talking real money. For other examples, see <a href="http://www.againstmonopoly.org/index.php?perm=593056000000001689">here</a>.<br /><br />This case is a good example of the waste caused by the patent system. The common justification for IP is that it increases innovation and overal societal wealth (see my article &quot;<a href="http://mises.org/story/1763">There&#39;s No Such Thing as a Free Patent</a>&quot;). But study after study concludes otherwise (see my article &quot;<a href="http://mises.org/story/3682">The Case Against IP: A Concise Guide</a>,&quot; and my post &quot;<a href="http://blog.mises.org/archives/010217.asp">Yet Another Study Finds Patents Do Not Encourage Innovation</a>&quot;). Is this surprising? After all, the patent system undeniably imposes enormous <a href="http://blog.mises.org/archives/007223.asp">costs</a> on society  - companies spend millions of dollars on patent attorneys&#39; fees and salaries, patent filing fees, licensing fees, litigation fees, and so on.  Is the value of the extra innovation that patent law stimulates greater than all these costs? Nobody knows for sure, but the various studies almost universally conclude no. Some studies even conclude that the patent system decreases overall innovation, meaning that that we are paying a huge cost just to have innovation impeded. Thus, as <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20091022/1102066639.shtml">noted</a> by Mike Masnick, &quot;if you build anything even remotely innovative these days, you&#39;re going to get sued for patent infringement, probably multiple times. It&#39;s become a massive tax on innovation, rather than a lever for innovation.&quot;<br /><br />Many patent lawyers and IP advocates begrudgingly admit that the system is broken, or at least needs <a href="http://mises.org/story/3702">significant improvement</a>. As a senior partner in the patent department of a major national law firm <a href="http://blog.mises.org/archives/010739.asp">wrote</a> me:<blockquote>Stephan, Your letter responding to Joe Hosteny&#39;s comments on Patent Trolls nicely states what I came to realize several years ago, namely, it is unclear that the US Patent System, as currently implemented, necessarily benefits society as a whole. Certainly, it has benefited [Hosteny] and his [partners] and several of their prominent clients, and has put <a href="http://overlawyered.com/2005/01/marshall-texas-patent-central/">Marshall, Texas</a> on the map; but you really have to wonder if the &quot;tax&quot; placed on industry by the System (and its use of juries or lay judges to make the call on often highly complex technical issues that the parties&#39; technical experts cannot agree on) is really worth it. Of course, anyone can point to a few start-up companies that, arguably, owe their successes to their patent portfolios; but over the last 35 years, I have observed what would appear to be an ever increasing number of meritless patents, issued by an understaffed and talent-challenged PTO examining group, being used to extract tribute from whole industries. I have had this discussion with a number of clients, including Asian clients, who have been forced to accept our Patent System and the &quot;taxes&quot; it imposes on them as the cost of doing business in the USA.</blockquote>But I disagree that the patent system is broken, or malfunctioning at all. It benefits certain people and companies, as all taxes and regulations do. The beneficiaries of this government program defend it with various forms of propaganda. For example, they say that is a major cause of innovation and wealth - indeed, that it is necessary for innovation. But as noted above, there is no proof that patent systems generate net wealth. Another tactic is to call patent a property right - in particular an &quot;intellectual property right.&quot; But calling it a property right does not make it so. In fact, as I have argued extensively - from the perspective of someone who is both as a practicing patent attorney familiar with the system and a libertarian who is a strong advocate of private property rights - patent rights are not genuine property rights. Patents are artificial privileges granted by the state that actually undermine private property rights. A patent is a government grant that gives the patent holder the right to tell others how they can use their own property, by vetoing certain uses. They can use this veto right to extort ransom payments, politely called licensing royalties today.<br /><br />IP advocates often say that infringers &quot;steal&quot; ideas from the originators, to bolster their characterization of ideas and patterns as property. In fact, in the dispute at hand, as reported <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/oct2009/gb20091022_488948.htm">here</a>, &quot;Nokia said Apple has refused to pay for use of intellectual property developed by Nokia that lets handsets connect to third-generation, or 3G, wireless networks, as well as to wireless local area networks. &#39;Apple is attempting to get a free ride on the back of Nokia&#39;s innovation,&#39; Ilkka Rahnasto, Nokia vice-president for legal and intellectual property, said in the statement.&quot; In other words, Nokia is trying to make it look like Apple copied Nokia&#39;s patented inventions, so that it looks more like a thief. But in a patent infringement lawsuit, the patentee does not need to prove copying. In fact, the infringer could have independently invented the technology, totally unaware of the patentee&#39;s invention, and still be liable. While Nokia here implies Apple is getting a &quot;free ride&quot; by using IP &quot;developed by Nokia,&quot; you can bet that they will happily accept a win in court over Apple even if Apple is shown to have independently invented the technology.<br /><br />And what is wrong with copying, anyway? This is how society and technolgy advances: by emulation, by learning. The free market thrives on competition and cooperation, and also on emulation and imitation. Every stage of technology is built on the body of knowledge developed over the centuries. Emulation and the acquisition of knowledge play a key role - are <a href="http://blog.mises.org/archives/009248.asp">essential</a> to - society and economy. Nokia&#39;s own technology was not developed in vacuo. There is nothing wrong with imitation. It is part of the market. It is essential to progress. It is no more theft than learning is. In fact, IP can be a <a href="http://blog.mises.org/archives/010783.asp">barrier to learning</a>, and even lead to <a href="http://www.stephankinsella.com/2009/07/02/book-banning-courtesy-of-copyright-law/">censorship</a>.<br /><br />So, no, the patent system should not be reformed. It should be abolished, for the sake of freedom, private property rights and prosperity.<br /><br />For further elaboration of the ideas expressed in this post, see my monograph <a href="http://www.stephankinsella.com/publications/#againstip">Against Intellectual Property</a>, my article &quot;<a href="http://mises.org/story/3682">The Case Against IP: A Concise Guide</a>,&quot; and other material on my <a href="http://www.stephankinsella.com/publications/#IP">website</a>.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.niso.org/about/directory/staff"><strong>Todd Carpenter</strong></a> [Managing Director, <a href="http://www.niso.org">National Information Standards Organization</a>]: &quot;Last week, the Supreme Court of Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/arizona-supreme-court-rules-electronic.php">issued a ruling</a> overturning a lower court on whether file metadata must be turned over in a public records request.  The <a href="http://www.supreme.state.az.us/opin/pdf2009/CV090036PR.pdf">ruling</a> [PDF file] essentially binds the inherent file metadata within the file itself.  In its finding, the court ruled that the plaintiff&#39;s request for the administrative metadata records was indistinguishable from the request for the public records themselves.<br /><br />Courts and governments generally have two interests in the preservation of metadata.  The first relates to discovery and accessibility of information, the second is focused on provenance.  The creation and management of metadata facilitates easy discovery of documents for retrieval and access.  The second key value to the administrative metadata of a digital file is that it is one method for tracking the document&#39;s authenticity.<br /><br />At issue in this case is the provenance of the records, not their actual content.  In a print world, it can be relatively difficult to change a written date or otherwise forge a physical document.  In the digital realm, changes are more easily made. However in many situations, information about creation, changes and authorship may be stored within the document.   One could envision a future where, much like the wax stamps of the past, without the electronic seal of embedded administrative metadata a document may not be trusted at all. <br /><br />The court did not comment on the types of data that might be required or the types of files to be used, only that the original file, with all of its associated metadata, be provided to the plaintiff.  It would be a stretch by the court to know what types of files or even what types of metadata might be available in the future.  The precedent that the metadata is an inherent part of the information of a document is an important one for the use of digital information in court.<br /><br />As we move forward toward a world where documents are more often in a digital format than in print, we need to establish precedent for using the full range of digital information that can help to address the questions of provenance.  As noted in the <a href="http://www.supreme.state.az.us/opin/pdf2009/CV090036PR.pdf">ruling</a> [PDF file], &quot;It would be illogical...to conclude that public entities can withhold information embedded in an electronic document, such as the date of creation, while they would be required to produce the same information if it were written manually on a paper public record.&quot;  If we are to trust and rely on the digital information that is presented to us, particularly in a legal environment, the validity and provenance of that information needs to be grounded in as much valid information as we can gather.  The court correctly understood the ramifications of withholding access to this information.<br /><br />This is but one of many examples of how our understanding of records management needs to adjust to the rapidly evolving digital environment.  Standards are slowly emerging in this area, as is case law.  We can expect to see many more decisions like <u>Lake v. Phoenix</u> in the coming years.&quot;<br />

		<title>The Use of Force After the &#039;War on Terror&#039;: A Call for an Obama Doctrine</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Christian Henderson of <a href="http://www.brookes.ac.uk/">Oxford Brookes University</a> (UK) says that although President Obama has made reforms in a number of areas since taking office last November, he has yet to distinguish his administration&#39;s policies on the international use of force from those of the former administration....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/christianhenderson.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->T<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->here was little doubt that when President Obama took over in the White House he was going to offer some stark contrasts to his predecessor. These have been visible both in style and in substance. <br /><br />Firstly, there has been a widely recognized dramatic shift towards multilateralism by virtue of many diplomatic initiatives, including: a widely hailed speech in Egypt; a willingness to negotiate with Iran (despite the criticisms of many Republicans); a willingness to be tough with Israel; and the opening of certain barriers with Cuba. Could one imagine the previous incumbent being honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize for "his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples?" The now infamous "you are either with us or you are with the terrorists" proposition would suggest not.<br /><br />Furthermore, President Obama has commendably identified different priorities and policy initiatives than his predecessor. These can be seen in the closure of Guantanamo Bay; its critical position on the use of torture; concerns regarding climate change; the reversal of the missile defence programme; and negotiations on nuclear disarmament.<br /><br />However, a troubling aspect of Obama's first year in the Oval Office has been the confusion generated over his position on the permissible limits on the use of force. Indeed, in this respect it must be questioned whether things are really so very different than they were under his predecessor.<br /><br />The simplest way to discern a particular administration's position on the use of force is by taking a look at its National Security Strategy. This document outlines the major national security concerns perceived by the administration and how it plans to deal with them. The 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act requires the publication of this document by June 15 of a new administration, a deadline which President Obama has failed to meet. However, he is not alone here; no administration has ever met this deadline.<br /><br />Consequently, and given the fact that he is not expected to produce one this year, we are left to analyze other sources to try and garner the position of the President on this issue.<br /><br />Perhaps the most direct indication we have on Obama's policy regarding the use of force is his response to a survey conducted by the American Society of International Law in which several questions were posed to the Presidential candidates in the run-up to the elections in 2008. Rather on point, one of the questions posed was 'What views do you have regarding any legal constraints on US use of force?'<br /><br />In answering this question much of what Barack Obama said may equally as well have come from the mouth of George W. Bush:<br /><br />'The U.S. has today and has always had the right to take unilateral military action, including the pre-emptive use of force, to eliminate imminent threats to our country and security. No nation or organization has a veto over our right of self-defense - and none ever will. In fact, Article 51 of the U.N. Charter recognizes this right of self-defense for every nation.'<br /><br />Furthermore, whilst Obama went on to recall "the so-called Bush doctrine" and noted that "[t]he preventive use of force - in anticipation of potential threats that may not be imminent - is a different matter," he also, and rather confusingly, was clear that "[s]ometimes, the preventive use of force may be necessary." This was hardly a resounding rejection of the Bush doctrine. <br /><br />Given a somewhat veiled criticism of preventive force but then making clear that it would be resorted to when "necessary," it could be questioned whether this was the beginnings of an Obama doctrine of "necessary force?"<br /> <br />To date, there is nothing to suggest that Obama has shifted from this position since taking up residence in the White House. Indeed, whilst not offering anything more on his position, the President chose to classify the war in Afghanistan as a "war of necessity." Whilst this was arguably not intended as a legal characterization, it does open questions as to where this fits within the international legal regulation of the use of force, and to whether President Obama has given this any thought.<br /><br />Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether force will be "necessary" if, for example, Iran continues to antagonize and provide confusion as to the ambitions of its nuclear program. And if the US does decide that force is "necessary," will it undertake such action with the other states that have shown concern over the issue, or will it be restrained if these other countries disagree with it? Whilst his administration's overtures to multilateralism in other areas have been commendable, Obama was clear in the ASIL survey that "when we do use force in situations other than self-defense, we should make every <em>effort</em> to garner the clear support and participation of others." (emphasis added) Clearly, he has not ruled out going it alone. <br /><br />Additionally, the experience of Iraq has clearly not deterred unilateral assessments of evidence. "The experience of Iraq underscores that often perceived threats are not as real as they may seem, and our intelligence may be imperfect. But, when our intelligence is good and defensible we should not rule out the use of force."<br /><br />Given these mixed signals and the confusion they've provoked, a call is made to President Obama to develop a clear and principled approach to the use of force taking full consideration of the limits imposed by international law. This should come as soon as possible, preferably in the form of the National Security Strategy. Indeed, if what has been set out above are the early signs of an Obama doctrine emerging, more needs to be provided to set out the boundaries of this as, as it stands, it is no more acceptable than the Bush doctrine of pre-emption.<br /><br />Under Bush, for better or for worse, we knew where he stood. Obama must now do the same.<br /><br /><em>Dr. Christian Henderson is a Lecturer in Law within the Department of Law at Oxford Brookes University, United Kingdom.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/Friedman.cfm">Lawrence Friedman</a> and <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a> of New England School of Law say that while there are risks associated with trying Guantanamo detainees suspected of terrorism in civilian courts in the United States, those risks can and should be managed in the interest of justice....<br /><hr size=1> <br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/lawrencefriedmannew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/forumy/victorhansennew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>E</strong></font>ven before President Obama announced that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four other terrorist suspects currently being detained at Guantanamo would be prosecuted in federal court in New York City, the administration suffered fierce criticism for proposing that these prosecutions should be conducted in Article III courts&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;civilian courts&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;in the United States. <br /><br />In an op-ed he recently wrote for the <em>National Law Journal</em>, Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) outlined several reasons why, in his view, we should not consider trying terrorist suspects on our soil.  He argued that such trials might result in the disclosure of sensitive information and that there will be logistical issues with securing the courthouse.  He also voiced concern over, in his words, "the additional legal rights terrorists will receive if they are brought here."   <br /><br />None of these reasons for declining to try terrorist suspects in Article III courts withstands close scrutiny.  <br /><br />First, as we have argued <a href="/forumy/2009/08/civilians-can-keep-secrets-too-trying.php">elsewhere</a>, the notion that a civilian trial means that sensitive information will be at risk of disclosure is chimerical.  Federal judges have many tools available to them that can be used to ensure that no sensitive information is disclosed during the course of these prosecutions beyond what is necessary for the lawyers to do their jobs.  The judges of the federal district court in Washington D.C., have proved themselves quite capable of protecting sensitive information in <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> proceedings brought by terrorist detainees.  It is not clear why their counterparts in New York could not do the same. <br /><br />Second, the logistical aspects of securing courtrooms and protecting all individuals who may be involved in these trials do not present insurmountable problems.  There already exists a high level of security in all federal courthouses. We can enhance that security knowing these courthouses might become even more attractive targets. We can close streets, deny access to unaffiliated personnel, cordon off air traffic, and so on.  Though burdensome, none of these steps are impossible, and&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;equally importantly&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;none necessarily entails closing the proceedings to members of the press, who in a very real sense will be representing all of us as witnesses to the administration of justice in respect to these defendants. <br /><br />Third, there is the fear that these terrorist suspects will receive additional legal protections.  This is a curious argument.  Its validity depends upon acceptance of the premise that, as a matter of course, they should receive fewer legal protections.  That premise is faulty: it suggests that because of their legal status these individuals are different from ordinary criminal defendants. Apart from what they have been charged with, however, they are not.  The premise assumes guilt when in fact that is what the government must prove.   <br /><br />Further, if the prosecution of these defendants in civilian court presents evidentiary problems because proof of their crimes was obtained through torture and other coercive techniques, then the question of guilt necessarily becomes more complicated. To put it bluntly, these detainees were deemed enemy combatants. They have not been proved in any judicial proceeding to be terrorists.  However much we believe in our good hearts and with good reason that they are terrorists, the whole point of our criminal justice system is to provide an opportunity for an objective determination of that fact.  That determination is what makes the verdict lawful and just. <br /><br />Senator McConnell also maintains that there is the risk that if the government cannot prove its case&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;because, for example, the evidence has been tainted&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;these defendants will be released into the United States.  This is a remote possibility.  This term the U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing a case, <em>Kiyemba v. Obama</em>, in which the district court, later overturned by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, ordered the release of a group of Uighers from Guantanamo into the United States.  Even if the Supreme Court overturns the Appeals Court and affirms the authority of district court judges to effect this kind of release, Congress has the authority to enact rules to regulate that power.  Indeed, Congress likely has the authority to create a system of civil confinement for individuals who cannot be repatriated or released into the United States.  It may be that, despite President Obama's wishes, the nation will not soon be abandoning the confinement of individuals at Guantanamo. <br /><br />We are not suggesting that there is no risk associated with trying Guantanamo detainees in civilian courts.  We are simply saying that those risks can be managed.  And, more importantly, those risks should be managed.  To determine the guilt or innocence of these individuals in civilian courts makes a powerful statement about just how seriously the United States takes the Rule of Law.  These trials may be another testament to why, at the end of the day, the terrorists will never win.  <br /><br /><em>Lawrence Friedman teaches constitutional law and state constitutional law and Victor Hansen teaches criminal law and criminal procedure at New England School of Law.   Their book, </em><a href="http://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=637&calcTitle=1&title_id=10328&edition_id=11780&lang=cy">The Case for Congress: Separation of Powers and the War on Terror</a><em>, was recently published by Ashgate.</em><br />

		<title>Kirkuk: The Danger of Delay</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/researchpost.php?postid=427">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that a comprehensive solution to the status of Kirkuk must be reached soon lest it become for Iraq the type of intractable and fundamentally corrosive problem slavery had become for the United States by 1861.... <br /><hr size=1>  <br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hamoudi.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><strong>A</strong></font>s is commonly reported, when faced with the intractable problem of slavery while drafting the Constitution, the Founding Fathers were not able to come up with a solution that would please both the North and the South.  So they submitted to the most natural of human impulses, that of procrastination, and punted the question so that it could be dealt with at a later time.   Yet the longer the problem of slavery was permitted to fester, the more difficult it became to address and soon the question began to subsume all others, paralyzing legislative work in areas only remotely related to it.  <br /><br />While I don't profess to be an expert in American history, by most accounts there was no reason that Kansas' status as a free or slave should ever have been contested; it was not suitable for the type of agriculture upon which the southern states were built and where slavery thrived, and eventually this became rather clear.  But, it seems, the slavery question had been allowed to fester for so long, feelings had become so strong, that something approaching an intrastate civil war erupted over this in Kansas before it was resolved.  A similar situation exists now with Kirkuk.<br /><br />Almost since the day that Saddam's Ba'ath regime fell, the question of what to do about Kirkuk has remained unanswered.  The Kurdish authorities in Iraq's north claim (correctly) that Saddam Hussein engaged in a process of forced Arabization of this historically multiethnic city.  They therefore call for this process to be reversed, for the population to revert back to what it was in 1957, and then for a referendum to be held in Kirkuk to determine whether or not its population would choose to join the Kurdish autonomous zone in northern Iraq, a referendum that the Kurds would almost certainly win if held on that basis.  The extent of Kurdish influence in the Iraq constitution is apparent by the fact that there is an Article in the Constitution, Article 140, that calls for the implementation of the Kurdish solution.<br /><br />Naturally, this notion of turning back the clock, and reversing decades of population change, has not sat well with those who would have to be forcibly removed in order to realize it, mainly the Arab and Turkoman populations.  They have resisted the implementation of Article 140 largely successfully, to Kurdish dismay.  What has resulted has been something of a de facto "Kurdization" of Kirkuk, with tens of thousands of Kurds returning to Kirkuk over the past half decade, but with no substantive implementation of Article 140.  The question of Kirkuk has arisen several times, most notably in the provincial elections last year, but for the most part the problem has been met with procrastination rather than decision making on what to do about it by forming committees to study an issue or by delaying an election pending further developments and the like.  <br /><br />In the meantime, to say the least, views have hardened to the extent that the issue of Kirkuk is threatening to delay crucial national elections.  The Arab and Turkoman populations of Kirkuk, supported by mostly Sunni nationalist forces in the Council of Representatives, have argued that the forced Kurdization cannot be permitted to stand, and the Kurds who have moved to Kirkuk since 2004 should not be allowed to vote there, but should instead vote in the province from which they came.  The Kurds will accept nothing less than a vote in Kirkuk that is no different from the vote in any other province in the country, on the basis of the 2009 voter registry.  Attempts to delay the issue one more time, whether via another commission or multiple polling districts- some for voters registered since 2004, others for voters registered thereafter, have not proven fruitful.  The Council of Representatives has already missed its self imposed deadline for an election law by more than two weeks, and the United Nations is indicating that if no law is passed soon, the election cannot be held on time.<br /><br />Much like Kansas, the issue of the national elections is only tangentially related to the fate of the city.  The voter rolls for this election have nothing to do with the voter rolls for any future referendum on the city's joining the Kurdish region, and various draft laws have made that amply clear.  Equally importantly, the Kurdish faction in the Council of Representatives is a reflection of the Kurdish population, and it tends to vote uniformly on national issues.  So if Kurds left the Kurdish city of Suleymania for the contested city of Kirkuk in 2007, for example, that merely reduced the number of Kurdish representatives in one place and added them in another.  It barely affects the actual workings of the Council of Representatives because of the highly ethnic and sectarian stratified matter in which the Council operates (i.e. Kurdish representatives from Suleymania do not vote differently from Kurdish representatives from Kirkuk when they are in Baghdad).  <br /><br />Yet compromises have become difficult, because all sides to this dispute have become frustrated with the procrastination.  The Kurds are frustrated by the national refusal to implement Article 140 of the Constitution, the nationalist Arabs and the Turkomen, have become frustrated by clear recent population shifts in favor of Kurds which they claim have been achieved by force.  All sides seem to have made this into a litmus test of sorts, and none are willing to compromise, or, more importantly, to procrastinate further. <br /><br />This is not to say the will to impose one more delay on Kirkuk's fate will not be found.  With the United States, the United Nations, Iraq's clerical authorities, and the broader Iraqi population all clamoring for some sort of solution to break the impasse, it may well be that all sides will find something to reach an agreement on, a Missouri compromise of sorts, that delays the issue one more time.  Even if this is the case, however, it has become abundantly clear that time is running short.  A solution, a comprehensive one, must be reached, and compromises must be made soon, or Kirkuk may become to Iraq what slavery became to the United States in 1861.<br /><br /><em>Haider Ala Hamoudi is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.law.emory.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/laurie-blank.html">Laurie Blank</a> of Emory Law&#39;s International Humanitarian Law Clinic and <a href="http://www.law.und.nodak.edu/LawFaculty/Profile/gordon.php">Gregory Gordon</a> of the University of North Dakota School of Law say that the most glaring failure of the controversial Goldstone Commission Report on the Gaza conflict has gone unnoticed....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/laurieblank.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/forumy/gregorygordon.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Goldstone Commission Report on the January 2009 Israel-Palestinian conflict in Gaza &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; which comes before the United Nations today, November 4, 2009 &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; has been accused of failure on various levels.  Many commentators argue that the Report fails the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  Some say it reflects a failure to understand the deeper historical realities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Still others say it fails the originally conceived purpose of the United Nations Human Rights Council and fails the search for objective truth.  Its most glaring failure, though, has gone unnoticed.  The Report fails the law.<br /><br />It does so by striking out in applying the law in three key areas.  Strike One: the Report incorrectly claims Israel disproportionately attacked civilians.  Strike Two: the Report unjustly accuses Israel of a disproportionate response to Hamas&#39;s attacks.  Strike Three: the Report treats Israel and Hamas disproportionately by holding them to different standards.<br /><br /><strong>Strike One</strong>  <br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Jus in bello</span> is the law governing conduct during war.  One of its key principles is proportionality, which requires military personnel to take precautions in targeting the enemy to ensure that the expected civilian losses are not excessive compared to the anticipated military advantage.  The commander&#39;s perspective at the time of the attack is the central focus.  The law assesses whether his actions were reasonable given the information he had access to, taking into account the &quot;fog of war.&quot;  Proportionality is not measured after the fact by looking at actual civilian casualties or actual military advantages.  If it were, no military could ever engage in any operations.<br /><br />The Report turns proportionality&#39;s bedrock premise on its head.  It relies substantively on information gathered after the fact and discounts contemporaneous Israeli intentions or actions and the surrounding circumstances.  The Report also undermines its own legitimacy by automatically verifying one side&#39;s statements and impugning the other&#39;s.  Israel&#39;s real-time information consists of mere &quot;allegations,&quot; but retrospective information collected months later in Gaza consists of definitive &quot;statements.&quot;  Israel admittedly did not cooperate (given the commission&#39;s biased conception), but that cannot justify reliance on the wrong information.<br /><br /><strong>Strike Two</strong>  <br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Jus ad bellum</span> is the law governing decisions to go to war.  Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter forbids the use of force without Security Council enforcement (Article 2(7)).  One exception: Article 51 preserves the right to use force in self-defense. <span style="font-style:italic;">Jus ad bellum</span> mandates that any act in self-defense constitute a proportionate response, meaning a necessary and reasonable means to counter the attack and eliminate future threats.<br /><br />The Report confuses <span style="font-style:italic;">jus in bello</span> proportionality (as explained above) with this <span style="font-style:italic;">jus ad bellum</span> requirement of a proportionate response.  Israel acted legitimately in self-defense to destroy Hamas&#39;s tunnels and rocket launchers.  Hamas indiscriminately fired thousands of rockets at Israeli civilians for eight years.  And yet, the Report does not even mention Article 51.  More egregiously, it uses the incorrect assessment that particular Israeli attacks violated <span style="font-style:italic;">jus in bello</span> proportionality to unfairly package Operation Cast Lead as disproportionate overall, a clear misapplication of <span style="font-style:italic;">jus in bello</span> principles in a <span style="font-style:italic;">jus ad bellum</span> framework.<br /><br /><strong>Strike Three</strong>  <br /><br />The Report&#39;s (unfounded) legal conclusions disproportionately hold Israel and Hamas to different standards.  It states unequivocally (but without factual substantiation) that Israeli forces committed grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, such as willful killing and torture.<br /><br />Article 85 of Additional Protocol I states that &quot;making the civilian population or individual civilians the object of attack&quot; and launching indiscriminate attacks&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the very crimes Hamas committed, according to the Report&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;are indeed grave breaches.  But the Report never considers that Palestinian armed groups committed grave breaches.  Accusing Israel of &quot;grave breaches&quot; while failing to similarly identify Hamas&#39; violations exposes the commission&#39;s bias to the core.<br /><br />This uneven treatment pervades the entire report.  For example, Hamas and Israel both had obligations to protect civilians in Gaza.  The Report&#39;s single-minded focus on Israel, however, leads to absurd statements regarding Hamas&#39;s breach of those obligations when it used civilian buildings as command centers, munitions storage and rocket launch sites.  While quick to condemn Israel flat out for violations, the Report merely suggests that Hamas&#39;s actions &quot;would constitute&quot; legal violations.<br /><br />Reading the Report in an uncritical vacuum suggests that Israel abrogated its obligations under the laws of war.  In reality, the main failure lies in the Report itself.  The Report fails the law.  Why does this matter?  Because in maintaining a delicate balance between destruction of enemy capabilities and protection of innocent civilians, the law reinforces our basic dignity and humanity in the face of the horrors of war.  We cannot afford to abandon it.<br /><br /><br /><em>Laurie R. Blank is the Acting Director of Emory Law&#39;s International Humanitarian Law Clinic. Gregory S.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Lt. Col. Stephen Abraham (US Army, ret.), formerly assigned to the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants and the first officer to publicly criticize the Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo, says the US Senate has acted appropriately in rejecting an appropriations amendment offered by Senator Lindsey Graham that would have effectively stopped domestic trials for Guantanamo detainees by prohibiting the Justice Department from using federal funds to prosecute them in federal courts...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/stephenabraham.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>Y</strong></font>esterday, the Senate, while considering the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010, voted to reject an amendment by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) that would prohibit the Justice Department from using federal funds to prosecute any alleged planners or conspirators in the September 11, 2001 attacks in the federal courts. Senators should be congratulated on taking the right course and recognizing that the federal courts are the right forum for trying these individuals.<br /><br />What's most troubling about this effort from Senator Graham is that it elevates an act of terrorism, which is innately a criminal act, to an act of war. We should not be so quick to do so, giving traction to the perpetrator&#39;s claim of legitimacy. These individuals are nothing more than suspected criminals and we need to treat them as such. If convicted, they should be put in the same prisons in which we place others who have committed offenses against our people and our laws.<br /><br />Furthermore, resorting to military commissions - the alternative Senator Graham appears to support - is not appropriate. Although recently amended, the military commissions have not been meaningfully reformed. This is certainly the case if the government is not prepared to see its process, results, and actions tested at every instance by an independent judiciary. The military commissions do not uphold the principles of liberty that our Constitution serves - not as a source but as a testament. As Justice Jackson (serving as chief prosecutor during the Nuremburg trials) said, "the world yields no respect to courts that are merely organized to convict."<br /><br />This is all part of a larger debate concerning how to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility properly. This led me to join over 125 Americans, including former members of Congress, diplomats, judges and prosecutors, retired military and government officials, foreign and national security experts, and bar leaders in putting forth <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/manage/file/347.pdf">Beyond Guantanamo: A Bipartisan Declaration</a>. The Declaration advocates for the use of federal courts to try suspected terrorists and an end to the policy of indefinite detention without charge. Our chorus of voices could not have come at a more crucial moment.<br /><br />The amendment proposed by Senator Graham demonstrates that the very nature of the balance of power that guards against unwarranted, capricious, and arbitrary abrogation of fundamental human rights, including liberty, may be decided in the context of transient executive priorities and in an environment of fear. This argument unfortunately assumes that the rights we hold dear are anything but inalienable.  It is an argument that cannot be allowed to succeed.<br /><br /><br /><em>Stephen Abraham, Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.), was the first officer to publicly criticize the Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo, filing an affidavit before the Supreme Court in Boumediene v. Bush. He served with the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants in 2004 and 2005 and was in the United States Army Reserve as a military intelligence officer for more than 22 years. The Declaration, </em>Beyond Guantanamo<em>, was coordinated by the Constitution Project and Human Rights First.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.aspx?fac=152">David Crane</a> of Syracuse College of Law and Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.wustl.edu/Faculty/index.asp?id=390">Leila Sadat</a> of the Washington University in St. Louis School of Law say that after the failure of American legislative and diplomatic initiatives opposing the International Criminal Court, the time has come for the US to support and cooperate with the ICC...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidcranenew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/forumy/leilasadatnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>F</strong></font>or the past ten months, in a modest courtroom in The Hague, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has been conducting its first trial.  The accused, Thomas Lubanga, is charged with forcing children to fight as soldiers in the simmering wars that have consumed central Africa in recent years.  Although these crimes are all too common, it is remarkably uncommon for a warlord like Lubanga to be facing justice.  This trial, therefore, represents a singular triumph for the international justice system and for the ICC, the world's first permanent court created to try persons accused of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  <br /><br />The ICC's progress from a start-up international court in 2002 to a fully functioning court today, conducting four wide-ranging investigations of atrocities in African countries that would otherwise escape scrutiny, might seem like something that the US would naturally support.  After all, this country was founded on the rule of law, and the US has played a central role in the creation of every international court from Nuremberg through the <em>ad hoc</em> tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone.   Opinion polls, moreover, have consistently shown that a clear majority of Americans support the ICC.<br /><br />Since the ICC's creation, however, US policy toward the ICC has been driven by hysteria and misinformation.  Wild-eyed opponents of the Court predicted that the ICC would be an anti-American monster, and before the Court ever had a chance to do anything, Congress enacted anti-ICC legislation and the Bush administration launched a global diplomatic campaign against the ICC.  During President Bush's second term, when it became apparent that the ICC was a responsible judicial institution, some of the more heated anti-ICC rhetoric faded away, and US policy gradually evolved in the direction of less overt hostility and even quiet cooperation at times, although the anti-ICC policy remained unchanged throughout.  <br /><br />Since President Obama took office, there has been no formal change in policy as of yet, thus the US remains on the outside looking in.  There are, however, signs of a thaw.  Secretary of State Clinton said on her recent trip to Africa that it was her "great regret" that the US was not an ICC member.  And in March 2009, following the ICC's arrest warrant for Sudan's President, the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Susan E. Rice, stated that "[t]he United States supports the International Criminal Court's actions to hold accountable those responsible for the heinous crimes in Darfur"<br /><br />The time has come for the US to support and cooperate with the ICC.  The legislative and diplomatic initiatives against the ICC have failed and have only served to isolate the US, as more and more countries join the ICC (the Czech Republic recently became the 110th member of the ICC).  There is added urgency for US participation due to the ICC Review Conference to be held next year in Uganda.  This meeting's purpose is to take stock in the progress of the court, and evaluate mechanisms to help the Court function more efficiently.  A major agenda item is settling on a workable definition of the crime of aggression, whether the ICC should exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression particularly what will trigger that jurisdiction over this inherently political crime.  <br /><br />US membership in the ICC is a long-term goal of many of us in the United States, but we recognize that ratification of the Rome Statute is highly unlikely for the foreseeable future.   The time is right, though, for a new ICC policy embracing the following elements:<br /><br />First, no more empty chairs: taking part in ICC meetings should be an obvious step.  The US may participate as a nonvoting observer in the intergovernmental meetings of the ICC.  Other countries that have not ratified the Rome Statute, such as Russia and Israel, attend and participate.<br /> <br />Second, the US should continue to support the ICC's investigations and operations by sharing intelligence and providing resources.  The US has repeatedly called upon other countries to provide support for the ICC's Darfur investigations and prosecutions.  <br /><br />Finally, engaging with the ICC will require the US to repeal or amend the harmful anti-ICC legislation that remains on the books.  Appropriate legislation should begin as soon as an ICC policy is in place. <br /><br />Americans are justly proud of this country's commitment to the rule of law and to basic principles of justice.  The past several years has brought that commitment into question by the world community. We must reclaim this heritage by rejecting the anti-ICC policies of recent years and embracing a new spirit of cooperation and support for this new and exciting institution.  The principles the US helped draft at Nuremberg demand it.<br /><br />The Section for International Law of the American Bar Association (ABA) and the ABA writ large have both been long term advocates of better support to the ICC.  The Section for International Law has formed a blue-ribbon task force to assist the Assembly of States Parties and the new US administration in developing a dialog as the ASP begins to prepare for the Plenary Session in Kampala, Uganda in the late spring of 2010.  The goal of this task force is to ensure that the US has an ability to work with the ASP on the key issues that the Plenary Session will consider next year and to develop mechanisms for communication, building mutual trust and respect.  As members of that task force our hope is to see an engaged American diplomat sitting at the table in Kampala.  The time is right to move forward together in seeking justice around the world for victims of atrocity.<br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

		<title>COSTA RICA: Illegitimate Restrictions on Freedom of Expression</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ekaterina Sivolobova, student at the Law Faculty of the University of Buenos Aires and legal intern at the Center for Justice and International Law in Buenos Aires, recently interviewed Costa Rican journalist Mauricio Herrera-Ulloa about his experiences appearing before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/HERRERA-702637.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/HERRERA-701248.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Freedom of expression is a fundamental right of all people, regardless of their socioeconomic class, ethnicity, nationality, gender, age, or beliefs. This right is of a truly universal nature. The importance of freedom of expression, including the right to information, is an essential characteristic of democracy and a tool to protect other human rights.<br /><br />Yet the right to freedom of expression is not absolute, and in certain cases, it is restricted.  One of these restrictions can be found in Article 13.2 of the American Convention of Human Rights (CADH), which defines the requirements needed to determine the legitimacy of a limitation to the right of individual freedom of expression.  To further determine the legitimacy of such limitations, the Inter-American Court (IAC) issued Advisory Opinion OC-5/83, in which the Court held that it is the duty of all states to respect and guarantee that any such limitations of this fundamental right comply with international instruments, are provided by law, are enacted to purse a legitimate goal and are necessary to secure that legitimate goal. Such limitations of the right to freedom of expression are usually accompanied by some form of punishment or sanction, and the IAC also held that any punishment for a violation of such limitation or restriction must be compatible with the preservation and development of democratic states as noted in Article 32 of the CADH.<br /><br />In Costa Rica, criminal defamation laws are used to penalize libel (defined as a false published statement), and slander (defined as a spoken false statement), in an attempt to reverse the perceived damage done to the victim&#39;s reputation, honor and prestige.  Penalties for conviction can include registration of the offender in the Judicial Registry of Criminal Offenders, a fine or a prison sentence up to three years.  The use of these punitive measures to protect the reputation of others cannot be justified as necessary or adequate.<br /><br />Mauricio Herrera Ulloa is a Costa Rican journalist, and a former member of the investigative unit of the newspaper <em>La Nacion</em>. He gained national recognition for his role in the reporting of political corruption cases that led to the arrest and charging of two former Costa Rican presidents in 2004. In 1998, Felix Przedborski, Costa Rica&#39;s former Honorary Ambassador to the Atomic Energy Commission, brought a criminal complaint against him in a Costa Rican court. Przedborksi based his complaint on seven articles Herrera wrote reporting on concerns posed by four reputable European publications concerning Przedborski&#39;s involvement in certain illegal activities.  Herrera&#39;s articles, &quot;Felix Przedborski: van gangster tot diplomat&quot; and &quot;L &eacute;trange monsieur,&quot; were published in <em>De Morgen</em> and <em>Le Soir Illistre</em>, respectively, and were based on investigations by the Belgian <em>Financieel-Ekonomische Tijd</em> (FET) and by <em>La Libre Belgique</em>.  The original reporting concerned Przedborksi&#39;s alleged involvement with Leon Deferm, who was closely linked to the alleged payment of secret commissions for the sale of Italian military helicopters to Belgium.<br /><br />In November 1999 a Costa Rican criminal court convicted Herrera of defamation. Herrera was sentenced to pay a fine equivalent to 120 days of his wages, his sentence was published in the newspaper <em>La Nacion</em>, and his name was added into the Judicial Registry of Criminal Offenders. This inclusion in the Registry prevents that person from, among other things, obtaining a driver&#39;s license, receiving a pension, adopting a minor child, and restricts the individual&#39;s ability to work both in Costa Rica and overseas. This disproportional sentence threatened not only Herrera&#39;s credibility, reputation and career as a respectable journalist, but also the freedom of all Costa Ricans to speak openly about politicians and government officials who hold positions of public trust.  <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/IACHR-755951.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 265px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/IACHR-755947.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Herrera appealed the Costa Rican court&#39;s ruling and sentence to the Inter-American Court and Commission of Human Rights.  On July 2, 2004, the Court concluded that Costa Rica had violated the CADH Article 13, concerning the freedom of thought and expression, by imposing unnecessary and disproportional sanctions in an attempt to protect individual dignity and reputation.  The Court voided Herrera&#39;s sentence and ordered the removal of his name from the Registry of Criminal Offenders. The Court also ordered Costa Rica to reform its national legal system according to the standards established by CADH Article 8.2.h, and to pay Herrera US$20,000 in reparations.  Costa Rica has so far complied with all of the Court&#39;s orders, except for the overhaul of its national court system.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Mauricio-at-ICHR-<br />717882.jpg&quot;&gt;<img style="float:right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 213px; height: 320px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Mauricio-at-ICHR-717873.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>This past August, I had the opportunity to interview Herrera. During the interview, at an outdoor Argentinean cafe by the Rio de la Plata River, he said that the most difficult part of the 1999 Costa Rican trial was not the fact that his right to freedom of expression was being suppressed. More importantly, his actions were investigated and penalized under criminal laws discouraging people from voicing their opinions and limiting the ability of the free press to inform Costa Ricans on matters of public importance. Herrera added that he believed that his case before the Inter-American Court was an important step in the promotion of the freedom of expression among Costa Ricans.  He also shared his frustrations during the trial, insights on his experience as a victim before the Inter-American Court, and his hopes for the abolition of criminal defamation laws in the Americas.<br /><br />Herrera argued that the Costa Rican law under which he was convicted breaches the right to freedom of expression.  According to Herrera, since such laws have no place in a democratic state, they violate the requirements of necessity, which is the need to satisfy a &quot;public interest.&quot; He also explained how the law violates the requirements of proportionality because the law limits the right to freedom of expression &quot;more than strictly necessary&quot; and indirectly restricts the right to freedom of expression. The use of criminal defamation laws to punish journalists, especially when they are engaged in sharing information on the actions of government officials, undermines their right to freedom of expression and the public&#39;s right to know.  It is fundamental that a democratic state allow its people to live in a society where information flows freely, a situation contingent upon open debate about public interest matters. Without this freedom, democracy would deteriorate and become a mere formality. <br /><br />The Inter-American Court stated, in Herrera&#39;s case, that criminal sanc
tions must be proportional to the law&#39;s objective, and should not limit the particular right involved in the law any more than necessary. According to Herrera, the application of criminal sanctions in a democratic state constitutes the harshest and worst possible option to investigate, adjudicate and punish conduct of any kind. There are other less intrusive and more proportional means of protection for the reputation of others. <br /><br />Herrera also addressed the public policy concerns inherent in the fight against criminal defamation laws.  Such laws, he reflected, deter journalists and citizens from contributing to public discussion of issues affecting the life of society and the community.  By their very nature, these laws create a dissuasive, frightening and inhibiting environment in which the right to freedom of thought, opinion and expression are restricted by the state.  Journalists especially need this right to carry out their professional journalistic duties -the fundamental and irreplaceable tool needed to inform society and contribute to the &quot;development of every man.&quot;<br /><br />At the end of our discussion, I asked Herrera, &quot;After what you have been through, and knowing what you know now, would you do it again?&quot; Without hesitation, he replied &quot;Yes, it is a matter of your ethical and professional duty, it is part of your work to inform the public, it is part of my obligations.&quot; He added, &quot;Besides this experience has made me a better journalist.&quot;<br /><br />Although the Inter-American Court&#39;s ruling in <u>Herrera Ulloa vs. Costa Rica</u> has been a small stepping stone towards the further protection of the rights of freedom of thought, opinion and expression in the Americas, there still remains a long way to go.  Many countries throughout the world still have criminal defamation laws, and the abuse of those laws is prevalent.  In the Americas alone, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti, Uruguay and Venezuela are among the countries that still enforce criminal defamation laws.  In a positive step towards the protection of the freedoms of thought, opinion, and expression last September, Argentinean President Cristina Kirchner presented Congress with a bill that would decriminalize libel and slander. <br /><br />Criminalization of libel and slander to control the right to freedom of expression requires the state to closely watch over and restrain society.  These laws do not represent a true characteristic of democratic states and should be abolished.  In their place, balanced civil defamation laws should be enacted to ensure that citizens are free to express themselves and have their voices heard. There is no legitimate justification for a society to live in fear and not be sufficiently informed, since a society that is not well informed is not a society that is truly free.<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt" size="2">Mentioned in the article:<br /><br />Portion of <a href="http://www.casarosada.gov.ar/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6375">Costa Rican judgment</a> convicting Herrera-Ulloa of libel and slander [in Spanish]<br /><br />Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Case of Herrera-Ulloa v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/about/staff-bios/sirkin_bio.html">Susannah Sirkin</a> [Deputy Director, <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/">Physicians for Human Rights</a>]: &quot;As a founding member of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) was alarmed and deeply disappointed by a Department of State spokesperson&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/us-will-not-become-party-to-anti.php">pronouncement</a> on November 24  that President Obama does not intend to sign the landmark 1997 treaty banning the egregious weapon.  However, an apparent reversal of the US position this week gives some signs of hope and follows an outcry from the landmine ban movement and Senator Patrick Leahy, among others.  At the current five-year review of the Treaty convening in Cartagena, Colombia this week, the US observer has now stated that the US has begun a comprehensive landmine policy review.  We hope that this review will be serious, transparent and include consultation with key non-governmental organizations as well as NATO allies, all of whom have joined the Treaty. <br /><br />The arguments for total eradication of antipersonnel landmines are many.  As PHR and the mine ban movement have demonstrated through decades of documentation and bearing witness, mines cannot distinguish between the step of a soldier and that of a child.  They recognize no cease-fire; long after the fighting has stopped, they continue to devastate populations, threatening livelihoods and farm land, causing trauma and disability well into a post-war generation.  It is estimated that half of landmine victims die of their injuries before they reach appropriate medical care.  Over 90% of the victims today are civilians, largely the rural poor.  One quarter are children, making landmines one of the six preventable major causes of death to the world&#39;s youth.  A mine costs as little as $3 to manufacture, but as much as $1000 to uncover and remove from the ground.<br /><br />A ban on this &quot;weapon of mass destruction in slow motion&quot; was called for by President Clinton in 1994 at the UN General Assembly.  Sadly, since then, the US has withdrawn from the powerful global movement to eradicate the cruel epidemic of the antipersonnel mine.  The 1997 Treaty, frequently referred to as the <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/mine/UNDocs/ban_trty.htm">Ottawa Convention</a>, is a comprehensive international instrument effectively banning the use, production and trade of antipersonnel landmines.  It includes measures for stockpile destruction, mine clearance and victim assistance.  Enlisting 122 nations for the Ottawa signing in 1997, and gaining the requisite 40th ratification two years later, the treaty became binding under international law more rapidly than any previous disarmament convention.  By 2005, states parties to this unprecedented international agreement had destroyed close to 40 million stockpiled anti-personnel mines, cleared tens of thousands of square kilometers of mine-infested land, and provided hundreds of millions of dollars to support rehabilitation in over 50 countries for survivors.<br /><br />The ban on mines is supported by virtually every major humanitarian and relief organization, religious denomination, disarmament group and medical association.  Shortly before September 11, 2001, American ban supporters, including more than 50 state and national health professional associations, endorsed the US Campaign to Ban Landmines.  Even without the support of the US, China and Russia, the Mine Ban Treaty has created an environment in which the trade and use of the weapon are effectively taboo.  Now, the United States under the leadership of President Obama has an opportunity to join the majority of nations who are committed to ridding the world of this unconscionable scourge. It is still not too late.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.kondylislawoffice.gr/page3.php"><strong>Nikolas Kondylis</strong></a> [Attorney at Law, <a href="http://www.kondylislawoffice.gr/page14.php">N. Kondylis &amp; Partners&#39; Law Office</a>, Athens]: &quot;During the last two days several protests took place in Athens in the anniversary of the death of a young boy who was killed last year. Within the demonstrations several protestors and anarchists turned parts of the protests into raids, violated the law and caused damages. Therefore, some of them, as announced, were <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/greek-police-arrest-150-on-eve-of.php">arrested</a> by the police authorities and brought before the prosecutor and the examining magistrate with various accusations. <br /><br />According to the Greek Constitution and the rules of the penal procedure, a person who is arrested in the act of committing a crime shall be brought before the competent examining judge within twenty-four hours of his arrest. The examining magistrate must, within three days from the day the person was brought before him, either release the detainee or issue a warrant of imprisonment. Upon application of the person brought before him or in case of force majeure confirmed by decision of the competent judicial council, this time limit shall be extended by two days. Should either of these time-limits elapse before action is taken, any warden or other officer, civil or military servant, responsible for the detention of the arrested person must release them immediately. Violators shall be punished for illegal detention and shall be liable to restore any damage caused to the sufferer and to pay him a monetary compensation for pain and suffering, as specified by law. The accusations will be judged whether they are groundless or not before the penal courts. The arrest itself does not denote the correctness of the accusation or the guilt of the accused persons. The people who have been arrested should be judged fairly and under the principles of justice and law. <br /><br />At this point, it should be mentioned that according to <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#A11">Article 11</a> of the Constitution, Greeks shall have the right to assemble peaceably and unarmed. Although, this right is not absolute. It knows the bounds of public order and security since outdoor assemblies may be prohibited by the police authority with a reasoned decision, and in general if a serious threat to public security is imminent, or in a specific area if a serious disturbance of social and economic life is threatened, as specified by law. On the one hand, these provisions guarantee the freedom of assembly, while on the other they ensure the interests of the state.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.gregorydlee.com/index.html"><strong>Gregory D. Lee</strong></a> [Nationally Syndicated Columnist and Criminal Justice Consultant]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/guantanamo-detainee-transferred-to.php">transfer</a> of Kuwaiti National Fouad Al Rabiah to his home country is a further attempt by the Obama administration to reduce the number of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay as much as possible before his self-imposed one-year deadline arrives in January.<br /><br />What disturbs me is the administration&#39;s haste to reduce the number of detainees without regard to the reasons these people became detainees in the first place. Upwards of half of all previously released detainees have returned to the jihad battlefield, and there is no reason to believe Al Rabiah won&#39;t do the same.<br /><br />The US counter-terrorism strategy appears to be in retreat. Attorney General Eric Holder&#39;s decision to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammad and four others in the Southern District of New York, yet try other detainees by military commission at Guantanamo, gives KSM the forum he requested at the time of his capture. If military commissions are a viable mechanism to try some detainees, why not all of them? Why offer the highest valued detainee to date the opportunity to be on the world&#39;s stage and subject New Yorkers to unnecessary security concerns, costs, and the dredging up of the horrible memories of the events of 9/11?<br /><br />The military commissions need to crank up and start trying these detainees so justice can finally be served.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.khrp.org/content/view/315/140/"><strong>Kerim Yildiz</strong></a> [Chief Executive, <a href="http://www.khrp.org/">Kurdish Human Rights Project</a>]: &quot;Turkey&#39;s Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/turkish-constitutional-court-bans-pro.php">ruling</a> to close the Demokratik Toplum Partisi (Democratic Society Party, DTP) - the first pro-Kurdish party in the Turkish parliament in 14 years &#8212; comes at a crucial time in Turkey&#39;s history.  The AKP government&#39;s initiative aimed at resolving the Kurdish issue in Turkey represents a positive step in finding a peaceful democratic solution to the conflict that has plagued the country for decades.  The Chief Prosecutor&#39;s allegations and the Constitutional Court&#39;s decision to ban the DTP represents a step backward and will do nothing to further the cause of peace. <br /><br />This is not the first time such tactics have been used in an effort to silence and further marginalize the Kurdish people.  Politicians and parties representing the Kurds and Kurdish aspirations have faced systematic persecution in Turkey.  Every party that has sought to articulate Kurdish concerns in a peaceful, democratic forum has contended with efforts by the establishment to restrict their activities, threaten their members and ultimately disband the party.  This has included, among others, The People&#39;s Labour Party (HEP), the Freedom and Democracy Party (&Ouml;ZDEP), Democratic Party (DEP), and pro-Kurdish People&#39;s Democracy Party (HADEP).  The well-known decision to shut down the Democratic Party (DEP) in 1994, led to a number of DEP MPs being subsequently arrested and imprisoned after they were stripped of their parliamentary immunity.  Five of them - Selim Sadak, Ahmet T&uuml;rk, Leyla Zana, Mehmet Hatip Dicle and Orhan Do&Auml;&#376;an - were sentenced to 15 years&#39; imprisonment because of their public expression of their Kurdish identity.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECtHR) later ruled that the 1994 shut down denied DEP MPs the right to a fair trial, a violation of <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art6">Article 6</a> of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and that the deprivation of their parliamentary mandate was in breach of the right to free elections under <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#P1.Art3">Article 3 of Protocol 1</a> to the ECHR. The ECtHR also found violations of the ECHR in a number of other party closure cases in Turkey.  This systematic harassment and persecution of elected representatives by unelected state agents underscores the need for a thorough overhaul of mechanisms in Turkey governing the banning of parties and prosecutions of MPs.<br /><br />For the stability of the region and in the interest of both the Kurdish and Turkish people, now is the time for Turkey&#39;s government to reach out to its Kurdish citizens and work towards the substantive democratic reforms necessary to bring it in line with European human rights standards and progress towards full membership in the European Union. This latest party closure is not only a major set-back to the Kurdish issue, but it is also another devastating blow to democracy and political stability in Turkey and lays bare the severe failings of the Turkish legal and political system.<br /><br />Barring Kurdish interests from political participation will do nothing for Turkish unity and will only succeed in further denying basic human rights to over 20% of the states population.  Political dialogue and reform, not the prosecution of dissent, is the only way to end the ongoing armed conflict that has cost the Turkish and Kurdish people so dearly.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ncac.org/Staff"><strong>Joan Bertin</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.ncac.org">National Coalition Against Censorship</a>]: &quot;Cases involving messages on license plates raise a potpourri of questions with important First Amendment implications.  <br /><br />The easiest cases are those in which the government itself creates a plate with a religious message.  For example, South Carolina&#39;s legislative decision to issue &quot;I Believe&quot; license plates was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-rules-christian-themed.php">recently held unconstitutional</a> under the Establishment Clause, because it constituted overt promotion of religion by the state.  <br /><br />Few cases are so clear.  In most, the court must decide whether the message on the license plate is government or private speech.  If it is government speech, free speech considerations do not apply since the government controls the message.  If it is private speech, First Amendment protections apply to the speaker, and the question is whether the government can regulate the content of the message.  The law has evolved mainly out of conflicts over &quot;Choose Life&quot; plates, sometimes when the state has created such plates, and sometimes when it has refused to.   <br />  <br />The Sixth Circuit has held that &quot;specialty&quot; license plates issued by the state at the request of private groups are government speech whose message can be controlled by the government. As a result, the court rejected a challenge to Tennessee&#39;s &quot;Choose Life&quot; plates, relying in part on a 1991 Supreme Court decision upholding a government policy to promote childbirth which contained a restriction on abortion-related speech.   <br /><br />In contrast, most other courts have concluded that specialty message plates represent private, not government, speech, but they have analyzed the cases under a variety of theories.  The Ninth Circuit held that Arizona&#39;s refusal to issue a specialty &quot;Choose Life&quot; plate was impermissible viewpoint discrimination based on the state&#39;s hostility to the message or its desire to avoid controversy.  The Eighth Circuit likewise concluded that a private group had a right to a specialty &quot;Choose Life&quot; plate under Missouri&#39;s statutory system, but did so by invalidating the statute because it gave state officials discretion to decide whether or not to issue the plate; the court said such an unlimited grant of discretion could result in viewpoint discrimination.  The Fifth Circuit employed another route to reject a challenge to Louisiana&#39;s &quot;Choose Life&quot; plate: it held that the challenge was barred by the Tax Injunction Act. In all these cases, the right to the &quot;Choose Life&quot; license plate was upheld.<br /><br />Only two circuits have invalidated &quot;Choose Life&quot; plates, but they also reached the same result by different means.  The Seventh Circuit upheld Illinois&#39; refusal to issue &quot;Choose Life&quot; plates, finding that, although private speech was involved, the decision was a reasonable content-based, viewpoint neutral rule, because the state excluded the whole subject of abortion from its specialty plates.   The Fourth Circuit struck down a South Carolina statute authorizing &quot;Choose Life&quot; plates, which the court characterized as a mixture of public and private speech, the state creating the plate and the individual purchasing it.  The principal opinion (two judges concurred in the result) concluded that the government had created a limited public forum for expression and that it engaged in viewpoint discrimination by favoring one view and discriminating against others.  <br /><br />In another Fourth Circuit decision involving a request for a plate displaying a Confederate flag, the court held that the message was private speech which was protected, and that the state&#39;s refusal to issue the plate was impermissible viewpoint discrimination.  The two Fourth Circuit decisions, along with the Ninth Circuit ruling on &quot;Choose Life&quot; plates, reveal how application of viewpoint discrimination analysis can result in a decision permitting expression of a controversial view, but can also yield the opposite result if other views are not given equal voice.   <br /><br />Confused yet?  If so, it&#39;s entirely understandable.  Given the varied factual situations, the lack of consensus in the courts, and the likelihood of continued litigation, query whether the income generated by specialty license plates exceeds the costs of defending them.  It just might be cheaper for states to eliminate message license plates altogether, and let people express themselves with bumper stickers.&quot;<br />

		<title>California must reduce recidivism for long-term solution to prison overcrowding</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dawn Koepke</strong>  [Legislative Advocate, <a href="http://www.crimevictimsunited.com/">Crime Victims United of California</a>]: &quot;After months of debate, the legislature <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/california-files-new-plan-to-reduce.php">approved</a> a watered-down version of the Corrections budget package aimed at addressing the $1.2 billion unallocated cut to the Department of Corrections provided in the July budget package.  The highly controversial provisions that included instituting an independent sentencing commission, early release of inmates to alternative custody, and changing a number of wobbler crimes to misdemeanors were removed from the plan.  Crime Victims United of California (CVUC) worked tirelessly with other public safety representatives to ensure these provisions, among others, were addressed. <br /><br />Although the package enacted was far better than the package originally proposed by the governor and legislature, it was not perfect and will undoubtedly have consequences.  The package includes updates to the property crime thresholds to reflect the Consumer Price Index (CPI); inmate credit enhancements for those that participate in programs while in prison; summary parole/banked caseloads for parole that would reduce parole supervision for &quot;non-violent,&quot; &quot;non-serious&quot; and &quot;non-sex&quot; offenders (this component of the package would also eliminate revocation for these parolees); and more. <br /><br />Despite the enactment of the watered-down plan, the issue of the federal court order to release roughly 40,000 inmates remains an issue that has yet to play out.  The Schwarzenegger Administration has filed a revised prison reduction plan with the federal courts in response to the three judge panel&#39;s order to reduce the prison population by 40,000 over the next two years.  The new plan would purportedly reduce the prison population by 42,000 by December 2011 and identify, per the judge&#39;s order, State laws that would need to be suspended in order to meet the reduction goal.  Although the Administration has provided such information relative to suspension of laws, it has indicated doing so would not be within the federal court&#39;s jurisdiction to intrude in to the State&#39;s affairs. <br /><br />The revised plan includes the proposals CVUC and law enforcement stakeholders fought hard to defeat over the last few years as well as other proposals that will require changes in State laws or federal court orders.  While we remain concerned about a number of these approaches, we are particularly concerned about the applicability of many of these proposals to purportedly &quot;non-violent&quot; and &quot;non-serious&quot; offenders; provisions related to imposition of a summary parole system; and reliance on alternative custody options for released offenders and parolees.  These measures are all window dressing items that deal with population reduction needs, but do not adequately focus on public safety and rehabilitation needs.  These proposals are purportedly geared towards focusing resources on the more serious of offenders, but many such offenders would be overlooked for such focused resources as a result of penal code definitions that do not adequately categorize the seriousness of offenses.<br /><br />Because many vicious crimes against children and others are classified as &quot;non-violent&quot; or &quot;non-serious&quot; &#8212; the &quot;lower risk&quot; offenders referred to in the plan &#8212; in the State penal code, the proposal could allow the early release of felons convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor; incest; pimping a minor, pandering a minor or providing a minor for lewd purposes; and other such crimes if not crafted carefully.  Furthermore, steps must be taken to ensure that those offenders that would be considered &quot;lower risk&quot; are not considered such merely based on their last offense.  It is important to look at the offender&#39;s history; in order to be sent to prison, more serious/violent offenses will have been committed by the offender.  We have no assurances that these issues have been adequately factored in to the criteria for determining eligibility for the various options laid out in the plan (summary parole, alternative custody, etc.).<br /><br />In this regard, CVUC would urge you to consider the recent Los Angeles case of Lily Burk who was brutally murdered.  The suspected offender was last convicted for a &quot;non-serious/non-violent&quot; offense and sent to a rehabilitation center (read alternative custody option).  Depending on the details of these proposals and diligence of staff in reviewing and assessing the offender and his records, many offenders like Charles Samuel whose record shows an increasing level of serious crimes could be subject to the same limited (if any) supervision with disastrous consequences.<br /><br />CVUC is also highly concerned with the Administration&#39;s summary parole or banked caseload-type system.  While we do not disagree that the parole system is broken, placing all &quot;lower risk&quot; offenders on the streets without any supervision whatsoever is dangerous.  California&#39;s current recidivism rate is roughly 70%.  Although many of the instances of recidivism may be minor parole violations, many of them are more serious crimes that are committed by offenders that have shown an increasing level of serious/violent crime.  Furthermore, this approach will be disastrous when combined with the lack of effective rehabilitation programs, poor economic climate, and decreased level of State support for offender&#39;s families as a result of cuts to critical social service programs.<br /><br />Finally, CVUC understands local law enforcement&#39;s need for alternative custody options and has been generally supportive of providing these options; however, this only gets us so far in addressing population issues and public safety concerns.  Alternative custody options and sanctions are important, but only as effective as the local law enforcement staff available to monitor and scrutinize offenders&#39; behavior.  It is by no means a solution to the entire problem, particularly as local law enforcement agencies have to cut back due to their own budget constraints.  This approach for custody of offenders is not a panacea and should not be considered such when public safety hangs in the balance.<br /><br />CVUC&#39;s concern with these proposals might not be so great if offenders were truly rehabilitated in the institutions prior to parole and release.  Along with problems related to overcrowding, inmates are still not truly rehabilitated and given the tools they need to become productive members of society and not continuously cycle through the system.  Vocational training opportunities within facility walls are hit-and-miss, and very little is done to help ensure that they do not return to prison.  Without programs available to offenders inside and outside facilities, they will surely continue to cycle through the system continuing to drive up costs, overcrowding, and bringing more victims into the system as well. <br /><br />Before considering commutations, alternative custody options, sentence or parole reforms, California must first acknowledge that reducing recidivism is the quickest and cheapest way to reduce our overcrowded system.  Such changes would provide long term benefits for the State in the form of decreased corrections costs, offenders in the form of assistance to reform their lives, and fewer victims being involuntarily brought into the criminal justice process.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/contact-dpic"><strong>Richard Dieter</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a>]: &quot;In a rapid sequence of events, the state of Ohio has abandoned its longstanding commitment to the standard method of lethal injection, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-appeals-court-rules-ohio.php">adopted a new protocol</a> (and even more novel &quot;backup plan&quot;) that no other state employs, and has asserted that it is ready to carry out its first execution under these new procedures in a few days.  The execution of Kenneth Biros should not go forward on December 8 without further review.<br /><br />Ohio&#39;s track record with lethal injections has been dismal.  In 2006, Ohio finally succeeded in killing Joseph Clark after 90 minutes of bungling in the lethal injection chamber.  Clark repeatedly called out &quot;It don&#39;t work.  It don&#39;t work.&quot;  In 2007, Ohio executed Christopher Newton with similar problems, and he was not declared dead until two hours after the process started.  Despite revisions to their procedures, Ohio failed in its attempt to execute Romell Broom in September 2009.  After two hours, the execution team gave up and Broom was removed from the chamber.  Ohio confidently said that it was ready to put Broom through another execution attempt one week later, but that attempt was blocked by the courts, exercising well-deserved skepticism.<br /><br />Very recently, Ohio has proposed a one-drug protocol - a massive (5000 milligram) overdose of an anesthetic - to kill those on death row.  Surely, this latest experiment on involuntary human subjects needs to be examined more closely before the state&#39;s word is taken at face value.  Ohio consulted with Dr. Mark Dershwitz regarding their new execution plan.  But even Dr. Dershwitz admits that the effects of this massive dose are untested, even if lethal.  He stated in the Fordham Urban Law Journal that &quot;We are unaware of any indication in clinical medicine in which a 5000mg dose of thiopental is given to a 80kg patient...there is circumstantial evidence that a 5000mg dose of thiopental may have caused, in some inmates, virtual cessation of circulation.&quot;<br /><br />Other doctors had even more serious reservations about this one-drug protocol in the same journal. Dr. Susi Vasallo said that to view this new method as an improvement was an &quot;illusion.&quot;  Dr. Teresa Zimmers said the drug might not be sufficient to cause death.  The Royal Dutch Society rejected this method for euthanasia.  The new protocol still requires an insertion of an IV, a process that the Ohio prison guards have not been able to complete in a humane manner.  Ohio&#39;s backup plan is to insert other drugs into the muscles of the inmate.  This, too, is without precedent.  Perhaps experts from the medical profession will agree that Ohio has chosen the best available alternative to the risky three-drug process.  But such a conclusion requires an evidentiary and adversarial hearing - not a doormat of blind acceptance.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://people.stfx.ca/lstan/"><strong>Lavinia Stan</strong></a> [Associate Professor, Department of Political Science, <a href="http://www.stfx.ca/">St. Francis Xavier University</a>]: &quot;On 14 December, the Central Electoral Bureau reinstated 2,000 of the 138,000 invalid votes registered in the second round of the presidential elections that took place a week before. The recounting was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/romania-constitutional-court-orders.php">ordered</a> by the Romanian Constitutional Court at the request of the Social Democrat Party candidate Mircea Geoana, who lost the poll to incumbent Traian Basescu, representing the Democrat-Liberal Party. With that announcement, Geoana&#39;s hopes of seeing the final score reversed vanished into thin air, as most of the newly validated votes went to his rival.<br /><br />The recount was the final scene of the first presidential poll organized after Romania was reluctantly and belatedly accepted into the European Union in 2007. This was also the first time when presidential elections were held separately from parliamentary elections, as the President&#39;s mandate was extended to five years, as opposed to four years for members of Parliament. For the first time in the history of this post-communist country, which remains a laggard in Europe and the European Union with respect to democratic consolidation, more electors voted in the second, as opposed to the first, round (54% as opposed to 58%). Finally, this was the first time when the winner was decided by a mere 70,000 votes, most of them believed to be those of the increasingly large Romanian diapora. The country has a total population of some 21 million.<br /><br />For Basescu and his Democrat-Liberals, this is an important victory. First, because they feared that a victorious Geoana might adopt a practice instituted by Basescu since 2004: that of refusing to accept cabinet formulas excluding his party. The practice, which Basescu hails as a prerogative of the Player-President he wants to be, runs counter to <a href="http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_2&par1=3#t3c2s0a84">Article 84</a> of the Constitution, which calls on the President to be above party politics and represent all Romanians, regardless of their ideological or policy preferences. While the Democrat-Liberals and the Social Democrats have formed the government in 2008-2009, their relations sharply deteriorated in the wake of the presidential poll. Thus, it was unlikely that President Geoana would have allowed the Democrat-Liberals to participate in the new government. Second, the victory allows Basescu to reform the political system and move the country closer to presidentialism (and away from French-style semi-presidentialism), a proposal surprisingly embraced by some of the country&#39;s intellectuals. While capitalizing on Parliament&#39;s dismal public trust and justifying presidentialism as key to unblocking the anticorruption campaign and reducing the political influence of the oligarchs, supporters of Basescu&#39;s constitutional amendments have downplayed the pitfalls of a system with which Romania historically had no experience and which displays uncanny similarities to Ceausescu&#39;s strong-man rule. Indeed, if these proposals had originated from the Social Democrat camp, intellectuals would have quickly dismissed them, and rightly so. In a country with feable civic spirit and limited democratic past, granting the President such wide prerogatives might spell the end of democratization.<br /><br />Basescu&#39;s victory is bitter-sweet because for the first time his ideological and policy inconsistencies might prevent the Democrat-Liberals to form the government. To the dismay of Western observers, after its acceptance into the European Union the country descended into political haos, rather than gloriously converging with the democratic older member states. During his first mandate, President Basescu single-mindedly sought to ensure parliamentary majority to his Democrat-Liberals at the risk of alienating all other political formations, and endangering the reform agenda. In 2005 and again in 2009 the governments he appointed enyoyed a significant parliamentary majority, but Basescu pursued an office-seeking, rather than a policy-seeking agenda. Since the October 2009 fall of the Democrat-Liberal and Social Democrat government, Romania has remained ungoverned, and Basescu&#39;s chances to form anything other than a minority cabinet are very slim, as his Democrat-Liberals remain isolated. It is unlikely that President Basescu will be able to strengthen the rule of law, launch the anti-corruption campaign, deblock de-communization, and boost Romania&#39;s international credibility during his second mandate.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/lawpolice/facultyprofile/odonnell.asp"><strong>Eugene O&#39;Donnell</strong></a> [Lecturer, <a href="http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/x_onhold.php">John Jay College of Criminal Justice</a>]: &quot;One of the paradoxes of crime reporting is that statistics sometimes decline when there is little expectation that law enforcement will treat a crime report seriously.  Thus, the reported crime rate in some of the nation&#39;s largest cities may well be higher than officially reported due to lack of public confidence in the police and low expectations about the services they deliver.<br /><br />There can be little doubt that <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/fbi-report-shows-reported-hate-crimes.php">hate crimes</a> are underreported, perhaps dramatically so.  Many law enforcement agencies, even those that take these matters seriously, are still wrestling with how to classify and handle hate-related complaints.  It also can&#39;t be ignored that the motivations of assailants are not always made explicitly clear or are easy to discern. <br /><br />Whether or not someone philosophically believes in enhanced punishment for hate crimes, I can certainly say that the New York city experience, though surely not typical of the American experience, is that hate crimes that are reported to the police are treated with the utmost seriousness.  Police officers and superior officers are expected to handle these matters with urgency, empathy and professionalism.  This official proscription against intolerant actions can create a more just and less divided national atmosphere, something that is maybe even more important during difficult economic times, when some may be tempted to scapegoat others for their own limited successes.&quot;<br />

		<title>Federal court ruling on &#039;I Believe Act&#039; relegates religious speech to second class status</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.religiousliberty.info/article.php?id=41e"><strong>Alan Reinach</strong></a> [President, Western Chapter, <a href="http://religiousliberty.info/">North American Religious Liberty Association</a>]: &quot;When we were children, we used to have play fights. &quot;I dare you,&quot; one would say, only to hear in response, &quot;I double dare you!&quot; Sadly, the culture wars have degenerated into a grown up version of such foolishness. The latest <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-rules-christian-themed.php">example</a> is in South Carolina, where a Federal Court recently struck down the state&#39;s approval of a license plate motto: &quot;I believe&quot; complete with a graphic of the Cross and a stained glass window. <br /><br />The real story here is not the constitutional issue, which is unremarkable. The <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> of the First Amendment requires strict government neutrality. The state is not to become a battleground for religious interest groups to fight over, to obtain public endorsement and promotion of its religion or belief. Yet, that is exactly what happened here. One group wanted the state to promote its ideology, &quot;I believe,&quot; while another group opposed such abuse of state authority. <br /><br />No, the tragedy here is that the Federal Court <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/DOCS/i.believe.order2.pdf">decision</a> [PDF file] will inflame both sides of this culture war to raise more money, and superheat its followers. The good Christian people of South Carolina, and throughout the nation, are being told that the Federal courts are hostile to Christian faith, and that the First Amendment has been abused &#8212; that there is no such thing as the separation of church and state. This is simply false. Meanwhile, those of a more secular or postmodern bent are being told to congratulate themselves, and continue supporting the organization that brought the legal challenge, because this is an important victory. Hogwash! <br /><br />This &quot;important victory&quot; only exacerbates the culture war, and makes finding common ground more difficult, perhaps impossible. It also masks the real culture war struggle that begs for a truce: the conflict between gay rights and religious freedom. The culture wars have become a zero sum game. Increasing conflict between gay rights and religious freedom poses an enormous risk to those religious institutions that live by traditional moral or biblical values regarding human sexuality. Eventually, they may be forced to &quot;convert or die.&quot;  This is truly tragic. Why can&#39;t we craft a society and a legal structure where people of faith and the GLBT community can both live in peace, and have their rights protected? Why does one group have to seek protections at the expense of the other? <br /><br />The people of South Carolina have not been deprived of opportunities to express their faith on their automobiles. Americans love their cars just as much as they love God and country. Those in South Carolina can express their sentiments, whether &quot;I believe&quot; or &quot;Honk if you love Jesus&quot; on bumper stickers plastered as loudly as they wish. Or they can display their sentiments on license plate frames. Indeed, since South Carolina permits organizations to apply for special license plates, the group sponsoring the &quot;I Believe&quot; plate has now changed its name to &quot;I Believe&quot; so that it can still display &quot;I Believe&quot; on the plate itself. <br /><br />Now we will see whether those opposing the license plates truly believe in freedom of speech and religion, or whether they are simply hostile to Christian expressions of faith. When South Carolina opens up the license plate to legitimate organizational displays, it creates a limited public forum for citizens to express their free speech. The resulting speech is not government endorsement or promotion of their message, but private speech, which is protected by the same First Amendment that was used to strike down the license plate display when it was &quot;government approved.&quot;<br /><br />I expect the antagonists to complain that even this modest approach violates the separation of church and state &#8212; that the state is still endorsing and promoting a religious message by permitting it to be displayed on the license plate. [Because we&#39;ve heard these arguments before.] They are likely to contend that only secular organizations and messages may enjoy the use of the limited public forum to display messages on license plates. But this argument betrays their hostility to free speech and religion, and more fundamentally, to Christianity. Religious speech is not rendered second class by the First Amendment. If the state chooses to create a limited public forum, it cannot make content based distinctions and approve only secular speech while excluding religious speech. <br /><br />When we were children, most of the time we were wise enough to figure a way out of the dilemma posed by the dare and double dare, without coming to physical blows. Today, everything winds up in court, the modern equivalent of the duel.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/jle2/"><strong>John Esposito</strong></a> [Professor, <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/">Georgetown University</a> and  Founding Director, <a href="http://cmcu.georgetown.edu/about/">Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding</a>]: &quot;Despite our increasingly globalized world and the need to strengthen religious pluralism as well as to transform an outmoded notion of tolerance based simply on co-existence to one based on mutual understanding and respect and the equal rights of all citizens, many countries continue to <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/us-report-criticizes-islamic-nations-on.php">fail</a> the religious freedom litmus test. Religious discrimination, persecution, and violence continue to be issues in Muslim countries. <br /> <br />On Saturday, August 1, 2009, after several days of rioting and violence over allegations that Christians had desecrated the Quran, an estimated crowd of one thousand stormed a Christian neighborhood in Gojra, Pakistan. The mob killed eight, including six women, and burned and looted dozens of houses. This was not an isolated incident in Pakistan, where blasphemy against the Prophet and the desecration of the Quran have often been used against Christians.<br /><br />Religious minorities in the Muslim world, constitutionally entitled to equality of citizenship and religious freedom, increasingly fear the erosion of those rights - and with good reason. Interreligious and intercommunal tensions and conflicts have flared up not only in Pakistan but also in Egypt, Sudan, Nigeria, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Abuses range from discrimination, violence, and the destruction of villages, churches, and mosques to murder. The result in countries like Nigeria has been cycles of death and vengeance: Muslim massacre of Christians and Christian massacre of Muslims. In Pakistan and Iraq, intra-Muslim communal intolerance and violence have flared between Sunni and Shia extremist organizations and militias.<br /><br />Have Muslim governments and religious leaders done enough to address them? Clearly, this year&#39;s report again indicates that while progress has been made by some countries, many have not. Some governments ignore interreligious conflicts or exacerbate them. In others like Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and some Muslim communities in the West, intra-Muslim relations, in particular between Sunni and Shia, remain contentious. An area often conspicuously absent or only marginally covered is the extent to which some governments like Egypt and Tunisia substantially restrict religious freedom in their suppression of mainstream Islamic activist organizations. However, there are winds of change.<br /> <br />Increasingly, Muslim reformers, a vanguard facing resistance from conservative and fundamentalist factions, call for and promote Islamic reform, challenging long held traditions. Most build on but also transform notions of religious pluralism already present in the Islamic tradition. They argue that the Quran recognized both Jews and Christians as &quot;People of the Book,&quot; those who have special status because God revealed his will through his prophets, including Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, which all three communities follow and that while classical Islamic law that classified Jews and Christians as &quot;protected&quot; (dhimmi) people who could live and practice their faith if they paid a poll or head tax (jizya) may have been advanced for its time, in today&#39;s world of modern nation-states, its application amounts to designating non-Muslims as second-class citizens.<br /> <br />Reformers, who redefine and broaden traditional theological notions of religious pluralism, root their interpretations in the Quran&#39;s emphasis on the equality of all humanity: God&#39;s decision to create not just a single nation or tribe but a world of different nations, ethnicities, tribes, and languages (30:22; 48:13). Many argue that religious exclusivism is not in accord with the Quran&#39;s worldview and teachings: &quot;To everyone we have appointed a way and a course to follow&quot; (5.48) and &quot;For each there is a direction toward which he turns; vie therefore with one another in the performance of good works. Wherever you may be, God shall bring you all together [on the Day of Judgment]. Surely God has power over all things&quot; (2.148).<br /> <br />Abdulaziz Sachedina of the University of Virginia <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Islamic-Roots-Democratic-Pluralism/dp/0195139917">reminds</a> his readers that Islam and Muslims facing the future, like Christianity and Christians, are challenged to balance a sense of uniqueness or special dispensation with true respect for other faiths. For Sachedina, the &quot;acid test of pluralism is whether a religion is willing to recognize members of other religions as potential citizens in the world to come. Is such citizenship conferred in spite of or because of the person&#39;s membership in another religion?&quot;<br /> <br />Muslim popular opinion in America reflects changing Muslim attitudes. Responses to a question on Islam and religious pluralism in a February 2008 Pew survey demonstrate a pluralistic trajectory.  While a minority (33 percent) of those polled responded, &quot;My religion is the one, true faith leading to eternal life,&quot; a majority (56 percent) believed, &quot;Many religions can lead to eternal life.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Volker Huls</strong> [Chief of Social Planning &amp; Monitoring, <a href="http://www.unicef.org/somalia/">UNICEF Somalia</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-announces-intent-to-ratify-un.php">announcement</a> by the Transitional Federal Government comes at a crucial time when more than ever children&#39;s rights are violated in Somalia as a consequence of the ongoing conflict in the country. This statement of intent gives hope that the government is taking these rights seriously, and is committed to legal and institutional reform to ensure children&#39;s rights are protected. Besides pursuing the legal process of domestic and international ratification, this requires a thorough analysis of both customary and traditional as well as codified law and practices in the country to establish conflicts with the Articles of the CRC.<br /><br />The Government proposal to undertake such an analysis will be very valuable for understanding the state&#39;s obligation under the treaty. It has been the experience of UNICEF that the process of legal reform is the biggest hurdle for the realization of children&#39;s rights, and while most countries have ratified the CRC, many states parties to the treaty still are not fully<br />compliant with its provisions. Somalia therefore is not alone in its endeavor, and UNICEF will provide support by sharing with the government other countries&#39; processes and experiences to facilitate the strengthening of systems that protect children&#39;s rights. In this context, the US could take similar action by declaring an intention to ratify, committing to the provisions of the CRC in principle, and then pursuing the necessary systems and legal reforms at a realistic pace.<br /><br />The declaration by the Transitional Federal Government brings up the contentious issue of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, in the Northwest of the country. It perceives itself as independent within the borders of the former Bristish Somaliland, and has every intent to pursue international recognition. In a parallel process this unrecognized entity has started to pursue the domestic ratification of the CRC, conscious of the fact that international ratification is not an option for the time<br />being. Instead, its government has already made steps forward in legal reform and in 2008 - with UNICEF support - put in place a Justice for Children Bill that significantly improves the situation of children in the justice system both as victims and as perpetrators. Such action is commendable and shows that in the long run implementation through legal reform and systems-strengthening is important and most effective for improving the protection of children&#39;s rights.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Alexander Abdo</strong> [Legal Fellow, National Security Project, <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a>]: &quot;Historically, the United States has championed the use of photographic evidence of human-rights abuses to advance the cause of justice. The reason is simple: Pictures have a unique ability to transform public debate. They convey in plain and unadulterated form what words cannot. It was the video of the Rodney King beating, for example, that exposed to the country the racial tensions lurking in Los Angeles. It was the photograph of the mutilated body of fourteen-year-old Emmett Till that helped spur the civil rights movement. And it was the iconic picture of a man, hooded, wired, and balanced on a cardboard box, that signaled to our nation that our counter-terrorism policies had strayed far from our core values.<br /><br />But now, to our profound disappointment at the American Civil Liberties Union, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates wants to abandon that tradition and keep from the American public potentially <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/defense-secretary-bars-public.php">hundreds of photographs</a> of abuse by American soldiers.  His stated concern is that the photos, if released, will inflame anti-American sentiment and thereby endanger our national security. Secretary Gates should reverse course and release the photos.  <br /><br />The images at issue depict the abuse of detainees held by the United States abroad in at least seven different detention facilities throughout Iraq and Afghanistan.  They are critical to a full and informed understanding of the interrogation and detention policies of the Bush administration. They document systemic abuse at a wide range of facilities and would serve to rebuke the myth, recently repeated by President Obama, that rogue soldiers are responsible for the mistreatment. And, perhaps most importantly, the pictures would illustrate in ways no words could the depraved consequences of the Bush administration&#39;s unlawful detention and interrogation regime. <br /><br />These photos would certainly be disturbing, as they should be. And no one wants to endanger our troops. But the Secretary is wrong to suppress the images. In rejecting the same argument when made by the Bush administration, an appeals court noted that the risk that release of the photographs would endanger our troops is &quot;speculative,&quot; and the possibility that it would endanger any particular solider is &quot;miniscule.&quot; The court&#39;s analysis should sound familiar, because it was President Obama who declared on his second day in office that information should not be suppressed based on &quot;speculative or abstract fears.&quot;<br /><br />The more fundamental problem with the Secretary&#39;s rationale, however, is that it is unbounded and would justify the greatest suppression of the worst governmental wrongdoing. To prevent inflaming anti-American opinion, the government would have to suppress all evidence of torture and any discussion of Guant&aacute;namo Bay or Abu Ghraib. That fundamentally antidemocratic equation &#8212; greatest suppression of the worst misconduct &#8212; would forever keep the public in the dark about the facts most important to representative democracy and informed decision-making. <br /><br />Secretary Gates should reject that distorted conception of American transparency - that evidence of misconduct may be suppressed precisely because it powerfully documents governmental misconduct - and release the photographs of abuse. The sooner we publicly acknowledge and investigate our past abuses, the safer, freer, and stronger our country will be.&quot;<br />

		<title>Hate crime data incomplete due partly to varying police reporting practices</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.csustan.edu/Spotlights/faculty/Phyllis_Gerstenfeld.html"><strong>Phyllis Gerstenfeld</strong></a> [Professor and Chair, Department of Criminal Justice,<br /><a href="http://www.csustan.edu/">California State University, Stanislaus</a>]: &quot;This week, the FBI <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/fbi-report-shows-reported-hate-crimes.php">reported</a> a 2% increase in hate crimes in 2008, as compared to the previous year.  While hate crimes are an important problem in the United States (and abroad), this reported increase itself should be grounds for neither particular concern nor comfort. The reason for this is that the FBI data give us an incomplete picture at best.<br /><br />While federal law requires the FBI to collect hate crime data from local law enforcement agencies, the agencies themselves are not generally required to keep track of hate crimes. Most do - and more did during 2008 than 2007, which may help account for the increase in reported incidents - but some still do not. Even among the agencies that do report hate crimes, however, the accuracy and completeness of the reporting differs a great deal. In a study I conducted several years ago, for example, I found that San Francisco reported nearly ten times as many hate crimes per year as its similarly-sized neighbor to the south, San Jose.  A large part of this difference was likely due to the cities&#39; differing approaches to recording and handling hate crimes. At the time, for instance, San Francisco had a bias crime unit and San Jose did not. Other researchers have found very much the same thing in other places; whether a particular incident gets reported as a hate crime may depend a great deal on the policies of a particular agency, as well as the training and perceptions of the officers involved. While many crimes may have variance in reporting, that situation is especially true for hate crimes, where the circumstances are often ambiguous and the offenders&#39; motives must be determined.<br /><br />Another reason to be cautious when interpreting the FBI data is the fact that only a small percentage of hate crimes ever get reported to the police in the first place. Research suggests that for a variety of reasons victims are particularly unlikely to report hate crimes. Among these reasons are some communities&#39; poor relationships with law enforcement;  victims&#39; fears of being outed, facing retaliation, or, in the case of undocumented immigrants, facing legal sanctions themselves; and victims&#39; lack of knowledge about hate crime laws. We can be quite sure that the 7,780 incidents reported by the FBI in 2008 represent only a small portion of the total.<br /><br />Finally, hate crime rates can be temporarily affected by current events. Perhaps the most obvious example of this was the spike in crimes against Muslims, Arabs, and those of Middle-Eastern ancestry that occurred in the weeks following 9/11. More recently, some areas have reported increases in crimes against immigrants, perhaps as a by-product of the nation&#39;s larger debate against immigration as well as the failing economy. Legal battles in California and other states concerning gay marriage may also have sparked some violence.<br /><br />The FBI hate crime data certainly have value, especially in the absence of more accurate methods of tracking hate crimes in the United States. However, small changes like those just reported should not be the primary focus of our inquiries into hate violence. The data are simply too fallible.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Virginia Keyder, currently teaching European Union law at Bogazici University and Sabanci University in Istanbul, Turkey, says that the Lisbon Treaty on European Union reform that has just entered into force is much more than meets the eye, especially as regards its implications for fundamental rights and EU military policy...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/virginiakeyder.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->N<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->ow that everything that could possibly be said has been said about the new bodies wandering Europe's opaque corridors of power, isn't anyone interested in what this Lisbon Treaty that created these <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0001:01:EN:HTML">positions</a> actually says?  If non-Europeans know little about it, Europeans know even less. If Tony Blair's short run as 'man most likely to succeed' in hooking up with the US is over, how will the Lisbon Treaty itself continue this privileged relationship?  <br /><br />Let me count the ways.  Some basic info: this Treaty, like its Amsterdam predecessor, is really two treaties: the 58-article Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the 358-article Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), plus 37 protocols and 65 declarations, for simplification. Keeping in mind that the purpose in setting up the original European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957 was to avoid future wars by integrating the economies of the founding six member states, using their particular strengths to create a peaceful and prosperous Europe, it comes as no little surprise to see its progeny display such an emphasis on undemocratic power, has-been neo-liberalism, and military aspirations. <br /><br />Democracy first. Does anyone really believe that simply by giving already castrated national parliaments access to a total dud of a 'principle,' namely subsidiarity (which ranks up there with derivatives for ease of explanation) to express themselves, provided eight of them can agree within eight weeks of 'being informed,' is democracy (now known as 'good governance')? See Article 12 TEU, Article 3 TFEU and Protocol 1).  <br /><br />Then there's the 'citizens initiative.' The second pillar (this organization loves pillars) of the new democracy provides in Article 11(4) TEU  "Not less than one million citizens who are nationals of a significant number of Member States may take the initiative of inviting the European Commission, within the framework of its powers, to submit any appropriate proposal on matters where citizens consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Treaties." These are the treaties that no citizen was permitted to vote on, by the way. <br /><br />Europeans need to face the fact that the EU Commission (where all legislation is initiated, lest the great unknowing think this happens in parliaments) takes its cues from lobbies, not citizens.  And just in time American lobbies (victims of their own success in Washington where the lobbies are now inside the tent, doing what tent insiders do) are in town.  Unlike in their previous habitat, these lobbies are totally unregulated in Brussels. No one dares to ask who they are, who their clients are, or how much they are paid. The two-year old voluntary register attracted everyone from the Aberdeen Fish Producers Organization to Young Friends of the Countryside.  Lobbies representing Business Software Alliance (BSA), Record Industry Association of America (RIAA), Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and various big pharma groups, deftly cloak demands for strong intellectual property protection and extra-judicial enforcement (the last real hold that western powers have on the world economy) with national security jargon and Europeans seem none the wiser or worse . <br /><br />As for neo-liberalism, most Europeans will be surprised to learn that social services, health, and education are now part of the Common Commercial Policy (an exclusive EU competency under Art. 3(e) TFEU), and may therefore be the subject of binding, possibly secret negotiations (the new Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement is ostensibly about intellectual property, but its 'national security' aspects have been stressed as justification for maintaining absolute secrecy about its contents), with (guess which) countries who feel such services, like everything else, should exist only if they are profitable.  Article 207 TFEU provides that only where EU commercial agreements "risk seriously disturbing the national organization of such services and prejudicing the responsibility of Member States to deliver them", will they be subject to unanimity in Council voting.  Otherwise they may be decided by qualified majority, with decisions to privatize services able to be made against the will of entire blocks of Member States. <br /><br />And finally, the nasty little secret about Common Foreign and Security Policy's (the second 'pillar' of the outgoing TEU) new military prowess. The creation of the European Defense Agency in 2004 was a direct result of lobbying by multinational defense companies to procure a larger chunk of EU research funds by claiming the distinction between military and civil research was expensive and artificial.  These same corporations were later asked to essentially draft EU defense policy. Articles 42 through 46 TEU 'constitutionalize' this perspective. While Article 11 of the outgoing Amsterdam Treaty stated that the goals of CFSP are the defining and implementing of policies covering all areas of foreign and security policy, the objectives of which shall be: "to safeguard the common values, fundamental interests, independence and integrity of the Union in conformity with the principles of the UN Charter, to strengthen the security of the Union in all ways, to preserve peace and strengthen international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, as well as the principles of the Helsinki Final Act and the objectives of the Paris Charter, including those on external borders, to promote international cooperation, to develop and consolidate democracy and the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."  <br /><br />Lisbon restates these objectives in Article 24 as follows:<blockquote>1. The Union&#39;s competence in matters of common foreign and security policy shall cover all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the Union&#39;s security, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy that might lead to a common defence&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;<br /><br />2. Within the framework of the principles and objectives of its external action, the Union shall conduct, define and implement a common foreign and security policy, based on the development of mutual political solidarity among Member States, the identification of questions of general interest and the achievement of an ever-increasing degree of convergence of Member States&#39; actions.<br /><br />3. The Member States shall support the Union&#39;s external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity and shall comply with the Union&#39;s action in this area. The Member States shall work together to enhance and develop their mutual political solidarity. They shall refrain from any action which is contrary to the interests of the Union or likely to impair its effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations.</blockquote>One has to ask, where did all the stuff about democracy, fundamental rights and the rule of law disappear to?<br /><br />The salient features of new Articles 42 &#8212; 46 TEU put meat on the bones of the new EU militarism as follows:<blockquote><br />1. The common security and defence policy sh
all be an integral part of the common foreign and security policy. It shall provide the Union with an operational capacity drawing on civilian and military assets. The Union may use them on missions outside the Union for peace-keeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. The performance of these tasks shall be undertaken using capabilities provided by the Member States.<br /><br />2. The common security and defence policy shall include the progressive framing of a common Union defence policy. This will lead to a common defence, when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides. It shall in that case recommend to the Member States the adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;<br /><br />3. Member States shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities. The Agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the European Defence Agency&quot;) shall identify operational requirements, shall promote measures to satisfy those requirements, shall contribute to identifying and, where appropriate, implementing any measure needed to strengthen the industrial and technological base of the defence sector, shall participate in defining a European capabilities and armaments policy, and shall assist the Council in evaluating the improvement of military capabilities&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;<br /><br />5. The Council may entrust the execution of a task, within the Union framework, to a group of Member States in order to protect the Union&#39;s values and serve its interests. The execution of such a task shall be governed by Article 44.<br /><br />6. Those Member States whose military capabilities fulfill higher criteria and which have made more binding commitments to one another in this area with a view to the most demanding missions shall establish permanent structured cooperation within the Union framework. Such cooperation shall be governed by Article 46. It shall not affect the provisions of Article 43.<br /><br />7. If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. This shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States.<br /><br />Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.<br /><br />Article 43<br /><br />1. The tasks referred to in Article 42(1), in the course of which the Union may use civilian and military means, shall include joint disarmament operations, humanitarian and rescue tasks, military advice and assistance tasks, conflict prevention and peace-keeping tasks, tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace-making and post-conflict stabilisation. All these tasks may contribute to the fight against terrorism, including by supporting third countries in combating terrorism in their territories&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;<br /><br />Article 44<br /><br />1. Within the framework of the decisions adopted in accordance with Article 43, the Council may entrust the implementation of a task to a group of Member States which are willing and have the necessary capability for such a task. Those Member States, in association with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, shall agree among themselves on the management of the task.<br /><br />2. Member States participating in the task shall keep the Council regularly informed of its progress on their own initiative or at the request of another Member State. Those States shall inform the Council immediately should the completion of the task entail major consequences or require amendment of the objective, scope and conditions determined for the task in the decisions referred to in paragraph 1. In such cases, the Council shall adopt the necessary decisions.<br /><br />Article 45<br /><br />1. The European Defence Agency referred to in Article 42(3), subject to the authority of the Council, shall have as its task to:<br /><br />(a) contribute to identifying the Member States&#39; military capability objectives and evaluating observance of the capability commitments given by the Member States;<br /><br />(b) promote harmonisation of operational needs and adoption of effective, compatible procurement methods;<br /><br />(c) propose multilateral projects to fulfill the objectives in terms of military capabilities, ensure coordination of the programmes implemented by the Member States and management of specific cooperation programmes;<br /><br />(d) support defence technology research, and coordinate and plan joint research activities and the study of technical solutions meeting future operational needs;<br /><br />(e) contribute to identifying and, if necessary, implementing any useful measure for strengthening the industrial and technological base of the defence sector and for improving the effectiveness of military expenditure.<br /><br />2. The European Defence Agency shall be open to all Member States wishing to be part of it. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall adopt a decision defining the Agency&#39;s statute, seat and operational rules. That decision should take account of the level of effective participation in the Agency&#39;s activities. Specific groups shall be set up within the Agency bringing together Member States engaged in joint projects. The Agency shall carry out its tasks in liaison with the Commission where necessary.<br /><br />Article 46<br /><br />1. Those Member States which wish to participate in the permanent structured cooperation referred to in Article 42(6), which fulfill the criteria and have made the commitments on military capabilities set out in the Protocol on permanent structured cooperation, shall notify their intention to the Council and to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.<br /><br />2. Within three months following the notification referred to in paragraph 1 the Council shall adopt a decision establishing permanent structured cooperation and determining the list of participating Member States. The Council shall act by a qualified majority after consulting the High Representative.<br /><br />3. Any Member State which, at a later stage, wishes to participate in the permanent structured cooperation shall notify its intention to the Council and to the High Representative.<br /><br />The Council shall adopt a decision confirming the participation of the Member State concerned which fulfills the criteria and makes the commitments referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on permanent structured cooperation. The Council shall act by a qualified majority after consulting the High Representative. Only members of the Council representing the participating Member States shall take part in the vote.<br /><br />A qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.<br /><br />4. If a participating Member State no longer fulfills the criteria or is no longer able to meet the commitments referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on permanent structured cooperation, the Council may adopt a decision suspending the participation of the Member State concern...</blockquote>European citizens didn't want this Treaty granting expansive military powers to Brussels any more than they want the SWIFT Agreement under which personal data on all their banking and other financial transactions will be handed over to the US (where the concept of data protection hardly exists), or the ultra-secretive ACTA agreement (which recently leaked documents show to include not only Sarkozy's extra-judicial interne
t disconnection on the basis of reported downloads but the infamous US law criminalizing the tweaking of software code to circumvent US content-industry mandated technological IP protection).   Because Brussels knew European citizens wanted none of these, they specifically weren't asked. As Charlie McCreevy  (Commissioner for Internal Market) has famously stated, "I think all of the politicians of Europe would have known quite well that if a similar question had been put to their electorate in a referendum the answer in 95 per cent of countries would have been 'No' as well.&quot; <br /><br />Post-democratic Europe is a reality. In addition to creating a totally non-transparent, non-democratic EU, powers (aka 'competences') handed over to Brussels have gone a long way to destroying real national democracy (in which citizens not only vote, but have reason to believe their vote means something) as well, as masterfully articulated in the June 30, 2009 decision of the German Constitutional Court on the constitutionality of Germany's ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.  Subsequent to this, as they say, the pig has been declared kosher. <br /><br />There is no going back to a Europe of nation states. Economic integration is too far along, and its effects have enriched and enlivened Europeans and their economies.  But Lisbon is not the way. Europe needs real democracy both for itself &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; because the alternative of having rulers who follow the increasingly military, greed-led power that the US has become is a huge step backwards &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and in order to defend the concept and practice of democracy around the world.  There are real human values at stake here. Remilitarizing Europe and cloaking it in crackpot neo-liberalism is not the solution, it is the problem.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Virginia Keyder teaches European Union law at Bogazici University and Sabanci University in Istanbul, Turkey.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Andrea Prasow of <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> says that judging from what she saw at Guantanamo last week, the new system of US military commissions established under the Military Commissions Act of 2009 fails to meet &quot;our highest standards as a nation,&quot; despite a recent pledge by US Attorney General Eric Holder...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/andreaprasow.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->L<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->ast month Attorney General Eric Holder announced that some Guantanamo detainees will be tried in federal court while others will face military commissions.  Holder assured the American public that military commissions will be "consistent with our highest standards as a nation." I am afraid he will be disappointed. <br /><br />I was in Guantanamo last week to observe the military commissions &#8212; the ones <br />blessed by both Congress and President Obama &#8212; which were designed to provide swift justice to terrorism suspects.  The hearing that took place under the new system of military commissions was a far cry from what I believe to be the highest standards of our nation. <br /><br />The defendant appearing before the military commission was Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi, a middle-aged Sudanese man who allegedly worked as Osama bin Laden's accountant in Khartoum, and later as his cook in Afghanistan. The prosecution alleges that he also served as bin Laden's bodyguard and provided logistical support to Al Qaeda. But despite having had more than five years since charges were filed to prepare for the trial, the prosecution showed up this week with a new theory of the case and a new set of charges.   <br /><br />The military commissions were originally created by presidential order in 2001.  Al Qosi was first charged before the military commissions in 2004, but those commissions were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2006. The Court ruled that the president lacked congressional authorization to establish the commissions and that they violated basic fair trial standards required by the Geneva Conventions. <br /><br />Still determined to try terrorism suspects by military commission rather than existing courts &#8212; which would have banned evidence obtained through torture and other abuse &#8212; the Bush administration went to Congress to get the necessary authorization.  Congress quickly passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006, reestablishing the military commissions with slightly improved rules. So Al Qosi was recharged under the new military commissions. <br /><br />Shortly after taking office, President Obama suspended the military commissions for 180 days. Many critics of the commissions believed the suspension was preparatory to ending the fundamentally flawed commissions.  But in May, the president announced that he planned to revive the military commissions with improved rules and asked Congress to draft legislation accordingly. The result is the Military Commissions Act of 2009. <br /><br />So last week, Al Qosi was in the hilltop courtroom overlooking Guantanamo Bay again, facing charges under the third iteration of military commissions. <br /><br />At the outset of the hearing, Judge Nancy Paul announced that she would set a trial schedule, since pre-trial motions had been under way for years now. But the prosecution said it wanted to amend the charge sheet.  One proposed amendment was relatively minor and necessary for the case to proceed.  But the others demonstrated the marked difference between a military commission and established court proceedings, as the prosecution sought to expand the charges against Al Qosi in a way that would never be permitted in a civilian court or even a court-martial.   <br /><br />Under the old Military Commissions Act of 2006, a military commission had jurisdiction over "alien unlawful enemy combatants."  However, the Military Commissions Act of 2009 provides jurisdiction only over "alien unprivileged enemy belligerents."  While this small change in language may not seem significant, a military commission can only try people who fit within the specific terms of its jurisdiction.  Therefore, if a defendant is not covered by these terms, his case must be dismissed. <br /><br />Ordinarily, any minor change to the charges doesn't require the government to withdraw the charges and refile them (as they plan to do for other detainees), so the prosecution wanted the judge to approve the change without restarting the proceedings.  Al Qosi would be charged under one version of a charge sheet today, and a different one tomorrow.  <br /><br />This sort of change is relatively straightforward, and indeed seems to be exactly what Congress intended to happen.  But as has frequently been the case at Guantanamo, prosecutors overreached.  In addition to changing the language relating to jurisdiction, the prosecution requested permission to add new overt acts to the charge sheet, and to accuse Al Qosi of conduct that took place four years before the current accusations.  <br /><br />The prosecution provided the defense with a draft of its new charge sheet just 20 minutes before the hearing started.  Defense counsel understandably appeared taken aback as they perused the proposed changes and discovered that not only did the dates of the alleged crimes go back to 1992 but the prosecution sought for the first time to charge Al Qosi with conduct that occurred in Somalia, Ethiopia and Chechnya.  Only the lawyers and the judge were allowed to see the proposed charge sheet, but it seems the prosecution wants to charge Al Qosi with participation in al Qaeda's world-wide criminal acts simply because they believe he was part of al Qaeda in the early 1990s.<br /><br />Ultimately, the judge ruled that while the prosecution could make the simple substitution of the words "alien unprivileged enemy belligerent," it could not "fundamentally alter the charges against the Accused" by expanding the scope and timeframe of the charges.  The prosecution is left to proceed with the current charge sheet, or it may choose to withdraw the charges entirely and refile them.  If it does so, the proceedings start anew. <br /><br />Not only are the charges in flux but the procedural rules that are supposed to govern the military commissions don't even exist yet.  According to the legislation Congress passed, the Secretary of Defense has 90 days to issue new regulations, which could result in significant changes to trial procedures relating to the types of evidence that are admissible.  Those new regulations are not drafted yet, but Al Qosi's case is going forward anyway.  Judge Paul believes she is bound to apply the old rules until she has new ones.  But instead of delaying the case for 90 days until there are new rules, the judge has again made Al Qosi the subject of proceedings that may ultimately be changed out from under him.      <br /><br />Meanwhile, the prosecution appears to have a new theory of Al Qosi's case &#8212; indeed of all the Guantanamo cases.  The new military commissions permit jurisdiction over an individual who was "part of al Qaeda" at the time the alleged offense was committed.  Because Al Qosi is charged with conspiracy &#8212; a wide-ranging charge that is not a traditional violation of the laws of war &#8212; the prosecution wants to hold Al Qosi responsible for any crime committed by al Qaeda.  It is for this reason that the prosecution wants to back-date Al Qosi's charge sheet to 1992.  Their theory appears to be that if they can show Al Qosi was "part of al Qaeda" in 1992, and Osama bin Laden issued fatwas against the United States in 1992, thereby commencing "hostilities" against the United States, Al Qosi can be held criminally responsible for everything al Qaeda did over the nine-
year period before he was captured.  While previously the prosecution was required to prove that the defendant's conduct occurred during "armed conflict," the new law substitutes the word "hostilities," which prosecutors seem to believe allows them to reach even more conduct. <br /><br />And so, instead of the trial date he was supposed to receive last week, Al Qosi now has a new hearing set for January at which time the government will again seek to establish that the military commissions have jurisdiction over him.  That is, unless the government withdraws the charges so that they can refile them with new allegations that fit their revised theory of the case.  <br /><br />With no word from Obama or the Department of Defense on where the military commissions will take place in the future, and whether Guantanamo will ever really be closed, it is likely Al Qosi's trial will begin at Guantanamo shortly after the president misses his deadline to close the prison. <br /><br />Eight years after he was apprehended and five years since being charged, Al Qosi may yet have his day in court &#8212; a court with markedly different rules and procedures than available to the defendants accused of actually planning the 9/11 attacks. <br /><br /><br /><em>Andrea J.

Koeltl to reconsider her sentence. The appellate panel directed Koeltl to remand Stewart to custody and the 70-year-old woman is now in prison.<br /><br />Stewart was convicted of conspiracy to provide and conceal material support to the conspiracy to murder persons in a foreign country (18 U.S.C. sec. 2339A and 18 U.S.C. sec. 2), conspiring to provide and conceal such support (18 U.S.C. sec. 371), and knowingly and willfully making false statements (18 U.S.C. sec. 1001). The majority opinion states that Stewart was convicted "principally with respect to [her] violations of those measures by which [she] had agreed to abide," namely, Special Administrative Measures (SAMs).<br /><br />The SAMs were placed on Stewart's client, Sheikh Omar Ahmad Ali Abdel Rahman, who is serving a life sentence for terrorism-related crimes. They restrict his ability to communicate with persons outside of the prison. Stewart and Abdel Rahman's other attorneys, Ramsey Clark and Abdeen Jabara, signed statements saying they wouldn't forward mail from Abdel Rahman to a third person or use their communications with Abdel Rahman to pass messages between him and third persons, including the media. Stewart violated her agreement to abide by the SAMs. Clark and Jabara allegedly did as well. Lawyers who violate SAMs expect to suffer administrative consequences, such as being denied visiting privileges. Yet Stewart was indicted for federal crimes. Clark and Jabara were not.<br /><br />Judge Koeltl presided over the nine-month trial. Stewart was precluded from arguing that a prosecution for conspiring to commit a conspiracy (an inchoate offense) raises serious dangers. Koeltl sentenced Stewart to 28 months. The maximum sentence under the federal sentencing Guidelines is 30 years but the Supreme Court held in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005) that the guidelines are advisory, not mandatory.<br /><br />Koeltl concluded that the terrorism enhancement, "while correct under the guidelines, would result in an unreasonable result." He cited "the somewhat atypical nature of Stewart's case" and "the lack of evidence that any victim was harmed as a result of the charged offense." The result of the terrorism enhancement, according to Koeltl, was "dramatically unreasonable in [her] case" because it "overstate[d] the seriousness of [her] past conduct and the likelihood that [she would] repeat the offense."  <br /><br />Stewart, Koeltl concluded, "has no criminal history and yet is placed in the highest criminal history category [under the terrorism enhancement] equal to that of repeat felony offenders for the most serious offenses including murder and drug trafficking." Koeltl found that Stewart's opportunity to repeat "the crimes to which she had been convicted will be nil" because she "will lose her license to practice law" ["itself a punishment"] and "will be forever separated from any contact with Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman."<br /><br />Koeltl viewed Stewart's personal characteristics as "extraordinary" and determined that they "argue[d] strongly in favor of a substantial downward variance" from the guidelines. He described her as a dedicated public servant who had, throughout her career, "represented the poor, the disadvantaged and the unpopular, often as a Court-appointed attorney," thereby providing a "service not only to her clients but to the nation." <br /><br />Koeltl also considered that Stewart had suffered from cancer &#8212; undergoing surgery and radiation therapy &#8212; and found a significant chance of recurrence. At age 67, Koeltl noted, prison would be "particularly difficult" for Stewart.<br /><br />Although the appellate majority stated that the district court judge is "in the best position to make an individual determination about the 'history and characteristics' of a particular defendant, and to adjust the individualized sentence accordingly," the panel second-guessed Koeltl by ordering that he reconsider Stewart's sentence. Specifically, the panel directed Koeltl to consider whether Stewart committed perjury at trial by testifying "that she understood that there was a bubble built into the SAMs whereby the attorneys could issue press releases containing Abdel Rahman's statements as part of their representation of him." The panel also directed Koeltl to consider Stewart's possibly perjured testimony about "her purported lack of knowledge" of Taha, a leader of the Islamic Group, who had solicited a statement from Abdel Rahman opposing the continuation of a ceasefire between the Islamic Group and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's government.<br /><br />In fact, Koeltl noted there was "evidence to indicate that [Stewart's] statements were false statements." But he concluded it was "unnecessary to reach [the question] whether the defendant knowingly gave false testimony with the intent to obstruct the proceedings" because (1) the Guidelines calculation already provided for the statutory maximum, and (2) a non-Guidelines sentence was, in Koeltl's estimation, "reasonable and most consistent with the factors set forth in Section 3553(a)." Thus, Koeltl did consider whether Stewart committed perjury in his initial sentencing decision. Michael Tigar, Stewart's trial counsel, told me he is "convinced that there is ample independent corroboration for Lynne's version of events."<br /><br />Judge Calabresi, who joined the majority panel decision, noted in his separate opinion that Koeltl was "a judge of extraordinary ability [with] a well-earned reputation for exceptional judgment." Calabresi wrote that "for us &#8212; who have not been involved in the case and do not know all the backs and forths, . . . to second guess the district court's judgment seems to me be precisely what both the Supreme Court and our court sitting en banc  . . . have said we should not do."<br /><br />According to Tigar, Koeltl's sentence decision was "well-argued." Tigar said, "For any court of appeals judge to write in a hostile vein about [Koeltl's] decision is an arrogation to the appellate court of a power that the rules of procedure and long legal tradition vest in trial judges. In addition," he added, "the sentence reflected the reality of this case, a reality that seems to have escaped the court of appeals panel."<br /><br />Calabresi thought it "not . . . entirely irrelevant" that Stewart was the only lawyer criminally charged even though two others also violated the SAMs. Noting that "while prosecutorial discretion may be salutary in a wide variety of cases," Calabresi wrote, "when left entirely without any controls it will concentrate too much power in a single set of government actors, and they, moreover, may on occasion be subject to political pressure." Calabresi observed that the district court's exercise of its sentencing discretion "may provide the only effective way to control and diminish unjustified disparities."<br /><br />Judge Walker, concurring and dissenting, wrote separately that Stewart's sentence was "breathtakingly low" and "extraordinarily lenient." He would go further than the majority and vacate Stewart's sentence as "substantively unreasonable."<br /><br />Both Calabresi and the ma
jority thought it significant that all of the acts for which Stewart was convicted occurred before the September 11, 2001 attacks. Calabresi would "take judicial notice of their timing," and "recognize that our attitudes about her conduct have inevitably been influenced by the tragedy of that day." Notably, he added: "We must be careful then in judging Stewart based on lessons that we learned only after her &#8212; very serious &#8212; crimes were committed." Stewart was indicted in 2002 and convicted in 2005. <br /><br />"Lynne's representation of the sheik was in the best traditions of advocacy," Tigar said. "She was brought into the case by Ramsey Clark, and her actions on behalf of her client never went farther than Ramsey had already gone. The government's conduct towards her when the  SAMs issue first erupted validated that belief."<br /><br />The clear message of the 125-page majority appellate panel opinion is that attorneys who zealously represent their clients in the post-9/11 era beware. This result will undoubtedly chill the willingness of criminal defense attorneys to handle terrorism cases. Moreover, the Court of Appeals fortuitously released its opinion just as Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intent to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in federal court for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and immediate past president of the National Lawyers Guild.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://doebbler.net/aboutus.aspx">Curtis  Doebbler</a> of An-Najah National University Faculty of Law in Nablus on the Palestinian West Bank, says that if the UN formally recognizes Palestine as a state it will rightfully validate the views of the Palestinian people and many states in the international community while discouraging the theory that &quot;might makes right&quot; in the context of international border disputes ....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/curtisdoebbler.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>ith the Palestinian authorities in Ramallah seeking recognition of a Palestinian state through the United Nations, it is important to consider what this means both to Palestinians and to the rest of the world. <br /><br />States are the predominant actors in the international community. They are the main actors that create, implement, and are subject to international law&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;a system of rules initially established by Western states that is now widely accepted as governing relations between all states.<br /><br />As statehood will have a significant effect on how Palestine is considered, and likely treated, by the international community, it is important to consider Palestinians' entitlement to statehood and what it means. International law provides a common denominator that can be used to answer this question.<br /><br />As the UN General Assembly lacks the power to do more than make recommendations, the starting point for Palestinian statehood or independence is not UN General Assembly Resolution 181 which recommended that two states be created on Palestinian territory. Instead it is the right to self-determination that the Palestinian people have as the indigenous people of Palestine. This right is perhaps the most notable human right in the United Nations. It is the only human right expressly recognised in the Charter of the United Nations, where articles 1, 55, and 73 acknowledge it. The right to self-determination is an essential &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the most essential for many states &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; part of customary international law and has been declared one of the most basic principles of customary international law by the UN General Assembly's Declaration on the Principles of International Law concerning the Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States.<br /><br />The right to self-determination has been explicitly recognised as applicable to the situation of the Palestinian people by the UN General Assembly for more than 30 years. To this end it established the <em>Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People</em> in 1975 to work towards the realisation of this right. This right provides all peoples, including the Palestinian people, the right to determine their own future. It is a right that Israelis did not enjoy in Palestinian territory when they unilaterally declared their state in violation of Palestinians' right to self-determination. The Palestinian right to self-determination pre-existed any effort by Israel to occupy Palestinian lands. It is a right that all Palestinians are entitled to exercise according to international law since at least the 1920s. It is thus a right that is enjoyed over all of the territory over which the British Mandate was approved by the League of Nations in 1922.<br /><br />This does not mean that Palestinians are required to exercise this right, but if they wish to do so they are entitled to do so. They need no permission from anyone else. Indeed, today more than half the states in the international community recognise Palestine as a state. <br /><br />Although Palestine may already be considered a state by most of the international community, the consequences of recognition by the United Nations General Assembly could add significantly to Palestine's rights and responsibilities. A good way to understand how and why this will be the case is to reflect on the constituents of statehood and what they mean.<br /><br />According to established customary international law, which is now reflected in the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States dating back to 1933, a state should have: a) a permanent population; b) a defined territory; c) a government; and d) the ability to enter into foreign relations with other states. There can be little doubt that Palestine satisfies all of these criteria. Indeed, on 15 November 1988 when almost all the senior leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) declared Palestine an independent state to ensure the "everlasting union between itself, its land, and its history," they undoubtedly believed that all of these criteria were met. <br /><br />Palestine indeed has a permanent population. This population includes not only the estimated more than four million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but also an estimated more than three million additional Palestinians who have been forced from their land or forced to become Israelis by the involuntary inclusion of their lands under Israeli jurisdiction. While Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip meet the requirement for a permanent population, all seven million Palestinians in the world are entitled to Palestinian nationality and to live in Palestine if the government of Palestine wishes this to be the case.<br /><br />Similarly the territory of Palestine is well defined. It was not defined in 1967 or even 1948, but was defined by the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. The occupation of Palestine is often considered to have begun after the 1967 war. This assumption is based largely on the questionable legality and legitimacy of the United Nations' handling of this situation. The Security Council's decision demanding a ceasefire after the 1967 war and the General Assembly's decision to create two separate states on the territory inhabited by Palestinians 20 years earlier both give the impression that Israel only violated Palestinians' right to self-determination when it occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip subsequent to the 1967 war. A better legal date for the start of the occupation is 14 May 1948, when Israel declared a Jewish state. This is the date on which Israel legally took Palestinian land; and acted in a manner that made it clear it intended to deny the Palestinian people the right to self-determination. <br /><br />That the United Nations subsequently ratified the existence of Israel as a state in the international community cannot abolish the Palestinians' right to self-determination. By the same token it cannot change the boundaries in which this right may be exercised. Even Israel's continued and ever-expanding oppressive occupation of the Palestinian people cannot extinguish the Palestinians' right to self-determination throughout all of the territory under the League of Nations mandate, minus that part in which the indigenous Hashimites founded their own state of Jordan in exercise of their right to self-determination. <br /><br />Again this does not mean that Palestinians have to claim all of the territory under the League of Nations mandate as their homeland. They can negotiate part of the land away if they wish. But they cannot be denied as having the right to do so in the first place, and the international community cannot, within the realm of international law, deny that Palestine's borders are legally based on those that existed before 1948 when Israel proclaimed itself a state. <br /><br />A very important consequence of understanding Palestine's borders in this way is that any changes should be negotiated from this legal starting point. Thus if Palestinians wish to recognise Israel they should do so knowing that they are ceding rights they have under international law. Perhaps, however, long-lasting peace is worth this trade off.<br /><br />Thus, it is
certainly possible for the Palestinian people to agree to accept the 1948 borders, the 1967 borders or any other borders they wish. It might mean, for example, that if necessary, entirely new territorial boundaries can be negotiated, perhaps to give two states viable, instead of divided, borders. What is clear is that Palestine has defined borders. Whether these borders are disputed is another question that is not a hindrance to statehood because legally these borders exist.<br /><br />Similarly, despite the ongoing dispute between the Palestinian authorities in Ramallah and those in Gaza, Palestine indisputably has a government. The government is currently divided between the authorities in Gaza who are commonly known by their association to Hamas, a liberation movement whose candidates in the Peace and Change Party were elected in a significant majority to be the government of the Palestinian people. The modality through which these elections took place was based on the Oslo Accords' provision for a Palestinian Authority with the power to govern Palestinians. These accords have unfortunately been repeatedly ignored, but no one can ignore the fact that Hamas officials were elected by a fair and free election that reflects the will of the Palestinian people.<br /><br />The other part of the government are the authorities in Ramallah who first refused to cooperate with the elected government and then tried to oust it by force, only to be rebuked and driven out of Gaza. Only the president, Mahmoud Abbas, is elected and his term has already expired without new elections being held, although they are currently scheduled for 2010. <br /><br />Like Hamas, the Fatah-controlled PLO is a resistance movement. It was founded in 1964. It was recognised as a National Liberation Movement (NLM) having observer status by the United Nations in 1974. The UN has also recognised that NLMs are entitled to struggle against foreign and oppressive occupation, and even to use armed force to do so. Thus while usually assisting the use of force against a member state of the United Nations violates international law, NLM movements fighting for self-determination are an exception to this prohibition, although they are still bound to use force in accordance with the rules of international humanitarian law.<br /><br />The fact that Hamas and Fatah/the PLO remain divided does not mean that Palestine does not have a government, but merely that the authority of the government is in dispute. The dispute is between Palestinian leaders who have been elected and the unelected leaders of the Palestinian people. The Palestinians will have to resolve this dispute to obtain their full potential, but not necessarily to be recognised as a state.<br /><br />Finally, Palestine's ability to enter into foreign affairs is widely recognised. As already pointed out, more than half the states in the international community recognise Palestine as a state. This is the ultimate recognition of the ability to enter into foreign affairs. <br /><br />The 21 other states of the Arab League, for example, already recognise Palestine as a state. So too do the 56 other member states of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC). Even the late Palestinian President Yasser Arafat had letterhead that designated him as the president of Palestine.<br /><br />Palestine is represented in more than a hundred states. Most of these are representatives of the PLO, but the authorities in Gaza are also establishing representative offices abroad. Already in 1982 the UN Office of Legal Affairs was able to conclude that, "[t]he overwhelming majority of states formally recognise the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people and have established direct links with it on a bilateral basis, sometimes even granting it full diplomatic status." <br /><br />While it is rather clear that Palestine meets all the criteria that entitle it to statehood, it is less clear what this means. <br /><br />In first instance, it means that Palestine will join the international community of states as an equal member entitled to the same respect for its sovereign territorial and political integrity as every other state. <br /><br />This would likely increase the pressure on Israel to withdraw from at least some Palestinian territory it occupies, but it would also increase the pressure on Palestine to ensure control over all of its territory and the persons acting on it. This latter obligation might not be easy to meet unless Palestinians define their government in a manner that will require all Palestinians living in Palestine to answer to the same unified government.<br /><br />As a state, Palestine would have the responsibility of exercising its police powers over all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip within the borders that constitute the State of Palestine. <br /><br />As a state, Palestine would also have strong arguments for removing, by force if necessary, Israeli settlements that are scattered throughout the West Bank. <br />As a state, Palestine could form its own army and trade goods and arms with any other state.<br /><br />If the Security Council recommended and the General Assembly, in accordance with article 4 of the Charter of the UN decided to admit Palestine to membership in the UN as a states, Palestine be able to fully participate in the United Nations as it already does in the OIC and Arab League. In fact Palestine is already recognised as a full member of the Asian Group of States in the UN, and often thereby submits and influences UN resolutions. Being a member state would also give the Palestinian representative to the UN the right to vote on General Assembly resolutions, among other UN decisions.<br /><br />At the moment, the Palestinian representatives to the UN &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; as are most Palestinian foreign representatives &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; are chosen by the Fatah-backed PLO. They point out correctly that they represent Palestine as a NLM that has been given observer status. If Palestine becomes a state represented in the UN, then the decision will have to made as to whether to allow the elected representatives of the Palestinian people to decide who represents them at the UN or to continue to allow unelected Palestinians, mostly from the political party that the people of Palestine rejected, to decide who represents the Palestinian people. This is a decision that both the Palestinian people and the member states of the United Nations will have to make.<br /><br />While the role of Palestine will be enhanced formally within the UN, it would seem hard to improve upon the goodwill that Palestinians already enjoy from the overwhelming majority of states. The fact that Palestine is now a peer inter pares might even lead to political competition that creates a more difficult environment for Palestine at the UN. It will also make Palestine a direct negotiating partner with Israel over issues between those two states, irrespective of whether or not the State of Palestine would recognise Israel as a state. Importantly, this could lead to using the UN &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and no longer the biased mediator of the United States or its Western allies &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; as the forum for negotiations of a final settlement to the dispute between Israel and Palestine. In fact, using any other forum than the UN to end this dispute would appear somewhat odd.<br /><br />Even the recognition of Palestine as a state by the United Nations General Assembly would enhance the recognition already given to Palestine by the majority of states of the international community. It could also contribute to ending the myth believed by a small minority of the world &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and sometimes even the Palestinians themselves &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; for more than 60 years: That might makes right and Israel is indivisible.<br /><br /><br /><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Doebbler">Curtis F.J.

Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) would dismantle whatever vestige of meaningful immigration enforcement that the Obama administration has been unable to eviscerate by executive fiat. While calling for enforcement against employers who hire illegal aliens, CIR ASAP would eliminate the only existing &#8212; and highly effective &#8212; employment eligibility verification system, known as E-Verify. E-Verify would be replaced by some yet to be developed system that could take decades to implement. Also eliminated by CIR ASAP would be the ability of state and local law enforcement to assist in immigration enforcement, except in extenuating circumstances.<br /><br />With some 25 million Americans unemployed or underemployed, CIR ASAP would also make millions of illegal aliens immediately eligible to compete for every available job in the United States. Introduced one week after the Washington Post presented alarming evidence that the children of recent immigrants not only aren&#39;t prospering, but are falling farther behind other Americans, CIR ASAP would add countless millions more people who are likely to be mired in poverty. <br /><br />In addition to amnesty for many millions of illegal aliens, H.R. 4321 would vastly increase both family-based and employment-based immigration in the future. These increases are designed to meet the demands of immigrant advocates and business interests, irrespective of the impact these policies might have on American workers, taxpayers, or any other consideration important to the American people.<br /><br />Americans have grown distrustful of their government because much of what goes on in Washington often seems to put the interests of the American people as an afterthought. In CIR ASAP, the interests of the American people are given no thought at all.&quot;<br />

		<title>Closing Guantanamo does not itself grant detainees greater due process rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.hudson.org/learn/index.cfm?fuseaction=staff_bio&eid=Elizabeth%20Samson"><strong>Elizabeth Samson</strong></a> [Visiting Fellow, <a href="http://www.hudson.org/">Hudson Institute</a>]: &quot;On January 22, 2009, President Obama issued an executive order to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay within a year and on December 15 he <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/obama-administration-to-house.php">announced</a> his plan to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the Thompson Correctional Center in Illinois.  The President is trying to make good on his campaign promise to close the Guantanamo prison - the controversial detention facility which has become a symbol of all that has gone wrong in the war on terror - and to separate the policies of his administration from those of former President George W. Bush.  It appears, though, that this move provides no guaranteed benefit, either for the detainees or the American public.  <br /><br />The President&#39;s <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/presdocs/2009/DCPD200900013.htm">stated</a> intent in closing Guantanamo is to &quot;restore the standards of due process and the core constitutional values that have made this country great even in the midst of war, even in dealing with terrorism.&quot;  But it is an empty gesture for two reasons.  The first is that no one knows precisely what the legal consequences of the detainee&#39;s transfer will be, and the second is that even if they are granted expanded legal rights the President wants to hold prisoners in preventive detention for an indefinite period.<br /><br />Presently, legal recourse available to detainees in Guantanamo is very limited.  They have some due process rights that allow for hearings to determine their status as enemy combatants, they have the right to counsel, and they also have the right to file a writ of habeas corpus to challenge their detention as unlawful, a right the US Supreme Court confirmed through a series of cases [see <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/542/466/case.html">Rasul v. Bush</a>, <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/542/507/case.html">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a>, and <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/553/06-1195/">Boumediene v. Bush</a>].  <br /><br />The government has argued that while the detainees remain in Guantanamo they do not have constitutional rights beyond those mentioned above because they are being held outside the United States.  Once the detainees enter the US, however, a legal Pandora&#39;s Box will be opened.  Their ability to challenge their detention and test the boundaries of our legal system could be limitless because they will be able to access the rights and protections of the US Constitution that every American enjoys.  But, it is not known at this point to what extent the courts will grant them those rights.<br /><br />Even if the courts find that the prisoners are entitled to greater constitutional protections on US soil, President Obama has expressed that he would like to hold some prisoners in indefinite preventive detention.  In the case of <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/542/507/case.html">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a>, the Supreme Court held that the President can exercise the executive authority to detain non-US citizens who are enemy combatants offshore for the duration of an ongoing military engagement, and at the cessation of hostilities the detainees must be released.  There is currently no statute that allows for domestic preventive detention, but the administration is arguing that they can be held as terror suspects because they pose a danger to Americans if released either into the US or abroad.<br /><br />While the President said that closing Guantanamo was a demonstration of the US taking the &quot;moral high ground,&quot; the truth is that the transfer of the detainees to Illinois may only give the appearance that they will be tried at some point, but it is not a promise that a hearing will be forthcoming.  In light of these facts, closing Guantanamo provides no assurance that the detainees will be afforded greater due process rights, either by the courts granting those rights or by the President allowing the prisoners to exercise them.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.amnestyusa.org/author/tom-parker/"><strong>Tom Parker</strong></a> [Policy Director, (Counter) Terrorism and Human Rights, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International USA</a>]: &quot;The Obama administration&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/obama-administration-to-house.php">announcement</a> that it intends to move &quot;War on Terror&quot; detainees not cleared for release to the Thomson Correctional Facility changes very little beyond enabling President Obama to honor the letter, if not the spirit, of his pledge to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. <br /><br />What this decision in fact demonstrates is a lasting commitment to two ideas that President Obama rejected as a candidate: Military Commissions and indefinite detention without charge. <br /><br />Military Commissions amount to little more than a cynical attempt to create a trial format with a sufficiently low burden of proof that it will admit evidence that could not be used in a real court. The concept of indefinite detention violates one of the most fundamental tenets of American - and international - justice that every defendant has a right to challenge his accusers in court. Both set disastrous precedents. <br /><br />The decision to move the detainees will also have little positive impact on the position of the detainees themselves - indeed it will most likely further retard cases already unconscionably delayed. Nor will their day-to-day lives be improved, it is likely to be quite a while before the recreational facilities at Thomson match those now on offer at Guantanamo. <br /><br />The bottom line is that the Obama administration is not fooling anyone either at home or abroad. Changing Guanatanmo&#39;s zip code does not make indefinite detention any less palatable or military commissions any more legitimate. <br /><br />Sadly, the good citizens of Thomson, Illinois, should get used to the idea that the name of their hometown will soon join Guantanamo and Abu Garaib as a shorthand term for American double standards and that it will likely become as effective a recruitment tool for Al Qaeda as its predecessors.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/french/staff/gr.html"><strong>Gino Raymond</strong></a> [Professor of Modern French Studies, <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/">University of Bristol, UK</a>]: &quot;For most commentators in France, the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/france-prosecutors-ask-judge-to-drop.php">decision</a> by French state prosecutors that former president Jacques Chirac had no case to answer regarding his alleged financial improprieties during his time as mayor of Paris, left only the theoretical possibility that the examining magistrate handling the allegations, Xavi&egrave;re Simeoni, would nonetheless press ahead with the investigation. Her decision at the end of October 2009 to do just that has set in train a series of twists in the affair that, paradoxically, appear both extremely surprising and guided by fate. As a result of Simeoni&#39;s decision, during the course of 2010, and for the first time in the history of the French Fifth Republic, a former president will have to answer charges in court. More precisely, Chirac and at least nine other accused will have to answer <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/france-judge-orders-probe-of-chirac.php">charges</a> that they participated in a system of rewarding their parties&#39; financial backers and other allies with fictional but remunerated employment in the municipal administration of Paris, notably the 35 posts allegedly identified during the period 1983-1998.<br /><br />Chirac&#39;s immediate response to the media was to assert that he remained &quot;serene&quot; faced with the prospect of such an appearance in court, even though a guilty verdict would potentially entail a custodial sentence and a fine substantially larger than his president&#39;s pension. For political insiders, however, Chirac has finally become victim to a fateful irony of his own making. Throughout his political career, Chirac has sought to dominate the fractious centre-right in France by trading on, and whenever necessary, by betraying loyalty. After his acrimonious resignation as President Val&eacute;ry Giscard-d&#39;Estaing&#39;s prime minister in 1976, Chirac successfully campaigned to become Mayor of Paris, transforming the city into his political power base, while at the same time taking over the Gaullist party in order to turn it into a vehicle for his presidential ambitions. Chirac&#39;s talent for exploiting, and when necessary sacrificing, the ambitions of his subordinates became most evident after his election to the presidency in 1995. After appearing to support his prime minister, Alain Jupp&eacute;, during the winter of discontent in France in 1995/96, Chirac sacked him when someone had to take the blame for the economic pain as France prepared to drop the franc in favour of the euro as its national currency. Jupp&eacute;&#39;s woes continued when in 2004 he was tried and found guilty of, inevitably, trading in fictional posts in the local government of Paris. As Chirac&#39;s second presidential mandate drew to a close, he manoeuvred Dominique de Villepin into the prime ministerial role in an effort to block the ascent of the man who had overtaken Chirac as the darling of the Gaullists, Nicolas Sarkozy. Within a year of Chirac&#39;s departure from office, de Villepin found himself under investigation for allegedly conspiring to smear Sarkozy. Now, bereft of his presidential power and privileges, it appears that Chirac may finally have to account for his actions, while the political parvenu he had despised, Sarkozy, sets about creating a quasi-monarchical court around himself at the Elys&eacute;e palace.<br /><br />Another irony attached to Xavi&egrave;re Simeoni&#39;s decision lies in the fact that if the legal reforms proposed by the Sarkozy administration pass into legislation, examining magistrates will no longer be able to act with the independence displayed by Mme Simeoni. Public opinion in France was much moved by the televised testimony of parents before a parliamentary commission in 2006, after their acquittal following charges of child abuse. The picture that emerged of the examining magistrate handling the case, an inexperienced and gullible young man called Fabrice Burgaud, showed to what extent a magistrate could abuse his or her independence, allowing a supposedly impartial representative of the law to pursue a ruthlessly biased investigation. The subsequent proposal to bring examining magistrates more closely under the supervision of state prosecutors, while on the face of things appearing to satisfy the public clamour for fairer justice, would also bring magistrates under closer political control by the justice ministry and make them less likely to embarrass the governing class in future.<br /><br />Finally, the ripest irony attached to Chirac&#39;s prospective trial is to be found in the reaction of the now socialist-led municipality of Paris. A major figure in the French Socialist Party and mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delano&euml;, has suggested that the municipal authorities might withdraw their accusations of corruption against Chirac and that he has always respected the man and been on good terms with him. This apparent clemency may not be unrelated to the fact that the Delano&euml; administration is itself under threat of investigation for its award of certain building contracts in Paris. In spite of the quiet satisfaction in certain parts of the political establishment that Chirac may be brought to book as an individual, the revelation of systemic failure is not the outcome they would wish for.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Roland Adjovi of Arcadia University in Arusha, Tanzania, says that to gain and maintain credibility in the wake of its first judgment, the African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights should streamline its policy rationale and procedure, thereby expediting its decision-making process....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/rolandadjovi.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->O<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->n December 15, 2009, the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights issued its first ever <a href="http://www.african-court.org/fileadmin/documents/Court/Latest_Judgments/Judgment_15_December_2009.pdf">judgment</a>.   The Court convened to consider a petition filed by Michelot Yogogombaye encouraging the dismissal of charges pending in Senegal against former Chadian president Hissein Habre.  Yogogombaye is believed to have been a minister for a short time under Habre's former regime.<br /><br />Yogogombaye was born on October 1, 1959.  He is the founding president of the Rassemblement D&Atilde;&copy;mocratique pour la Paix et la Libert&Atilde;&copy; au Tchad (RDPL), an opposition political party in Chad.  He is also the <a href="http://www.letchadanthropus-tribune.com/declaration%20michelot.html">self proclaimed president</a> of the military rebellion in Europe against the current Chadian regime.  In the late 1980's, while Habr&Atilde;&copy; was still in power, Yogogombaye was arrested but freed some two weeks later, even though he seems to have been a supporter of Habre's regime.  In December 1990, after Idriss D&Atilde;&copy;by won the presidential election against Hissein Habr&Atilde;&copy;, Yogogombaye maintained some political activities until 1992 when he quickly fled the country for Switzerland, where he currently resides.  It appears therefore that he has consistently and <a href="http://librafrique.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=389">openly supported</a> Habr&Atilde;&copy;.   In August 2008, he even stated that he was ready to testify before the Senegalese judges to support <a href="http://www.ndjamena-matin.com/article-21654974.html">"[his] President, El-Hadj Hissein Habr&Atilde;&copy;"</a>.  <br /><br />The purpose of the preceding consideration of the applicant is twofold.  First, it is difficult to make sense of the interest Yogogombaye has in the case again Habr&Atilde;&copy; which would have supported his application, thus giving him standing.  In addition, it is clear that Yogogombaye has a political agenda which led him to file the application in the first place.  In that context, his adherence to the military opposition against the current regime in Chad is a key additional element.  In his application, Yogogombaye argued that being a citizen of Chad is sufficient grounds for the jurisdiction <em>ratione personae</em> of the Court, and such argument could have been easily dismissed.<br /><br />The application was dated August 18, 2008, delivered to the African Union Commission (AUC) by e-mail on August 19, 2008, and addressed to the African Court both directly and indirectly (through the AUC).  But it was only effectively delivered to the African Court on December 29, 2008 (with a cover letter dated November 2008 from the Legal Counsel) through the African Union Commission. In the application, Yogogombaye requested that the African Court order the discontinuance of the case against Habr&Atilde;&copy; in Senegal, particularly on the bases of a purported violation of the non-retroactivity principle and alleged political abuse of the universal jurisdiction principle.  Yogogombaye also requested the use of Ubuntu, a typically African means for conflict resolution.  The aim of the application is certainly to put an end to the saga  against Habr&Atilde;&copy; and to free Habre after years of house arrest. <br /><br />The pleadings of the Republic of S&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;gal were centered on the Court's lack of jurisdiction on the basis that Senegal has not consented to the right of individuals to lodge cases against it before the Court. <br /><br />The Court's December 15th judgment seems quite straightforward as well as in line with the pleadings of S&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;gal.  The 1998 Protocol establishing the Court states that an individual can only lodge a case against States who have made a declaration to the effect of granting individuals such right.   In the present case, despite a statement by the applicant to the contrary,  the Court found that the Republic of Senegal has never granted individuals the right to lodge any case against it before the Court. <br /><br />Such a simple response does not warrant six months of deliberation, let alone nearly twelve months of deliberation.  In fact, in his separate opinion Judge Ouguergouz, producing a reason very much enriched by his prior experience at the International Court of Justice, stated that the Applicant ought to know why it took so long for the Court to come to a decision.<br /><br />Judge Ouguergouz went on to detail his own thorough analysis of the complexity of the case as far as jurisdiction is concerned.  In that framework, he developed the concept of forum prorogatum, which would have led the Judges to think that the Republic of S&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;gal, through its attitude, seems to have consented to the proceedings. He consequently questioned whether any application should ever have just been dismissed by the Registry when it could not be excluded that the State would consent to such application. While the argument remains technical &#8212; even though quite well explained &#8212; it is difficult for one to satisfy oneself with this first judgment of the Court.<br /><br />Although the simplicity of the questions posed by the Court would seem to warrant simple and clear responses, it took almost a year for the Court to come up with a decision.  In addition, the judgment was only 13 pages long, with some three pages dedicated to an elucidation of the Court's actual reasons and the remaining pages being devoted to the facts and procedural details.  What message does such management of the first case convey to the communities in Arusha, in Africa, and worldwide?  Will the Africans and the residents in Africa still believe that the Court is going to do justice to them?  The Court will need to improve its pace in deciding cases and the caliber of its reasoning.  <br /><br />In addition, there have been issues with the transparency of the proceedings; for instance, the judgment reveals that some interim orders were made during the course of the proceedings.  But none of those orders were ever made public even though nowhere in the Judgment was it stated that they were confidential.  Moreover, the references in the judgment to those orders were missing, and one cannot trace them for a comprehensive understanding of the case and the procedure.  The same can be said for the case file: the documents of the proceedings (especially the application and the pleadings) have not been published to the best of our knowledge  even though the Court has not stated whether they are confidential or not.  However, those documents are summarized in the Judgment without any further explanation.  Can justice be seen to have been served in such circumstances? The Court will gain respect, prestige, and good publicity if its judges and civil servants streamline the Court's procedure and policy.  <br /><br />Finally, one might wonder whether the parties were duly informed of the issuance of the Judgment as neither of the two was present.  It seems unlikely that such absence should be analyzed by a lack of interest from each of them, especially from the Applicant's side. <br /><br />In conclusion, this judgment was slightly deceptive, but one must hold on to the hope hope that in serious cases
&#8212; possibly regarding Burkina Faso or Mali, the two countries that have granted individuals the power to lodge applications against them &#8212; the Court will be able to substantially serve justice.<br /><br /><br /><em>Roland Adjovi is the academic director of the Nyerere Centre for Peace Research and the Centre for East African Studies of Arcadia University&#39;s College of Global Studies in Arusha, Tanzania</em>.<br />
