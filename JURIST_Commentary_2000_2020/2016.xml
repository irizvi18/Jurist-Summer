		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.usnwc.edu/Academics/Faculty/Jason-Coats,-MAJ.aspx">Jason Coats</a> of the <a href="https://www.usnwc.edu/home.aspx">US Naval War College</a> discusses the investigations into the legitimacy of reports concerning ISIS...</p><strong>O</strong>n December 11, the Chairmen of three House of Representatives committees&#8212;the <a href="http://intelligence.house.gov/">Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence</a> (HPSCI), the <a href="http://appropriations.house.gov/about/members/defense.htm">Armed Services Committee and Appropriations Committee's Defense Subcommittee</a> (APCDS)&#8212;announced the establishment of a joint task force to investigate allegations that senior members of the <a href="http://www.centcom.mil/">US Central Command</a> (CENTCOM) manipulated intelligence products prior to providing them to national policy makers. The task force is additionally inquiring into whether the allegations reflect a greater systemic problem in CENTCOM's intelligence operations. </p>

<p>This is the most recent reaction to claims that surfaced in August regarding tampering with intelligence assessments. The committees have previously looked into the matter on their own accord and the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> Inspector General (DoD IG) is likewise undertaking an investigation. The allegations and subsequent investigations can be confusing given the Intelligence Community's (IC) complex organizational structure and its assorted oversight mechanisms. Nevertheless the CENTCOM situation usefully illustrates how allegations of misconduct are addressed, particularly when involving DoD personnel.</p>

<p>This contribution to JURIST opens with a brief overview of reactions to the CENTCOM accusations. It then describes the organization of the IC and its oversight mechanisms. Lastly I suggest a number of outcomes that could result should any of the investigations uncover wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The NYT <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/world/middleeast/pentagon-investigates-allegations-of-skewed-intelligence-reports-on-isis.html?_r=0">reported</a> in late August that the DoD IG had launched an investigation into allegations that CENTCOM military officials had skewed intelligence assessments regarding the campaign against the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL) in an effort to paint a rosier picture than was merited. The following month The Daily Beast <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/09/exclusive-50-spies-say-isis-intelligence-was-cooked.html">asserted</a> that CENTCOM higher-ups edited intelligence reports to support the administration's claim that the US is winning the battle against ISIS and al Nusra, al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria. A civilian Defense Intelligence Agency analyst working within CENTCOM levied, at least in part, the allegations.  </p>

<p>The number and respective scope of investigations have evolved since the accusations surfaced. The DoD IG appears to be limiting its inquiry to the intelligence assessments regarding ISIS in Iraq in Syria. Prior to announcement of the joint task force, the congressional committees with IC oversight responsibilities have demonstrated varying degrees of deference to the DoD IG review. Although the Senate Intelligence Committee (SIC) conducted a few interviews early on its chairman has stated that the DoD review should be allowed to play out (SIC is not included in the joint task force and its deference will presumably continue). The HPSCI staff prior to formation of the joint task force combed through years of CENTCOM intelligence reports and compared them to non-DoD reports such as those generated by the CIA. Additionally the HPSCI review <a href="http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/ISRPerformanceAudit%20Final.pdf"> included</a> [PDF] intelligence reports regarding Afghanistan and other areas under CENTCOM's purview. The House Armed Service Committee also initiated its own inquiry. The joint task force combines the efforts of the House committees and will presumably maintain a broad scope of review across all of CENTCOM's area of responsibility.</p>

<p>Since its genesis in the <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/national-security-act">National Security Act of 1947</a> the IC has gradually developed into sixteen Executive entity membership. It is headed by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). The DoD's membership includes, among others, the Service-component (i.e., Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) intelligence assets and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The DIA was established in 1961 by then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to deal with the issue of biased intelligence reporting by the individual services' intelligence offices. Prior to then military intelligence assessments often conflicted, frequently reflecting Service interests. The directive establishing the DIA tasked it with producing all DoD intelligence estimates and providing the DoD input to the National Intelligence Estimates. By making the DIA directly reportable to the secretary of defense the intent was to eliminate service bias and inaccuracy from intelligence assessments meant to support policy making. Today the intelligence office at a DoD combatant command, such as CENTCOM, is composed of personnel from multiple intelligence organizations, both DoD and non-DoD. They share information and support each other's activities, but also conduct their own intelligence activities and generate independent products. Because the DIA assets embedded in CENTCOM report directly to the secretary of defense, they should be insulated from any potential CENTCOM influence and bias. </p>

<p>All members of the IC are subject to, broadly speaking, the same oversight and regulation. For the most part the Executive Branch exercises oversight through Executive Orders (EO) and directives, while the Legislative Branch does so through statutes, appropriations and hearings. The Office of the DNI's (ODNI) recent Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203 (January 2015) <a href="https://fas.org/irp/dni/icd/icd-203.pdf">dictates</a> [PDF] five analytic standards that the IC is required to follow, one of which is independence from political consideration. To this end "[a]nalytic judgments must not be influenced by the force of preference for a particular policy." ICD 203 provides the standards which intelligence agencies including those operating within CENTCOM, are expected to maintain.</p>

<p>To ensure compliance with applicable directives an IG office at most Executive Branch entities serves as an independent and objective body for receiving complaints and conducting investigations, reviews and audits. Congress created the ODNI's <a href="http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about/organization/office-of-the-intelligence-community-inspector-general-who-we-are">Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community in the National Intelligence Authorization Act of 2010</a>. While the IG is the DNI's investigative asset it must also notify Congress whenever it determines allegations are credible. Upon receiving the initial accusations involving CENTCOM the ODNI IG informed the appropriate congressional committees and the DoD IG, prompting initiation of the latter's investigation. The DoD IG's inquiry is reviewing CENTCOM's intelligence reporting processes and the conduct of those involved to evaluate compliance with applicable operating procedures, regulations and law.</p>

<p>Congressional oversight of the IC has slowly developed since enactment of the National Security Act of 1947. As my colleague Major Christopher Ford has described the tightening of this oversight has resulted from periods of IC improprieties, two of which are of significant note. The first occurred in the 1970s with public discovery of Army Intelligence collection on American citizens participating in the <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/vietnam-war-protests">Vietnam antiwar movement</a> and of CIA involvement in the Watergate scandal. Ad hoc congressional inquiries substantiated these allegations and subsequently motivated establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and HPSCI. The second period of significance was discovery of covert intelligence operations in the early 1980s that involved the sale of arms to Iran in order to facilitate the freeing of American hostages that country held and to fund guerillas in Central America (the "<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/reagan-iran/">Iran-Contra Affair</a>"). In response Congress significantly increased the President's reporting requirements in advance of certain intelligence operations via the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/101/hr5422">Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991</a>. Today a number of congressional committees exercise oversight of the IC. These committees utilize hearings to investigate potential misconduct, as well as inform the public of allegations of impropriety. Congress also exercises its power of the purse over the annual intelligence authorization legislation as an additional means of oversight. Because these oversight measures apply to the IC in its entirety, they directly impact CENTCOM intelligence operations.</p>

<p>A number of possibilities exist as to the consequences of the ongoing investigations. IG investigations and records, barring special justification and authorization, may not be used for adverse action (i.e., reprimand or position/employment termination) against the individuals involved. Instead they are generally utilized to amend procedures and improve processes. Adverse action or criminal prosecution must rely upon separate command and/or criminal investigations. Such inquiries may be taking place but no acknowledgement to that effect has been publicly made. Accordingly the most that may be expected from the DoD IG investigation is institutional and procedural reform.</p>

<p>Should the congressional inquiries substantiate improprieties the committees with oversight responsibilities will likely pressure the Executive and DoD to "tighten the reigns" on intelligence operating procedures, as well as remove those senior officials responsible for the behavior. Congress could also mandate greater oversight measures, such as additional reporting requirements, in the next intelligence appropriations legislation. A potential wildcard does exist. Former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel recently <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/24/politics/defense-secretary-hagel-to-step-down/">described</a> the hostility he felt from members of the Obama Administration when he publicly voiced his opinion on the formidability of ISIS. If the congressional investigations discover that intelligence assessment manipulation is somehow attributable to the administration, Congress may respond by imposing oversight measures designed to insulate the IC from administration influence. </p>

<p>Yet the effort to address the CENTCOM incident may also serve as an example of the IC working properly. Although the DIA was established to remove bias and manipulation from intelligence reporting, no system is flawless. In this case suspect conduct in the provision of intelligence assessments was brought to light and investigated on multiple levels.  Therefore the incident may well reinforce the sufficiency of IC oversight measures. Whether this will eventuate depends of course, on those actions taken to respond to any misconduct that may be discovered. </p>

Matthews discusses discriminatory No Promo Homo laws...</j:header></p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he US Supreme Court recently decided in favor of same-sex marriage in the long awaited case of <a href=" http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> [PDF]. As a supporter of LGBT rights, this decision makes me uneasy. I worry this decision will be seen as the end of the gay rights movement. Mission accomplished, time to go home. The gay rights movement has been so focused on marriage rights that other discriminatory laws have been overlooked or ignored. My hope is that instead the decision will be a stepping stone towards eradicating these laws across the nation. </p>

<p>No Promo Homo laws are the most discriminatory laws you have never heard of. Hidden in education laws, they restrict the promotion of homosexuality in public school classrooms by prohibiting the teaching of homosexuality or requiring its condemnation. They exist in eight states: Alabama, Arizona, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah. For example <a href=" http://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title53A/Chapter13/53A-13-S101.html?v=C53A-13-S101_1800010118000101">Utah</a> requires their board of education to prohibit instruction in the "advocacy of homosexuality." A more egregious <a href=" http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/txstatutes/PE/5/21/21.06">Texas law</a> requires teaching that homosexuality is "not an acceptable lifestyle and is a criminal offense." Appallingly, Texas cites the very penal law found unconstitutional in the landmark 2003 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas</a> case.</p>

<p>It is clear that legislatures in some states disagree and resist homosexual rights even 10 years after the decision in <span class="casename">Lawrence</span>. These states have kept their discriminatory agenda on the books by burying these laws in education bills, taking advantage of their broad discretion in the area of education.</p>

<p>These laws are not outdated; indeed they have only been around since the 1980s. To combat the teachings of acceptance by the 1960's gay rights movement, these states responded by teaching hate. As the gay rights movement continues to make strides across the nation and same-sex marriage becomes inevitable, states look to No Promo Homo laws as their last avenue for spreading anti-gay beliefs. In 2013 <a href=" http://le.utah.gov/~2012/bills/static/HB0363.html">Utah House Bill 363</a> proposed an expansion of their law to also prohibit classroom "instruction in or advocacy of homosexuality." Teachers would be barred from even recognizing homosexual students or "instructing" them about homosexuality. This bill proposed in Utah's ban on same-sex marriage was found unconstitutional in <a href=" https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14533722201297318497">Kitchen v. Herbert</a>. </p>

<p>When I bring this law to the attention of my classmates they always ask, "Is a law like this actually followed?" The ever-practical law student wants to know what impact, if any, these laws are having. They doubt the law is being followed and believe it is just an outdated law simply forgotten about and left on the books. However the evidence is overwhelming that these laws are being followed.</p>

<p>The national <a href=" http://www.glsen.org/">Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLESN)</a> warns that No Promo Homo laws have created a hostile and discriminatory learning environment for LGBT youth. GLESN reports that states with these laws have significantly higher levels of victimization based on sexual orientation than states without, contributing to LGBT youths' high suicide rates. Two students in Alabama recently campaigned to remove their No Promo Homo law. The students argued it is "school sponsored bullying," blaming the school for taking part in their discrimination. Unfortunately these students were unsuccessful with their petition. Clearly state-by-state legislative change is unlikely and will be slow; these laws must be challenged in court as unconstitutional. </p>

<p>The constitutional challenge to No Promo Homo laws is strong and multi-faceted. The constitutionality claim of teachers and students is based on the <a href=" https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>. Cases throughout the years have interpreted free speech rights and have specifically detailed when and if speech can be barred in school. In the case of <a href=" https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15235797139493194004">Tinker v. Des Moines</a> the Supreme Court reaffirmed constitutional rights in school, holding, "it can hardly be argued that students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech at the school gate." In order to regulate speech, a school must show that discussing homosexuality will lead to a substantial disruption of school activities. Mere disagreement of opinion is not enough, given that "undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression." Discussion about homosexuality does not substantially disrupt school activities to justify a ban on speech of teachers and students. In fact studies repeatedly show that discussing all lifestyles in school leads to a more inclusive and safe environment. It is clear that the ban is nothing more than a difference of opinion, therefore it violates the free speech of teachers and students. </p>

<p>These laws also violate the Equal Protection clause of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a>. No Promo Homo laws discriminate against students on many different levels. Some only impliedly do so, like a <a href=" http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t59c032.php">South Carolina law</a> which requires schools to promote heterosexual marriage in their education. This law does not facially discriminate against LGBT students but favors heterosexuality and implies that homosexuality is of less value. Others are facially discriminatory and require the condemnation of LGBT students in the classroom setting. Equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment requires that both types of laws are rationally related to a legitimate state purpose. Although it is a low standard, it is unlikely states will be able to satisfy it. Arguments against homosexuality are not related to legitimate interests of the state and are instead related to religious doctrine. These states may also proffer that homosexuality education threatens legitimate state interests in family life and child care, yet these arguments have been repeatedly struck down in recent same-sex marriage cases. Courts find no evidence that LGBT couples are any less successful in raising a family than their heterosexual counterparts. No Promo Homo laws are not rationally related to any legitimate state interest and hence also violate Equal Protection. </p>

<p>These constitutional arguments against No Promo Homo laws deserve their chance in court. As Justice Kennedy stated in the majority opinion of <span class="casename">Obergefell</span>, "They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right." No Promo Homo laws should be the next item on the gay rights agenda to ensure this equal dignity is given to our students and teachers as well. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.wayne.edu/profile/robert.sedler/">Robert A. Sedler</a> of <a href="http://law.wayne.edu">Wayne State University Law School</a> discusses the validity of censoring disparaging trademarks...</p><strong>T</strong>he Constitution changes everything. When the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)</a> <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/12/federal-appeals-court-rules-government-cannot-reject-offensive-trademarks.php">refused to register as a trademark</a> the name of an Asian-American rock band, <a href="http://newsite.theslants.com/">The Slants</a> [official site], on the ground that the name "disparages and is offensive to Asian-Americans," that action brought into play the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment's</a> guarantee of freedom of speech. </p>

<p>The US Supreme Court has interpreted that First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech very expansively, and the constitutional protection afforded freedom of speech is perhaps the strongest protection afforded to any individual right under the Constitution. It is also fair to say that the constitutional protection afforded to freedom of speech in the US is seemingly unparalleled in other constitutional systems, and that in the US, as a constitutional matter, the value of freedom of speech generally prevails over other democratic values, such as equality and human dignity.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court decides First Amendment questions under what I have referred to as "<a href="http://waynelawreview.org/the-law-of-the-first-amendment-revisited/">The Law of the First Amendment.</a>" The "law of the First Amendment" consists in large part of concepts, principles, specific doctrines and precedents that the court has developed over the years in the process of deciding First Amendment cases. In many cases, once the appropriate concept, principle, specific doctrine or precedents have been identified and applied, the parameters for the resolution of the First Amendment issue have been established, and the result is often fairly clear. The application of most of the components of the "law of the First Amendment" involves strict scrutiny, which imposes a very high burden on the government to justify the restriction on freedom of speech. A few of the components involve intermediate scrutiny, which still requires substantial justification for the restriction.</p>

<p>The most important First Amendment principle in terms of its application in actual litigation is the principle of content neutrality. Under this principle, the government may not proscribe any expression because of its content, and an otherwise valid regulation will violate the First Amendment if it discriminates between different types of expression based on their content. One aspect of the principle, to which the court has recognized no exceptions, is that of viewpoint neutrality. The government cannot regulate or legislate in reference to expression in such a way as to favor one viewpoint over another viewpoint. Thus, a law prohibiting the display of a sign in front of a foreign embassy that <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/485/312/case.html">"tends to bring the foreign government into public odium or public disrepute"</a> violates the First Amendment, since it only prohibits displays of the foreign government that are critical of the foreign government and not display that are favorable to it. So does a federal law that allowed the wearing of American military uniforms in a portrayal only if the portrayal did not <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/398/58/">"tend to discredit the military."</a> The viewpoint neutrality aspect of the principle was the basis of the court's invalidation of federal and state laws prohibiting the burning of the American flag because these laws authorized burning as a proper means of disposing of a torn or soiled flag, but <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/491/397">prohibited burning</a> as a means of protest or criticism of government policy. The court has also held that viewpoint neutrality applies to governmental regulation of speech that is not itself constitutionally protected, such as "fighting words": this being so, a law prohibiting only "fighting words" expressing a message of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/90-7675.ZS.html">"racial hatred,"</a> but not "fighting words" expressing a message of "racial tolerance," violated the First Amendment.</p>

<p>The viewpoint neutrality aspect of the principle also constrains the government when it provides funding or other benefits to groups or individuals. The court has held that a regulation of a federal agency funding local legal assistance programs that prohibited those programs from engaging in representation involving efforts to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-603.ZS.html">amend or challenge the validity of existing welfare laws</a> was impermissible viewpoint discrimination and so was unconstitutional. Similarly, while the First Amendment does not require that the government allow private groups to parade on the public streets, if the government does allow such parades pursuant to a "parade permit" law, <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/373/262/case.html">the law must contain narrow, objective and definite standards</a>, controlling the discretion of the licensing official, so that the licensing official will not be able to deny the permit based on the content of the parade. Finally, the viewpoint neutrality requirement applies even when the government claims that the speech at issue is commercial speech and so not entitled to the same protection as non-commercial speech. Applying the viewpoint neutrality requirement, the court has held violative of the First Amendment a state law that <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/10-779.ZO.html">prohibited pharmacies from selling or disclosing pharmacy records</a> that revealed the prescribing practices of individual doctors and that prohibited the use of this information by pharmaceutical manufacturers. This was because the law permitted the use of this information by those who wished to engage in certain "educational communications," such as academic organizations, for "use in countering the messages of brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers, and in promoting the prescription of generic drugs."</p>

<p>Another important principle is the protection of offensive speech. Under this principle, the government cannot prohibit the expression of an idea on the ground that the idea itself or the manner in which the idea is expressed is highly offensive to many people. As the court stated in <span class="casename">Texas v. Johnson</span>: "If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society itself finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable." Thus, any time the government tries to justify a restriction on expression on the grounds of its offensiveness, that justification is necessarily improper. A public university, for example, cannot <a href="http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/comm/free_speech/doe.html">constitutionally justify a ban</a> on "racist speech" on the ground that it expresses a highly offensive idea or that it is very offensive to the "victim groups." The author was counsel for the plaintiffs in these cases. Nor can a city with a large Jewish population, including many Holocaust survivors, <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/439/916.html">ban a march by self-styled "Nazis" </a>with Nazi uniforms and swastikas. Likewise, the court has held that the First Amendment <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-751.ZD.html">protects the right of a religious group to picket</a> on a public street near the site of a military funeral with the message that the death of American soldiers in combat is God's punishment for America's tolerance of homosexuality. Nor can the state prohibit the expression of an idea on the ground that the manner in which the idea is expressed is highly offensive to many people, such as a person's appearing in public wearing a jacket expressing his opposition to the military draft by the use of an <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/15">"unseemly expletive.</a>" The principle of protection of offensive speech also applies to the government's regulation of commercial speech, so the government <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/463/60">cannot prohibit an advertisement for contraceptives</a> on the ground that such advertising would be offensive to many people.</p>

<p>Under the void on its face or overbreadth doctrine, laws that by their terms include within their prohibition a substantial amount of protected speech are <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/413/601/case.html">invalidated on their face</a>. In such a circumstance the court's analysis does not go beyond the terms of the law, and it does not matter whether the activity of the party asserting the overbreadth challenge is itself constitutionally protected. </p>

<p>Applying the "law of the First Amendment," it is clear, as the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held, that the provision of<a href="http://www.bitlaw.com/source/15usc/1052.html"> sec.2(a) </a>banning the federal registration of a trademark that is "disparaging" is void on its face for overbreadth. It violates both the principle of content neutrality and the principle of protection of offensive speech. Under the principle of content neutrality, the government cannot deny The Slants the benefits of trademark registration because of its disagreement with the idea that the The Slants are trying to express in their trademark, namely that "Asians should be proud of their cultural heritage and should not be offended by stereotypical descriptions." Under the principle of protection of offensive speech, the government cannot deny The Slants the benefits of trademark registration because it finds that the use of the term "Slants' would be highly offensive to many persons of Asian descent. It is as simple as all that.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the government's efforts to uphold the ban on the ground that trademark registration is "government speech" and that trademark registration is a government subsidy on which the government can impose the condition that it not be disparaging cannot be supported under the doctrine relating to "government speech" or the doctrine relating to unconstitutional conditions. The "government speech" doctrine applies only when the government itself is conveying a message, such as when the government <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-665">sponsors a display on public property </a> or when the government <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/14-144">issues an automobile license containing a message</a> such as the state motto or the message of the holder of the license that the state has endorsed. Trademark registration is not "government speech," because it does not convey any message other than that the mark is registered. As to conditions on governmental subsidies, it is questionable whether trademark registration constitutes a government subsidy for First Amendment purposes. In any event, whenever the government provides a subsidy, it cannot under the unconstitutional conditions doctrine,<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/408/593"> impose a condition</a> that violates the First Amendment rights of the recipient. The only condition that the government may impose on the granting of a subsidy, consistent with the First Amendment, relates to government speech in the sense that the government may require that the recipient of a subsidy not contradict that message that the government is trying to convey with the grant of the subsidy. Since federal law prohibits the use of federal funds to subsidize abortion, the government may require that recipients of federal funds for family planning adhere to the government's policy that <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/500/173/case.html">"abortion is not a recognized method of family planning" </a>and not provide counseling regarding the use of abortion as a means of federal planning or make referrals for abortion as a means of family planning.</p>

<p>As stated above, the government is not trying to convey any message by the registration of a trademark, so that it may not impose the condition that the trademark not be "disparaging" on the registration of the trademark. Thus the imposition of this condition violates the First Amendment.</p>

<p>Finally, it does not matter under the "law of the First Amendment" that a person can still use the trademark even if federal registration is denied. Federal registration of the trademark is a very valuable governmental benefit, and the government cannot deny a benefit on ground that violate the First Amendment. </p>

		<title>Moving the Chains: Why Employee Status for College Athletes is Necessary to Ensure their Protection</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Patrick Prager of <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2016 is the ninth author in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development. Prager discusses the influence of the upcoming decision from NLRB regarding student athletes...</j:header></p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he "student-athlete" is surprisingly uncompensated and unprotected. Though the NCAA's revenues approach <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/finances/revenue">a billion dollars annually</a>, athletes are not considered employees of their universities and are not protected by the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-7/subchapter-II">National Labor Relations Act</a>. Although, athletes do receive scholarships for working excessive hours for universities, their scholarships may not be guaranteed and they may not receive properly constructed aid packages or academic support. They also risk their bodies for these schools, while lacking protection against serious injury. Because of these concerns, members of the Northwestern University football team sued for employee status in the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The regional board found athletes performed services for another (playing football), under a contract of hire (scholarship agreements) and subject to that other's control (rules of their schools/coaches) in return for payment (their scholarships). <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-director-region-13-issues-decision-northwestern-university-athletes">Northwestern appealed</a> this determination to the National NLRB headquarters and the entire college athletic community is anxiously awaiting the final decision.</p>

<p>In the wake of the Regional Board's decision, the NCAA's Board of Directors <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/leg-process.jpg">reorganized itself</a> and provided autonomy to its five largest conferences, commonly known as the Power 5. The Power 5 met at a convention in January, and <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football-news/4632825-power-5-ncaa-schools-vote-new-scholarship-concussion-proposals-autonomy">addressed athlete demands in some areas</a>, such as guaranteeing four-year scholarships, increasing cost-of-attendance formulas to give athletes what amounts to a $5,000 stipend, raising requirements to return to play after concussion like symptoms and allowing star athletes to take out insurance against their future earnings so star athletes can receive large payouts in the event that injuries prevented a fruitful professional career. With these changes, the NCAA has endeavored to persuade athletes and the nation that employee status and unionization are not necessary to protect athletes. The NCAA attempted to show progress and thereby weaken the athletes' case. These changes, however, came in response to fear that athletes would be given employee status and therefore prove just how necessary unionization for athletes truly is. Athletes will finally receive all of the protections they need, both medical and financial, if they are allowed to unionize and collectively bargain. Without unionization, progress can be made but a solution cannot be realized. Athletes may receive some concessions from the NCAA but not enough.</p>

<p>The NCAA Convention did not eliminate the difficulties facing student-athletes. First, the changes only apply to Power 5 players and still leave thousands of athletes in the same situation they were in prior to the conference. Second, the Committee did not fully develop solutions to health issues athletes face. Only through organization, can athletes get all of the protections they deserve. </p>

<p>The NCAA has ignored athletes at smaller schools. Yet again, the NCAA showed its propensity to privilege money over athletes. In many ways, the concessions given to Power 5 athletes are even more necessary for athletes of smaller conferences, as they are less likely to go pro. When athletes choose to go to a Power 5 school, they often do so with an eye toward professional sports. Professional teams covet athletes at smaller schools less; therefore they have lower professional aspirations and their education is more important because there is little hope of the huge economic windfall a professional sports career provides. </p>

<p>By leaving out smaller schools, the NCAA deprived those schools' athletes of the benefits awarded to their higher regarded colleagues, such as guaranteed scholarships, regulation of time demands to increase attention placed on academic achievement and player safety improvements, and a $5,000 adjustment to their scholarship formula, intended to allow athletes to live above the poverty line. Additionally, progress made toward bettering player safety and security does not apply to schools outside of the Power 5. </p>

<p>Furthermore, what player safety issues were addressed, were not addressed properly. Questions have been raised regarding the effectiveness of the Committee's approved concussion safety protocol. The approved protocol instructs schools to better recognize concussion-like symptoms, but allows coaches, not doctors, the final call on returning athletes to games. Representatives of the Big 12, one of the Power 5 conferences, specifically criticized the protocol. The Big 12 suggested physicians have "unchallenged authority" to hold a player off the field after experiencing concussion-like symptoms and protested the influence coaches have on determining the health of a player under the passed model. Dr. Michele Kirk, a team physician at Texas Christian University, said <a href="https://www.tcu360.com/story/33820tcu-team-physician-new-ncaa-concussion-policy-its-huge-pr-stunt-our-opinion/">the passed concussion policy was a PR stunt</a>, lacking "teeth." </p>

<p>The NCAA also completely ignored worker's compensation issues that would guarantee for care when an athlete is permanently injured playing for college sports. In today's athletic environment, athletes are bigger, faster and stronger than in the past. As a result, athletes suffer more injuries with more severe results. Lack of employee status has left students who are permanently injured unable to receive worker's compensation, shifting the cost of on-field injuries from the school to the athlete. The NCAA has even <a href="http://deadspin.com/how-the-myth-of-the-ncaa-student-athlete-was-born-1524282374">avoided worker's compensation</a> for a player who died on the field. Without the protection of worker's compensation, the worst occurrences of athlete mistreatment may be repeated. The Committee should have taken the most cautious approach possible; instead it prioritized winning (and earning) over player safety. </p>

<p>Athletes will not see needed changes without unionization. Lacking the enforcement power of the NLRB, players will remain exposed to mistreatment and the financial devastation of life-altering injuries. And not every player will see the progress being made. The NLRB must affirm the employee status of college athletes to ensure all are fully protected. The NCAA owes a billion dollar debt to these athletes. To be a truly successful organization for student athletes, the NCAA must focus less on its bottom line and more on the athletes in its charge. The NCAA must make sure it provides its athletes the best opportunities, not just athletically, but also academically, financially and physically. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Alexander Burns of Valparaiso University discusses growing pains associated with law enforcement body cameras use, implementation, and pending Indiana legislation...</j:header><strong>I</strong>n this article I will address several legal and practical issues presented by law enforcement body cameras including: privacy concerns for victims, juveniles and witnesses, especially when an officer is interviewing a witness or victim in a private residence, the logistics and problems associated with storing and managing an influx of video data and the need for effective legislation in Indiana to address these issues.	</p>

<p>Post-Ferguson, around the country, the knee jerk reaction is this: we need law enforcement body cameras and we need them yesterday. Across the country, law enforcement implementation of body cameras is the new norm. Generally, reactions to body cameras are positive; they are perceived as an effective tool that offer protection to the officers wearing them as well as the citizens encountered.  </p>

<p>But implementing body cameras is not always an easy task. Law enforcement is feeling the pressure, not only to implement body cameras, but also to do so quickly. It is easy to see why they are struggling to adapt. If a department is able to figure out how to pay for the physical cameras, they soon realize they also need new training, new policies, software to manage and retain all that data, and likely a full-time officer tasked only with making decisions on what video to save, for how long and how to pay for the massive data storage.  </p>

<p>Additionally, under certain circumstances, body cameras may unintentionally reduce privacy protection for certain citizens. Currently, inadvertent public disclosure of otherwise protected juvenile information in body camera video is another issue that remains unresolved in the Indiana Code. As nearly every news outlet and human rights group calls for camera implementation, the Indiana legislature is trying to catch up and sort out the legal issues and logistics of quickly and effectively implementing law enforcement body cameras in society.</p>

<p>Initially, the proposition that every law enforcement officer wear a body camera was as an overwhelmingly positive policy change. More evidence, in video form, of officer and civilian encounters offers protection for the officers wearing the cameras as well as the citizens they encounter. The analysis is: cameras are good, therefore it follows, logically, that we must implement them now. Unfortunately, that is where most people's analysis stops.     </p>

<p>Until recently, I personally could not and did not think of any drawbacks to more cameras and more footage. This summer, however, when working as an intern for the <a href="http://www.tippecanoe.in.gov/department/?structureid=8">Tippecanoe County Prosecutor's Office</a> [official website], I realized several drawbacks and additional considerations for law enforcement body cameras which must be addressed. As an intern, some of my duties involved the laborious task of watching, redacting and disclosing police videos for current and pending litigations. The majority of the media I worked with was traditional dash camera and breath test room video. Occasionally, in addition to the more traditional media, body camera videos were also in the mix. As I watched additional videos, I began to realize just how much time and money viewing, redacting and disclosing more video could cost taxpayers.  </p>

<p>Imagine a DUI investigation lasting approximately thirty-minutes: two squad cars and four officers arrive on scene, each vehicle and each officer is outfitted with a camera and the officers then investigate and arrest the suspect for operating while intoxicated. During the course of any litigation, resulting from the arrest, there will be approximately three hours of video and at least another thirty-minutes of breath test room video, which someone, likely a lowly intern, must watch, redact and disclose. All the watching, redacting and disclosing is time paid for by taxpayer money, time that is currently already allocated and cannot be easily fit into the already jam-packed schedule of the average deputy prosecuting attorney. The only solution is to hire more people to deal with the influx of videos. </p>

<p>The work I did got me thinking: what happens to the countless hours of videos not part of pending litigation? Those videos do not have an intern to watch them, then redact sensitive personal information, and they are all subject to public disclosure. From my legal studies at Valparaiso School of Law, I knew any police video not part of a pending investigation or litigation is subject to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by any member of the general public for no reason at all. I then realized this issue presents major privacy concerns and is more significant implications than use of taxpayer resources.  <br />
	<br />
Specifically, personal information, images and video of juveniles documented by body cameras are freely accessible by the media or&#8212;any citizen&#8212;via a Freedom of Information Act request. Imagine a scenario where an officer encounters a lost child. Before making contact, per department policy, the officer turns on their body camera. The officer then attempts to find the child's parents by asking the child for personal information including name, age, telephone number, parent's names and address. The video of the encounter and all the juvenile's personal information then become a public record, which is accessible by anyone via a FOIA request.<br />
	<br />
As police departments across the country continue implementing body cameras, further policy considerations and legislative protection of juveniles information is the paramount issue. All images, video and private information of juveniles depicted in body camera video should be afforded the same protection as in court proceedings and statutorily protected from public disclosure. Currently, inadvertent public disclosure of otherwise protected juvenile information in body camera video is an issue that remains unaddressed in the Indiana Code. Our legislature, however, is taking steps to address these very important privacy concerns with the help of a special committee hearing testimony from those on the cutting edge of the complexities created by body cameras.  <br />
	<br />
Fortunately for Hoosiers, specifically those of us from Tippecanoe County, our very own <a href="http://www.westlafayette.in.gov/department/?fDD=9-0">West Lafayette Police Department</a> [official website] ("WLPD") is quite literally writing the book on implementation of body cameras. I recently spoke with <a href="http://www.westlafayette.in.gov/egov/apps/directory/list.egov?path=pro&usr=64">West Lafayette Police Chief Jason Dombkowski</a> [official website] about law enforcement body cameras. Chief Dombkowski just arrived home from a trip to Alaska, where he spoke at a law enforcement conference about West Lafayette Police experience with body cameras, beginning in 2013 as part of a Purdue Graduate Program. Dombkowski said that WLPD first started testing body cameras in 2013 because of the proliferation of cell phones with video capabilities. Videos of police encounters shot by bystanders often only show part of the encounter and therefore do not tell the whole story. The main objective behind WLPD officers starting to wear body cameras was to document the full encounter.<br />
	<br />
Because WLPD had a head start, they are one of two departments in Indiana able to fully implement body cameras within 30 days after Ferguson in September of 2014. Now WLPD is using what they learned to help other departments implement body cameras and tailor department policies based on their own trial and error as well as a few studies from the Department of Justice and the ACLU. Chief Dombkowski, also recently testified before a joint Indiana House and Senate Committee about WLPD's experiences and issues with the cameras. Chief Dombkowski told lawmakers in the year since his department equipped officers with body cameras, the number of police incidents involving force has dropped dramatically, from 29 in 2013 before cameras were used to seven this year: "Well the proof is in the pudding there," Dombkowski said in an <a href="http://fox59.com/2015/09/29/chief-says-body-cams-reduce-incidents-with-force-lawmakers-debate-whether-to-make-video-public/">interview</a> . "I have to believe everybody behaves differently when they know they're on camera."<br />
	<br />
As far as legislation is concerned, the first regular session of the <a href="https://iga.in.gov/">119th Indiana General Assembly</a> [official website] convened on Tuesday, January 6, 2015, during the session legislators proposed bills to address this issue. Early in the session, bills from the <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2015/bills/house/1225#document-7723f1de">Indiana House Bill 1225</a> [PDF] and the <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2015/bills/senate/454/#document-6828514d">Senate Bill 454</a> [PDF] urged the legislative council to take immediate action by assigning a study committee regarding public records requests for police body camera video. Those two bills lead to, <a href="http://www.indianasenaterepublicans.com/clientuploads/A.pdf">Legislative Council Resolution 15-01</a> [PDF], which birthed a joint <a href="https://iga.in.gov/documents/138a26ec">Interim Study Committee on Government</a> [PDF] tasked with addressing the issue of public records requests for police body camera video: "Whether additional exemptions are needed in the open records law (<a href="http://www.in.gov/ieerb/files/IC_5-14-3_Access_to_Public_Records.pdf">Indiana Code 5-14-3</a> [PDF]) to prevent the disclosure of private information caught on police body camera video, including interiors of private homes, medical information, juveniles, witnesses, and victims..."<br />
	<br />
The committee met at the State House a total of four times beginning in August 2015 and ending on October 15, 2015. During their sessions the committee explored a number of relevant topics by reviewing exhibits, scholarly articles, studies from the DOJ, ACLU and policy from Indiana police departments with prior body camera experience. The committee also called expert witnesses. The agenda, witness list and exhibits may be found <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2015/committees/i_government_interim_study_committee_on">here</a>. The committee's first and second meeting involved discussions about the <a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/laws/2015/ic/titles/035/articles/046/chapters/8.5/">current statute</a> [PDF], whether it is now obsolete, and data issues and how they interact with public record requests. Testimony was heard from law enforcement and the courts. The <a href="https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/1/3/8/a/138a26ec/gov-interim-committee-final_report-adopted-2.pdf">committee's final report</a> [PDF] was published on Tuesday, October 6, 2015.  <br />
	<br />
Overall Indiana's legislature is being as proactive as they can in dealing with this novel issue. However, any legislation sent down the pipeline will not become law until July 1, 2016 at the earliest. Until then, and likely after, body cameras present an ever-evolving set of issues. But, lets not forget that all the struggles and growing pains are necessary to implement what may prove to be the most useful tool for serving justice in our modern society.     <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://commonlaw.uottawa.ca/en/people/manirakiza-pacifique">Pacifique Manirakiza</a> of the <a href="https://cdp-hrc.uottawa.ca/en/people/manirakiza-pacifique">University of Ottawa Law School</a> discusses the debate surrounding what is going on in Burundi and proposes a different view... </p>
<strong>B</strong>urundi is undergoing a <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2016/01/un-secretary-calls-for-peace-talks-in-burundi-to-avert-continued-violence.php">political and constitutional crisis</a>. Following the announcement of Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza as the presidential nominee for the ruling party, the Conseil national pour la défense de la démocratie/ Forces de défense de la démocratie (CNDD-FDD), people mainly in the Capital city Bujumbura descended to the streets to demonstrate against the decision. The organizers of the demonstrations (main political opposition parties and civil society organizations) are of the view that Nkurunziza vying for a third term is unconstitutional. Although they were initially peaceful and all-inclusive, they became violent as some of demonstrators resorted to violent acts followed by police fierce reprisals. Also, they became contained in Tutsi-dominated suburbs of Ngagara, Nyakabiga, Musaga, Cibitoke, Mutakura and Jabe. </p>

<p>Invoking the law and order paradigm, the government resorted to force&#8212;sometimes excessive&#8212;to curb the demonstrators today labeled as insurgents or terrorists. The ongoing serious human rights violations, especially the extra-judicial killings carried out by government security forces, have alimented fears of genocide "à la rwandaise" [Rwandan style].</p>

<p><strong>1. The genocide rhetoric in Burundi</strong></p>

<p>There is controversy among Burundians and some corners of the international community on the legal characterization of the human rights situation in Burundi. Tutsi-dominated organizations and the Tutsi elite have no doubt that genocide is ongoing against the Tutsi ethnic group. Apart from some <a href="http://burundi-information.net/alerte-ac-genocide-canada-against-tutsi-genocide-version-anglaise.html">usual Tutsi genocidemaniacs</a>, prominent tutsi elite joined the club and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_ozD-SVxRY">warned</a>[in French] against Tutsi genocide ongoing or in preparation. With the massacres of December 11-12, 2015 following the attacks on the military barracks in Bujumbura, more people now strongly believe that these are evidence of acts of genocide against Tutsi, as most of the hundred and more victims were of Tutsi ethnicity. In addition, reference is made to unfortunate hate speeches made by political leaders like the Speaker of the Senate, Hon. Révérien Ndikuriyo who told local leaders to "<a href="http://www.newsofrwanda.com/featured1/29893/rwandan-genocide-incitement-tactics-emerge-in-burundi/">work</a>", a word that was interpreted, by reference to Rwanda, as an incitement to murder as many people as possible.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the ruling party CNDD-FDD joined the genocidemaniacs club. In a <a href="http://www.cndd-fdd.net/2015/11/12/communique-no-39-2015-of-the-cndd-fdd-party-november-10th-2015/">statement of November 10, 2015</a>, the party accused Belgium, the former colonial empire, of orchestrating genocide in Burundi. Similarly, in another statement made public on <a href="http://cndd-fdd.org/2015/12/24/communique-no-045-2015-of-the-cndd-fdd-party-dated-december-23rd-2015/">December 23, 2015</a>, the Chairman stated that if the December 11-12 attacks on the military barracks were successful, then the attackers would have easily carried out their genocide project as planned. The statement asserts that this is why the Belgian EU Member of Parliament, Mr. Louis Michel, was unhappy when the army defeated them. In both statements, the Hutus were hinted as the would-be victims of that "planned" genocide.</p>

<p>Without denying that Tutsi who essentially opposed the third term project are being killed, other stakeholders are more nuanced and <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/12/un-resolution-approves-investigations-into-burundi-human-rights-abuses.php">conclude instead that genocide of a political nature</a> is ongoing. Less radical in their positions, some opposition political parties and organizations, whether Hutu or Tutsi, denounce an ongoing genocide of a political nature. For instance, since early 2014, Léonce Ndendakumana, chairman of the FRODEBU party, <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201411191587.html">cautioned</a> on the risk of a political and ethnic based genocide in Burundi. Similarly, the UPRONA in opposition, which portrays itself as the genuine representative of Tutsi interests deplored a politico-ethnic based genocide ongoing.</p>

<p>On its part, the Conseil national pour le respect de l'Accord d'Arusha et de l'Etat de droit (CNARED) observed that both Hutus and Tutsis are being victimized by Nkurunziza regime to the point that its chairman, Mr. Leonard Nyangoma characterized the situation as "Barundicide" (<a href="https://agencebujanews.wordpress.com/2015/12/16/declaration-de-nyangoma-leonard-cnared-apres-les-massacres-du-12-decembre-2015/">Ihonyabarundi</a>[in Kirundi]). Likewise, in an <a href="http://media.ipadio.com/10786574_201512292100391563.mp3">interview aired on Humura Radio on December 29, 2015</a> [in Kirundi], Alexis Sinduhije, chairman of the Mouvement pour la solidarité et la démocratie (MSD) and also another CNARED leader, stated that it is counterproductive to be selective and focus on Tutsi victims alone while ignoring the sufferings of Hutu families who lost their loved ones.</p>

<p>Civil society is not left out. In a letter sent to the UN on April 14, 2015, the Campaign "Halt to the third term" warned of perpetration of international crimes in Burundi, including genocide. Recently, Ms. Marguerite Barankitse, founder and CEO of the Maison Shalom <a href="http://ici.radio-canada.ca/tele/le-telejournal-22h/2014-2015/segments/reportage/3735/burundi-barankitse-repression">stated</a> [in French] on the Réseau d'information de Radio Canada that genocide was ongoing in Burundi. </p>

<p>With regards to the different positions displayed above, it is interesting and useful to analyze the current situation from a legal perspective and find out whether or not there is an ongoing genocide.</p>

<p><strong>2. Is there genocide ongoing in Burundi?</strong></p>

<p>Before I respond to the question, I deem it necessary to recall the legal definition of the crime of genocide. According to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CrimeOfGenocide.aspx">Convention on the Prevention and the Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</a>, this crime amounts to an act targeting ethnic, racial, religious or national groups as such, with the intent to destroy them in whole or in part (article 1). Since the total annihilation of a group is practically impossible, the issue then lies at the meaning of the "part" of the group that needs to be destroyed for genocide to occur. Originally, the international case-law considered that the killing of a single person would suffice to establish genocide, as long as he or she was intentionally targeted because of his or her ethnicity, race, nationality or religion (<a href="https://www.icrc.org/casebook/doc/case-study/ictr-akayesu-case-study.htm">Akayesu case</a>, judgement, para. 521). However, the case-law has evolved since. Today, for an act to be characterized as genocide, the prosecution must establish, beyond reasonable doubt, the destruction of a substantial part of the protected group (<a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/jelisic/acjug/en/jel-aj010705.pdf">Jelisić case</a> [PDF], judgement, para. 82; <a href="http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?docid=48abd5170">Bagilishema case</a>, para. 64; <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/krstic/4#tjug">Krystić case</a>, appeals judgement, para. 8). This approach makes sense because the Genocide Convention aims at protecting groups, not individuals <em>per se</em>. Even Raphaël Lemkin, the "Godfather" of the Genocide Convention has explained that the intent to destroy "in part" must be interpreted as a desire for destruction, which "must be of a substantial nature [...] so as to affect the entirety." The ICTR caselaw in <a href="http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?docid=48abd5a31a">Kayishema</a> has set the bar high since, for an accused to be found guilty of genocide, the prosecution must prove the intention to destroy a "considerable" number of individual members of a group (<span class="casename">Kayishema case</span> [in French], para. 97), to the point that their disappearance would impact upon the survival of the group as such.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the Genocide Convention has been ratified and somehow domesticated by Burundi, making the crime of genocide prosecutable nationally. So, according to the legal criteria, is it warranted to speak of genocide in Burundi for the moment? Although Burundi has experienced atrocious acts over the last eight months, mostly in Tutsi-dominated suburbs of Bujumbura, the killings do not amount to acts of genocide targeting Tutsi group as such. Given the fact that the spring demonstrations against the third term of President Nkurunziza were carried out by people predominantly living in these suburbs, the targeting of these areas is politically motivated and localized. Other Tutsi-dominated areas such as Rohero, Kiriri, Kinindo and countryside have been spared from police reprisal acts. However, it should be highlighted and reminded that international criminal law does not require territorial generalization of heinous acts to qualify as genocide. If the legal criteria are satisfied, genocide can be proved even if the acts are simply localized. Furthermore, regardless of the atrocities and the deplorable number of deaths, it is less plausible for the moment to suggest an intention to destroy a substantial part of the Tutsi to the point that the killings have endangered the very survival of the Tutsi ethnic group as such. </p>

<p>In fact, the human rights violations <em>modus operandi</em> in the anti-third term areas follows the same pattern of this very government, which has displayed a great deal of intolerance towards political opponents. For instance, during the first and second Nkurunziza presidential terms, one should remember the systematic killings perpetrated against the militants and combatants of the Forces Nationales de Libération (FNL). Despite their Hutu ethnicity, members of the FNL were systematically killed mainly in Muyinga and Bujumbura Rural provinces. Victims' corpses were also found in water drains and rivers or on the streets as we are witnessing it today with third term victims.  Apart from FNL militants and combatants, government sponsored hostile acts were carried out against members of other opposition political parties such as MSD, FRODEBU, UPD Zigamibanga as well as prominent members of civil society organizations like Pierre Claver Mbonimpa, who survived an attempted assassination.</p>

<p>Can we then say that a "politicide" is ongoing against those opposing the CNDD-FDD political agenda? Although the majority of stakeholders are of that view, it should be reminded that the Genocide Convention affords protection to only four groups (ethnic, racial, religious and national). Contrary to other countries, the Burundian implementing legislation textually adopted the definition from the Genocide Convention, without extending the grounds for protection, to include for example other groups deemed to be equally vulnerable for genocide such as political groups. Therefore, no political genocide can be sustained either, from a purely legal perspective.</p>

<p>In conclusion, an evidence-based inquiry into the facts suggests that the killings and other degrading and ill-treatment acts are targeting people who are against Nkurunziza third term. They are in no way attacks on any Tutsi for his or her ethnicity as such. Therefore, from a legal perspective, no serious analysis can conclude to the existence of genocide ongoing in Burundi. However, from a human rights perspective, and for the time being, even if they cannot found allegations of genocide, most of the horrible acts are in no way justifiable, under the law and order paradigm. They are punishable domestically or internationally, the real issue here being for the moment the recognition of the scale of the human suffering and the dignity of victims as opposed to the recognition of genocide <em>per se</em>. Time is not for apocalyptic discourse from politicians and others. Burundians are all affected by the current crisis, irrespective of their ethnic or political affiliation. In order to avoid the worst, the international community should ensure that political "belligerents" commit to dialogue. Dialoguing is playing responsible politics.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Craig Welch of LWC Policy Consulting, Inc. discusses legislation regulating tobacco packaging in the international context, and related health and safety issues... </p><strong>A</strong> recent <a href="http://isdsblog.com/category/uncitral/">Investor State Dispute Settlement</a> (ISDS) decision in Singapore represents a major setback for tobacco companies in their fight against plain packaging legislation. But are the implications of this case as important as some commentators have suggested?</p>

                <p>In 2011, <a href="jurist.org/forum/2011/12/allyn-taylor-tobacco-suit.php">JURIST Guest Columnist Allyn Taylor</a> [JURIST] from Georgetown University Law Center quite reasonably suggested that a successful ISDS case could prove to be a 'chilling blow' to governments' attempts to enforce public health measures such as the plain packaging of tobacco products - which precludes brand differentiation and prevents the use of cigarette packets as an advertising medium. At that time the case in question was that of <a href="http://www.italaw.com/cases/851">Philip Morris (PM) - Australia</a> in the <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage37e7.html?pag_id=363">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a>, a dispute that was launched the same day that the <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011A00148">Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 (Cth)</a> came into effect.</p>

                <p>Concurrently PM intervened in a High Court case in which two other major tobacco companies (<a href="http://www.jti.com/">JT International</a> and <a href="http://www.bat.com/">British American Tobacco</a>) were suing the Australian Government, claiming that the tobacco packaging legislation amounted to expropriation of their intellectual property rights (mainly trademarks). The High Court determined in 2012, by a six to one majority, that the actions of the Government did not constitute the acquisition of property, in that there was no property of the kind specified in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html"> § 51(xxxi)</a> of the Australian Constitution.</p>

                <p>The ISDS case, held in Singapore by arbitrators appointed by both parties, was neither a continuation of nor an appeal against the High Court Case, but was brought separately under the terms of a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1993/30.html">Bilateral Investment Treaty </a>(BIT) between Hong Kong and Australia. It was arguably doomed to fail, as the corporate re-shuffling to enable an action to be brought under this particular BIT took place after the Australian Government had foreshadowed its plain packaging agenda.</p>

                <p>The Singapore judgment has garnered <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/18/australia-wins-international-legal-battle-with-philip-morris-over-plain-packaging">headlines </a>worldwide, but the perception of the outcome as a 'win' for public health and a 'loss' for the tobacco industry is illusory. The case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, after an application for bifurcation was allowed. It addressed neither the merits of the legislation nor the subsequent effect on tobacco use and importantly, offers no legal precedent. Nor can either of the two cases be appealed.</p>

                <p>Together, what these two cases should do however is to prompt questions about the validity of the widely mooted concept of 'regulatory chill'. Implicit in this concept is that governments are less likely to legislate or regulate in an area where ISDS or similar provisions might allow a challenge from 'Big X', where 'X' might be tobacco, pharma, food, fossil fuel and so on. Regulatory chill, it is claimed, hinders the ability of Governments to pursue sound public policy, including public health policy. The Australian Government itself complained about regulatory chill  in a <a href="http://www.wto.org/index.htm">World Trade Organisation</a> (WTO) <a href="https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/FE_Search/DDFDocuments/130104/q/WT/DSB/M352.pdf">meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body</a> [PDF] in November 2014, referring to a plethora of disputes as 'a well-known tactic of the tobacco industry to avoid countries implementing tobacco control measures'. Whether or not this 'chill' has had an effect, it has arguably been put in the freezer by the two cases discussed.</p>

                <p>Australia is also being <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds458_e.htm">challenged by Cuba and others</a> under the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, primarily based on allegations of breaches of the <a href="http://www.standards.org.au/InternationalEngagement/Technical_barriers_to_trade/Pages/default.aspx">Technical Barriers to Trade </a> (TBT) and <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm">Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights </a> (TRIPS) Agreements. A Dispute Panel has been formed and is expected to hand down its decision in the first half of 2016.</p>

                <p>Important considerations here are that the <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/">High Court of Australia</a> found the Government's actions legal; the ISDS action was a sham; and there are valid defenses to the WTO action in that there are exceptions to the relevant <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/gatt_ai_e/art20_e.pdf">treaty obligations</a> [PDF] including when 'necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health'.</p>

                <p>There is another extant dispute similar to that which failed against Australia. Philip Morris has raised a <a href="http://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/cases/Pages/casedetail.aspx?CaseNo=ARB/10/7">dispute against Uruguay</a>, under the <a href="http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/laws/italaw6239.pdf">Switzerland - Uruguay BIT</a> [PDF]. One unfortunate aspect of ISDS cases is that they frequently take some years to conclude. Although there was a hearing two months ago on the merits, the matter is currently held up in procedural arguments. Importantly though, to date no ISDS case relating to tobacco plain packaging has been either won or lost on its merits. This particular BIT contains a pro-vision recognising '... each other's right not to allow economic activities for reasons of public security and order, <strong><em>public health</em></strong> or morality, ...', as do most BITs. It hardly bears mentioning that tobacco use is a major public health issue. </p>

                <p>All of the above cases, concluded or not, are part of the scene currently being set in the United Kingdom. In May 2016 the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/829/contents/made">Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations 2015</a> comes into effect - and predictably, on December 10 a <a href="http://www.ash.org.uk/media-room/press-releases/:tobacco-industry-court-case-on-standardised-tobacco-packaging-starts-thursday-in-high-court">challenge </a>was mounted in the <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/you-and-the-judiciary/going-to-court/high-court/">UK High Court</a> to the validity of the regulations by almost the same group of players involved in the Australian domestic challenge. </p>

                <p>Perhaps the 'regulatory chill' is turning into a 'regulatory grill' as the plain packaging movement gains momentum. May 2016 also marks the entry into force of Ireland's <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/4/section/23/enacted/en/html">Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015</a>, which provides a one year 'wash-out' period for labelled stocks to be depleted. That same month also sees the advent of France's corresponding <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/ta/ta0505.asp">Act</a>, <em>Projet de Loi de modernisation de notre système de santé</em> [translation: Bill of Modernization on Our Health System]. 2016 becomes a watershed year with legislation along the same lines coming into force in in <a href="http://www.tobaccolabels.ca/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Burkina-Faso-2011-Decree-on-Packaging-and-labeling-of-tobacco-products-in-Burkina-Faso.pdf">Burkina Faso</a> [PDF, in French], and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/tbt/en/search/?tbtaction=search.detail&num=31&Country_ID=HUN&dspLang=EN&BASDATEDEB=&basdatedeb=&basdatefin=&baspays=HUN&basnotifnum=31&basnotifnum2=31&bastypepays=HUN&baskeywords=">Hungary </a>being the first of many other countries that are planning their own implementations.   </p>

                <p>And in the background is the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/docs/dir_201440_en.pdf">EU Tobacco Directive</a> [PDF] (2014), which contains provisions for standardized packaging, as well as other measures relating to e-cigarettes, menthol flavors, among others. France's actions are a national implementation of the Directive. In a significant move, prior to an upcoming judgment in the <a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice/index_en.htm"> Court of Justice of the European Union</a>, the Advocate General <a href="http://www.julianekokott.de/index.php/en/curriculum-vitae">Juliane Kokott</a> recently gave her support to all components of the Directive, including packaging. Her <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-12/cp150154en.pdf">opinion </a> [opinion, PDF] is not binding, but the Court generally takes such opinions very seriously. Those bringing the challenge to the Directive include the usual tobacco parties (some as 'interested' parties) as well as Poland and Romania.</p>

                <p>Whether it is the strength of the public health agenda or the weakness of the case being prosecuted by the tobacco industry, there is little evidence to date that 'regulatory chill' is undermining the resolve of governments around the world. However whether one can conclude that efforts to pit public health against the commercial interests of powerful industries other than tobacco will not be undermined by ISDS provisions, remains to be seen.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist David G. Delaney, assistant Professor at <a href=" http://law.indiana.edu/">Maurer School of Law </a> discusses historic and current cyber legislation...</p>

<p><strong>N</strong>o one should doubt that Congress's record on cyberspace issues is dismal. The Bush and Obama administrations both bemoaned Congress's expertise and engagement in this field. Much of its legislation follows Edward Snowden's 2013 disclosures of cyber surveillance programs. But one struggles to find the real benefits of laws like the <a href=" https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2521/text">Federal Information Security Modernization Act</a>, the <a href=" https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2048">USA Freedom Act</a>, and the <a href=" https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754">Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act</a> addressing discrete cyber issues quite minimally. If anything, Congress's fractured approach to cyberspace issues reveals that legislators are unable to view and address cross-cutting cyber issues strategically. The solution is to establish a joint cyberspace committee.</p>

<p>Congress's cyber legislation should be measured by the degree to which it reforms its own committees and the executive branch. It sounds daunting, but Congress has undertaken similar tasks at least twice in the last century. World War II prompted the first episode; a reform-minded public and legislature of the 1970s fueled the second. As during those Cold War periods, emerging threats, global security interests, surveillance concerns, and government accountability animate today's public debates about cyberspace. In the digital age, however, Congress has been impotent to address them.</p>

<p>Given today's political environment it would take enormous courage and the leadership of many true statesmen to accomplish the feat. Assuming those resources could be mustered, consider what else may be needed. During the immediate post-war years Congress set out to reconstitute the defense and intelligence establishment. The shared experience of the war and common concerns about communism and the Soviet Union drove quick action. There is no such common understanding or cause in today's cyber debates.</p>

<p>Another early-Cold War lesson is there must be significant harmony between the executive and legislative branches on thorny constitutional issues. Through the <a href=" https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2008-featured-story-archive/national-security-act-of-1947.html">National Security Act of 1947</a> Congress created a new department of defense to unify the military services, a civilian secretary to lead the department, a staff of military service chiefs to coordinate military planning, a national security council to coordinate executive branch policymaking, and the CIA as a function of national security planning processes. To do this it drew upon numerous constitutional powers shared with the president. </p>

<p>Congress also had to reform its own committees to provide suitable frameworks and processes for the branches to operate effectively. Creating new armed services committees through the <a href=" https://www.law.cornell.edu/topn/legislative_reorganization_act_of_1946">Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946</a> was essential because it enabled Congress to legislate for and oversee the new military system. Note that Congress adjusted its own structures before recasting the executive branch through the National Security Act.</p>

<p>Such framework legislation was a common feature of the 1970s reform initiatives as well. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/topn/legislative_reorganization_act_of_1970">Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970</a> embodied the multi-year work of a joint congressional committee to reform committees and procedures. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/94th-congress/house-bill/3884">National Emergencies Act of 1976</a> established processes for the president to make the public and Congress aware of states of emergency. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701">International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977</a> provided a mechanism for the president and Congress to address shared constitutional powers relating to international and fiscal emergencies. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1801">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978</a> established the court system under scrutiny in today's cyber intelligence debates. These and other laws adjusted the framework created after World War II. In so doing they reflected Congress's twin desires to regulate wide-ranging executive emergency powers and carry out its legislative functions more comprehensively.</p>

<p>Congress has not taken similar comprehensive steps to posture government for the digital age. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/3541">Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002</a>, for example, created a common management framework to address cybersecurity in civilian federal agencies; however, the costly bureaucratic regime could not measurably or reliably improve cybersecurity. The attacks of September 11 then fully redirected Congress's attention. Viewing digital-age security issues through a counterterrorism lens, Congress inadequately addressed interrelated cybercrime, intelligence, military, commercial, consumer protection and other cyberspace issues through the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ296/content-detail.html">Homeland Security Act of 2002</a> and the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ458/content-detail.html">Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004</a>.</p>

<p>The former, hastily drafted and passed, clustered cyber, communications,and related critical infrastructure functions from five different agencies in the new department of homeland security. It empowered the secretary to deliver a limited range of cybersecurity services to most parts of government and, more rarely, to state and local governments and the private sector. It did not, however, alter Congress's committee structure to work with the new department. The law thus provides inchoate treatment of cybersecurity as a public-private, intergovernmental, global interest spanning national counterterrorism, critical infrastructure protection, emergency response, law enforcement, information sharing and other objectives. This remains true even after the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2519/text">National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014</a>.</p>

<p>The 2004 intelligence reform law more closely approximates Congress's strategic military-intelligence reforms of the 1940s and 1970s. It created a director of national intelligence, the national counterterrorism center, a FBI intelligence directorate and an information sharing infrastructure with the private sector and state and local governments to plan and carry out various functions with cyber and other counterterrorism objectives at their core. With respect to many cyber issues, however, the new homeland security and intelligence regimes offer competing, duplicative frameworks for government to develop expertise and judiciously apply limited resources to multi-faceted national strategies.</p>

<p>Over the last decade Congress has reaffirmed the primacy of counterterrorism objectives in its treatment of cyberspace concerns. Funding decisions and amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act have confirmed Congress's interest in developing cyber perspectives and capabilities primarily through military and intelligence agencies. Congress also oversaw the evolution of a new U.S. Cyber Command with 6,000 cyber warriors capable of performing offensive and defensive military cyber actions domestically and abroad. The argument is not that these undertakings are objectively unnecessary or misguided, only that they reflect the structure and processes of a Cold War Congress to the detriment of a government that must view security through a digital-age lens.</p>

<p>To be sure, the Obama administration's 2011 so-called "comprehensive" cybersecurity proposal&#8212full disclosure, I helped shape it as a senior homeland security attorney&#8212was not a panacea. Nor could it recommend committee structures and processes for Congress. As might be expected and despite the significant efforts of numerous Senate and House committees, Congress rejected the proposal and failed to pass alternative Senate and House bills in 2012 and 2013. This, too, should not be surprising considering Congress has not implemented the 9/11 Commission's 2004 recommendation to reform committee structures and processes to enable efficient relationships on homeland security matters.</p>

<p>In short, Congress has ceded important constitutional leadership roles on cyberspace issues that, arguably, will remain longer and evolve more rapidly than current terrorism concerns. The opportunity cost can be calculated many ways. It certainly includes a lack of cyber expertise that legislators and committee staffs could have developed. It also includes oversight and public debate on cyber intelligence and law enforcement matters that have roiled the nation particularly since Snowden's disclosures. The tally must also include the nation's ability to address geostrategic cyberspace concerns and balance them against economic, counterterrorism and other policy interests. Bringing unity of purpose to Congress's many cyberspace and security interests and functions is Congress's most hopeful way forward.</p>

<p>If the end of the Cold War is any guide, that can take time. For example, military and intelligence communities struggled to adapt to the Soviet Union's collapse despite a decade's worth of study. One relevant example is this <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/directors_misc/directors_work_plan.pdf">1999 NSA statement</a> [PDF] of its overriding challenge: "NSA is an organization ripe for divestiture: its individual capabilities are of greater value than is the organization as a whole." The agency envisioned a future in which it "operates and thrives in the net" as part of a plan to demonstrate value beyond the sum of its signals intelligence, information assurance, and military support functions. One hopes for such strategic, self-critical evaluation within government's security establishment. As for the proposed solution, it implicates many cyberspace issues that are not unique to intelligence, military, or other government or private organizations. Regrettably, Congress played no demonstrable role in helping the executive branch and the public comprehend and shape such policy preferences.</p>

<p>A joint cyberspace committee would bring sustained focus to such issues. It would enable Congress to develop a broad base of staff expertise, communicate with the executive branch efficiently, and prepare to oversee or legislate for any new or reformed executive branch entities. All options should be on the table to order and administer cyberspace matters across foreign affairs, defense, commercial, technical, regulatory, and other governmental functions. The approach could also enable Congress to bring new perspectives and solutions to recent cyber stalemates. It is a generational leadership challenge, but it is not so novel or difficult that it cannot be envisioned and achieved.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.cwsl.edu/faculty-staff-and-campus-directories/faculty-and-staff-directory/g/glenn-c-smith">Glenn C. Smith</a> of the <a href="https://www.cwsl.edu">California Western School of Law</a> discusses the latest challenge to President Obama's immigration policy...</p><strong>S</strong>peculation about whether the US Supreme Court would wade into controversial issues involving immigration policy and presidential power&#8212;in an election year, no less&#8212;is over. On Tuesday, January 19, the justices announced that they would hear oral argument on the arcane issues of justiciability and administrative law on which <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C15/15-40238-CV0.pdf">US v. Texas</a> has so far turned.  </p>

<p>But the court also upped the ante by announcing that it would consider constitutional arguments the lower courts punted on when enjoining President Obama's <a href="https://citizenpath.com/dapa-expanded-daca-status/">DAPA program</a> (the 2014 <a href="http://www.dhs.gov">Department of Homeland Security</a> "Guidance Memo" offering "deferred legal status"&#8212;<em>i.e.</em>, three years of freedom from deportation, with potential eligibility to work and receive some government benefits&#8212;to millions of undocumented aliens whose children are US citizens or permanent legal residents and who meet five other criteria).</p>

<p>This commentary provides a court-watchers' guide to the complex and cascading issues at stake in this important and high-profile case.</p>

<p>But, first, it's worth emphasizing that <span class="casename">US v. Texas</span> is a textbook example of a phenomenon often true of law in general and constitutional law in particular: how political and social controversies get skewed and narrowed when the they end up in court. Ask most Americans (law-trained or not) what the big issues are surrounding the DAPA policy, and they'd likely cite personal hardships felt by undocumented immigrants hiding in the shadows of American law and society, the unfairness of letting some immigrants "jump the line" ahead of others seeking a path to citizenship through more conventional means and the like. These Americans would likely be surprised to learn that the Obama Administration's loss to date has turned instead on arcane (yet highly significant in their own right) questions of standing to sue and administrative procedure. Of further surprise might be the strong possibility that the court will resolve the litigation without ruling on much-ballyhooed political claims that the administration is acting unconstitutionally by seeking to change immigration realities without congressional involvement. </p>

<p><strong>The Challengers' Standing to Sue</strong></p>

<p>The first set of disputes in <span class="casename">US v. Texas</span> involves an issue often arising preliminarily in public-law litigation&#8212;whether the challengers have legal "standing" to sue government defendants. Under current standing doctrines, the challengers must suffer an injury that extends beyond a mere abstract policy dispute; in the words of a 2013 court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-1025_ihdj.pdf">decision</a> [PDF], plaintiff must suffer an injury that is "concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling."  </p>

<p>Both the judge in the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> and two of three judges on the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit </a>found standing based on the economic injuries that Texas (and perhaps other states among the 25 others joining the legal challenge) would suffer when DAPA applicants succeed in achieving deferred legal status. Specifically, jurists assumed that a substantial number of the estimated 500,000 newly deportation-free Texas residents would apply for drivers licenses, which are substantially subsidized by the state. The cost in Texas alone could be "several million[s of] dollars." </p>

<p>This assertion of economic-injury standing presents the Supreme Court with doctrinal complications of broader import to the accessibility of federal courts as forums for resolution of highly salient controversies. For example, should Texas' injuries be ignored under the doctrine that plaintiffs cannot "manufacture" standing by "self inflicted" injuries, because it is Texas' decision to subsidize license fees for all residents, including non-citizens? Further, both the district judge and the circuit-court majority prominently invoked language from a recent court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-1120.pdf">global-warming case</a> [PDF] stating that sovereign state challengers deserved "special solicitude." Thus, a dispute with bigger ramifications roils about the extent to which state governments will be able to claim standing in future cases by asserting injuries that could not successfully be claimed by non-state challengers.</p>

<p>Even more legally troublesome is the additional argument that states suffer injuries sufficient to confer standing merely when federal actions "impos[e] substantial pressure on them to change their laws." As the dissenting Fifth Circuit judge noted, this is arguably a "breathtaking expansion of state standing" allowing "limitless state intrusion into exclusively federal matters" by "effectively enabling the states, through the courts, to second-guess federal policy decisions--especially decisions involv[ing] prosecutorial discretion."</p>

<p><strong>How Much Discretion Does DAPA Really Allow to Implementing Officials?</strong></p>

<p>If a majority of the court agrees with lower-court judges that the challengers have standing, the justices will then face an intricate set of nested issues relating to administrative law and procedure. Despite distinct doctrines and precedents, these several disputes turned on a common question: Are DAPA deferrals, like other forms of prosecutorial discretion, "nonbinding and revocable determinations" made on a case-by-case basis (as the Administration argues)? Or, despite its facial language and the professions of federal officials, is DAPA, as the Fifth Circuit majority found, a program of "significant legal consequences" for millions "implemented without discretion to deny applications."</p>

<p>Deciding among the competing characterizations requires answering several complicated factual and policy questions. Did lower-court judges justifiably discount as "merely pretext" Obama Administration claims that DAPA is discretionary? Is it fair to do that based on experience with a previous deferral program, the length of DAPA guidance (150 pages), political puffing by Obama or the testimony of the head of a public-employee union (who may have an axe to grind based on where DAPA decisional authority is lodged in the DHS hierarchy)? And did lower courts correctly rely on the inability of the Administration to show how many deferral applications were denied under a similar previous ("<a href="http://www.immigrationequality.org/get-legal-help/our-legal-resources/path-to-status-in-the-u-s/daca-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals/">DACA</a>") program? Or is this what the dissenting circuit judge called illegitimate "burden shifting" because it was up to challengers to carry the evidentiary burden? </p>

<p>Answering these and other questions goes to the heart of whether the anti-DAPA challenge is precluded by <a href="http://www.patentofficelawsuit.info/apa_act.htm">Section 701(a)</a> of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/part-I/chapter-5/subchapter-I">Administrative Procedure Act</a>, which denies judicial review in the event of statutory preclusion or when "agency action is committed to agency discretion by law."  The discretion-versus-dictation issue also determines whether DHS could validly promulgate the DAPA policy without resorting to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553">APA Section 553 </a> notice-and-comment rulemaking. The APA exempts "general statements of policy" and "procedural" rules from notice and comment; in varying ways the extent and finality of the policy change accomplished by DAPA influences the availability of this rulemaking exception.  </p>

<p>If the Supreme Court agrees with the majority of judges to date, DAPA would return to the rulemaking drawing board and face months of rulemaking procedures and a likely new round of post-promulgation court challenges. This would likely "run out the clock" on the Obama Administration, leaving DAPA's fate to the next administration. If a Republican wins the White House, DAPA rescission would probably be high on the agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Do Immigration Statutes and Past Practice Permit DAPA's Policy Change?</strong></p>

<p>And just in case this needs to get more complicated, the Fifth Circuit panel majority opened up a second, substantive front in the Administrative Procedure Act attack. Unlike the district court, which was content to invalidate DAPA on procedural (i.e., lack of notice-and-comment) grounds, the circuit-court judges additionally opined that DAPA violated separate <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706">APA Section 706(2)C</a> because DAPA is "in excess of statutory...authority." </p>

<p>If the Supreme Court similarly reaches this substantive dimension, the justices will be plunged into detailed disputes about the meaning of federal immigration statutes and the significance of past legal-status deferrals adopted by previous congresses and administrations. The Fifth Circuit majority's statutory exegesis concluded that DAPA was "manifestly contrary" to Congress' "careful plan" about "how parents may derive an immigration classification on the basis of their child's status." By contrast, the appeals-court dissenter saw these past enactments as endorsing broad DHS discretion generally and approving generous legal-status deferrals specifically. </p>

<p><strong>Reaching the Big Constitutional Controversy?</strong></p>

<p>The most provocative question of all is whether and how the court will end up deciding the constitutional question that it ordered litigants to additionally brief.  </p>

<p>Under standard judicial-restraint principles, the justices should only assess the question of whether DAPA "violates the Take Care Clause of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section3">Constitution, Art. II, §3</a>" if they fail to resolve the controversy on less-fundamental grounds of APA compliance or standing.  </p>

<p>If core separation-of-powers issues are reached, the statutory and practical questions posed by the Fifth Circuit's substantive Administrative Procedure Act claim become wrapped in a doctrinal framework dating back to the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/343/579/case.html">1952 decision</a> invalidating President Truman's executive order temporarily seizing steel mills during the Korean war and still not definitively resolved. Thus, the justices would consider whether DAPA "faithfully executes" congressional immigration policy to date&#8212;or is instead an unconstitutional example of a president "direct[ing] that a presidential policy be executed in a manner prescribed by the president." Pragmatically, it will matter whether the administration seems to be acting with the "acquiescence," opposition or indifference of Congress.</p>

<p>Because the lower courts did not opine on this constitutional dimension, the merits briefs filed with the court will be of even greater significance.</p>

<p>In the meantime, stay tuned!</p>

		<title>Why Police May Still Have Free Reign to Search an Arrestee&amp;apos;s Cell Phone Despite a Warrant Requirement</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header> JURIST Guest Columnist Veronica Reyes of <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a>, Class of 2016, is the tenth author in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development. Reyes discusses why warrantless searches of cell phones by the police may not be the best solution in protecting our Fourth Amendment rights...</j:header><strong>T</strong>he <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9647156672357738355">Riley v. California</a> decision is a slight victory for privacy rights advocates like myself who believe individuals should be protected from unreasonable searches of personal information. In <span class="casename">Riley</span>, the Supreme Court held that police officers must "get a warrant" before searching the contents of an arrestee's cell phone. Nonetheless while the court's ruling thoroughly discussed the privacy risks posed by warrantless cell phone searches, I am not confident the decision went far enough in protecting cell phone privacy rights.</p>

<p>The <span class="casename">Riley</span> holding is disconcerting because it does not provide law enforcement officials with suitable instructions for implementing cell phone search warrants. A warrant must describe with reasonable precision the places to be searched and items to be seized. However by declining to define particular requirements for what can and cannot be searched on a cell phone, the court's ruling left police officers with considerable free reign to still search through private information on an arrestee's cell phone. </p>

<p>The two cell phone privacy cases heard by the court help illustrate this point. <span class="casename">Riley</span> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9089622262626106192">US v. Wurie</a> dealt respectively with police searches of a smartphone and flip-phone. In the first case, police pulled Riley over for driving with expired license registration tags. When police discovered that Riley's driver's license was also suspended they searched his car, found two guns, and arrested him. They found a smartphone in Riley's pocket, searched it, and discovered videos and photographs connecting Riley to a gang drive-by shooting. In the second case, police arrested Wurie for selling cocaine. Police then searched Wurie's flip-phone and found his home phone number, which they used to locate his home address. Upon searching his home police found more drugs and weapons in Wurie's possession.</p>

<p>In both cases, warrantless cell phone searches gave police the evidence necessary to prosecute Riley and Wurie for new crimes. But at what cost? Many individuals believe that police best protect society when given full authority to search and seize incriminating evidence that locks up criminals. They feel that the benefits of a cell phone search, which can recover fruits of a crime, far outweigh the protection of a criminal's privacy rights. </p>

<p>Yet, I caution these individuals to consider the constitutional problem with warrantless cell phone searches: they violate the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a>. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures absent probable cause or a warrant. This protection is violated when police officers search digital data on a cell phone without a warrant. This protection is also violated if, despite a warrant, the warrant does not precisely authorize what can and cannot be searched on a cell phone.</p>

<p>Through its decision, the court drew many appropriate conclusions. First it declined to extend the "<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5387812968771120977">search incident to a lawful arrest exception</a>" to cell phone searches, which ordinarily allows police officers to search an arrestee's person for twin purposes of protecting officer safety and preserving evidence. In <span class="casename">Riley</span>, the court correctly found that these purposes are not an issue during a cell phone search. Digital data cannot be used to harm a police officer, nor are officers concerned with remote wiping or data encryption that would destroy evidence on the phone before they obtain a warrant. </p>

<p>Second the court embraced the digital age, discussing how cell phones differ both qualitatively and quantitatively from other physical objects on an arrestee's person. Chief Justice Roberts compared cell phones to minicomputers; they are portals to vast amounts of information that individuals may no longer store in their own homes. Finally the court determined that protecting the expectation of privacy in data stored on cell phones outweighs immediate needs of law enforcement to protect society. Privacy concerns are certainly magnified when one considers how much information police officers can uncover from cell phone searches. </p>

<p>Thus, post <span class="casename">Riley</span>, police officers now know they must get a warrant before searching a cell phone if they want evidence to withstand a suppression hearing. Nevertheless, by evading a discussion of particularity requirements, the Supreme Court's decision left law enforcement with uncertainties about how to implement the cell phone search warrant requirement. </p>

<p>Legitimate questions arise regarding what digital data an officer can search when he requests a warrant for a cell phone. For instance, cell phones store emails, text messages, photographs, videos, internet searches, mobile software applications and much more. This information may not be pertinent to a criminal investigation. Furthermore, this information may not be physically stored on the cell phone, but may be on a remote server or in "the cloud" which pose their own privacy issues. </p>

<p>I suggest that we can find guidance for implementing cell phone search warrants in Justice Alito's concurring <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9647156672357738355">opinion</a>. Agreeing with the majority that warrants are the best solution, Alito suggested that the legislature enact laws to determine what can and cannot reasonably be searched on a cell phone. </p>

<p>Therefore, to ensure that cell phone privacy rights are protected, Congress should enact a law that would regulate searches of cellular devices based on categorizing the information stored on the device. The categorization would differentiate digital data stored directly on a cellular device from digital data synchronized with a cellular device. The law would still require police officers to show probable cause to search information on the cell phone. However, synchronized data, because of its connection to sources outside of the cellular device, would be afforded greater privacy protection than data stored directly on the cellular device. Searches of this information would require officers to show that there is more than mere criminal activity afoot to obtain a search warrant for such information. </p>

<p>The <span class="casename">Riley</span> ruling reaffirmed an arrestee's fundamental Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Yet while the court acknowledged the necessity of a search warrant requirement for cell phones, it fell short in discussing how to implement such a requirement, giving police considerable authority in searching cell phones. Through Congress' initiatives, we can hope that a balance between privacy interests and the goals of law enforcement will be perfectly struck through a defined warrant requirement. </p>

		<title>Mind the Gap between Poor and Rich: An Equal Rights Approach is Key in Global Development</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.equalrightstrust.org/content/executive-director">Dimitrina Petrova</a> of Equal Rights Trust discusses the need to reduce inequality as a development goal in order to reach a prime Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)... </p>

                <p><strong>A</strong>s we entered 2016, a new resolution to "transform our world" by 2030 came into effect. On January 1, the 17 <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs) replaced the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). With this New Year's resolution has come new wisdom. Among many other advances, the SDGs address one major shortcoming of the MDGs: the failure to make reducing inequality a development goal.</p>

                <p>The MDGs largely neglected the role which inequality can play in frustrating human development efforts. This has had serious consequences, both for the communities that have been excluded and for the success of national policy measures designed to achieve development goals.  Yet the centrality of equal rights in development policies is not a new idea among strategic thinkers, such as Nobel Prize Laureate <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html">Amartya Sen</a>. A reflection of the need to reduce inequality is also found in the early work of the <a href="http://www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/OPHI_WP36.pdf">UN Development Programme</a> [PDF].</p>

                <p>In recent years, research by NGOs has demonstrated that <a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/MDGreportwebsiteu2WC.pdf">ethnic and religious minorities</a> [PDF], <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/review_of_disability_and_the_mdgs.pdf">persons with disabilities</a> [PDF] and <a href="http://www.helpage.org/silo/files/mdgs-must-target-poorest-say-older-people.pdf">older persons</a> [PDF] have frequently been left behind by MDG efforts focused on achieving aggregate targets. Success in reaching such targets often disguised an increase of the gap between groups inside a country. For example, a reduction of maternal mortality by 75 percent (MDG 5) might be achieved at the expense of concentrating efforts in urban centers in pursuit of quick results whilst ignoring rural or remote communities.</p>

                <p>The SDGs' focus on reducing inequality is to be welcomed and as the new framework came into effect, the pressing question now is how can this be achieved? The answer, increasingly recognized over the last years, lies in the direction of holistic government-led interventions; but what has not been stressed as strongly as it should have been is that an essential element of this approach is the adoption and enforcement of comprehensive equality laws on which such policies should be based.</p>

                <p>Since 2013, the Organization <a href="http://www.equalrightstrust.org">Equal Rights Trust</a> has <a href="http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/130916%20Equal%20Rights%20at%20the%20Heart%20of%20the%20Development%20Agenda.pdf">advocated the adoption of an equal rights approach to development</a> [PDF], which rests on comprehensive equality legislation prohibiting discrimination on all recognized grounds and requiring states to adopt positive (affirmative) action measures to address substantive inequalities of particular groups. The difference between development with and without this approach is the difference between enforceable rights and unaccountable aspirations.</p>

                <p>Until just a few years ago, it was legal for courts in Kenya to discriminate against widows in succession cases. Disinherited widows would be evicted from their homes and land and have no means of redress. <a href="http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/Jim%20Fitzgerald%20article.pdf">A new Constitution</a> [PDF] adopted in 2010, finally prohibited such discrimination. If women are able to seek enforcement of their legal right to equality, they would be stepping up to an entirely new level on their ascent to full participatory equality with men. The Equal Rights Trust, among others, works with Kenyan women to enable them to dare forward.</p>

                <p>With effective equality legislation in place, the ethnic minority living in a marginalized area can use the law to challenge development policies which direct resources to other parts of the country; the persons with disabilities can challenge the failure to accommodate their needs in places of education and employment; all those disadvantaged by history of policy or both can take effective steps to reducing the inequality gap in their societies.</p>

                <p>The MDGs of the past 15 years leaped over the inequality gap. The SDGs of future decades require taking a good look at the gap to create the regulatory framework for interventions that would make it shrink.</p>

                <p><br />

The past two years have seen a lot of <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/10/01/3708011/how-sentencing-reformers-are-reacting-to-the-senates-new-criminal-justice-reform-package/">enthusiasm and optimism for criminal justice</a> with former <a href="http://lawenforcementleaders.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Law-Enforcement-Leaders-SCRA-Letter-of-Support.pdf">federal prosecutors</a>, <a href="http://www.justiceactionnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Letter-to-Sen-Leaders-re-S2123-Jan19.2016.pdf">federal judges</a>, <a href="http://www2.nycbar.org/pdf/report/uploads/20073012-TheSentencingReformandCorrectionsActof2015FEDCOUR12.8.15.pdf">defense attorneys</a>, and even Congress weighing in on the issue. Yet the proposed legislation, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, does nothing to fix the root causes of America's failed approach to crime and criminal justice. Instead, the proposed legislation, as recently revised by the Senate Judiciary Committee, creates the appearance of reform without doing much of anything to effect actual reform. Let's recap a little.  </p>

                <p>We call ourselves the land of the free, but we have the highest incarceration rate of any nation in the world. We have five percent of the world's population, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/04/30/does-the-united-states-really-have-five-percent-of-worlds-population-and-one-quarter-of-the-worlds-prisoners/">more than twenty-percent of the world's prisoners</a>. We imprison folks in the US longer than anywhere else for their crimes, we permanently shame and disintegrate ex-offenders from society upon their release and then act surprised when they re-offend. Let's acknowledge the irony in this the land of the free.  </p>

                <p>American criminal justice over the past four decades has been characterized by three events: over-criminalization, the rise of mass incarceration, and an increasing tilt towards the prosecution in the adversarial process leading to a significant rise in the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao/legacy/2014/09/22/13statrpt.pdf">conviction rate to nearly 93.3 percent</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Proliferation in Federal Criminal Laws</strong></p>

                <p>Prior to the 20th century, criminal law concerned itself mostly with acts that everyone knew and understood were morally wrong. Thus, the old saying <em>ignorantia juris non excusat</em> (ignorance of the law is no excuse) could be taken seriously. This is no longer the case today. When the Government exercises its power to prosecute and imprison, it is exercising its most awesome power, short of warfare. It is a power that must be exercised with precision and clarity. Yet, recent decades have seen a <a href="http://http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2015/02/the-perils-of-overcriminalization">proliferation in federal criminal laws</a>, a dramatic expansion in their application to various contexts and factual scenarios, and even their extraterritorial application even beyond our borders. The sheer number of federal laws that impose criminal penalties has grown to an unmanageable point. In point of fact, the Congressional Research Service has been unable to come up with a definitive total of federal criminal laws; the best they have been able to do is to come up with an estimate that the number is in the thousands.</p>

                <p><strong>The Rise of Mass Incarceration</strong></p>

                <p>Prior to the sentencing reform movement across the US of the late 1970s and 1980s, probation was the starting point for most non-violent first-time offenders. In the 1980s, a little less than half of offenders in the federal system received probation. Fast forward to 2014&#8212;nine in ten federal offenders received prison sentences.</p>

                <p>Until the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11853896925646326770">US v. Booker</a>, judges had limited sentencing discretion, and calculating the appropriate sentence simply required adding up points to determine where a defendant fell in the Sentencing Guidelines' grid. Yet, even after <span class="casename">Booker</span>, which rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2015/02/the-perils-of-overcriminalization">Pew Charitable Trusts</a> research report demonstrates that a period of imprisonment is still the norm. After decades of sentencing, Judges have become <a href="http://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/what-yogi-berra-teaches-about-post-booker-sentencing">accustomed</a> to seeing imprisonment as the most viable criminal sanction to meet the goals and purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). While judges may decry any responsibility for the rise of mass incarceration, they can no longer skirt responsibility by simply blaming the Sentencing Guidelines. Of course, federal judges can still blame mandatory minimum, but fixing or reducing the application or eliminating statutory mandatory minimums, is not enough. On this point, while the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015 reduces some statutory mandatory minimums, it introduces a myriad of new offenses, which trigger mandatory minimums. Federal judges who have the weighty task of sentencing need to understand that <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/opinion/sunday/did-i-sentence-a-murderer-or-a-cooperative-witness.html?_r=1">criminal sanctions short of lengthy imprisonment</a> often suffice to fulfill all the goals of sentencing, namely, just punishment and deterrence. Moreover, criminal justice reform opponents universally recount, often in graphic detail, the details of offenders' criminal conviction and appeal to morals and <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2015/07/bill_otis_meet_the_last_man_standing_who_thinks_criminal_justice_reform.html">mass hysteria</a>. Yet, two wrongs don't make a right. Years of empirical and academic research by criminologists have put <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2015/11/prison-time-surges-for-federal-inmates">numbers to the lie</a> that has permeated the nation's collective psyche that more and longer incarceration is the solution.  </p>

                <p><strong>Are Defendants Still Innocent Until Proven Guilty?</strong> 	</p>

                <p>The US likes to boast that our criminal justice system is heavily tilted in favor of criminal defendants because we'd rather that ten guilty men go free than an innocent man be convicted. As noted in a recent law review <a href="http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/2015/06/Kozinski_Preface.pdf">article </a>by <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> Judge Alex Kozinski, there is reason to doubt the continued applicability of this principle first expressed by English jurist <a href="http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/William_Blackstone">William Blackstone</a> in his seminal work, <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England</em>, published in the 1760s. For fiscal year 2013, the US Department of Justice achieved a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao/legacy/2014/09/22/13statrpt.pdf">93.3 percent conviction rate</a> [PDF, charts]. This ever-increasing conviction rate calls into question whether <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/us/tough-sentences-help-prosecutors-push-for-plea-bargains.html?_r=0">prosecutors have too much leverage</a> and whether the Constitutionally-protected and prized adversarial system remains just and fair. Worse, a defendant who exercises his Constitutionally-protected right to put the Government to its proof at trial may receive a <a href="https://ccjs.umd.edu/sites/ccjs.umd.edu/files/pubs/TrialPenalties.pdf">trial penalty</a>: a punishment that is far in excess of the sentence that could have been imposed had the defendant pled guilty. This is because prosecutors have exclusive discretion over when to charge, which charges to bring against the defendant and control the facts, including the set of facts known as <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2782&context=lawreview">"acquitted conduct" </a> and <a href="http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118&context=wmlr">"relevant conduct"</a> that are shared with the Probation Office. These facts determine how many or which of the many enhancements available under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines apply. Worst still, these facts can lead to what numerous judges and academics have described as a case of the <a href="http://socialchangeharbinger.com/2015/07/30/judicial-fact-finding-in-the-wake-of-alleyne/">"tail wagging the dog"</a> where the acquitted conduct or relevant conduct and not the offense of conviction <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998383">determines the sentence</a>, subject only to the statutory maximum of the offense of conviction. On this point, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act 2015 is completely silent. </p>

                <p><strong>We Are Not a Nation of Second Chances</strong></p>

                <p>Most politicians and most Americans proudly state "we are a nation of second chances." This statement is utter rubbish&#8212;it is misleading, and is nothing more than a <a href="http://ccresourcecenter.org/2015/07/14/president-declares-u-s-a-nation-of-second-chances-but-issues-no-pardons/">soundbite for the media</a>. An offender convicted of a felony offense becomes an instant pariah and his debt-to-society will technically never be paid; his conviction will often be used to insure he is denied access to housing, jobs, and even education. A person convicted of a felony in the federal system who serves his sentence without incident, will not magically turn his life around and become a doctor, a lawyer, a judge, or licensed professional. Instead, he will be disenfranchised at almost every turn. In most cases, a felony conviction will result in the <a href="http://sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_Felony%20Disenfranchisement%20Laws%20in%20the%20US.pdf">loss of the right to vote</a>; preclude future employment in many licensed professions; and even the run-of-the-mill jobs that require a background check. A felony conviction will also exclude many offenders from accessing education, federal and state benefits and even housing. </p>

                <p>Not surprisingly, criminal punishments and a permanent criminal record can actually increase future offending among the punished. According to <a href="http://kenplummer.com/publications/selected-writings-2/344-2/">labeling theorists</a>, criminal behavior often shows an increase after sanctioning because formal sanctions significantly reduce legitimate life pathways. Moreover, especially in the case of young adults, sanctioned criminals may engage in a process of value identification with their label, and thus adopt norms and behavior patterns typical to that label, i.e. "once a criminal always a criminal." Imprisonment may serve as a powerful conduit to the adoption of criminal identity, as it is the most severe sanction that one can receive from the state (except for death) and in fact, bestows a more stigmatized label than lesser sanctions (e.g. probation). In short, being imprisoned and labeled a convicted felon for prolonged periods of time, may serve to increase future offending, not reduce offending. Thus, the American criminal justice system does not provide or foresee second chances. 	</p>

                <p>On this point, § 211 of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2123/text/is#toc-idf4523b8c8bdb422d907527c0f6544028">original version</a> of the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act 2015 borrowed from Senators <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/?p=about_senator">Cory Booker (D-NJ)</a> and <a href="https://www.paul.senate.gov/about-rand/meet">Rand Paul's (R-KY)</a> legislation, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/675">REDEEM Act</a>, and contained an expungement and sealing provision to help young adults petition the sentencing judge to expunge their non-violent juvenile delinquencies, and seal their felony convictions. The original provision covered both juvenile delinquencies <em>and</em> felony convictions, provided the conduct leading to the juvenile delinquency or felony conviction (not the date of conviction) occurred before the offender turned twenty-one years old. Currently, the broad availability of criminal record information, which can often be accessed through a simple Google search, disables adults who have turned their lives around from finding employment and becoming productive members of our communities years - sometimes, decades - after their criminal conviction. </p>

                <p>Yet, even here, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, falls short: after the <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/about/members">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>'s markup, the expungement and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2123/text/rs">sealing provisions in § 211 were limited</a> to only those with juvenile delinquencies. And Senators Booker and Paul's REDEEM Act, which provided broad access to expungement and sealing procedures, appears to be dead in the Judiciary Committee.</p>

                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

                <p>While the few reforms in the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015 are not inconsequential, they do not go far enough and place too much of an emphasis on drug crimes. This is because federal drug offenses only represent <a href="https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp">46.5 percent </a>of the federal prison population.  </p>

                <p>In the end, this draft legislation betrays a more fundamental problem in America: a failure to appreciate or even acknowledge the need to fundamentally alter our response to crime and criminal justice. Reducing a few mandatory minimums and adding a few new ones, with a few superficial changes to prohibit prolonged periods of solitary confinement, will hardly reverse the carnage that decades of over criminalization and mass incarceration have brought on America and the fundamental rights of the accused. Finally, back to the sausage: even this modest reform has run into stiff opposition from <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/criminal-justice-tom-cotton-218121">Senator Tom Cotton (R-AK)</a>, who has warned that it would make American communities unsafe and may fail before the election season swings into full gear. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.illinois.edu/faculty/profile/ericjohnson">Eric A. Johnson</a> of <a href="https://www.law.illinois.edu">University of Illinois School of Law</a> discusses the recent Criminal Code Improvement Act ...</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>n November 2015, the House Judiciary Committee voted to send "<a href=" http://judiciary.house.gov/_cache/files/75116271-c347-4589-9c47-4fe06859c638/criminal-code-improvement-act-rp-003-xml.pdf">The Criminal Code Improvement Act of 2015</a>" [PDF] to the House floor. The bill would, among other things, add to the federal criminal code a new section, 18 USC § 11, which would govern the interpretation of federal criminal statutes that are silent with respect to culpable mental states. The new statute would provide, specifically:</p>

<blockquote><b>§ 11. Default state of mind proof requirement in Federal criminal cases.</b> If no state of mind is required by law for a Federal criminal offense&#8212;

<p>(1) the state of mind the Government must prove is knowing; and<br />
(2) if the offense consists of conduct that a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances would not know, or would not have reason to believe, was unlawful, the Government must prove that the defendant knew, or had reason to believe, the conduct was unlawful.</blockquote></p>

<p>Would this proposed statute "improve" the federal criminal code? No. Granted, many federal criminal statutes are silent or ambiguous with respect to mental states. And granted, the federal courts' efforts to fill these statutory "gaps" with judge-made law have been somewhat uneven. Probably, then, the federal criminal code would be improved by the addition of a well-drafted general provision governing the assignment of mental states to offense-elements. But 18 USC § 11 isn't well-drafted. It's a disaster from start to finish. It's worse than nothing.</p>

<p>For now, let's focus on subsection (1), which would require the courts to add the mental state of "knowing" to any federal criminal statute that is silent with respect to mental states. The first difficulty with this section is that it does not say to which offense-elements the "knowing" mental state would be assigned. All criminal offenses have multiple offense-elements. And, as every first-year law student learns, it's to these elements, not to the offense as a whole, that mental states attach.</p>

<p>To illustrate: Consider <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922">18 USC § 922(g)(9)</a>, which prohibits persons who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes from possessing firearms. This statute requires the government to prove four elements:</p>

<p>•	the defendant had been "convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence";<br />
•	the defendant possessed or "received" something;<br />
•	what he or she possessed was a "firearm" or "ammunition"; and<br />
•	the firearm or ammunition had "been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce."</p>

<p>This statute doesn't mention any mental states, so the offense presumably would be subject to the mental-state requirement in subsection 11(1). But to which of these four elements would the "knowing" mental state attach? Requiring the government to prove that the defendant knew he possessed something and knew that what he possessed was a firearm (as the courts already do) is one thing. Requiring the government to prove, in addition, that the defendant knew he had been convicted of a domestic-violence misdemeanor is something else entirely. (In many parts of the country, juries would be only too happy to credit a defendant's claim that he had "forgotten" about the conviction or its nature.) Finally, requiring the government to prove that the defendant knew the gun had traveled in interstate commerce would be absurd.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to construct a variant of subsection 11(1) that solved this dilemma&#8212;that said specifically to which of the elements the mental state attached? Of course. Lots of state criminal codes have default mental-state requirements, and all of them specify the kinds of offense-elements to which the requirement applies. In this respect the state codes were influenced by the Model Penal Code, which was published by the American Law Institute in 1962. The Model Penal Code says that an offense-element must be assigned a mental state if the element is "material"&#8212;and it says specifically what it means for an element to be material. Congress certainly could draw on these models in constructing a workable default mental-state provision.</p>

<p>Even better, Congress could draw on the work of the so-called "<a href="http://www.ndcourts.gov/court/resource/CriminalCode/FinalReport.pdf">Brown Commission</a>," [PDF] which Congress created in 1967 to conduct a thorough review of the federal criminal law and to propose changes. The commission's 1971 draft federal criminal code includes a section, § 302, that would govern the interpretation of statutes that are silent with respect to mental states. Unlike the Criminal Code Improvement Act, the Brown Commission's draft provision carefully and exhaustively specifies the circumstances under which a mental state must be assigned to an offense element.  </p>

<p>Subsection 11(1)'s failure to specify the elements to which the "knowing" mental state would attach is only part of the problem, however. The other part is the "knowing" mental state itself. The trouble with the "knowing" mental state is that it requires the actor to refrain from acting only if he is <em>certain</em> that the proscribed result will occur, or is <em>certain</em> that the critical circumstance exists. If applied to the element of non-consent in rape, for example, the "knowing" mental state would require the defendant to refrain from having sex with the victim only if he was <em>certain</em> that she did not consent; if he merely was aware of a high probability that she did not consent, he could go ahead and have sex with her. Nor is the element of non-consent unusual in this respect; a knowledge requirement is inappropriate for most offense-elements. Which is why the Model Penal Code, the Brown Commission's draft code, and most state codes specify "recklessly," rather than "knowingly," as the default. The exception is Oregon, which specifies a default of mental state of criminal negligence.</p>

<p>To this argument, I'm guessing that the proponents of Criminal Code Improvement Act would respond in roughly this way: "It's better to demand too much by way of culpability than too little, particularly given current rates of incarceration. Moreover, Congress remains free to specify a mental state less demanding than 'knowingly' for any particular offense. It need merely do so explicitly." I could say a lot about this argument, but I'll limit myself to a single narrow point: In the end, Subsection 11(1) would not actually make the federal criminal code more demanding. </p>

<p>Here is why. Remember, first, that Subsection 11(1) does not say to which elements the default mental state of "knowing" actually would attach. As a result, the federal courts almost certainly would interpret Subsection 11(1) as permitting them to decide for themselves&#8212;as they always have done before&#8212;which elements of any particular offense require mental states. After the enactment of Subsection 11(1), however, the court's exercise of this discretion would be informed by the recognition that assignment of a mental state to an offense-element under Subsection 11(1) is an all-or-nothing proposition; if the court assigns a mental state at all, it <em>must</em> assign an extremely demanding one, namely, knowingly. Since the "knowingly" does not work well for most offense elements&#8212;non-consent in rape, for example&#8212;courts simply would decide not to assign any mental state at all to most offense-elements.</p>

<p>Is this prediction fanciful? No. When courts face the question whether to assign a mental state to a particular offense-element, they often justify their refusal to assign a mental state by (1) framing the question as whether the element requires, say, an "intentionally" or "knowingly" mental state; and (2) then explaining why these relatively demanding mental states aren't suitable. This happened in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-5274.pdf">Dean v. US</a> [PDF], 556 US 568, 572 (2009), for example, where the Supreme Court framed the critical question as "whether [18 USC] § 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains a requirement that the defendant <em>intend</em> to discharge the firearm." The Court had little difficulty in concluding that the answer to this question was no. This refusal to assign a mental state would have been harder to justify if the Court had framed the critical question as some lower courts had, namely, as whether the statute's "discharge" element requires the assignment of <em>some</em> mental state&#8212;recklessly, negligently, etc.</p>

<p>In summary, the proposed 18 USC § 11(1) would not make the federal criminal code consistently more demanding. In the usual case, it would force the courts to choose between (1) demanding nothing by way of culpability and (2) demanding too much. They often would choose to require nothing. </p>

		<title>The Future of Abortion Rights and Regulations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/krooseve/">Kermit Roosevelt</a> of the <a href="https://www.law.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania Law School</a> discusses abortion rights in America ...</p><strong>I</strong>n 1973, over 40 years ago now, the US Supreme Court entered the abortion fray in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113">Roe v. Wade</a>. <span class="casename">Roe</span> offered the nation the court's view of the competing interests in the abortion dilemma, which it identified as the woman's right to privacy and the state's interest in potential life. It also provided a detailed constitutional framework to govern state regulation of abortion. Until the end of the first trimester, the court pronounced, the decision must be left "to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician." After the first trimester, but before viability, states could regulate in order to protect maternal health. And after viability, states could regulate and even ban abortion in order to protect potential life, except when abortions were necessary to protect the "the life or health of the mother." This framework, the court declared, was "consistent with the relative weights of the respective interests involved."</p>

<p>And so it presumably was, in the court's eyes. But the American people do not always acquiesce in judicial determinations of moral dilemmas, and <span class="casename">Roe</span> did not resolve the divisive issue of abortion. Overturning <span class="casename">Roe</span> became part of the Republican Party's platform. Over the next 20 years, three successive Republican Presidents appointed seven justices to the US Supreme Court. With <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-744.ZS.html">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>, many thought that the vehicle to overturn <span class="casename">Roe</span> had arrived.</p>

<p>It had not. In <span class="casename">Casey</span>, three Republican appointees, Justices Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and David Souter formed a surprising coalition to preserve what they called <span class="casename">Roe's</span>  "essential holding"&#8212;the idea that the Constitution provided special protection for a woman's choice of abortion. While preserving that central holding, <span class="casename">Casey</span> changed the court's approach in significant ways. <span class="casename">Roe</span> had erred, the <span class="casename">Casey</span> plurality wrote, in taking such an uncompromisingly pro-choice approach. States had legitimate interests in promoting life, and they were entitled to make their voices heard. States were free, <span class="casename">Casey</span> suggested, to make good-faith attempts to persuade women to choose childbirth over abortion. They could not, however, impose an "undue burden" on the choice&#8212;they could neither restrict it so much as to coerce, rather than persuade, nor impose regulations whose only purpose was to make obtaining abortions more difficult. With this compromise, the <span class="casename">Casey</span> plurality hoped, the divisive issue of abortion could finally be settled, as "the contending sides ... accept[ed] a common mandate rooted in the Constitution."</p>

<p>Once again, though, the court was disappointed. <span class="casename">Casey's</span> call for compromise fell on deaf ears. And the undue burden test turned out to be far from an ideal way of accommodating competing interests. <span class="casename">Roe's</span> rigid trimester framework might have erred by invalidating even good-faith attempts by states to persuade rather than coerce, but it was at least a test that courts could apply consistently. Different judges with different ideologies would tend to reach the same results. Not so with <span class="casename">Casey's</span> gauzy generalities. The undue burden test essentially asked judges to distinguish between good-faith persuasion and the bad-faith imposition of pointless hurdles. But that is a line that is hard to draw objectively, and judges applying the undue burden test were inevitably influenced by their own ideology. Pro-choice judges were more likely to find that state regulations were bad-faith attempts to chip away at the abortion rights, while pro-life judges were more likely to find that they were good-faith efforts to improve women's decision making.</p>

<p>This tendency found its most striking expression in two court decisions rendered within the span of seven years. In the late 1990s, the Nebraska legislature enacted a ban on what it called "partial birth abortion," a particular abortion method that had become controversial. In <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/530/914/case.html">Stenberg v. Carhart</a>, in 2000, the court pronounced this law unconstitutional by a vote of 5 to 4. Its prohibition swept broadly enough to include other abortion procedures, wrote Justice Breyer for the majority. And in any case, the law lacked a constitutionally-required exception for abortions necessary to protect the life or health of the mother.</p>

<p>In 2003, the federal government enacted a similar law, the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1531">Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act</a>. Congress attempted to improve on the Nebraska law in some ways. They drafted with slightly greater precision and created a somewhat more impressive record. Still, the two laws were essentially indistinguishable, and every justice to consider the federal ban voted exactly as he or she had voted on the Nebraska act.</p>

<p>Yet the result, in the 2007 decision of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-380.ZS.html">Gonzales v. Carhart</a>, was a 5-4 victory for the defenders of the law. What happened? The majority made some attempt to distinguish the earlier decision, but the real source of the change was obvious to everyone: Justice Alito had replaced O'Connor, and he was more sympathetic to state regulation than she was. Under the malleable undue burden test, the replacement of one justice made all the difference.</p>

<p>One possible future for abortion rights, then, is that the undue burden test will continue to be the law of the land&#8212;but a law that means strikingly different things depending on who sits on the Supreme Court. Presidential elections will loom large in the minds of abortion rights supporters and foes alike. Those elections, and the politicized and partisan court nominations that follow, will be one of the most significant battlegrounds for the issue of abortion rights.</p>

<p>It is not a prospect that either side should find inspiring. But those hoping for more from the Supreme Court are likely to be disappointed. The court has repeatedly proved itself unable to impose consensus from above, and it is unlikely that any decision it renders will do better at achieving that goal than <span class="casename">Roe</span> and <span class="casename">Casey</span>.</p>

<p>There is a possible way forward through Supreme Court decisions. If we look at history, it is possible to distinguish controversial decisions that have won acceptance&#8212;decisions like <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/347/483">Brown v. Board of Education</a>, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/388/1">Loving v. Virginia</a>, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1941.ZS.html">US v. Virginia</a>, and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html">Lawrence v. Texas</a>&#8212;from those that have not, like <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/198/45/case.html">Lochner v. New York</a> and <span class="casename">Roe</span> itself. The difference is that the decisions that have come to be accepted by the American people are based on equality, while those that remain controversial or have been rejected are based on liberty. If the court were able to write a persuasive equality-based abortion decision, it might set the debate on the same path as the debate over school segregation or interracial marriage. </p>

<p>There have certainly been calls for such a decision, both from law professors and from justices, notably Ruth Bader Ginsburg. But the shift from a liberty to an equality perspective is actually not something the court can achieve on its own. Such an opinion will be persuasive only if society comes to see the underlying issue as one of equality. </p>

<p>Such shifts in social perspective happen. They are how school segregation came to be understood as a blatant offense against equality rather than a hard question about freedom of association, how same-sex marriage came to be understood as a plea for equal treatment, not special rights. But they happen not because of courts but because of citizens, because Americans undertake the hard work of engaging with each other and changing opponents' minds. Ultimately, if there is to be a resolution of the divisive abortion issue, it must come from the American people.</p>

		<title>The Poison Poor Children Drink: Six Lessons from the Flint Tragedy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/faculty/profiles/faculty.html?facultynum=091">Robert Percival </a> from <a href="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/index.html">University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law</a> discusses what can be learned from the tragedy in Flint, Michigan...</p><strong>A</strong>mericans who visit China quickly notice one significant difference from travel in the US.  Even if they are staying in luxury five-star hotels, they are told not to drink tap water because in China it is not safe to drink. By contrast, no matter where one travels in the US tap water should be safe to drink because of a federal law called the <a href="http://www.epw.senate.gov/sdwa.pdf">Safe Drinking Water Act</a> [PDF] (SDWA), 42 U.S.C. §300f et seq. Since its enactment in 1974, the SDWA has required tap water in the US to meet minimum federal standards to protect public health.</p>

<p>Thus it was shocking to learn that for more than a year impoverished residents of Flint, Michigan were drinking lead-laden tap water that poisoned their children. How could this happen in the 21st century in the most developed country in the world despite the SDWA and the now well-known dangers of exposure to lead? It seems astonishing that government officials violated the SDWA and failed promptly to inform Flint residents that their water was poisoned.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2016/01/michigan-ag-to-open-investigation-in-flint-water-crisis.php">Flint tragedy</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/us/anger-in-michigan-over-appointing-emergency-managers.html?_r=0">originated</a> with the appointment by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder of Darnell Earley as emergency manager for Flint. To save money Earley decided in April 2014 to <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/who-poisoned-flint-michigan-20160122">shift</a> the source of the city's water supply to the polluted Flint River. Because Flint River water is highly corrosive, lead from pipes in Flint's water supply system leached into the drinking water, poisoning Flint residents. Shockingly, after test data revealed the lead contamination, state and federal officials failed to inform Flint residents. Officials initially denounced private groups who tried to publicize test results. Yet when General Motors <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/01/flint-lead-water-crisis-timeline">complained</a> that the water was corroding parts at a plant in Flint, government officials quietly reconnected the plant to its former water supply.</p>

<p>Behind these shocking events are dark realities that require reassessment of our current system for protecting public health. First, history demonstrates that it is easier to muster political will to control health risks that are highly visible. Long before the US had national environmental laws, Congress in 1912 imposed a prohibitive excise tax on the use of white phosphorous in match manufacturing because it inflicted a horribly disfiguring disease on workers exposed to it. Because lead exposure causes neurological damage that is less apparent to the naked eye, it took much longer for environmental policy to respond to it. While <a href="http://www.unep.org/newscentre/default.aspx?DocumentID=26802&ArticleID=34969">much</a> of the rest of the world banned lead-based paint at the beginning of the 20th century, the US did not do so until <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/1977/CPSC-Announces-Final-Ban-On-Lead-Containing-Paint/">1978</a>, more than a half-century later. Lead additives in gasoline were <a href="http://www3.epa.gov/otaq/regs/fuels/additive/lead/pbbandfr.txt">banned</a> only in the 1990s after a prolonged struggle that extended for decades more than the effort to ban lead-based paint.  </p>

<p>A second lesson from Flint is the folly of changing policy simply to save costs without considering the impact on public health. Incredibly in <a href="http://www.rff.org/files/sharepoint/WorkImages/Download/RFF-DP-03-37.pdf">1982</a> [PDF] the Reagan administration proposed to allow more lead to be added to gasoline simply to reduce costs to oil refiners. Even as it was touting a new executive order requiring agencies to balance costs against benefits before taking regulatory action, the administration said only cost reductions need to be considered when proposing to relax existing rules. It was self evident to Reagan's minions that any measure saving industry money was desirable regardless of its effect on public health. Fortunately public outcry forced Reagan's <a href="http://www3.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) not only to abandon this disastrous proposal but eventually to eliminate gasoline lead additives entirely. Leaded gasoline now has been banned in virtually all the world. This is probably the most successful public health measure in the history of environmental law with economists estimating that it generates more than trillions of dollars in net benefits to society each year.</p>

<p>Third, the Flint tragedy dramatically highlights an environmental justice problem&#8212;environmental risks  <a href="http://www.progressivereform.org/perspenvironJustice.cfm">continue</a> to be disproportionately concentrated on poor and minority communities. Flint is a majority African-American community with more than 40 percent of the population living below the poverty line. In 1982, columnist George Will wrote a remarkable column opposing the Reagan administration's effort to allow more lead in gasoline. Entitled <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/09/16/the-poison-poor-children-breathe/7eb9b578-bdce-44a5-afad-863644992ed7/">"The Poison Poor Children Breathe,"</a> Will observed that "the problem of lead in the environment . . . is a childhood health problem that illustrates how society's hazards are often distributed regressively - persons lowest on the social ladder have special handicaps for climbing." Will noted that "[a]ny childhood disease that threatened affluent children as lead poisoning threatens poor children would produce public action faster than you can say 'swine flu'." The same is true today, as illustrated by the Flint tragedy. Government officials in Flint responded promptly to GM's complaints about the water, but its poor residents were not warned of the hazard.</p>

<p>Fourth, Flint exposes fundamental inadequacies in how lead in drinking water currently is regulated under the SDWA.  When EPA first regulated lead in drinking water in 1991, 56 <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2007/10/10/E7-19432/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations-for-lead-and-copper-short-term-regulatory-revisions-and">Fed. Reg.</a> 26,460 (1991), it knew that there is no safe level of exposure to lead. Because of lead's potentially severe health effects at even low levels of exposure, EPA established a health-based goal of zero lead in drinking water. The SDWA directs EPA to set limits on contaminants in drinking water as close as is feasible to the health-based goal. Thus EPA had to determine how close to zero the standard could feasibly be set.  </p>

<p>Although the use of lead pipes and lead solder in drinking water systems was prohibited in 1986, an enormous number of homes still have such plumbing or are served by lead service lines. EPA concluded that Congress had not anticipated the problem of drinking water contamination occurring as a byproduct of pipe corrosion. It argued that public water systems should not be responsible for contamination from portions of the distribution system beyond their control. 56 <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2007/10/10/E7-19432/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations-for-lead-and-copper-short-term-regulatory-revisions-and">Fed. Reg.</a> 26,460, 26,476 (1991). Because a requirement that all lead service lines be removed would cost cities many billions of dollars, EPA instead required water suppliers to employ relatively inexpensive corrosion control measures to prevent lead from the pipes leaching into the water. Under the regulations EPA adopted if more than 10 percent of a city's water samples exceed 15 ppb lead at the tap, the city water supplier is required to add a chemical to the water to inhibit corrosion. If these corrosion control measures failed to reduce the percentage of samples exceeding this action level, water suppliers were required to replace lead service lines on a schedule stretching to 2014. </p>

<p>When it shifted to the corrosive Flint River water, Flint failed to use corrosion controls, even though a March 2015 consultant's report urged it to do so. This clearly would have reduced levels of lead in Flint's water, though it would not have completely eliminated lead contamination. It is well known that levels of lead in tap water can vary widely within a single system. Some cities gamed the system by choosing to do most of their testing at locations where they knew they would be less likely to find lead contamination. Environmentalists argued that EPA's regulations were inadequate because they could leave up to one-tenth of a city's population exposed to unlimited levels of lead. Faced with legal challenges from environmentalists attacking the rules as too weak and cities attacking the rules as too stringent, a reviewing court upheld EPA's regulations. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3612286298203221560">American Water Works Ass'n v. EPA, 40 F.3d 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1994). </a> </p>

<p>Fifth, the Flint tragedy illustrates the difficulty of remediating environmental harm once toxic materials are incorporated into the infrastructure of urban areas. More than a decade ago high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_contamination_in_Washington,_D.C._drinking_water">concentrations</a> of lead were found in Washington, D.C.'s drinking water as a result of testing by Marc Edwards, the very Virginia Tech professor who blew the whistle on Flint's contamination. In addition to employing corrosion control measures D.C. began replacing lead service lines. Like the widespread use of asbestos and lead paint in homes and buildings, lead in water supply systems can continue to pose severe risks to public health long after use of the toxic materials is banned.  Many cities like Flint and Washington, D.C. have lead pipes and plumbing in their water supply systems that eventually must be removed and replaced at great expense.  </p>

<p>Sixth, Flint illustrates the importance of civil society groups serving as a backstop when government officials fail to implement or obey the law. Private parties were the first to publicize the lead contamination in Flint. Predictably they initially were dismissed as alarmists by the very government officials who failed to ensure that Flint's drinking water was safe. In 1882 the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen wrote <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carey-purcell/henrik-obsen-an-enemy-of-the-people_b_1949174.html">An Enemy of the People</a>, a play about a community's demonization of a local doctor who exposes contamination of the town's economically vital baths. The play captures a timeless pattern that has been repeated for more than a century. Fortunately environmental laws in the US encourage private parties to hold government officials accountable when they fail to protect public health. This now appears to have happened, at least belatedly, in Flint. One can only hope that the lessons embodied in the Flint tragedy will make it less likely to be repeated in the future.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist James Tugee of the <a href="http://law.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> discusses how Rwandan President Paul Kagame can save his legacy by retiring, despite recent amendments extending his term limits... </j:header><strong>O</strong>n December 18, 2015, Rwandans voted in a referendum to approve various amendments that had been proposed by the Senate to the <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Rwanda_2010.pdf">2003 constitution</a> [PDF]. Key among the changes was the amendment of Article 101 of the constitution to change presidential terms of office from seven years each to five years each. The amendments, which were approved by 98.3 percent of the voters, include a special exception made for the incumbent president, <a href="http://www.paulkagame.com">Paul Kagame</a>, who is currently serving his second, and what would have been his last, seven-year term in office under the 2003 constitution. Following the amendment, President Kagame can now run for another seven-year term in 2017 and another two five-year terms subsequently. Consequently, the amendments make it possible for Mr. Kagame, now 58, to remain in power until 2034.</p>

<p>President Kagame has been the president of Rwanda since 2000, when his predecessor, <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2872100013.html">Pasteur Bizimungu</a>, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/24/news/mn-12264">resigned</a>. He was, however, very much in a position of control since 1994 when his rebel forces took over the capital, <a href="http://www.kigalicity.gov.rw">Kigali</a>, ousting Hutu extremists and ending the <a href="http://www.unitedhumanrights.org/genocide/genocide_in_rwanda.htm">genocide</a>. He was Rwanda's de facto leader when he served as Vice President and Minister for Defence between 1994 and 2000. </p>

<p>The genocide, the darkest blot on Rwanda's history, remains very much alive in Rwanda's national conscience. Around 800,000 Rwandans were killed, and over two million more displaced. Because of President Kagame's contribution in ending the genocide, most Rwandans revere him. President Kagame has, however, perhaps unfairly, used the unfortunate history of the genocide to propagate dictatorial rule. </p>

<p>Rwandans would never want a recurrence of a genocide. They perhaps live in daily fear of such recurrence. The government takes advantage of this by heavily regulating and censoring the media, stifling the opposition in its attempts to discharge its role, and unjustifiably limiting the freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. There is little space for dissent, and the excuse seems to be that disagreements may lead the country to civil strife. </p>

<p>With these in mind, it is hardly any surprise that President Kagame has always registered overwhelming victory in elections, at least according to the official results. The results of the referendum vote, with some 98 percent of the voters supporting the proposed amendments, follows this script. </p>

<p>The manner in which the Rwandan government and the National Electoral Commission managed the process left a lot to be desired. There was not enough time and opportunity for meaningful political discussions on the proposed amendments. The date of the referendum was announced on December 8, 2015, which was just 10 days before the vote. Campaigns against the proposed amendments were not allowed. The opposition <a href="http://www.rwandagreendemocrats.org/">Democratic Green Party</a> of Rwanda's planned "NO CHANGE" campaigns were rendered illegal by the electoral commission's confirmation that campaigns were not allowed. Moreover, since there was little time for civic education, and the text of the proposed amendments was only made publicly available less than a day before the vote, most of the voters probably voted for the changes without appreciating their full effect. In addition, there was no official provision for independent observation of the process.</p>

<p>The flaws in the process did not go unnoticed internationally. The European Union Heads of Mission in Rwanda made a <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/rwanda/documents/press_corner/news/151218_en.pdf">statement</a> [PDF] to express their concerns that "the one week run-up to the referendum in Rwanda neither fully explained the constitutional changes, nor offered sufficient time and space for debate." They faulted the fact that "the text of the draft constitution adopted by the Parliament was only published publicly less than one day ahead of the vote in Rwanda" and regretted that no process allowing for independent monitoring was put in place.  </p>

<p>The United States, in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/12/19/statement-nsc-spokesperson-ned-price-rwandan-constitutional-referendum">statement</a> by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/">National Security Council</a> (NSC) spokesperson Ned Price, expressed disappointment "that a referendum was called on short notice to amend the Rwandan constitution and introduce exceptions to term limits" and regret "that the arrangements for the referendum failed to provide sufficient time and opportunity for political debate on the merits of the proposed provisions."</p>

<p>While there is basis to fault the process, it is nonetheless true that some 4 million out of the 6.3 million Rwandan registered voters petitioned for the changes to allow President Kagame to run for a third term. It is not clear whether the seeming desperation of Rwandans to keep President Kagame in power is out of fear or love. Either way, President Kagame should preserve his legacy by retiring next year, or risk ultimately leaving office with his presidency being considered more of an error than an era.</p>

<p>While presidential term limits may be an effective way of doing away with bad leaders, this is not, in fact, their primary function. There are elections, impeachments, and recall of leaders for that purpose. Term limits, rather, are an acknowledgement by society that national leadership is a privilege accorded to the first among equals, and that there are many people within society who are capable of leading a country. By imposing term limits, society allows transfer of power and transitions. Rwanda has the opportunity to experience this next year. They should neither be denied nor allowed to deny themselves this opportunity. While the populace is now used to the leadership of Mr. Kagame, and perhaps very comfortable with it considering what was there before it, the country will make significant steps in dealing with the fear that seems to control every decision the country makes when a proper democratic transition occurs. Rwandans should not have to wait for President Kagame's death (God forbid), or 2034 to be part of this! </p>

<p>President Kagame has done a good job during the time he has been in office. Rwanda has achieved significant economic and social development. Mr. Kagame has himself earned the respect and admiration of many Rwandans and the international community. This is, however, not a ticket to life presidency. In fact, holding on to power is only likely to lead to disastrous results for himself and Rwanda, if the experiences of other nations are anything to go by.</p>

<p>President Kagame need not look far to see the potential disastrous consequences of holding on to power. Africa is replete with examples. Presidents <a href="https://www.yowerikmuseveni.com">Yoweri Museveni</a> and <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/robert-mugabe-9417391">Robert Mugabe</a> of Uganda and Zimbabwe, respectively, are fine examples of leaders who during the initial periods of their leadership were national heroes who enjoyed a lot of domestic and international support, but have over time, by holding on to power for too long, not only lost a lot of this support but also transformed into despots. Burundi is currently experiencing turbulent times because President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-32490645">Pierre Nkurunzinza </a> has held on to power beyond his term limit. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.nelsonmandela.org/content/page/biography">Nelson Mandela</a> of South Africa, who arguably made much more personal sacrifices for his country, and who enjoyed the overwhelming support of his people and the international community, served a single term as president and voluntarily relinquished power. Even <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7056229.stm">Joaquim Chissano</a> of Mozambique, who served as president for a longer period of time (1986 to 2005) knew the right time to relinquish power, having transformed the previously war-torn country into one of the most successful African democracies. The right moment for President Kagame to retire is 2017.</p>

<p>The support and confidence President Kagame once enjoyed internationally has dwindled in recent times and continues to dwindle. He and the government of Rwanda have come under criticism following the December 2015 referendum vote. This will only heighten if President Kagame makes a definite decision to run for president in 2017. While there is a lot of merit in the argument that Rwanda is a sovereign nation whose people should have the right to choose how they are governed and who to have as their leader, it is also an insult to Rwandans to suggest that only President Kagame can lead the nation.</p>

<p>It is inconceivable that Rwanda does not have other individuals who are able to lead the country as well as or even better than President Kagame. There should therefore be no justification for President Kagame's continued stay in office beyond 2017. Indeed, if President Kagame has not, in his 16 years so far as president, groomed individuals within his own government and party who are ready to lead the country, he has failed. What happens if, God forbid, he dies or otherwise becomes incapacitated?</p>

<p>To quote the NSC statement again, <br />
<blockquote>"President Kagame, who in many ways has strengthened and developed Rwanda, now has an historic opportunity to enshrine his legacy by honoring his commitments to respect the term limits set when he entered office. By doing so, President Kagame would establish a credible foundation for democracy in Rwanda, reinforce the substantial progress that has been achieved towards sustained peace and prosperity for all Rwandans, and set a laudable example not only for Rwanda, but for the region and the world."</blockquote> </p>

<p>What would be a greater legacy than an African leader voluntarily relinquishing power when he had the opportunity to rule for another 17 years? </p>

		<title>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby: The Dangers of Protecting First Amendment Rights of Corporations and the Rapid Expansion of &#034;Corporate Personhood&#034;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header> JURIST Guest Columnist Katharine Suominen of <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a>, Class of 2016, is the eleventh author in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development. Suominen discusses the dangers of the court's decision in <u>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</u>...</j:header><strong>I</strong>magine Occupy Wall Street protests break out again, but this time, the mayor directs the NYPD to let the protesters stay in various private public spaces, like the lobby of a corporate office building. Barclays decides that it does not want to risk bloody confrontations between its own security guards and the occupiers. Instead, it releases a specially programmed fleet of drones to direct air or sound at the occupiers until they leave the premises. New York's city council then proposes legislation to ban the corporate use of drones. Barclays decides to challenge the ordinance as an unconstitutional restriction on its corporate right of self-defense. The Supreme Court agrees with the corporation and extends Second Amendment rights to all corporations. </p>

<p>This hypothetical may seem dramatic and highly unlikely, but it is actually not that farfetched. In recent years, the Supreme Court has vastly expanded the constitutional rights of corporations. In a mere four years (2010-2014), the Supreme Court has given corporations unrestricted political speech rights and then, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5322529599500468186&q">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a>, First Amendment religious freedom rights. And there is no indication that the court intends to stop, or even slow, the expansion of corporate personhood. </p>

<p>In <u>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</u>, a 5-member family, deeply wedded to their Christian beliefs and values, owned and operated an arts and crafts chain throughout the US. Hobby Lobby argued that President Obama's Affordable Care Act contraceptive mandate violated its Free Exercise rights under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment </a>and sought protection under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2014/07/24/act-pl103-141.pdf">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA), which prevents the passage of laws that substantially burden a person's right to free exercise of religion. The Supreme Court concluded that "person" under the RFRA included corporations. The US Department of Health and Human Services conceded that "person" includes non-profit corporations, so the court reasoned that there was no "conceivable definition of 'person' that includes natural persons and nonprofit companies, but not for profit corporations, [like Hobby Lobby]." Thus, Hobby Lobby and other "closely-held corporations" were permitted to seek the protections of the RFRA. In other words, "closely-held corporations," a vaguely defined term, have free exercise rights under the First Amendment. </p>

<p>Since the majority opinion did not distinguish corporations from other business forms, such as sole proprietorships, the reach of the court's opinion becomes much greater. Thus, the extension of the RFRA to for profit corporations is bound to have, as Justice Ginsburg argued, "untoward effects."</p>

<p>In issuing its decision, the court in <u>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</u> clearly missed a few key unintended consequences for corporate law. The first unintended consequence is that this expansion of corporate personhood enhances the ability of creditors to pierce the corporate veil. The second unintended consequence is that the court's reasoning could be extended to grant corporations other constitutional rights, thereby allowing corporations to morph into "super corporations." </p>

<p>"Veil piercing" is a legal decision in which the court treats the rights and duties of a corporation as the rights and duties of the shareholders or owners. This usually happens when the court determines that the corporation is no longer separate and distinct from its owners and forfeits the limited liability protection. If a corporation goes bankrupt and the veil is pierced, creditors can go after the homes, bank accounts, investments and other personal assets of the corporation's owners, shareholders or members in order to satisfy the corporate debt. Thus, there is, arguably, no other business tool more powerful than incorporation because it protects shareholders from personal financial ruin. </p>

<p><u>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</u> has potentially diminished the importance of this once essential and powerful business tool. These closely held corporations, which seek to invoke the RFRA protections, might be opening themselves up to veil piercing as they are extending their own personal religious beliefs to the corporate entity. While the Supreme Court may not pierce the corporate veil under these circumstances, lower courts might use the <u>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</u> decision as precedent to do so. </p>

<p>As for the second unintended consequence, religious rights and the free exercise thereof were once considered "purely personal," meaning the Free Exercise clause was reserved for individuals and could not be extended to corporations. However, in <u>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</u> the Supreme Court did not address this distinction between "purely personal" constitutional rights and those rights that may be granted to corporations. This departure sets the stage for future courts to disregard this distinction and continue the expansion of corporate personhood.</p>

<p>Prior to <u>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</u>, most people would have scoffed, if not laughed, at the thought of corporations having religious rights; and yet, now they do. Thus, it may not be as improbable as people think for corporations to have <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> rights. The court ascribes similar purposes to both the First and Second Amendments--self-actualization and government deterrence. Therefore, the logic used to extend First Amendment rights to corporations could be used to extend Second Amendment rights to corporations as well.</p>

<p>With both First and Second Amendment rights, corporations become "super corporations" with all the essential constitutional rights of the natural person, but with even greater protections than natural persons. Under this hypothetical the US would shift from "We the People" to "We the Corporations." It is therefore essential for the court to return to the artificial entity theory of corporate personhood and limit its expansion of this legal concept. Unfortunately, given <u>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</u> it seems unlikely that this is the path the Supreme Court is on. </p>

Hodge, Jr.</a> of the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law, Arizona State University (ASU), John L. Hick of the University of Minnesota School of Medicine, Dan Hanfling of the UPMC Center for Health Security and Sarah Wetter of the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law, ASU, discuss the intersection of medical and legal decisions in response to the Zika virus outbreak ...</p>

<p>On the heels of the <a href="http://who.int/csr/disease/ebola/en/">2014 Ebola outbreak</a> (with just a few remaining cases in Sierra Leone), the world faces its next major threat from an emerging infectious agent&#8212;<a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/zika/en/">Zika virus</a> (ZIKV). Originally discovered in <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/10/uganda-discovered-the-zika-virus-and-the-solution-for-it/">Uganda</a> in 1947, ZIKV, like Ebola, was largely dormant for decades. Limited outbreaks among smaller populations in  the <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0805715">Yap Islands</a> (2007) and <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/02/09/466152313/zika-in-french-polynesia-it-struck-hard-in-2013-then-disappeared">French Polynesian Islands</a> (2013) raised some public health flags. However, ZIKV's emergence in South and Latin Americas in 2015 through global migration of mosquitoes and human travel patterns escalates this threat to emergency levels.</p>

<p>On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of ZIKV a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/02/01/zika-virus-who-declares-global-public-health-emergency-given-rapid-spread-in-americas/">public health emergency of international concern</a> (PHEIC). Multiple countries, including <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-34960818">Brazil</a>, <a href="http://accesswdun.com/article/2016/2/366815">Honduras</a> and <a href="http://balita.ph/2016/02/03/mexican-health-authority-confirms-37-zika-cases/">Mexico</a>, have made similar declarations. The US National Security Council has directed federal agencies to plan for the emerging virus. President Obama presented a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/08/fact-sheet-preparing-and-responding-zika-virus-home-and-abroad">supplemental budget</a> to Congress recently focused on  improving diagnosis, developing medical countermeasures and coordinating preparedness and response strategies. On February 8, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) placed its emergency operations center on its highest Level 1. Governors of <a href="http://www.flgov.com/2016/02/03/gov-rick-scott-directs-public-health-emergency-in-four-counties-for-zika-virus/">Florida (2/3)</a>, <a href="http://www.fortaleza.pr.gov/content/en-marcha-la-alianza-nacional-para-combatir-el-zika">Puerto Rico (2/5)</a> [Spanish], and <a href="http://governor.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/160212_EmergencyProclamation_Dengue.pdf">Hawaii (2/12)</a> [PDF] have declared their own states of emergency with the impending approach of ZIKV in the US. ZIKV is projected to infect multiple millions globally before this current wave crests. </p>

<p>As with Ebola, ZIKV requires public health officials, medical practitioners, and policymakers to make critical, real-time decisions with inexact or incomplete data on the morbidity and risks of the condition itself. While Ebola virus disease (EVD) imperiled patients, medical providers, and those immediately around them, impacts of ZIKV are thought currently to extend mostly to vulnerable infants and pregnant women. As discussed below, difficult choices at the intersection of public health, medical and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21908702">legal triage</a> must be made amidst present and future uncertainties about the trajectory and morbidity of ZIKV among specific populations. </p>

<p><strong>Public Health and Medical Triage In Response to ZIKV  </strong><br />
ZIKV is yet another example of an emerging infectious disease with public health consequences exceeding the normal provision of medical care. Unlike with EVD, ZIKV is spread primarily via the <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/aedes-aegypti-meet-mosquito-spreading-zika-virus-panic-n504026">Aedes species of mosquitos</a>. Other lesser routes of ZIKV transmission include through <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/transmission/">infected humans→mosquitoes→other humans, sexual transmission, blood transfusions</a> and potentially even through <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/02/05/465699300/zika-may-not-spread-in-saliva-or-urine-health-officials-say">other bodily fluids</a> (<em>e.g.</em>, saliva, urine). None of these other routes is known presently to be the source of major, or even minor, outbreaks. Still, Brazilian authorities recommended that people <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/02/11/zika-virus-adds-growing-list-troubles-brazil/80229470/">avoid kissing</a> to prevent infection during the February 2016 Carnival. As well, sexual transmission of the virus from male to female partners for undefined periods of time after the partner's infection implicates additional medical and societal issues.</p>

<p><strong>Risks.</strong> Public health challenges of ZIKV extend from risks primarily to unborn children. Most ZIKV infections occur with minimal or no symptoms to the host (only about <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/symptoms/index.html">20 percent of infected persons are symptomatic</a>). Its transfer to fetuses through pregnant women, however, can have catastrophic consequences. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6503e2.htm">Microcephaly</a>, in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and brains, has been <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1600651">associated with</a> corresponding increases in rates of fetal demise and moderate to severe developmental delays in the offspring of women infected with ZIKV. When and how often infection in the course of pregnancy may lead to such disabilities are uncertain.</p>

<p>A spectrum of less severe brain damage among infants may also be correlated with ZIKV, but these conditions can only be detected well after birth when cognitive testing can be conducted. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/qa-pediatrician.html">Vision and hearing problems</a> among newborns have also emerged as potential ZIKV complications. Some reports in Colombia and elsewhere suggest adults infected with ZIKV develop <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/21-january-2016-gbs-el-salvador/en/">Guillain-Barre Syndrome</a> (GBS), which can cause temporary or permanent paralysis.</p>

<p><strong>Testing.</strong> Several companies are working to develop rapid, easy and accurate tests for ZIKV as existing blood tests are problematic. A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4285245/">PCR test</a> applied during a patient's symptomatic phase can only be conducted at a handful of specialized laboratories. Patients recovering from ZIKV can also be tested for <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/pdfs/denvchikvzikv-testing-algorithm.pdf">IgM antibodies</a> [PDF]. Interpretation of the IgM results is confounded by cross-reactivity with other diseases such as Dengue fever and Yellow fever vaccine, commonly recommended for travelers to areas where ZIKV is currently endemic.</p>

<p>Currently CDC recommends <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6502e1.htm">testing pregnant women</a> who have traveled to endemic countries, whether or not they experience symptoms of ZIKV. Testing recommendations are problematic. <a href="http://www.ct.gov/dph/lib/dph/infectious_diseases/zikavirus/qa_for_obstetrical_providers.pdf">False positive tests</a> [PDF] (where a test inaccurately suggests ZIKV infection) may lead a woman to decide to terminate an otherwise normal, healthy pregnancy. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/19/health/zika-virus-screening-for-pregnant-women/">False negative tests</a> (where a test fails to accurately detect infection) are rarer, but may lead to missed diagnoses. Subsequent failures to perform appropriately-timed ultrasounds during pregnancy may result in undetected cases of microcephaly. Finally, while domestic testing demands are being met now, rapidly and accurately testing thousands of at risk pregnant women will be difficult if ZIKV transmission spreads across southern states later this spring.</p>

<p><strong>Preparedness.</strong> Public health and medical limitations are compounded by a potential lack of preparedness, as seen with initial cases of EVD in the US. Front line medical providers likely to see cases of ZIKV include specialists in obstetrics/maternal-fetal medicine, primary care, neonatology and neurology. Most of these practitioners have limited experience with preparing for public health emergencies, implementing <a href="http://iom.nationalacademies.org/About-IOM/Leadership-Staff/IOM-Staff-Leadership-Boards/Board-on-Health-Sciences-Policy/CrisisStandardsReports.aspx">crisis standards of care</a> and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001665.htm">reporting ZIKV cases</a>. Consequently, the <a href="http://www.phe.gov/about/aspr/pages/default.aspx">Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response</a>, CDC, other federal authorities and specialty societies (e.g.,<a href="http://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/ACOG-Departments/Zika-Virus"> American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology</a>) are working extensively to raise awareness  of ZIKV, its symptoms and morbidity among the clinical community.</p>

<p><strong>Treatments and Vaccines.</strong> There is no specific treatment for ZIKV. Addressing typical symptoms (<em>e.g.</em>, fevers, joint/muscle pain, conjunctivitis) may assuage discomforts, but does not rid the body of the virus nor make one less infectious. Current efforts focused on development of a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/zika-virus-outbreak-updates-vaccine-trials-months/story?id=36892485">vaccine</a> are still months from fruition, and thus of little consequence to tens of millions currently at risk of infection. Since ZIKV is clinically benign for most patients, any future vaccine's side-effects must be extremely minimal for it to offer reasonable risk-benefits.</p>

<p>The unknowns of ZIKV transmission, treatment and prevention lend to multiple, challenging questions on the medical and public health impacts including:</p>

<p><strong>&#8212;</strong>How many resources should be expended to test asymptomatic travelers and those living in endemic areas when current data are insufficient to accurately assess risk to a pregnancy from the disease?</p>

<p><strong>&#8212;</strong>Even if a safe vaccine can be developed, initial supplies will be limited. Who gets available vaccines first? At-risk women of child-bearing years may be at the front of the line now, but might this change as epidemiologic findings on GBS or other conditions materialize?</p>

<p><strong>&#8212;</strong>Are suggested restrictions on pregnancy in El Salvador, Colombia, Ecuador and Jamaica warranted given their significant impacts on reproductive rights, economic interests and social status?</p>

<p><strong>&#8212;</strong>Should females of child-bearing age (or their partners) avoid travelling to endemic countries given the risks, or should travel recommendations be dispensed altogether in lieu of prudent use of contraception and/or screening for pregnancy?</p>

<p><strong>&#8212;</strong>Are enhanced domestic public health responses, including aggressive mosquito control efforts, warranted despite potential risks from public exposure to vector control agents?</p>

<p><strong>Legal Triage In Response to ZIKV</strong><br />
Just as medical and public health practitioners are working to address key determinants regarding testing, screening, treatment, vaccination and prevention of ZIKV, law and policy-makers are assessing emerging legal issues. Legal triage entails prioritization of these issues in real-time to facilitate legitimate public health and medical responses by: <strong>(1)</strong> identifying enabling and disabling issues; <strong>(2)</strong> gauging changing legal and ethical norms; <strong>(3)</strong> crafting and explaining innovative solutions; and <strong>(4)</strong> consistently revisiting the utility and efficacy of legal guidance. Initial answers via legal triage can change immediately via declared states of emergency, disaster, or public health emergency, as in Florida, Puerto Rico and Hawaii. With conditions like ZIKV, where medical and public health findings are constantly evolving, the practice of medical and legal triage intersect, as illustrated below.</p>

<p><strong>Testing and Screening.</strong> Public health legal powers to test and screen individuals and populations vary. They include purely voluntary recommendations, mandatory measures that set conditions on testing, and compulsory interventions. What is legally authorized depends on what is justified from a public health or medical perspective. For example, government recommendations for voluntary ZIKV testing of adult pregnant women are lawful even if test results are somewhat unreliable. So long as the testing is truly voluntary a patient may choose whether to participate or not via informed consent.</p>

<p>Still, even voluntary testing can implicate difficult policy choices. Recently, <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/268848-gop-skeptical-of-new-funding-for-zika">federal legislators</a> objected to the potential for federal ZIKV preparedness funds to support women who may choose abortions if faced with positive ZIKV test results. Profound reproductive rights issues surround access and use of contraception and abortion, especially among pregnant minors. Many of the nations experiencing widespread ZIKV infections have religious foundations and related laws that deeply conflict with these services. In countries like Colombia, El Salvador and Ecuador, where government recommendations to avoid pregnancy have emerged, lawful access to safe abortions is minimal, if non-existent.</p>

<p>Contrast a voluntary approach to mandatory testing of infants. <a href="http://www.babysfirsttest.org/newborn-screening/states">Mandatory newborn screening</a> for a multiple condition is common practice in the US. Adding ZIKV to the list of newborn conditions tested may seem pragmatic, but could still lead to legal questions. Until ZIKV threatens a greater portion of pregnant women domestically, screening recommendations may apply only to at-risk groups like infants born to mothers with prior or current exposures to endemic regions. Potential for discrimination arises as mothers (e.g., migrants from Mexico) are targeted for screening. Furthermore, mandatorily screening infants for ZIKV at birth may be questionable if there are no proven interventions to address their potential medical complications. Conversely, if efficacious treatments for ZIKV infections among infants become a part of the standard of care, failures to screen at risk infants may lead to liability later if their disabilities could have been prevented.</p>

<p><strong>Allocation of Vaccines/Treatment.</strong> One of the most difficult issues in the context of emerging infectious disease outbreak is how to allocate available limited resources, particularly medical countermeasures. The Institute of Medicine noted in its <a href="http://iom.nationalacademies.org/Reports/2012/Crisis-Standards-of-Care-A-Systems-Framework-for-Catastrophic-Disaster-Response.aspx">2012 Crisis Standards of Care report</a> that the actual "crisis" in disease outbreaks is often the lack of essential resources and not the condition itself. How limited resources are distributed is ethically perplexing, especially given intersecting shifts in medical data and legal responsibilities.<br />
As noted above, if a safe, efficacious ZIKV vaccine was available now, females of child-bearing years at risk of exposure may be first in line for access. This sort of allocation seems legally non-controversial. That is, until suggestions about the potential adverse effects of the vaccine arise, whether based in fact or fiction. <a href="http://jurist.org/forum/2015/11/hodge-campos-vaccines-speech.php">Pervasive mistruths about current childhood vaccine safety</a> continue to hamper vaccination rates in specific subpopulations in the US. In 2015,<a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2417307"> California</a> legislated away existing vaccine exceptions for religious and philosophical exemptions. The mere specter of adverse events related to ZIKV vaccines may obviate their use, changing the nature of how they are allocated.</p>

<p><strong>Travel Limitations.</strong> The 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil and continued mosquito migrations to North America heighten the potential for rapid global spread of ZIKV. While infections directly through mosquitos are by far the surest path to contracting ZIKV, other transmission routes (discussed above) may lend to international or national travel restrictions of questionable legality. </p>

<p>Concerned about discrimination and trade, <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2016/1st-emergency-committee-zika/en/">WHO</a> has expressed disdain for any national travel bans or restrictions. CDC has issued<a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices"> voluntary travel warnings for pregnant women</a> and others in affected countries. As seen in response to EVD and SARS, other nations may impose restrictive travel policies on their citizens or attempt to keep out or screen persons arriving from "hot zones." To be lawful, travel-based limits or screening protocols must be efficacious based on known risks of transmission of ZIKV. So long as the spread of ZIKV continues to be dominated by mosquitos, and not people, travel restrictions or bans lack utility, carry significant economic impacts and potentially infringe human rights. </p>

<p><strong>Mosquito Abatement.</strong> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222283/">Controlling mosquitos</a> to prevent disease is a consummate goal of public health authorities. The rapid spread of <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/print/environ/mospol.pdf">West Nile virus</a> [PDF] domestically in the early 2000s prompted state and local governments to implement or enhance mosquito abatement programs, often through mosquito control districts. Yet, transmission of ZIKV via the "<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/fighting-the-cockroach-of-mosquitoes-1455238636">cockroach of mosquitoes</a>" presents unique challenges. Finding and killing Aedes mosquitoes are not easy. They can breed in small amounts of water (think bottle caps and birdbaths, not ponds) and tend to fly no more than 100 meters from their source. Typical fumigation of communities may not fully address their spread.</p>

<p>As a result, community education on mosquito source reduction is integral. Hawaii launched its "<a href="http://health.hawaii.gov/docd/files/2015/11/FIght_The_Bite_final.pdf">Fight the Bite</a> [PDF]" campaign in January 2016 to provide information and resources for eliminating breeding grounds from homes and properties. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/resources/vector-control.html">CDC</a> recommends source reduction and <a href="http://www.epa.gov/mosquitocontrol/controlling-mosquitoes-larval-stage">larvicide</a> treatments early in the breeding season, and <a href="http://www.epa.gov/mosquitocontrol/controlling-adult-mosquitoes">adulticide</a> treatments only after local ZIKV cases are detected. Widespread pesticide application, however, may invoke public and private <a href="http://www.stopwestnilesprayingnow.org">opposition</a> given potential harms to the environment (<em>e.g.</em>, plants, animals, water supply), private property (<em>e.g.</em>, vehicular paint damage) and the public's health. Compliance with <a href="http://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/about-pesticide-registration">legal pesticide requirements</a>, use of <a href="http://www.epa.gov/managing-pests-schools/introduction-integrated-pest-management">integrated pest management</a> and proper <a href="http://www.epa.gov/pesticide-worker-safety/how-get-certified-pesticide-applicator">training of pesticide applicators</a> can minimize risks and liabilities. State and federal water laws may require <a href="http://mde.maryland.gov/programs/researchcenter/reportsandpublications/emde/pages/researchcenter/publications/general/emde/vol4no10/article10.aspx">spray permits</a> or <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3290991/">environmental impact assessments</a>, subject to waiver under appropriate emergency declarations. Use of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/01/29/heres-how-gm-mosquitos-with-self-destruct-genes-could-save-us-from-zika-virus/">genetically modified mosquitos</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/the-bacteria-that-could-fight-zika-virus">mosquito-killing bacteria</a>, currently under consideration internationally, may raise public concerns and implicate new legal requirements in the US.</p>

<p>Not everyone may be able or willing to assist in mosquito abatement efforts. In such cases, laws in many jurisdictions allow public health officials to classify private property as a <a href="http://www.in.gov/isdh/20405.htm">public health nuisance</a> to require mosquito abatement actions by owners. Still, owners may object through right-of-entry claims or simply fail to comply with public health orders, hindering abatement efforts.</p>

<p>Zika may not generate the same fears as Ebola, but it does present other, complex social challenges. Some issues will be clarified as public health authorities and medical providers learn more. As new data arise, key decisions in medical and legal triage for the management of this emerging infectious threat must be made in unison based on best medical and legal practices leading to improved health outcomes.</p>

		<title>Why Obama Should Want to Make a Recess Appointment to the Supreme Court</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.samford.edu/cumberlandlaw/directory/Ross-William-G">William G. Ross</a> of the Cumberland School of Law at Samford University discusses President Obama's refusal to make a recess appointment to fill the present vacancy on the US Supreme Court...</p><strong>I</strong>n refusing to make a recess appointment to fill the present vacancy on the US Supreme Court, President Obama is taking a calculated risk that Americans who want a Democratic president to make the appointment may come to regret. </p>

<p>Article II, section 2, clause 3 of the Constitution provides that "The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session." Since Congress was in recess last Saturday when Justice Scalia died and will remain in recess until noon on February 22, Obama could, until 12:00 pm on Monday, appoint a Supreme Court Justice who could take office immediately. Such a justice could remain in office until the end of the first session of the next Congress, presumably late in 2017, or until the Senate confirmed the appointment of a different person nominated by the next president. </p>

<p>At least one dozen Supreme Court justices have been among the hundreds of federal judges and thousands of federal officials who have taken office through recess appointments, which began during the earliest years of the Republic. President Washington appointed one Justice, Chief Justice John Rutledge and several lower federal judges in this manner. The most recent president to make recess appointments to the court was Eisenhower, who used this method for Chief Justice Earl Warren in 1953, William J. Brennan in 1956 and Potter Stewart in 1957. The US Supreme Court recently affirmed the constitutionality of recess appointments during both inter-session recesses (like the present recess) and intra-session recesses in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3293670442848064324&q">National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning</a>. The US Court of Appeals in two decisions has sustained the constitutionality of recess appointments of federal judges, rejecting arguments that such appointments conflict with the provisions of Article III of the Constitution that guarantee life tenure and undiminished compensation for federal judges. (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7897850895152526799&q">US v. Woodley</a>, 726 F.2d 1238 (9th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1048 (1986) and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=184090037045094890&q">Evans v. Stephens</a>, 387 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 942 (2005))</p>

<p>Obama's reasons for refusing to use this constitutional means of doing a temporary end-run around the Senate confirmation process are not entirely clear. Some reports suggest that he fears that such a method would seem sneaky and thereby alienate public opinion and antagonize senators. Obama may wish to avoid making himself and the nominee vulnerable to allegations that he is not presenting the nomination in a direct and open manner or taking unfair advantage of the Senate's recess. Even many Americans who disagree with those Republicans who contend that a president should not make a court appointment during his final year in office may believe that a president who is nearing the end of his term should not shuffle anyone onto the court without the advice and consent of the Senate, particularly since Obama's replacement of Scalia could critically alter the court's political balance. Such a move also would provide grist for opponents of Obama who assail him so harshly for lacking proper respect for Congress. It could further poison Obama's relations with Congress and cost the Democrats votes in the upcoming elections. Obama and his advisors also might fear that a recess appointment could generate legal challenges that would have the practical effect of preventing the Senate from considering his nominee. In particular, there might be an effort to re-open the Article III questions that the courts addressed in <u>Woodley</u> and <u>Evans</u>, which the Supreme Court has not resolved. There also is a possibility that Obama's antagonists would deny that the Senate actually is in recess. Although the court's detailed consideration in <u>Canning</u> of what constitutes a recess provides strong support for an assumption that Congress presently is recessed, there is perhaps just enough ambiguity to spark a lawsuit about that issue.</p>

<p>Such an appointment also would require him to make a quick selection decision, although one would assume that his choice would not be hasty or ill-informed since we would hope that his Administration gave careful consideration to possible nominees long before Scalia died.</p>

<p>If the justice appointed through the recess procedure failed to receive confirmation by the Senate and had to leave the court, the justice's departure could damage the court's prestige by casting a pall over the legitimacy of decisions in which that justice had participated, especially if the justice cast the deciding vote and even more so if these were high profile cases. Justice Stewart cast the deciding vote in six cases when he sat as a recess appointee during most of the court's 1957-58 term, although none of those had great constitutional significance. While Warren did not determine the outcome of any decision when he sat as a recess appointee during five months of the 1953-54 term, he may during that time have influenced other justices to vote against the racial segregation of schools in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12120372216939101759&q">Brown v. Board of Education</a>. Although the ejection of a recess appointee would not affect the legal validity of any action he had taken while a member of the court, his departure might diminish public support for controversial decisions in which a justice had cast a deciding vote, generate challenges to set aside the murky precedent, and call attention yet again to the indeterminacy of judicial decision-making. And, of course, the unsuccessful litigant might feel that she had been the victim of an unfair adjudication. </p>

<p>Perhaps the best argument against a recess appointment is that it might diminish the independence and integrity of the judiciary since there is at least a possibility that the probationary justice would alter his or her arguments, votes and written decisions to help curry favor, or at least diminish opposition, among the senators who will vote on his or her nomination if the next president nominates that person. The likelihood that the nomination process will be contentious exacerbates such a danger. Even if the nominee did not allow such considerations to affect his or her performance on the court, there could be a public perception that they influenced the justice, whose reputation could unfairly suffer as the result of unfounded suspicions, which also could unfairly erode respect for the court. Although there were no significant aspersions cast upon the motives of Warren, Brennan and Stewart during their service as recess appointees, the Supreme Court process during the 1950s was far less rambunctious and all three justices were practically assured of confirmation.</p>

<p>The Senate considered these problems in 1960 when Democrats who were troubled by Eisenhower's three recess appointments to the court persuaded the Senate to approve a resolution declaring that such appointments were not in the interests of the court, the recess nominees, litigants or the American people and should be avoided except in "unusual" circumstances in which there had been a "demonstrable breakdown" in the appointments process. </p>

<p>Obama could plausibly argue that there has indeed been a "demonstrable breakdown" in the process since many Republican senators, including Majority Leader McConnell, have vowed to block any nomination that Obama might make. Since Republicans appear to have the ability and will to make good on their threat, the vacancy on the court is likely to last at least a year if Obama does not make a recess appointment. Although the court could properly adjudicate cases and conduct other business with only eight Justices, the vacancy would mean that some important cases might be decided by a four to four vote, which would leave the lower court decision standing and deprive the nation of clear guidance on issues that are so important that the court has regarded them worthy of its consideration. Although some of the cases on this term's docket are so far along that the new Justice presumably would not participate in their adjudication, there are other cases in which the recess appointee could take part in oral argument and vote. If a Democrat is elected president in November, the vacancy could last much longer than a year if Republicans in the next session of the Senate have the numbers and will to obstruct a nomination, leaving the court with only eight members for considerably longer than a year, perhaps throughout the court's 2016-2017 term.</p>

<p>If Republicans are as adamant about blocking Obama's nominee as they say, a recess appointment would provide Obama with his only realistic hope of filling the seat. In response to allegations that he has circumvented the confirmation process and denigrated the Senate, Obama could point out that he had no practical alternative since Republicans have vowed to prevent the confirmation of anyone he nominated. Although Obama seems to hope that a more cooperative approach will help to overcome Republican obstruction, his efforts to placate his congressional opponents during the past seven years nearly always have come to naught. </p>

<p>A recess appointment also should be an enormously attractive option for Obama because a sitting justice probably could obtain confirmation more easily than a mere nominee. </p>

<p>If the next president is a Democrat, he or she presumably would nominate the justice appointed by Obama. Even if Republicans in the next session of the Senate have enough votes to defeat the nominee, at least some otherwise antagonistic senators might be loath to oust an incumbent justice. In addition to diminishing the prestige of the court, disrupting its operations and unsettling the law, such an ejection might appear too overtly political. Moreover, some senators might be unwilling to send the justice packing insofar as a justice who has served for a year presumably would be better known to senators, both professionally and perhaps personally.  Such considerations probably would more than neutralize any lingering antagonism about the manner in which the justice was appointed, especially since Obama would have left office by then. </p>

<p>If the next president is a Republican, the new president presumably would nominate someone else early in his term, and that person presumably would be quickly confirmed if the Senate remained Republican. In that event, a recess appointment would at least have provided Obama and progressives with a justice who might have had the opportunity to cast the deciding vote in a few cases in a manner that would have pleased them. </p>

<p>Obama therefore appears to have almost nothing to lose and potentially much to gain by making a recess appointment. His reluctance to do is puzzling, perhaps a reflection of the caution, detachment and desire to avoid confrontation that has characterized his presidency and frustrated so many progressives. Although a recess appointment might not serve the long-term institutional interests of the Supreme Court, it is almost certain to serve the political interests of progressives. It is difficult to imagine that other presidents, such as Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, who did not hesitate to provoke controversies over Supreme Court appointments, would have shrunk from a confrontation that would have provided them and their political supporters with such a rich opportunity to change history by altering the complexion of the court.  </p>

		<title>Will the Civil Justice System Further Victimize the Residents of Flint?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.vermontlaw.edu/directory/person?name=Latham,Mark">Mark Latham</a> of Vermont Law School discusses the Flint water crisis...</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he Flint residents poisoned by lead-contaminated drinking water were not harmed as a result of some sudden, unexpected natural disaster that left behind in its aftermath thousands of destroyed lives. Sadly, the residents of Flint were the victims of local, state and federal government incompetence at a level rarely seen.</p>

<p>There was, however, a recent small victory for some Flint residents when the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the arguments that one of the class action suits filed in state court on behalf of residents and property owners should be removed to federal court. A question to consider, nonetheless, is whether the civil justice system is the best option to compensate the residents of Flint for the harms that they suffered at the hands of local, state and federal officials?</p>

<p>The genesis of this environmental disaster is traceable to the 2011 decision by Governor Rick Snyder's administration to appoint outsiders to manage Flint in order to right the city's shaky finances. (This extraordinarily antidemocratic action is allowed under a <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(54qubheljwjpxj3wopzd3ccv))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-act-4-of-2011">Michigan law known as Public Act 4</a>.) The appointment of outside, non-elected managers rendered Flint's duly elected officials impotent to stop the ill-fated decision to provide residents with water from the Flint River. While one could perhaps point fingers at local officials for the fiscal woes that Flint faced, the state deserves criticism, too, since the legislature cut taxes and for years reduced the level of financial support directed towards municipalities.</p>

<p>The appointment of outside managers, in turn, led to the decision to pinch pennies by switching the source of the city's potable water to the Flint River from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Authority, which had supplied Flint with water from Lake Huron for decades. Due to its legacy as essentially an open sewer, the Flint River was a questionable source of drinking water, even on an interim basis. Its water was much more corrosive and bacteria-laden than the water provided by the DWSA. Nonetheless, this new source of drinking water was foisted upon the citizens of Flint as a safe alternative with catastrophic results. The precise number of affected individuals is not clear nor will the degree of adverse impacts be determined for years. Exactly how, for example, the lead-contaminated water may have affected the thousands of children in Flint who were exposed to it is impossible to know at this point.</p>

<p>Multiple suits have been filed as a result of what happened in Flint, including a class action filed in state court on behalf of affected homeowners and residents against the engineering firms responsible for upgrades to the Flint water treatment plant. The defendants removed the case to federal district court, which ultimately remanded the case back to the state court based on the Class Action Fairness Act, specifically the Act's provision that allows a state court to maintain jurisdiction under the "local controversy exception." The <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9379811179841156352&q">federal district court's decision</a> was affirmed 2-1 by the Sixth Circuit on November 16, 2016. </p>

<p>Given that the plaintiffs reside in Michigan and the exposure to lead occurred there, the decision seems correct that this particular class action suit should remain in state court. But will the residents of Flint who were adversely affected by the lead-contaminated water be well served by the civil justice system, a system founded on adversarial principles to ferret out the facts and where years and years can pass before an ultimate decision is rendered?</p>

<p>Considering those two aspects of the civil justice system - its adversarial nature and the lengthy time it will take to resolve the number of suits that have been filed, the situation in Flint is a poor match to resolve through the courts. Is there, for example, much to be gained by way of new facts from the expensive, time consuming, laborious and often contentious discovery process? What would the opinions of experts add to the understanding of what occurred in Flint? How many more motions and appeals will the residents have to endure before they receive one nickel of compensation for their harms?</p>

<p>What is clear is that government ineptitude at all levels &#45; local, state and federal &#45; exposed tens of thousands of men, women and children to unsafe levels of lead, a potentially deadly neurotoxin. The appointed emergency managers valued saving money more than protecting public health. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality failed in its crucial oversight role, as it allowed Flint to provide water that was anticipated to leach lead and possibly other heavy metals out of the ancient Flint water distribution system that would ultimately find their way into the taps of the residents. Indeed the Flint Water Advisory Task Force, appointed by Governor Snyder to conduct an independent review of the crisis, <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/snyder/FWATF_FINAL_REPORT_21March2016_517805_7.pdf">determined</a> that the "MDEQ bears primary responsibility for the water contamination in Flint." Similarly, regulators at US EPA Region 5, the Midwest branch of the EPA that includes Michigan under its oversight umbrella for delegated federal environmental regulatory programs, such as the Safe Drinking Water Act, were slow to respond. For months EPA Region 5 officials didn't recognize the situation in Flint as a crisis that would have devastating public health effects. Meanwhile, Governor Snyder's office paid little, if any, attention to what was taking place in Flint until after the catastrophe was well under way.</p>

<p>It is also clear that the affected residents are in desperate need of compensation. Many still cannot consume the water because of ongoing elevated lead levels and others are hesitant to believe that the water in some areas of Flint is now safe for consumption. Costly health monitoring and treatment is required for the thousands of children who have been exposed to lead. Due to the ineptitude of government officials at all levels, the Flint water crisis has also delivered a significant economic blow to a mightily struggling city that can ill afford yet another negative economic event. For example, those residents who own homes now have an asset that has declined sharply in value and that they will likely never be able to sell. In the meantime, the aggrieved residents of Flint wait as the civil justice system's machinery slowly grinds away, they hope, towards a favorable resolution.</p>

<p>While our civil justice system is perhaps the envy of the world, it is not necessarily the best system to resolve the volume of claims arising out of the harm to Flint residents. This is particularly true where, as here, there are two crucial conclusions that we can reach: 1) there is overwhelming evidence of incompetence leading to harm and 2) the harm is widespread among a large population of victims. With the presence of these two factors the lengthy process of the civil justice system is of questionable value for those who have suffered harm. First, it is a resource intensive system and those resources could be better utilized as part of the compensation that the victims who have been harmed should receive. Second, the civil justice system is not only expensive but also very time consuming. It will undoubtedly be years and years before the plaintiffs learn whether they will receive any damages whatsoever. Third, the end result of the civil justice system as a means to provide compensation is also fraught with uncertainty. The plaintiffs may have the facts and law in their favor but possibly still receive nothing after years and years of hard fought litigation.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Flint plaintiffs will ultimately prevail, but if and when that day will come is anyone's guess. Consequently, since so many government actors contributed to this debacle, federal and state officials should expeditiously establish a non-litigation-based compensation system for those adversely affected by this unfortunate case of government bungling.</p>

<p>The establishment of an alternative compensation mechanism outside the civil justice system in response to an environmental disaster is not a novel idea; it has been done before. Consider, for example, the massive BP oil spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Rather than requiring those harmed by that environmental catastrophe to litigate their claims, the government and BP agreed to establish a $20 billion extra-judicial compensation system. While far from perfect, the BP fund approach could allow for the effective and prompt compensation for the victims of the Flint water crisis. The funding needed to implement this approach could come from the very parties who significantly contributed to this debacle, namely the state of Michigan and the federal government.</p>

<p>As the Flint Water Advisory Task Force noted in its March 2016 Final Report, "The Flint water crisis is a story of governmental failure, intransigence, unpreparedness, delay, inaction and environmental injustice." Those harmed as a result should not become victims a second time due to the inefficiencies inherent in the civil justice system. They deserve compensation for their personal and property damage and deserve it now, not years and years from today, if at all.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Akhil Kang, discusses a case in Punjab and Haryana High court where castrated cis-gendered men brought a criminal case against religious groups claiming that they were induced to undergo castration on the promise of attaining higher enlightenment... </p>

                <p>Hans Raj Chauhan in the state of Haryana in northern India filed a case against the <em>Dera Sacha Sauda</em> (a religious sect) for inducing him and around 400 other men to undergo castration in the hope that emasculation would lead to realization of God. The <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112098487/">case</a> essentially talks about the need for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), an investigative police agency under the jurisdiction of government of India, to make an enquiry into the allegations given the huge political and social influence of the Dera. Although the case might be just another one determining the extent of criminal liability for grievous hurt, but an important point to note is that the court makes is about emasculation being a violation of human rights. </p>

                <p>The court notes that there &#8220;could be no consent to castration for a <em>normal</em> person&#8221;. Reading <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/895891/">Section 320 of the Indian Penal Code</a> which defines grievous hurt to include emasculation, the court concludes that a person, a normal person, can never consent to being castrated on the belief or faith of finding God. Castration or &#8216;genital mutilation of reproductive organs&#8217; (according to the court) is no doubt,  very widely practiced (<a href="http://www.thequint.com/opinion/2015/04/10/female-gender-mutilation-indias-well-kept-secret">particularly among women</a>) in India. Voluntary castration prevalent among trans* persons &#8220;is different pathetic story to which we (the court) are not concerned about.&#8221;  Although the court makes a very passing reference to trans* individuals in its judgment, saying that voluntary castration prevalent among trans* persons &#8220;is different pathetic story to which we (the court) are not concerned about,&#8221; it becomes quite important to note that such cases could become quite pivotal to conceptualizing rights and making sustainable claims for them.</p>

                <p>The problem with many off hand references to trans* individuals in many judgments is that they often get ignored or side-lined because of their evident biased colouring of a significant marginalized population of the country. Therefore, the impact that it could or might have on that population somewhere gets lost in trying to sanitize the language that the judge ought to or could have used. The judgment might not talk about the implications of genital altering surgeries on trans* individuals except for the fact that trans* individuals voluntarily undergo them because of &#8216;emotional compulsion&#8217; arising out of &#8220;<em>indescribable agony of being trapped between two sexes of a male in female body or a female in a male body</em>&#8221; but the legal consequences of these choices open up multiple possibilities.</p>

                <p>The liability (criminal in this case) of <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/cbi-examines-2-doctors-in-dera-sacha-sauda-castration-case/story-Gxiqs9bdPfxWIrF0iRASJK.html">Dera workers and its doctors</a> opens up the possibility of trans* persons asking for damages and compensation against genital alterations. One fact that the judgment does get right is that the sex reassignment surgeries for trans* individuals (consensual or otherwise) often gets performed by quacks and surgeons who have almost little to no experience in performing such surgeries. Bringing medical negligence against the surgeons for genital alterations is in fact quite unexplored. Amritananda Chakravorty, working with <a href="http://www.lawyerscollective.org">Lawyers Collective in New Delhi</a> notes how difficult it becomes to sustain such claims. She says that lack of proper government guidelines for sex reassignment surgeries always becomes a defense for surgeons and doctors to escape any kind of liability. She says that in most of these surgeries, getting hold of all the documents becomes a problem and in some cases families are not ready to bring these cases before the courts. In lot of cases, the consent of trans* individuals becomes quite manufactured at the promise of safe and successful surgeries.</p>

                <p>Recently, in Germany, Michaela &#8220;Micha&#8221; Raab <a href="http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Nuremberg-Hermaphrodite-Lawsuit-Damages-and-Compensation-for-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations">successfully won a case </a>against the Erlangen University Clinic for non-consensual intersex genital mutilation treatment. At the age of 20 Micha had consulted doctors for their lack of period and breast growth. The doctors put them on a female hormone therapy and operated on them for &#8216;oversized clitoris.&#8217; This treatment caused bone pain, migraines, vision ailments and depression. It was only years later that Micha realized that they had XY chromosomes and were genetically male. Micha claimed that the doctors did not reveal this and that they might have wanted to live as a man. The court ruled out the liability of the surgeons arguing that lack of disclosure of diagnosis wasn&#8217;t the surgeon&#8217;s fault but held the Clinic responsible for damages and compensation. In <a href="http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/gesundheit/intersexualitaet-chirurg-muss-fuer-entfernung-von-geschlechtsorganen-zahlen-1515845.html">another case</a> from Germany, a claim brought 20 years after the surgery was performed which erroneously marked the complainant as a man, was successful in claiming damages against the doctor for illegal medical interference. Similarly in the case of <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/born-in-between">M.C. v. Aaronson</a> in the US, a suit brought by M.C., by and through his adoptive parents, in which under the custody of the South Carolina Department of Social Services (SCDSS), sex assignment surgery was performed on M.C. to make his body appear female. M.C. was born with Ovotesticular DSD, i.e., with internal reproductive organs of both male and female sexes. Later in his life however, M.C. started identifying himself as a boy. The District Court for the District of South Carolina charged<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2015/03/05/m-c-v-aaronson-update/"> the doctors</a> with medical malpractice for failing to obtain adequate informed consent before performing the surgery. However, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/case/crawford_decision.pdf">reversed </a>the lower court&#8217;s decision noting that the doctors who performed the surgeries in the year that it was performed did not have a fair warning from then existing precedent that performance of such a surgery would be a violation of constitutional right.</p>

                <p>In the Hans Raj case, the court also establishes that there is no bar of limitation for registering a complaint for commission of cognizable offence, which in this case, is of grievous hurt. Although all these cases are of non-consensual medical interventions, the medical intervention on trans* bodies in India has very troubling consequences. There is a very poignant moment in the play &#8216;Color of Trans 2.0&#8217; which depicts series of life incidents of the performers. In one of the narratives, Angel Glady shares her experience of getting a sex re-assignment surgery. She recounts how nervous but excited she was to be finally getting the surgery. Her appointment gets repeatedly delayed by the surgeon and when she wakes up after the surgery and finally comes in terms with the operation, she thanks the surgeon for having given her a new body and for having given her new hope. But at the same moment she breaks down in a fit of anger and shouts that she also thanks the surgeon for making her urinate like &#8216;this&#8217; and rips open a pack of water against her thighs which shoots the jet of water against her face while she tries to cover her face with the other hand, evidently indicating how horribly wrong the surgery had gone.</p>

                <p>The medical interventions onto trans* bodies have been severely criticized while talking about non-consensual intersex individuals. The surgery done on intersex individuals generally <a href="http://jurist.org/hotline/2015/10/arvind-narrain-intersex-justice.php">deny diverse sex characteristics</a> among humans and tries to fit the body into male-female binary. The <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5026">Sex Determination Amendment</a> (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act of 2013 in Australia includes remedies and redressal for <a href="https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf">involuntary or coerced</a> [PDF] sterilization of intersex people. In India, the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 2003 has <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sex-determination-an-old-law-a-new-debate/">no way of covering people</a> who could argue for violation of their bodies through surgical interventions as it only talks about the illegality of determining the sex of the unborn child. </p>

                <p>The point here is that consensual cases of genital alterations have no way of finding their ways to the court of law apart from medical negligence. Sex Reassignment surgeries as a whole get covered with the discourse of absolute necessity of individuals trying to escape their &#8216;dysphoria&#8217; or to attain the sex and genders of their choice. The path between the surgery and the purpose for which an individual underwent that surgery somewhere gets lost. With the legal obsession of granting &#8216;third gender&#8217; rights, there is almost no way of talking about people who undergo surgeries without any intention to attain other genders at all. Nonetheless, the Hans Raj case definitely would open channels to claim damages and/or compensation for SRS gone wrong and genital alteration surgeries. </p>

		<title>On the Road to Abolition: Capital Punishment and Its Uncertain Future in the United States</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.smu.edu/professor-profiles/ryan">Meghan J. Ryan</a> of <a href="http://www.law.smu.edu">Dedman School of Law</a>, Associate Professor of Law, discusses the evolution and future of the death penalty...</p><strong>C</strong>apital punishment in this country has a long and storied history. In the early years, the colonies regularly executed criminal offenders for a variety of crimes, including arson, piracy, and sodomy. These executions were often public in nature. As our country continued to grow and progress, executions continued but became much rarer in practice. The rarity with which executions were imposed perhaps ironically created a constitutional problem. Because being sentenced to death was like being "<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/408/238#writing-USSC_CR_0408_0238_ZC2">struck by lightning</a>," imposition of capital punishment was arbitrary and capricious, which amounted to it being unconstitutional. As a result of this and other concerns, in 1972, the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/408/238">struck down</a> the death penalty as it was being applied in the states. Despite this difficulty, many states clung to the extreme punishment, and, just four years later, the Court <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/428/153">upheld</a> Georgia's new and revised capital punishment statute, which set the standard for the additional thirty-seven states that reinvested in the death penalty.</p>

<p>Since 1976, the number of states embracing capital punishment has generally hovered around thirty-eight. In recent years, though, several states have explicitly or effectively walked away from the punishment. Since 2004, seven states have abolished the death penalty either through statute or case law: <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/new-york-1">New York</a> (2004), <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/18/nyregion/18death.html?_r=0">New Jersey</a> (2007), <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/news/state/191028406892newsstate03-19-09.htm">New Mexico</a> (2009), <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/03/09/134394946/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty">Illinois</a> (2011), <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/25/justice/connecticut-death-penalty-law-repealed/">Connecticut</a> (2013), <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/12/31/the-most-recent-state-to-abolish-the-death-penalty-is-about-to-empty-its-death-row/">Maryland</a> (2013), and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/us/nebraska-abolishes-death-penalty.html?_r=0">Nebraska</a> (2015). This amounts to a change from 76% to 62% of states supporting capital punishment. This shift is significant for a couple of reasons. </p>

<p>First, it suggests that much of the public is changing its views on the issue of capital punishment. This is probably a reaction to the realization that <a href="http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/detaillist.aspx?View=%7bfaf6eddb-5a68-4f8f-8a52-2c61f5bf9ea7%7d&SortField=Exonerated&SortDir=Asc">well over 1,500 Americans</a> have been wrongfully convicted in this country. It is also likely a result of greater understanding that imposing capital punishment on an individual is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/05/01/considering-the-death-penalty-your-tax-dollars-at-work/#68222d6f17f0">vastly more expensive</a> than feeding, housing, and medicating an inmate for the rest of his life. For example, a <a  href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/WashingtonCosts.pdf">recent study</a> [PDF] put the costs associated with an aggravated first-degree murder case in which the death penalty was sought at north of $3 million in the state of Washington, whereas the costs associated with an aggravated first-degree murder case in which the death penalty was not sought was around $2 million in the state. </p>

<p>The second and related reason that the shift in support for capital punishment is significant is that it raises questions about the constitutionality of the punishment. As early as 1958, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a>'s prohibition on "cruel and unusual punishments" "<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/356/86">must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.</a>" (Actually, this statement in support of the Court's decision did not have precedential effect, but the Court has repeatedly adopted it as binding law in its subsequent opinions.) This approach to the Eighth Amendment indicates that our interpretation of it may change with time as society evolves. This is despite the fact that U.S. Supreme Court Justices, as well as legal practitioners and scholars, still debate more broadly whether we should take an originalist or living constitutionalist approach to interpreting the Bill of Rights. But this evolving understanding of the Eighth Amendment means that a practice that was once considered constitutional may later become unconstitutional even if the Court does not overrule its prior opinion on the matter. In <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/00-8452P.ZO">Atkins v. Virginia</a>, for example, the Court determined that it is unconstitutional to execute intellectually disabled persons even though the Court had&#8212;just thirteen years earlier&#8212;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/492/302">concluded</a> that this practice was <em>not</em> unconstitutional. Similarly, in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/03-633P.ZO">Roper v. Simmons</a>, the Court determined that it is unconstitutional to execute juvenile offenders even though the Court had <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/492/361">previously concluded</a> that this practice was <em>not</em> unconstitutional. Importantly, the Court reached these contrary conclusions in the later cases of <span class="casename">Atkins</span> and <span class="casename">Roper</span> without overruling the prior decisions. Instead, the Court concluded that the facts had changed over time&#8212;and society's values had changed&#8212;<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1209362">forcing a new, updated meaning</a> of the Eighth Amendment. With this living, evolving understanding of the Eighth Amendment, there is room for even the death penalty to become unconstitutional over time. </p>

<p>In determining whether a punishment practice has become unconstitutional as society has evolved, the Court has looked primarily at whether various jurisdictions have adopted or rejected the practice. This, the Court has <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/492/302">explained</a>, is the "clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values." The Court has also occasionally examined whether the punishment is actually imposed in practice and whether professional groups or the international community oppose the practice. In <span class="casename">Atkins</span>, it took sixteen states withdrawing support from the practice of executing intellectually disabled individuals for the practice to move from constitutional to unconstitutional within a period of thirteen years. These sixteen states were added to the three jurisdictions already prohibiting the practice, as well as to the fourteen states rejecting capital punishment altogether. The <span class="casename">Atkins</span> Court also stressed that it is not so much the number of states withdrawing their support for the practice that matters, but it is "<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/00-8452P.ZO">the consistency of the direction of change</a>" that is important. In comparison, while just seven states have withdrawn support for capital punishment altogether, the consistency of the direction of change within a short period of time has been remarkable on this issue. No non-death penalty state has adopted capital punishment since 1995. This trend is even more impressive when compared to <span class="casename">Roper</span>. In that case, it took just six states to newly abandon the practice for the Court to find it unconstitutional. These six states were added to the twelve states that already prohibited juvenile offender executions, as well as the twelve states that had rejected the death penalty altogether. </p>

<p>The <span class="casename">Roper</span> Court did rely on additional considerations, however. The Court was also concerned about factors such as the infrequency which with the practice was employed and juveniles' general lack of maturity, underdeveloped sense of responsibility, and lesser culpability than adults. Still, when comparing the shift in states' rejection of executing juvenile offenders with the recent shift in states rejecting capital punishment altogether, the latter is more overwhelming. While a change in just six states' laws pushed the Court to find unconstitutionality in <span class="casename">Roper</span>, we have recently had seven states abandon the death penalty in its entirety. That puts us at nineteen states rejecting capital punishment. In <span class="casename">Atkins</span>, that same number of states&#8212;nineteen&#8212;specifically rejected executing intellectually disabled offenders, and in <span class="casename">Roper</span>, just eighteen states specifically rejected the practice of executing juvenile offenders. Employing this method of state-counting, which the Court has <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/492/302">emphasized</a>, provides the "clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values," it seems that we have reached the territory of possible unconstitutionality of capital punishment. </p>

<p>There remains the issue that capital punishment, unlike the practices of executing intellectually disabled persons or juvenile offenders, is specifically mentioned in the Bill of Rights. How could a punishment contemplated by the Constitution be unconstitutional? First, although the <a  href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Constitution mentions capital punishment</a>, it does not specifically indicate its constitutionality. It suggests that, if capital punishment is to be employed, there are limits on its use&#8212;specifically that "[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital ... crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury" (except in particular circumstances); that no one shall "be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life";  and that no person shall "be deprived of life ... without due process of law." Perhaps more importantly, because the Court has explicitly adopted an evolving meaning interpretation of the Eighth Amendment, a punishment that was once constitutional can become unconstitutional over time. This is what happened in <span class="casename">Atkins</span> and <span class="casename">Roper</span>, and this evolving approach does not provide exceptions for punishments mentioned in the Bill of Rights. </p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why one might argue that capital punishment is unconstitutional. Indeed, the petitioner in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Shonda-Walter-Cert-Petition.pdf">Walter v. Pennsylvania</a> suggested that the rarity with which the punishment is employed, and the fact that its imposition is laced with racial bias, means that capital punishment should be found unconstitutional. Perhaps the best argument for unconstitutionality here, though, is based upon the number of states that have rejected the practice. Just as many states have rejected the death penalty as rejected executing intellectually disabled offenders and executing juvenile offenders&#8212;numbers that convinced the Court to find these practices unconstitutional. If the trend of abolition continues as it has over the past decade, the death penalty should be something that cannot withstand constitutional challenge. As the Court indicated in <span class="casename">Atkins</span>, the direction and consistency of rejecting the punishment will be overwhelming.</p>

		<title>Republicans Play Hypocritical Politics With the Supreme Court</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/directory/bryan-h-wildenthal">Bryan H. Wildenthal</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego discusses the history of Supreme Court vacancies and presidential nominations during presidential election years...</p><strong>J</strong>ustice Antonin Scalia, one of the most provocative judges in American history, was known for his brilliantly argued views on the plain text and original meaning of our Constitution. So perhaps it is fitting that his death has triggered an epic political and historical argument over when to appoint his successor on the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Scalia's body had not even begun its final journey home from remote West Texas when leading Republicans threw caution and decency to the winds, declaring they would block consideration of any nominee to fill the vacancy until after President Obama leaves office. Obama has almost a full year left in the term to which the American people reelected him. But Republican senators and presidential candidates closed ranks behind a hastily proclaimed "precedent" allegedly developed over the last "80 years" not to confirm Supreme Court nominees during presidential election years. Suggestions have appeared in recent days that there might be some cracks in the Republican monolith, but it is still important to dissect this argument carefully.</p>

<p>It is, first of all, stunningly hypocritical. It is also factually wrong. But even if, as in the old song lyric, Republicans "don't know much about history," they usually claim, like the late Justice Scalia himself, to care about the "original" meaning of the Constitution, including historical practices going back to the nation's founding said to provide guidance. It is thus strange and highly suspect that they suddenly narrow their focus to only the last 80 years of the 227 our Constitution has been in effect.</p>

<p>Where does this "80-year" talking point come from, anyway? Well, the last time the Senate confirmed a Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election year, to fill a vacancy occurring that same year, was 1932 (84 years ago). President Hoover (a Republican, by the way) got his nominee confirmed to fill a vacancy that happened in January, only slightly earlier in the year than Scalia's death, before being defeated that November by his Democratic successor, President Roosevelt. That precedent, of course, inconveniently contradicts the current Republican argument, which is apparently why they drew the line at 80 years to avoid it. But their argument is bogus anyway, falsely implying that such vacancies have happened since 1932 but with the opposite outcome (wait for the next president). But no outcomes like that exist.</p>

<p>Suppose for a moment that no comparable Supreme Court vacancies at all happened between 1932 and Scalia's death. All that would show is that such vacancies are not very frequent. It would not provide any logical reason to ignore what was done the last time it happened (in 1932). In any event, unhappily for Republicans, 1932 was <em>not</em> the last relevant occasion.</p>

<p>Even if we play along and blinker ourselves to look only at the last 80 years, the Republican argument falls apart. There has in fact been one election-year vacancy since then, in 1956. And the outcome was exactly opposite to what they now argue. The 1956 vacancy occurred very late in the year, October, and yet President Eisenhower (another Republican) <em>immediately</em> installed a new justice by recess appointment, right before the election. That justice was then confirmed in March 1957, thus removing this case on a technicality from the category of "election-year vacancy-plus-confirmation." True, confirmation became much easier and more likely once Eisenhower was reelected, but the relevant point is that he didn't wait to find out. He acted before the election and did not just leave the choice to whoever took office in January 1957.</p>

<p>It gets worse. Recall that the broader version of the Republican argument frantically blasted out the day Scalia died was no Supreme Court confirmations, period, during election years (in the last 80 years). Slight problem: In two more such years, 1940 and 1988, nominees by a Democratic President (Roosevelt) and a Republican President (Reagan) were confirmed, though it is true they filled vacancies that arose before the election year (but just barely in the first case, a death in mid-November 1939).</p>

<p>Then there is 1968, an example that might at first blush seem favorable to Republicans, since that was an election year in which Republican senators played a major role in blocking a Democratic president's late effort to make a court appointment. But 1968, while a bit more complicated, also does not support the Republican talking points, and in fact further undermines them. Chief Justice Earl Warren waited until June that year to announce his intention to retire (four months later in the year than Justice Scalia's death), while stating he would continue to serve until a successor was confirmed. President Johnson nonetheless went ahead and nominated a successor, defying the "precedent" now claimed. Conservative senators in both parties ultimately blocked Johnson's flawed nominee (he withdrew), but they held hearings and gave him ample consideration. There was much less time to act, and no urgency since no actual vacancy existed.</p>

<p>By contrast, blocking any consideration this year of any replacement for Scalia would guarantee a vacancy on the court lasting at least a full year, and more likely 16 months (around 500 days) until after the next court term ends in June 2017. That would seriously hamper its work and create numerous 4-4 splits. There has been no gap of that length in the court's full strength since the Civil War era.</p>

<p>Let us pause to be very clear: During the relevant time frame <em>claimed by Republicans</em> we have actual <em>bipartisan</em> precedent contradicting their bogus "precedent." Republicans say President Obama should not even nominate Scalia's replacement, but in four of the last twenty presidential election years, Supreme Court vacancies existed, occurred, or were announced, and <em>in all four cases</em> the incumbent presidents (two Republicans and two Democrats) went ahead and made a nomination (or even more pushy, a recess appointment), and in three out of four cases, the Senate confirmed the incumbent's choice.</p>

<p>Now let us honor Justice Scalia by doing what he often did in his greatest opinions, and follow the history back to the founding era. The details are a bit complicated. (History buffs may consult a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2735256">paper</a> posted by the author of this essay containing supporting data and explanations.) But the big picture is clear: Not only is there nothing resembling the precedent Republicans claim, a strong <em>contrary</em> tradition dates back to the founding era. Here are the highlights:</p>

<p>In <em>every single</em> election-year vacancy in American history, the incumbent president did not follow the course Republicans now demand of President Obama. Instead, all those presidents, including some very unpopular "lame ducks," nominated and made vigorous efforts to confirm the replacement justices of their choosing. And in a heavy majority of cases, those presidents got their way and the justices they nominated were confirmed and seated on the court. Three of those were Chief Justices of the United States, including Chief Justice John Marshall, by common consent the greatest in American history, who served 34 years (1801-35).</p>

<p>In the eight most relevant cases of election-year vacancies occurring by June (thus allowing reasonable time), the Senate gave full consideration and up-or-down votes to the nominees seven out of eight times and approved them six out of eight times, a 75 percent success rate. In the one case, in April 1844, when the vacancy did not result in a Senate vote, there was actually another pending vacancy from December 1843, for which the lame-duck incumbent did receive Senate votes and which he eventually succeeded in filling less than a month before his term expired. So incumbent presidents actually received full Senate consideration in 100 percent of the most relevant election years.</p>

<p>In nine cases, including the other 1844 case, nominees were confirmed during election years (or even later before the end of that presidential term) to fill vacancies that occurred the previous year (in five out of nine cases, in October or later right before the election year began). Incumbent presidents enjoyed a 100 percent success rate with those nine nominations.</p>

<p>We thus have a grand total of 17 relevant vacancies, from 1796 to 1988, which either occurred during the first half of an election year, or which occurred the year before but were not resolved until after the election year began. The Senate gave the nominees full consideration and up-or-down votes in 16 cases (in 100 percent of the 12 election years involved, five of which involved double vacancies), and approved the nominees 15 times out of 17, an 88 percent success rate.</p>

<p>Those Republicans who claim, with special ostentatiousness, that they honor the original understanding based on practices close to the time of the Constitution's adoption, should pay special heed to this fact: Two election-year vacancies, plus two additional vacancies filled by election-year confirmations, occurred within fifteen years of the Constitution taking effect in 1789. <em>All four received full Senate consideration and approval.</em></p>

<p>When President George W. Bush was in the White House, Republicans argued that every presidential nominee was entitled to a fair up-or-down vote, and that any Senate filibuster or other refusal to grant such a vote violated the spirit and perhaps the letter of the Constitution they claim to revere. Some Democrats, including then-Senators Obama and Hillary Clinton, sought to filibuster the confirmation of Justice Alito in 2006. But no Senate Democrat ever suggested the Senate not hold hearings or consider his nomination, and a substantial number of Democrats joined the 72-25 vote to end the filibuster, ensuring Alito's confirmation and a major shift to the right in the ideological balance on the court. Senate Democrats later came to agree with Republicans on the filibuster, and limited its use.</p>

<p>Now the shoe is on the other foot and Republicans, quite simply, want to change the rules. No one disputes that senators, after fairly considering any nominee, have the right and power under the Constitution to withhold their "consent." And everyone knows the current Senate has a Republican majority with the votes to do just that, though they would have to account to the American people for how fair and justified such a rejection might be.</p>

<p>But for senators to declare in advance that they will not even consider any nominee President Obama may propose, to keep a seat open for more than a year in the hope that a Republican president may fill it, is a truly shocking and extremist step. It would be a bizarre obstruction, unparalleled in American history. It would be an astonishingly uncalled-for insult to a duly elected President of the United States. It would surely invite Democratic retribution if a Republican president sought to fill the same vacancy later.</p>

<p>If Senate Republicans choose to ignore the facts, defy history and abuse their power in this way, they will dishonor both Justice Scalia and the Constitution he revered and spent his life defending. They should think again.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist John W. Klinker of Loyola University Chicago School of Law discusses how the decision in <span class="casename">Montanile</span> potentially creates a precedent that could affect the funding of welfare benefit plans... </j:header><strong>A</strong> common term in welfare benefit plans establishes an agreement whereby the plan will pay covered medical expenses of an employee when the employee is injured by a third party. Typically, as part of this arrangement, employees agree to reimburse the plan should they later recover from the injurious third party. Such an agreement is done by way of a subrogation clause. Consider what happens when an employee receives money from such a third party, but instead of reimbursing his plan he spends it on non-traceable items, such as services or consumable goods. These were the facts before the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-723_1bn2.pdf">Montanile v. Board of Trustees of the National Elevator Industry Health Benefit Plan</a> [PDF].</p>

<p>The National Elevator Industry Health Benefit Plan, the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs_2015_2016/14-723_bs.authcheckdam.pdf">Respondent</a> [PDF], administered a welfare benefit plan. Under the plan, a beneficiary could receive advanced benefits when injured by a third party, thus providing them with adequate financial support while pursing said third party in a legal action. By accepting advanced benefits, a beneficiary agreed to use any amounts recovered through the legal action to promptly reimburse the plan, even before recovered funds were used for attorneys' fees or costs, or the expenses or damages of the beneficiary.</p>

<p>In December 2008 Robert Montanile, the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs_2015_2016/14-723_pet.authcheckdam.pdf">Petitioner</a> [PDF], was the victim of a car accident. A drunk driver ran through a stop sign and collided with Montanile's car causing him severe injuries. As a result of his injuries Montanile underwent spinal fusion surgery and several other forms of treatment. At the time of his injury, Montanile was a beneficiary of the Respondent's welfare benefit plan. As such, the plan paid for Montanile's medical expenses, which totaled $121,044.02. Before receiving the advancement, Montanile signed an agreement affirming his obligation to reimburse the plan for any recovery he received by way of "legal action or settlement or otherwise."</p>

<p>Montanile filed suit against the driver and ultimately received a $500,000 settlement from which he paid his attorneys' fees and costs, reducing his overall recovery to nearly $240,000. The Board of Trustees of the Respondent then pursued reimbursement from Montanile's remaining funds pursuant to the subrogation clause of the plan. They received resistance from Montanile's attorneys who claimed the plan was not entitled to reimbursement. The two sides attempted to reach a resolution regarding reimbursement, but the negotiations failed. Montanile's attorneys then informed the Board that the remaining funds would be disbursed to Montanile unless the Board objected within fourteen days. The Board failed to object and the funds were disbursed. Six months later the Board filed suit.</p>

<p>The Board sought reimbursement of the plan's advancement to Montanile by way of an equitable lien on the settlement funds or any other property in Montanile's possession. Montanile, having taken possession of the settlement funds several months earlier and spending nearly all of them, argued that the funds were no longer separate and distinct from his general assets and, therefore, an equitable lien could not be placed on them. This argument failed at the district court, which granted summary judgment for the Board, and the Eleventh Circuit, which affirmed the trial court's decision. The issue before the Supreme Court was "whether an ERISA fiduciary can enforce an equitable lien against a defendant's general assets under these circumstances."</p>

<p>ERISA, specifically <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1132">§ 502(a)(3)</a> therein, allows fiduciaries to pursue equitable relief through a civil suit when necessary to enforce a welfare benefit plan's terms. This provision became the crux of the discussion in Montanile where the court had to determine whether pursuing reimbursement from Montanile's general assets, on top of the settlement funds, constituted a permissible equitable remedy or overstepped into the realm of a remedy at law.</p>

<p>In determining whether the resolution sought by the Board constituted equitable relief, the court undertook an extensive investigation of how to characterize the claim before them and the nature of the remedies requested. The court has previously ruled&#8212;in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/99-1786P.ZO">Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Co. v. Knudson</a>, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/05-260P.ZO">Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc.</a>, and<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/11-1285.pdf"> US Airways, Inc. v. McCutchen</a> [PDF]&#8212;on plan fiduciaries seeking reimbursement of advancements to beneficiaries for medical expenses that the beneficiaries later recovered from third parties. Under the precedent set forth in those three cases the Board's claim would be considered equitable, but it was not conclusive as to whether the remedy sought by the Board is equitable.</p>

<p>Equitable remedies typically provide a party with rights to or over a particular item whereas legal remedies give a party the right to recover money from the defendant's assets. Therefore, for an equitable lien to exist it must be placed on a specifically identifiable fund, as that fund would constitute a particular item over which a right could be held. By spending the entirety of the specifically identifiable fund on non traceable items, a beneficiary eliminates the item upon which an equitable lien could be placed. The court stated that such conduct by a defendant is improper but despite that impropriety, a plaintiff could not pursue reimbursement from the beneficiary's general assets.</p>

<p>Therefore, the court ultimately ruled in favor of Montanile and held that the lower court could not properly allow the plan to seek recovery from Montanile's general assets. Instead, the court remanded the case to the trial level for a determination of whether Montanile had kept his settlement funds and the rest of his assets segregated, as well as whether he owned any traceable assets directly stemming from the funds.</p>

<p>The precedent set by this decision may be quite narrow, but it has the potential to greatly affect the funding of welfare benefits plans. In situations such as the one in <span class="casename">Montanile</span>, benefit plans are set up to provide assistance to their beneficiaries during their time of need following injuries. In return, those beneficiaries expressly agree, by way of a subrogation clause, to repay their plans if they are made whole by the third party who caused their injury. Welfare benefit plans expect beneficiaries to reimburse them as part of their constant efforts to remain adequately funded such that they can provide necessary support for all beneficiaries under the plan. However, as Justice Ginsburg raised in her <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-723_1bn2.pdf">dissent</a>[PDF] to <span class="casename">Montanile</span>, beneficiaries now "can escape that reimbursement obligation . . . by spending the settlement funds rapidly on nontraceable items."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.netanya.ac.il/englishSite/Members/Pages/DrBarryFeinstein.aspx">Dr. Barry A. Feinstein</a> of <a href=" http://www.netanya.ac.il/englishSite/Pages/default.aspx">Netanya Academic College School of Law</a> discusses the recent seizure of US naval ships and personnel by Iran...</p>

<p><strong>F</strong>or more than a year and two months, Iranians held hostage at any given time some 50 to 70 United States <a href=" http://www.historyguy.com/iran-us_hostage_crisis.html#.Vsx2crdWG1t ">diplomats and other citizens </a> after students overran the Embassy of the United States in Iran in November 1979. This prompted President Jimmy Carter to <a href=" http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=33079">declare</a> the captives as "innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy." <a href=" http://www.historyguy.com/iran-us_hostage_crisis.html#.Vsx2crdWG1t ">Photographs</a> of the hostages blindfolded were displayed by the Iranians, and the American captives were showcased on Iran's State television while hooded or blindfolded. British marines, sailors and their vessels were <a href=" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3077540.stm">commandeered by Iran</a> while they were engaged in training exercises in June 2004, after the craft had allegedly entered the Iranian part of the Shatt al-Arab waterway dividing southern Iraq and southern Iran. The British personnel were subsequently shown blindfolded on Iran's State television. In March 2007, British naval personnel and their boats were again <a href=" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6494289.stm">seized by Iran</a>, which contended they were trespassing in Iranian waters. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, called the Iranian actions "<a href=" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6493391.stm">unjustified and wrong</a>". The humiliation by Iran of the US and its naval personnel in January 2016, is yet another example of its continuing denigration of the US, the UK and their citizens. Iran seized US Navy riverine command boats and their sailors when they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/world/middleeast/us-navy-iran.html">purportedly strayed into the territorial sea of Iran</a> due to navigational and mechanical trouble and then proceeded  <a href=" http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/12096275/Iran-holds-two-US-Navy-boats-in-Persian-Gulf.html">to broadcast pictures</a> of the US sailors kneeling with their hands clasped behind their heads and paraded them on Iran's State television. There subsequently appeared to be an apologetic undertone on the part of the US <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35299930">regarding the entire incident</a>. I will undertake to examine this recent Iranian seizure of US naval personnel and their vessels as a case study of Iran's systematic violation of international law.  </p>

<p>Under long-standing principles of the <a href=" http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf ">international law of the sea</a> [PDF] when applied in an objective fashion to the Iranian seizure in January 2016 of US naval personnel and their vessels, there is nothing for which the US needs to apologize. Iran, on the other hand, clearly violated those same respected principles of international law and has everything for which to apologize. The international law of the sea recognizes the <a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_1_1958_territorial_sea.pdf">right of each coastal State</a> to a band of sea adjacent to its coast called the territorial sea over which that State is sovereign. Under customary international law, the territorial sea in the past extended out from the coastal State for three nautical miles, and today it is considered to extend out from the coast for twelve nautical miles. At the same time, however, the international law of the sea grants any foreign-flagged vessels (including military ships) the right to navigate through this territorial sea off a State's coast if they are exercising <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf">innocent passage</a> [PDF].</p>

<p>The right of innocent passage means that the US vessels were permitted to be situated in the territorial sea of Iran all the while they were conducting expeditious and continuous passage, according to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (to which the US is not a party, yet it does in significant part reflect customary international law), that was "not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State." First of all, regarding the term "passage," even if the US vessels were stopped or anchored in Iran's territorial sea due to <em>force majeure</em> or <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf">distress</a> [PDF] caused by engine trouble, or "mechanical problems in their navigation system" as officials in Iran themselves have <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-navy-boat-iran-1.3400786">admitted</a> was the situation, or one of the craft was rendering assistance to <a href=" http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/18/diesel-engine-trouble-while-iranian-waters-led-eas/">the other</a>, as apparently actually occurred, the US boats would still legitimately be considered to have been engaged in "passage." Next, in order to establish if the passage of the US vessels through Iran's territorial sea was innocent, assuming of course the veracity of the Iranian allegation that the vessels were indeed located at the time in Iran's territorial sea, it is necessary to turn to the decision rendered by the International Court of Justice over 65 years ago in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/1/1645.pdf">Corfu Channel Case</a> [PDF], according to which the determination of whether the passage of a foreign vessel is "consistent with the principle of innocent passage" depends on "the <em>manner</em> in which the passage was carried out." Basically, all the while that passage of a foreign ship through the territorial sea takes place objectively in a way that is not threatening the security, peace or good order of the coastal State, or in the terms of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea a foreign ship is not engaged in certain specified activities, none of which would appear to be relevant here, it is considered to be carrying out innocent passage. Consequently, under generally recognized principles of the international law of the sea, any subjective feeling or impression on the part of the Iranians that the presence of US ships may have constituted a security threat to Iran is not determinative, since their passage itself was undertaken in a <em>manner</em> that was "consistent with the principle of innocent passage." Additionally, even if the US boats were passing through Iran's territorial sea, as military vessels they were in any respect immune from Iranian criminal enforcement jurisdiction. Moreover, if the US boats at the time of their seizure were navigating outside territorial or internal waters, they were permitted to exercise their freedom of navigation, unencumbered by rules relating to innocent passage through territorial seas or restrictions in internal waters.</p>

<p>But can the passage of a warship ever really be considered "innocent," per se?  The previously mentioned Corfu Channel Case in fact involved none other than warships, which the International Court of Justice determined unequivocally do indeed have the right of innocent passage, although this decision dealt with the right of innocent passage of warships through an international strait which was comprised of territorial seas. Furthermore, the international law of the sea allows submarines, most of which are military vessels, to exercise the right of innocent passage if they navigate on the surface of the territorial sea while they show their flag. Thus if one type of warship, a submarine, is permitted by international law to exercise the right of innocent passage, it can be inferred that any other type of military vessel, such as a US Navy riverine command boat, has a similar right of innocent passage through the territorial sea. Beyond that, the headings of the applicable subsections of the relevant international law of the sea treaties describing the right of innocent passage and the conditions under which it may be exercised, refer in an all-encompassing fashion to "Rules Applicable to All Ships." The US military boats, or any other warships for that matter, certainly belong to the generic category of "All Ships," every one of which may exercise the right of innocent passage. This conclusion is re-enforced by the headings of subsequent subsections of the pertinent international law of the sea treaties which refer, <em>inter alia</em>, to rules applicable specifically to merchant ships and specifically to warships.  Under the international law of the sea therefore warships are entitled to exercise the right of innocent passage.</p>

<p>Consequently, the US owes no apology to Iran for the presence of its military ships in Iran's territorial sea. It is actually Iran that should apologize to the US for its seizure of US naval personnel and vessels in January 2016, in violation of venerable principles of international law.</p>

		<title>Is Water a Commodity or a Human Right? Lessons from Flint</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2016/02/ryan-stoa-flint-water/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=" https://law.fiu.edu/faculty/directory/ryan-b-stoa/">Ryan Stoa</a> of <a href=" https://law.fiu.edu/">Florida International University School of Law</a> discusses the lessons from the Flint, Michigan water crisis ...</p><strong>W</strong>hen I teach Water Resources Law to my students, I often start each semester by juxtaposing two competing conceptualizations: water as a private commodity vs. water as a human right. The contrast demonstrates the diversity in approaches to water management, while foreshadowing the public-private tensions that permeate contemporary water law debates. Some students are attracted by the promises of privatization, including capital investments to upgrade infrastructure and the efficiencies of allowing market forces to allocate water where it is most valued. Other students push back, noting the fundamental human need for water as a justification for holding water resources in common, while citing the negative externalities that frustrate attempts to monetize water accurately.  </p>

<p>Both viewpoints are playing out in the wake of the Flint, Michigan, water crisis. Last month I wrote about the rhetoric following the crisis, noting that many critics were <a href="http://ryanstoa.com/blog/2016/1/22/flint-water-crisis-evokes-the-human-right-to-water-debate">echoing the human right to water perspective</a>. One Michigan state representative even proposed a bill that would declare water to be a human right. To <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/donald-cohen/is-the-tragedy-in-flint-a_b_9103320.html">many observers</a>, the crisis was caused by water managers holding financial considerations above public health and environmental justice. Indeed, Flint's decision to switch from water provided by the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to water provided by the Karegnondi Water Authority was largely a financial one, as the move was projected to save the city $19 million over eight years. When the Flint city council voted to return to Detroit water, the city's emergency manager opposed the move on financial grounds. To many, water cannot be managed with such financial tunnel-vision, and a human right to water might rebalance water managers' priorities.</p>

<p>But in the last several weeks, another view has (re)emerged. Some have <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2016/02/01/heres-how-to-fix-flints-water-system-pri">called for further privatization</a> of water resources. To these critics, the Flint water crisis is a crisis of public governance, one that may have been avoided had a private utility been in charge. A private utility would still have received government oversight, while avoiding the messy political battles necessary to receive infrastructural investments. A private utility, furthermore, would not have enjoyed sovereign immunity, providing an incentive to avoid litigation arising from water contamination. </p>

<p>So, which view is the right view? It is important to get this right, to extract some broader lessons learned instead of dismissing the Flint ordeal as flukey mismanagement. On the contrary, water infrastructure is crumbling across the country. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives our drinking water infrastructure a D+ grade, and despite capital investments not keeping pace with upgrade costs, Congress has been spending less and less on local infrastructure maintenance. The upshot of all this is that more and more pressure will be placed on water managers to provide safe, clean drinking water despite all these challenges.  </p>

<p>Just this week, the long-running water troubles experienced by residents of St. Joseph, Louisiana <a href="http://ktla.com/2016/02/23/brown-tap-water-in-louisiana-town-deemed-safe-to-drink/">made headlines</a>. Their water has iron levels 32 times higher than the US EPA's recommendations. State engineers blame the iron concentration on faulty infrastructure in need of repair. The small town's representatives, though, have done little to address the problem. In places where human and financial resources are scarce it will be difficult to promote sound water management, whether public officials are managing water resources directly or overseeing private operators. As long as infrastructure continues to deteriorate and little to no resources are allocated to address water problems, we can expect to see more cases like Flint, Michigan, and St. Joseph, Louisiana. </p>

<p>For critics on both sides of the privatization vs. human right spectrum the Flint water crisis is Exhibit A for the need to reform. Unfortunately, water resources can be mismanaged in many different ways, whether privately or publicly held.  Water users in Flint paid a staggering $864 a year for water. But a report by Food and Water Watch found that on average private utilities <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/02/17/making_big_bucks_off_water_private_for_profit_water_companies_charge_58_more_than_the_government_report_finds/">charge more for water</a> than public utilities. Complicating the matter further are the many water management frameworks that constitute a public-private enterprise. Around the country there are examples of both public and private water providers working well, while others are struggling to meet the needs of their communities in safe, sustainable and equitable ways.  </p>

<p>Regardless of which end of the spectrum you are on, what should be clear is that water is a vital human resource, and to manage it well requires investment and expertise. In the face of crumbling infrastructure and shrinking budgets, it will be tempting for water managers of any utility to short-change the system in favor of short-term payoffs.  Short-changing Flint's water quality in favor of cost-saving measures was not a unique trade-off, but rather a circumstance public and private utilities will likely find themselves facing in the future. If Flint provides one lesson learned, then, it's that water regulators may want to reconsider the costs and benefits of short-term water management thinking. The nation's water infrastructure is in need of repair, and water resources are in need of responsible governance. There may be more than one way to accomplish those objectives, but it will be hard to do so without significant investments. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nolo.com/lawyers/profile/law-office-daniel-wright">Daniel J. Wright</a> of <a href="http://www.danielwrightlaw.com">The Law Office of Daniel Wright</a> discusses the need to revisit life without parole sentencing in the US justice system...</p><strong>"N</strong>o one truly knows a nation," Nelson Mandela <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nelson-mandela-quotes-a-collection-of-memorable-words-from-former-south-african-president/">wrote</a>, "until one has been inside its jails." The story of America's jails and prisons is a sad reflection: dirty, overcrowded, riddled with gang violence, drugs sold by prison guards and lack of rehabilitative programs. Notwithstanding this, the incarceration rate of the United States is the highest in the world. The United States has 4.4 percent of the world's population, but has almost 22 percent of the world's prisoners. The number of incarcerated Americans has more than tripled since 1980. There is no evidence of a corresponding increase in safety or decrease in crime as a result of these policies.</p>

                <p>One category of prisoner, the non-violent drug offender, has gathered attention recently. President Obama sponsored initiatives to reduce sentences and secure the release of drug offenders in federal institutions who posed little risk to the community. Other prisoners were not so fortunate. One of the categories of prisoners who have not received relief are those sentenced to life in prison, life without parole and extraordinarily long, death-in-prison sentences. </p>

                <p>Many countries around the world have abandoned the concept of life imprisonment. <a href="http://antt.dglab.gov.pt/exposicoes-virtuais-2/carta-de-lei-da-abolicao-da-pena-de-morte-1867-marca-do-patrimonio-europeu/">Portugal</a> [Portuguese] was the first. Life sentences were abolished there in 1867, and the last execution is recorded to have taken place in 1847. Other countries followed suit, and life sentences are not imposed in Norway, Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Spain and many other countries. A more common alternative is to allow parole after a certain term of years: <a href="http://www.pbc-clcc.gc.ca/infocntr/myths_reality-eng.shtml">25 in Canada</a>, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=py_dX__lu50C&pg=PA152&lpg=PA152&dq=15+years+in+belgium+life+term+jail+sentences+parole&source=bl&ots=L5634h-WKT&sig=lurbG8xFCdT1onVXMwIYNALKJN4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj42oe57JPLAhUJMj4KHUT6A-cQ6AEIRTAI#v=onepage&q=15%20years%20in%20belgium%20life%20term%20jail%20sentences%20parole&f=false">14 years in Belgium,</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=s-QtAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA173&lpg=PA173&dq=15+years+in+switzerland+life+term+jail+sentences+parole&source=bl&ots=owjlxUWubd&sig=-KUVQHOWqvGEesnDeSPXbXMl7Nk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiE9tf47JPLAhVDNz4KHeaXC3EQ6AEIRjAI#v=onepage&q=15%20years%20in%20switzerland%20life%20term%20jail%20sentences%20parole&f=false">15 in Switzerland</a>, <a href="http://www.penalreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/UNODC-1994-Lifers.pdf">21 years in Italy</a> [PDF]. In the United States life without the possibility of parole is permitted, as is capital punishment.</p>

                <p>It is well known that the percentage of adult males incarcerated in American prisons is disproportionately African-American and Latinos. The rate of incarceration of African-American males is more than six times the rate of adult white males. It should come as no surprise that the punishment of life imprisonment is also visited disproportionately upon African-American defendants, and more disproportionately than incarceration in general. In Maryland, 85 percent of those serving life sentences are African-American. According to <a href="http://newjimcrow.com">Michelle Alexander</a>, the United States "imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid."</p>

                <p>The rates of life imprisonment vary widely among the states. An important component of the rate is the possibility of parole&#8212;the real possibility, not theoretical. Life prisoners make up 10 percent of all Maryland prison inmates. One reason for this is that Maryland doesn't have a functioning parole system for life inmates. The Governor still has a veto over the parole of life inmates, a politicization of the process that has been abandoned by the vast majority of states. As a result, only a fraction of the life inmates eligible for parole have been given a <a href="http://www.abell.org/sites/default/files/publications/afr-stillblockingexit215.pdf">serious consideration for parole</a> [PDF].</p>

                <p>This is troubling for a number of reasons. Unlike many states, Maryland has experience with the release of inmates serving life sentences. In 2012, <a href="http://www.mdcourts.gov/opinions/coa/2012/111a09.pdf">a ruling by the Maryland Court of Appeals</a> [PDF] concerning improper jury instructions in the 1970s and 1960s led to the release of almost 100 prisoners serving life and LWOP sentences. Most had served several decades in maximum security prisons. Notwithstanding the conditions in which they had lived while incarcerated, the prisoners released overwhelmingly managed to transition successfully to a positive life upon their release. There has been little recidivism. Inmates who have served long sentences often simply "age out" of crime. California has released large numbers of inmates in response to court rulings brought about by overcrowded conditions. Recidivism among inmates released has been low. Many people also have trouble understanding that errors are often made at trial, and the innocent convicted.</p>

                <p>Charles A. Scott was convicted of murder at the age of 19 in Baltimore. By now he has served almost 49 years in prison. He is 69 years of age. He hasn't had a rule violation in years and can hardly be considered a risk to the community. Even though he has spent almost five decades in prison, like many life prisoners he has never given up hope for a future life on the outside. In earlier years, he dug tunnels and managed to escape on three different occasions. He was out for more than a year. He recently managed a successful post-conviction appeal. Although sentenced to die in prison by a judge as a teenager in the 1960s, he refused to lose hope or accept the life-denying categorization of the rest of his life. </p>

                <p>It isn't obvious what benefit can be gained by further incarceration of elderly prisoners, but the prisons have many inmates in their 70s and 80s. They pose little risk to the community, but continue to be held because parole procedures make their release difficult or impossible. The rising cost of their medical care is borne by the State. The cost of housing an inmate is more than $38,000 per year in Maryland, even before medical costs for elderly inmates is factored in.</p>

                <p>Sebastian McMillian has served more than 25 years in a Maryland prison after his attorney recommended that he plead guilty to a double murder rather than go to trial. The benefit she promised him was that the two life sentences he would receive would be concurrent rather than consecutive&#8212;no benefit at all. He has been a model inmate, however, with no infractions and an outstanding institutional adjustment. Raheem Rahman was convicted of attempted murder in 1999. Since that time he has pursued education and written a book about his experiences. He hasn't gotten in trouble. Although these men would have been released long ago in many countries, they remain incarcerated: an example of warehousing rather than individualized assessment of danger and potential.</p>

                <p>The jurisprudence that leads to these results includes mandatory minimum sentences, repeat offender statutes (<a href="http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1032-sentencing-enhancement-three-strikes-law">&#8220;three strikes&#8221; laws</a>), and mandatory life and LWOP sentences for certain crimes. In many states, homicide leads to mandatory life and LWOP sentences. In states such as Maryland that don't have viable parole mechanisms for life inmates, a life sentence effectively becomes an LWOP sentence. Since parole exists on the books, but largely not in reality, the problem is in many respects hidden. Another factor is the promotion of LWOP by those seeking the <a href="http://www.muse.jhu.edu/results?searchtype=regular&search_term=abolition+death+penalty&filtered_content=content&limits=&x=0&y=0">abolition of the death penalty</a>. Those seeking to avoid the horror of capital punishment sometimes hold up LWOP as an acceptable alternative. Yet there are many times more inmates facing the irrational punishment of life and LWOP than capital punishment and they simply do not get the publicity or attention in the public mind that capital inmates do.</p>

                <p>The decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-280_3204.pdf">Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U.S. ____ (2016)</a> [PDF], may offer a helpful beginning. That case involved a juvenile, Henry Montgomery, convicted of murder at the age of 17 and sentenced to death. His sentence was later reduced to a mandatory sentence of life without parole. At the time of the Supreme Court's decision, he was 69 years old, like Charles Scott. He sought collateral review of his sentence in light of the court's earlier decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-9646g2i8.pdf">Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. _____ (2012)</a>[PDF], which held that mandatory LWOP sentences for juvenile homicide offenders violates the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eight Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment</a>. <span class="case name">Miller</span> required that sentencing courts consider a child's diminished culpability and heightened capacity for change in rendering sentences. The State of Louisiana argued, as several state courts and federal courts had held, that Miller was not intended to be applied retroactively. The Supreme Court, through Justice Kennedy, held that <span class="case name">Miller</span> was indeed intended to apply retroactively. Rather than ordering new trials for all the prisoners who suffered <span class="case name">Miller</span> violations, however, the court held that states could remedy the violation by permitting prisoners to be considered for parole. In other words, parole commissions could look at a prisoner's institutional record and make a determination of the inmate's growth and maturity since the time of the original sentence. Many inmates will have shown an ability to reform their behavior and no longer pose a danger to the community. Under <span class="case name">Miller</span>, these prisoners will be released and start the process of transitioning back to the community.</p>

                <p>Henry Montgomery is 69 and has spent approximately 50 years in prison. Sadly, there are many more like him. The Supreme Court has determined that his life deserves a second look. Many prisoners have changed with time. Juveniles are not alone in the process of maturation. The decision in Montgomery is a recognition that no judge can predict at the time of sentencing how an inmate will respond to the process of incarceration and the passage of time. Judges have a gavel, not a crystal ball. If there is benefit in taking another look at a juvenile offender's life after a period of years, then the same logic can, and should, be applied to other inmates as well. </p>

                <blockquote>I mounted the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with a feeling akin to awe, and stood for a long time before the seated figure of one of the greatest men of history, surely the greatest of all the rulers of the nations, the man who would spend a sleepless night because he had been asked to order the execution of a young soldier. He certainly knew that in pardoning we are pardoned.&#8221;</blockquote>  &#8212;Alan Paton

Toussaint discusses whether the disparate impact of international aid in Haiti...</j:header></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>s a seemingly routine afternoon faded to dusk on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8455629.stm">January 12, 2010</a>, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake rocked Haiti's capital city, Port-au-Prince. The devastation was <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/0,28757,1953379,00.html">exhaustive</a>: 316,000 people dead, 300,000 injured and nearly 1.5 million people left homeless. As the once majestic National Palace lay in ruin, it became clear that the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/haiti/overview">poorest</a> country in the Western Hemisphere would need all the help it could get in order to get back on its feet.</p>

<p>Heeding Haiti's call the international community donated nearly $13.5 billion dollars to assist with humanitarian efforts, including $4 billion <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s1104/text">donated</a> by the US government. Yet five years later less than 7 percent of the total money pledged has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/world/americas/in-aiding-quake-battered-haiti-lofty-hopes-and-hard-truths.html?_r=0">aided</a> the Haitian people, and 93 percent has been lost to fraud and waste. While unfortunate this outcome is far too customary to the citizens of Haiti. In fact since 1986, hundreds of millions of <a href="http://www.cgdev.org/files/1426185_file_Ramachandran_Walz_haiti_FINAL.pdf">dollars </a> [PDF] belonging to the Haitian people has sat in European bank accounts, as thousands of Haitians struggle in the squalor of makeshift tent cities. These funds, stolen from Haiti's treasury in 1986, were deposited in several countries&#8212;including Switzerland&#8212;by Haiti's <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/04/world/americas/jean-claude-duvalier-death/">former</a> dictator Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier. For 15 years, he led a government rife with open corruption. </p>

<p>Following Baby Doc's exile an accounting was done which revealed that nearly $504 million of the Haitian people's money had been misappropriated from the nation's treasury and hidden in foreign accounts. Over the next three decades the Haitian government fought to have the money returned, but to no avail. In 1986 both the French and Swiss governments refused to overturn money held within their jurisdictions. Then in 2011, hours before the massive earthquake, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court decided to release the remaining $6 million held in Swiss accounts to the Duvalier family uninhibited. After the earthquake, Switzerland's government was worried about a public relations nightmare following the court's decision and decided to reverse course. The Swiss enacted a groundbreaking new law&#8212;the <a href="https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/20100418/201102010000/196.1.pdf">Restitution of Illegal Assets Act (RIAA)</a> [PDF]. </p>

<p>Before the RIAA Switzerland had long been a tax haven for deposed despots&#8212;mandating strict bank confidentiality, and enabling clients to invest assets without paying any taxes. Past despots with Swiss bank accounts included General Sani Abacha of Nigeria, who kept a reported $505 million in Swiss bank <a href="http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/bribe/2009/05/haiti-the-long-road-to-recovery.html">accounts</a>, and the former president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos, who stashed away $624 million. The RIAA looks to remedy this problem by burden shifting. It moves the burden of proof away from the petitioning nations seeking a return of funds and places it squarely onto the shoulders of the former heads of state, requiring the heads of state to prove that his or her alleged assets were earned legitimately.</p>

<p>The provisions of the RIAA are straightforward. First, it must be determined that traditional channels of justice cannot produce binding outcomes. This may occur for a variety of reasons, but it is typically caused by an inability of the petitioning country to successfully prosecute the former head of state in their own justice system. Once this determination is made, the <a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/federal-council.html">Federal Council of Switzerland</a> may freeze assets held in Switzerland if two additional conditions are met: (1) the funds held in Switzerland are significantly larger than what could have credibly earned by the former head of state while in office, and (2) the petitioning country has a history of corruption. Once these two conditions are met, the burden of proving the legitimacy of the assets falls on the former head of state. If no such proof can be provided, the assets are frozen. If frozen, the RIAA provides for a restitution process. In the case of Baby Doc Duvalier, this point came in 2013. </p>

<p>Nonetheless two years after the Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland determined that restitution was appropriate, the RIAA has failed to return any money to the Haitian people. Why? Swiss authorities fear that the funds will be returned into a cycle of corruption. Accordingly the two sides have never even met to negotiate. All the while 60 percent of the country's entire population lacks access to basic health care services and less than 2 percent of <a href="https://www.concern.net/sites/default/files/resource/2011/02/haiti_country_profile_factsheet.pdf">Haitian</a> children finish secondary school.</p>

<p>I propose a possible solution to this seemingly intractable quagmire. Currently there are between 3,000 and 10,000 <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/ngo-republic-haiti/">NGO's</a> in Haiti, providing four-fifths of the nation's social services. In fact NGO's are widely viewed by the Haitian people as being more adept than the national government in solving the pressing issues that affect their day-to-day lives. This is Haiti's reality. Therefore, I propose that the government of Switzerland accept non-governmental entities as suitable custodians of stolen assets in their restitution standards under the RIAA. </p>

<p>The Swiss are not the first to want to assist Haiti, and yet be wary of corruption. Back in 1986, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, fashioned a <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2928&context=fss_papers">remarkable</a> non-governmental entity called The Commission for a New Haiti (The Commission). The Commission would consist of a seven-member panel: three development economists or experienced project administrators; two representatives chosen from a reputable human rights organization; and two representatives chosen from the private sector. All panel members would be of Haitian descent, with all commission proceedings being a matter of public record, subject to public scrutiny during a thirty-day comment period. The Commission would have the fiduciary duties of allocating any funds returned to Haiti in accordance with a detailed restitution plan governed by an agreement between Switzerland and Haiti. Such procedure would mitigate both the temptation of corruption and any fears of wasteful spending. </p>

<p>While the RIAA was an important step in the right direction, it has effectively been stalled by mistrust and cynicism. By embracing NGO's like The Commission For A New Haiti, Switzerland could finally put an end to this three decades long cat-and-mouse game and finally fulfill the very goal that the Swiss government had at the time of the RIAA's passage&#8212;delivering direct assistance to the citizens of the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

		<title>Closing Guantanamo Isn&amp;apos;t Enough</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.rwu.edu/jared-goldstein">Jared A. Goldstein</a> of Roger Williams University School of Law discusses President Obama's proposal to close the prison in Guantanamo Bay...</p><strong>L</strong>ast month President Obama announced his latest <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/GTMO_Closure_Plan_0216.pdf">plan [PDF]</a> to close the prison in Guantanamo Bay. Under the proposal the government will continue to look for countries to take in three dozen detainees who have been cleared for transfer, while the remaining 55 detainees would be moved to a federal facility in the United States. </p>

<p>Closing the prison at Guantanamo deserves support because Guantanamo has come to symbolize the abandonment of the rule of law. For almost fifteen years Guantanamo has been a prison outside the law, where the rules that the United States long ago agreed to follow in the conduct of war have been rejected in favor of indefinite detention without trial, waterboarding and other forms of "enhanced interrogations." Yet the president's plan to merely transfer the detainees from one prison to another seeks only to address Guantanamo as a symbol, without doing what is really needed: re-committing the nation to detention only in accordance with law.</p>

<p>Both sides in the fight over closing the Guantanamo prison have acted as if all that matter is symbols. President Obama <a href=" https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/23/remarks-president-plan-close-prison-guantanamo-bay">said</a> that the prison should be closed because of its symbolic value, because terrorists "use it as propaganda in their efforts to recruit." Republicans counter that the prison should be kept open to symbolize our nation's resolve in the war against terrorism. Senator Marco Rubio <a href=" https://marcorubio.com/news/marco-rubio-opposes-closing-guantanamo-bay/">said</a> that "We should be putting people into Guantánamo, not emptying it out," and Senator Ted Cruz agrees: "don't shut down Gitmo, expand it and let's have some new terrorists there." Upping the stakes, Donald Trump longs to torture new detainees: "I would bring back waterboarding, and I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding." </p>

<p>What is missing in the debate over Guantanamo is any discussion about the actual persons kept there. Republicans in favor of keeping Guantanamo open often describe the detainees as inhuman monsters. After tweeting a video in which he threw Obama's proposal to close Guantanamo into the trash, Senator Pat Roberts took to the Senate floor to <a href=" http://www.roberts.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=VideoClips&ContentRecord_id=32D01CF9-BCA3-44E9-B4B7-7B8D20ADFB7D">declare</a> that the country could never safely hold the detainees at Guantanamo because they are "fixated on the destruction of America and they have no regard for life, not that of their own and especially not for the lives of innocent civilians." Bringing the detainees to the United States would threaten national security, republicans warn ominously, because their presence inside the country would attract new acts of terrorism. </p>

<p>The fears provoked by the proposed closure shows that we have forgotten our history. During World War II, the Army held 425,000 German prisoners of war in the United States&#8212;including thousands of committed Nazis and members of the SS&#8212;while Germany was committing acts of brutality and massacres of civilians on a scale far beyond anything al Qaeda or ISIS has attempted. There were thousands of American Nazi sympathizers, far more than the estimated number of al Qaeda and ISIS supporters in the U.S. today, who might have been tempted to commit acts of sabotage or terrorism against the detention of their comrades. Yet the U.S. military somehow handled the massive security arrangements necessary to hold hundreds of thousands of German prisoners without any significant national security problems. Perhaps this history suggests that we could handle a few dozen al Qaeda members kept in maximum security facilities without jeopardizing national security.</p>

<p>Even more, what is missing from the debate is any <a href=" http://law.shu.edu/publications/guantanamoReports/guantanamo_report_final_2_08_06.pdf">discussion [PDF]</a> of the actual persons who have now been held at Guantanamo for fourteen years, more than ten years longer than any of the World War II prisoners of war. The POW status of Germans and other combatants in past wars went largely unquestioned because they were captured on the battlefield wearing enemy uniforms. In contrast the military found it nearly impossible to determine whether the 800 detainees brought to Guantanamo really were enemy combatants. They were not captured on the battlefield but were rounded up by Afghani and Pakistani locals for large bounties. The U.S. did not receive dossiers or files on these men; no investigation had been done about who they were. All the evidence that has been gathered to justify their continued detention was gathered after they were in custody, most of it obtained through interrogations of the detainees themselves through abusive and improvised techniques conducted by officers with no training in interrogation. </p>

<p>For many detainees the evidence linking them to terrorism is extremely flimsy. The government has argued that the fact that many of them were Arabs in Afghanistan or Pakistan after September 11, 2001 by itself suggests that they are terrorists. For some detainees, the best the military could come up with to show a link with terrorists is that the detainees were caught wearing a Casio wristwatch associated with known terrorists. By the military's own estimates, a large percentage of the detainees were held by mistake. But since they had no reliable way to tell who had worked for al Qaeda and who had not, the government made the calculation that it was safer to imprison them all rather than let some dangerous men go free.</p>

<p>My client Mohammed al Daihani was a Kuwaiti accountant who was brought to Guantanamo in December 2001. The United States never claimed that Mr. Daihani had taken part in any terrorist activities against the United States or that he was a member of al Qaeda, the Taliban or any other anti-American group. Instead Mr. Daihani was accused of having given a few hundred dollars to an organization that appeared to be a legitimate charity, which had given money to another organization, which in turn was alleged to be associated with al Qaeda. After years of imprisoning and interrogating Mr. Daihani at Guantanamo, the military had developed no evidence that he had intended to support any terrorist group. Yet it did not matter whether Mr. Daihani had intended or even known that his donation may have indirectly supported terrorism. He was designated an enemy combatant because his donation supported terrorism, whether he meant to or not. And on that basis Mr. Daihani was locked up 24 hours a day for four years in solitary confinement in a 9- by 6-foot cell, forbidden from speaking to his family or even reading a newspaper.</p>

<p>Supporters of the Guantanamo prison continue to repeat the lie perpetrated by Donald Rumsfeld that the detainees are the "worst of the worst," but by 2003 Rumsfeld privately admitted in documents that have been <a href=" http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=342110087101019126105082088105097006002092063023032070066028023098081091119103006117121123020058055102054115071084095002001120049055017040015007070110102127068097101033093000103064114110089072005076103089087109001024098113002022100020123086000117123121&EXT=pdf">declassified [PDF; appendix A]</a> that the majority of the detainees were at most "low-level" operatives. Very few detainees have even been accused of committing acts of terrorism or violence against the United States. Fewer than 20 are likely to face trial before military commissions. The rest have simply been held indefinitely without charges and without any formal process for determining whether they actually did anything to justify detention that has lasted more than fourteen years and threatens to go on indefinitely. </p>

<p>The betrayals of our commitment to law have been perpetuated not only by the president and Congress but by the courts as well. In 2008 the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-1195.ZS.html">Boumediene v. Bush</a> that the detainees have a constitutional right to pursue habeas corpus, which would ensure that the detentions continue only upon sufficient proof that the detainees really are enemy combatants whose imprisonment can be lawfully justified. In several cases, however, the D.C. Circuit has gutted habeas for the Guantanamo detainees, ruling in <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Kiyemba_v_Obama_555_F3d_1022_384_US_App_DC_375_DC_Cir_2009_Court_?1457625690"> Kiyemba v. Obama</a> that the detainees may be imprisoned indefinitely without due process; and ruling in <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1531137.html">Al-Adahi v. Obama</a> and <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Latif_v_Obama_No_105319_2012_BL_107280_DC_Cir_Apr_27_2012_Court_O?1457625775">Latif v. Obama</a> that detention may be justified on unreliable and untested information. Together these rulings have made meaningless <span lass="casename">Boumediene's</span> promise of a "meaningful opportunity" to contest the basis for the detentions.</p>

<p>Without any valid legal process to determine whether the indefinite imprisonment is justified, Guantanamo remains a prison outside the law. President Obama is right that Guantanamo should be closed because it conflicts with our nation's commitment to the rule of law. But to close the prison without providing a fair process to make sure the detentions are lawful would be an empty gesture, a symbol lacking in substance.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists Evan M. Meyers and Paul Geske of <a href="http://www.mcgpc.com">McGuire Law, PC</a> discuss the US Supreme Court's recent decision in <u>Campbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez </u>and the implications of this decision...</p><strong>T</strong>he US Supreme Court&#8217;s recent January 20, 2016 decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7167416114471624218&q">Campbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez</a> is a landmark for class action practice. The Supreme Court held that a defendant&#8217;s offer to provide complete relief to the plaintiff does not render the case moot. <u>Gomez</u>, a putative class action, was originally filed in 2010 in California. The mootness issue arose in the case after the defendant, Campbell-Ewald, made an individual &#8220;pick-off&#8221; offer to the putative class&#8217;s representative, Jose Gomez. Had Campbell-Ewald&#8217;s attempted pick-off been successful, it would have mooted the case and avoided any potential liability to the putative class that Mr. Gomez sought to represent. Mr. Gomez rejected the offer, however, as it only included a payment for him individually, while failing to provide any injunctive or monetary relief for the tens of thousands of other putative class members.</p>

                <p>Although the <u>Gomez</u> holding clarified that a mere offer cannot moot a plaintiff&#8217;s claims, some have argued that the case leaves open the possibility for a defendant to moot a case by going one step further, and actually <em>transferring</em> money to the plaintiff in the full amount of his claims. Proponents of this view cite the dissenting opinions and the majority&#8217;s statement that it was declining to reach the issue of &#8220;whether the result would be different if a defendant deposits the full amount of the plaintiff&#8217;s individual claim in an account payable to the plaintiff, and the court then enters judgment for the plaintiff in that amount.&#8221; It is foreseeable that defendants will seize on this statement, and the even stronger statements in the dissents, and attempt to repackage the pick-off offer tactic in the form of an actual transfer of money. Indeed, in the few months immediately following <u>Gomez</u>, lower courts have already confronted this issue as defendants have begun testing this strategy.</p>

                <p>It is misguided, however, to think that <u>Gomez</u> authorizes or approves of a forced entry of judgment in a class action. In fact, the <u>Gomez</u> opinion strongly suggests that the opposite is true. Specifically, the court states that a putative class representative with a viable claim is entitled to see the case through to certification. The court observed that &#8220;a would-be class representative with a live claim of her own must be accorded a fair opportunity to show that certification is warranted.&#8221; This is because Rule 23 bestows on the class representative a procedural right to have the issue of certification adjudicated. Although the court did not go so far as to define this right&#8217;s extent or attributes, it would likely violate the class representative&#8217;s right if the court forced him to accept a payment in satisfaction of his claims, over his objection, and then dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

                <p>In addition to the procedural right to certification, a class representative also has a strong interest in obtaining certification, and this interest remains intact even in the event that his individual claim is paid. First, certification is the only way for the class representative to hold a defendant liable for <em>all</em> of its wrongdoing and to adequately deter similar wrongdoing in the future. Second, certification creates economic interests. If a class is certified, class representatives usually receive an incentive award, which compensates them for all of their time and effort spent working on the case and representing the absent class members. Certification also promotes administrative efficiency by spreading the costs and expenses of the litigation among the class, who will share in the eventual recovery. Importantly, these interests keep the case live, and prevent it from becoming moot.</p>

                <p>Some lower courts have observed that a forced entry of judgment is inappropriate in the class action context for the additional reason that it upsets the incentive structure created under Rule 23. Rule 23 imposes a duty on the named plaintiff to be an adequate representative of the absent class members and to champion their interests. This duty arises as soon as the class action complaint is filed. The class representative thus serves in a quasi-fiduciary role in relation to the class even prior to certification. It would therefore be contrary to the adequacy requirement and the class representative&#8217;s obligations to the class to force him to take an individual payoff at the expense of the other class members, who would then be left without a representative or any relief.</p>

                <p>Even in a case where the defendant successfully effects payment, there will still be disagreement over whether that payment actually satisfies the plaintiff&#8217;s prayer for relief. In other words, questions will remain as to what the plaintiff is entitled to recover on his claims, and whether the defendant&#8217;s payment constitutes complete relief. For example, the plaintiff may be requesting injunctive relief, even though the defendant is only willing to pay money. Or the plaintiff may be seeking class-wide relief, but the defendant may only want to make an individual deal. In such situations, the plaintiff is asking for one thing, but the defendant is only willing to provide something else. Since these issues will be in dispute, they will need to be decided by a court. And because there is a dispute that needs to be adjudicated, and the court is capable of granting relief to the plaintiff, there will still be a &#8220;controversy&#8221; for purposes of Article III, and the court will necessarily retain jurisdiction over the case.</p>

                <p>Finally, the court&#8217;s reasoning in <u>Gomez</u> is supported by fundamental policy considerations as well. If courts allowed defendants to moot a case at will, and thereby eliminate jurisdiction or otherwise justify a forced entry of judgment, they would essentially be handing the keys to the courthouse doors to defendants. As Justice Ginsburg observes, the <u>Gomez</u> dissenters&#8217; opinions would have put defendants &#8220;in the driver&#8217;s seat&#8221; of a case, allowing them to impose a settlement against a plaintiff&#8217;s will. Taken to its logical extreme, this strategy could be used to cripple virtually any type of class action, from consumer privacy and product defect actions, to environmental and civil rights cases. This would give defendants an extremely powerful tool that hinders access to the courts and frustrates the purposes of Rule 23. </p>

                <p>The primary goal of Rule 23, and of class actions generally, is to give people who are similarly situated, who have been injured in the same way, a mechanism to join together and resolve their issues in a fair and efficient way in a single proceeding. This is especially so where it is economically infeasible for each individual class member to bring a separate suit, or each individual lacks the resources to hire an attorney. Closing the courthouse doors to a large proportion of class actions not only frustrates these goals, it also harms the public, because it allows entities to escape liability for activities that injure a large number of people, as long as the injury to each individual is relatively small. By avoiding this outcome, the court preserved the viability of class actions as a mechanism for aggregating the claims of members of the public who have been injured at the hands of a single party. The legacy of <u>Gomez</u> is an assurance that class actions are an essential means of promoting the public&#8217;s access to justice, and courts should be wary of any attempt to curtail that legacy.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.ru.nl/law/cmr/organisation/staff/staf-members/mantu-(sandra)/">Dr. Sandra Mantu</a> of Radboud University discusses France's upcoming vote on a bill that would grant the legislator authority to revoke citizenship of natural born citizens...</p><strong>O</strong>n February 10, 2016, the French National Assembly adopted a bill&#8212;<a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/ta/ta0678.asp">Constitutional Law to Protect the Nation</a>&#8212;that introduces in the French Constitution provisions dealing with the declaration of the state of emergency and specifies that the legislator has the competence to regulate nationality law, including conditions under which a person can be deprived of French nationality or of the rights attached to it where she has been condemned for a crime or offense that constitutes a serious violation of the nation's life. The French Senate (upper house) will vote on the text on March 22, 2016. To become law, the bill needs to receive a 3/5 majority; based on the results in the National Assembly (162 in favor, 148 against and 22 abstentions) one expects a close vote. This article will focus only on the issue of citizenship deprivation and the legal implications of the proposed measures.</p>

<p><strong>What are the rules? </strong></p>

<p>At present, citizenship deprivation is regulated by the <a href=" https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006419321&idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006136064&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070721&dateTexte=20160311">French Civil Code</a> that sets down the rules for the acquisition and loss of French nationality. French law distinguishes between <em>perte</em> (loss) regulated by <a href=" https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006419958&idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006149955&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070721&dateTexte=20160311">Article 23</a> of the Civil Code and <em>décheancé</em> (deprivation) regulated by <a href=" https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006150513&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070721&dateTexte=20160311">Article 25</a> of the Civil Code. Article 23 covers voluntary and involuntary loss of nationality and its personal scope can include&#8212;depending on the specific case&#8212;persons who acquired French nationality by birth, whereas citizenship deprivation is applicable only to persons who have become French after birth (naturalized citizens). Loss of nationality is considered something of an academic provision since in the recent past it has never been used. Since 1998 (law no. 98-170 of 16 March 1998) a person can be deprived of citizenship only if she is not made stateless by the measure, which in fact means that the person has more than one nationality. Naturalized citizens may have their naturalization withdrawn in cases of fraud or misrepresentation according to Article 27-2 of the Civil Code. The latter case is the most common ground for loss of French nationality. </p>

<p>Citizenship deprivation based on Article 25 of the Civil Code sanctions lack of allegiance (<em>defaut de loyalisme</em>) in the following circumstances: </p>

<p>(1) conviction for acts against the fundamental interests of the nation, or conviction for ordinary or serious offenses which constitute acts of terrorism; </p>

<p>(2) conviction for crimes considered to be crimes against the public administration (crimes committed by persons holding a public office); </p>

<p>(3) conviction for acts of insubordination in relation to performance of national service;</p>

<p>(4) engaging, for the benefit of a foreign state, in acts that are incompatible with the quality of French national and commission of acts that are prejudicial to the interests of France. No prior conviction is necessary. </p>

<p>Since 2003 citizenship deprivation can occur for facts prior to the person's acquisition of French nationality. As a rule, deprivation can be pronounced only within 10 years of the perpetration of the facts. In 2006 the time limits increased to 15 years in case of acts of terrorism or acts against the fundamental interests of the nation. Citizenship deprivation entails an administrative procedure that gives the executive the power to decide whether to pursue a citizenship deprivation or not. The person concerned must be notified of the government's intention to deprive, and be given the opportunity to make observations and mount an appeal (<a href=" https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000699753">Decree no. 93-1362</a>). The order to deprive has to specify the legal and factual grounds upon which the measure is taken; the authorities can proceed with deprivation only after the favorable opinion of the Council of State. The Council of State is a body of the French government with a dual function: (a) legal adviser of the executive branch on state issues and legislation, and (b) supreme court for administrative justice. The concurring opinion is issued as part of its consultative function. Citizenship deprivation operates only for the future.</p>

<p><strong>What will change?</strong></p>

<p>The constitutional bill clarifies that the legislator has the competence to regulate nationality law, including deprivation of nationality and that any French national can be subject to a citizenship deprivation measure, irrespective of how she acquired nationality. There is no indication that the French executive or legislator intend to water down the protection against statelessness introduced in <a href=" https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000754536&categorieLien=id">1998</a>. With the occasion of the new bill, there has been talk of France ratifying the 1961 <a href=" http://www.unhcr.org/3bbb286d8.html">UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness</a>; no concrete steps have been taken yet. </p>

<p>If the bill is adopted by the Senate in its current form, the French legislator will be able to make changes to the current provisions on loss of nationality. It is unclear whether this will take the form of abrogating altogether Article 25 of the Civil Code and replacing it with a new provision applicable to all French citizens irrespective of how they acquired citizenship or whether Article 25 will survive but a new case of citizenship deprivation will be added alongside it. The initial proposal was phrased differently from the current text&#8212;the provision only referred to the possibility to deprive of citizenship French citizens by birth; it did not cover naturalized citizens for whom Article 25 of the Civil Code was the relevant provision. The text adopted by the National Assembly applies to all persons holding French nationality giving the ordinary legislator the power to create a single framework applicable to the citizenship deprivation of all French citizens, provided that they hold another nationality.</p>

<p>Prior to this constitutional bill, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to modify the provisions of the Civil Code in respect of citizenship deprivation. In 2014 proposals were put forward to deprive of citizenship all French dual nationals if arrested, caught or identified fighting against the French armed forced, their allies or the French police forces. The proposal was rejected by the Constitutional Law Commission of the French Parliament. This failure explains the need to amend the French Constitution since most political parties and the executive believed that the Constitutional Council will not approve an ordinary law allowing dual nationals to lose French nationality acquired at birth. In a decision from <a href=" http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/acces-par-date">1996</a> (upheld in <a href=" http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/acces-par-date/decisions-depuis-1959/2015/2014-439-qpc/decision-n-2014-439-qpc-du-23-janvier-2015.143103.html">2015</a>) the Council stated that although naturalized citizens and citizens by birth enjoy a similar position in respect of nationality law, differential treatment between the two categories in the context of the fight against terrorism is justified as long as citizenship deprivation is limited in time. Historically, French citizens by birth have never been covered by the scope of legal provisions on citizenship deprivation and there is an ongoing discussion as to whether one can speak of a constitutional and republican principle preventing such Frenchmen from losing their nationality&#8212;the Constitutional Council will have the final say if and when asked to decide. </p>

<p>Below is a short analysis of the main elements of the proposal: </p>

<p><em>Personal scope</em>: any person who has French nationality, irrespective of how nationality was acquired. This includes all modes of citizenship acquisition be it at birth or later on in life. The person must have another nationality, thus the measure will only be relevant for dual or multinationals. </p>

<p><em>Material scope</em>: the person must be condemned for a crime or offense that constitutes a serious violation of the nation's life; the conviction must be final. There is no definition of what constitutes a serious violation of the nation's life and the ordinary legislator will have to clarify the scope of this notion if it will proceed to amend the rules on citizenship deprivation. The formulation resembles one of the grounds listed in Article 25 of the Civil Code but the latter covers a broader range of acts for which citizenship deprivation can be engaged in respect of naturalized citizens. When introducing the law in Parliament, the prime minister referred to crimes of terrorism, treason, espionage and similarly serious crimes affecting the life of the nation. He underlined that only the most serious crimes and offenses will justify a measure of citizenship deprivation including direct financing of terrorism, individual acts of terrorism and participation in a criminal group or constitution of a criminal group that intends to commit terrorist acts. Under the current rules, citizenship deprivation affecting naturalized citizens can occur for both terrorism crimes and offenses, which include a wide range of activities. It remains to be seen whether such a large material scope can be justified in relation to French-born citizens or whether the scope needs to be much more limited. </p>

<p><em>Effects</em>: deprivation of nationality or of the rights attached to it. The possibility to be deprived of the rights attached to nationality is a novelty explained by the fact that persons holding only French nationality cannot lose it since they would become stateless. Thus deprivation of the rights attached to nationality can be seen as an alternative measure to be used where citizenship deprivation is not possible. In practice this would lead to a person losing those rights that only French citizens can have&#8212;political and voting rights, as well as the right to hold certain official positions. Deprivation will operate only for the future and will have an individual character, thus the spouse and children of the person concerned will not be affected by the measure. </p>

<p>The ordinary legislator will have to decide whether citizenship deprivation should remain a prerogative of the executive or become a complementary sanction to be administered by a judge as part of the judicial procedure leading to the condemnation of the citizen of a crime covered by the notion of serious violation of the nation's life.  </p>

<p><strong>How effective will a new law be?</strong></p>

<p>Citizenship deprivation has been rarely used by the French executive and since 1973 there are 13 reported cases of citizenship deprivation for acts of terrorism and acts against the fundamental interest of the nation (2015&#8212;five; 2014&#8212;one; 2006&#8212;five; 2003&#8212;one and 2002&#8212;one). President Hollande announced his intention to change the law after the events of November 2015, although his party was against similar proposals in 2014. In light of the attacks that took place in 2015 and in which a number of French born citizens were involved, politically it became necessary to demand that such citizens be deprived of French citizenship. Moreover the government is concerned about the number of French citizens involved in terrorist fighting abroad (sometimes against French troops)&#8212;if born French they cannot be deprived of citizenship, even if they were dual nationals. The allegiance of dual French-Algerian citizens who under current rules cannot be deprived of citizenship since they acquired French citizenship at birth based on double <em>jus soli</em> has been a constant presence in public and political debates about changes to nationality law. Although the proposed law is couched in terms meant to reflect the republican principle of equality between citizens, since only dual nationals can be deprived of citizenship, the measure will affect primarily French citizens of immigrant background whose allegiance to the French nation has been constantly questioned by the far-right. The new measure is seen even by its initiators as having a limited and primarily symbolic effect. The Council of State reached a similar conclusion in its <a href=" http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/pdf/projets/pl3381-ace.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF] on the bill when stating that citizenship deprivation will have a limited dissuasive effect for those planning to commit terrorist acts bearing in mind also that citizenship deprivation can only be applied against persons who have been condemned of very serious crimes in line with the principles of proportionality and necessity. Moreover France is bound by several human rights conventions; it is unclear whether a person deprived of citizenship can be that easily removed from France. Concerns that citizenship deprivation leads to the creation of <em>de facto</em> stateless persons seem justified. Although symbolic, the proposed measure sends a strong message about who belongs to the French nation, at least from the perspective of the French authorities. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.fraktlaw.com/about-us.html">David Frakt</a> discusses President Obama's recent Supreme Court nomination...</p><strong>Y</strong>esterday, President Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/obama-nominates-judge-merrick-garland-to-us-supreme-court.php">nominated</a> Judge Merrick Garland to serve on the US Supreme Court. Within minutes, the Republicans in the Senate confirmed, as they had previously made clear, that they will refuse to even meet with Judge Garland, much less allow a confirmation vote for him. </p>

                <p>The Republicans claimed rationale for refusing to even consider President Obama&#8217;s nominee is that they want to &#8220;let the people decide&#8221; who should appoint Justice Scalia&#8217;s replacement in the next Presidential election. The Republicans have lately refined their message to assert that by declining to allow a vote that they are exercising their Constitutional right to advise and consent, as opposed to completely abdicating their constitutional responsibility. The actions of the Senate Republicans are, in my view, completely illegitimate. But, legitimate or not, they are clearly determined to deny President Obama the opportunity to fill this vacancy. Republicans know that replacing Justice Scalia with even a moderately liberal Justice will dramatically alter the composition of the court, and they simply are not willing to allow President Obama the chance to shape the legal landscape potentially for years to come by consenting to his nominee.  At this point, the only real value of the open seat on the Supreme Court to the President and his party is political. The behavior of the Senate Republicans in abdicating their Constitutional responsibility in this unprecedented fashion provides further evidence of the dysfunction and obstructionism of the Republican majority, providing an argument for returning the Senate to the Democrats; the Democratic Presidential candidate may also benefit somewhat by raising the specter of the Republican Presidential candidate getting the opportunity to appoint another conservative to the court. This frightening prospect may well serve as a useful incentive to get out the Democratic vote. But leaving the seat unfilled could just as easily benefit the Republican nominee - keeping the Scalia seat in conservative hands is undoubtedly a powerful rallying cry on the right; indeed, this theme has already become a regular feature in Republican Presidential candidate stump speeches.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, the court is faced with several important decisions that they must make with only eight members, which is likely to lead to numerous 4-4 tie votes on important issues. This undesirable state of affairs is likely to last well into 2017. The precedent being set by the Senate Republicans virtually ensures that the confirmation process for future Supreme Court nominations, especially for this vacancy, will be a bitter and lengthy partisan battle. Even if the next President nominates someone to fill the vacancy on his or her first day in office, it could take months to get the candidate confirmed.</p>

                <p>What if Judge Garland were to promise, if confirmed, to offer his or her resignation to the next President, whomever it might be, as soon as he or she is inaugurated, effective upon the confirmation of a replacement nominee? The next President could decline or accept the resignation, as he or she saw fit. If the resignation were accepted, Judge Garland would simply remain on the court until his or her replacement was confirmed, then return to his seat on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals (a vacancy that is very unlikely to be filled during the last few months of President Obama&#8217;s term anyway). This would ensure that the court would not have to operate without a full complement of nine justices. If this offer managed to break the political stalemate in the Senate, the worse case scenario for Judge Garland would be a brief stint on the Supreme Court, followed by a return to his lifetime position as a Federal Appellate Judge. Making such an offer would also show Judge Garland to be a selfless jurist, who is above politics and willing to put the good of the country and the judiciary before his personal ambitions.  </p>

                <p>Although offering such a compromise would, in one sense, be rewarding very bad behavior by the Republican Senators, it does offer benefits to Democrats as well. If this offer were enough to persuade Republican Senators to confirm him, it would presumably enhance the likelihood of the Obama Administration&#8217;s preferred outcomes on the cases that Justice Garland would sit on over the next year. Such a compromise would also give President Obama at least some chance to cement his legacy by exercising the right to make an appointment to the Court that he has earned by winning two Presidential elections, an opportunity that he is currently being denied. At the same time, this compromise would allow Republicans to get exactly what they say they want, which is for the 2016 Presidential election to determine which party will get to choose Justice Scalia&#8217;s life-appointed replacement. This compromise might also be appealing to Republicans as a hedge against the strong possibility of the Democratic nominee winning the Presidency, in which case President Clinton or Sanders might well nominate someone far younger and more liberal than Justice Garland. Since a Democratic President would be unlikely to accept the offered resignation, confirming Judge Garland would preclude ending up with a far more objectionable nominee. And if the Republicans refused this eminently reasonable compromise, it would provide even greater political value to Democrats, not only in the Presidential race, but perhaps even in crucial Senate races as well, as Republicans could be portrayed not only as the &#8220;party of no,&#8221; but also as hypocrites, who won&#8217;t even accept a deal that gives them exactly what they claim to be seeking.</p>

		<title>In Israel, Atypical Detention and Typical Judicial Review</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Sari Bashi of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/donate-now?ea.tracking.id=ED2016EVSCgl&gclid=Cj0KEQjwt763BRDZx_Xg3-Pv2cABEiQAoDfeGPjO0BmDHOH-DY-V1u_9FW5rTCfh1C1nR9fbjtNN8-saAhEZ8P8HAQ&variation=5344140064_2">Human Rights Watch</a> discusses the flaws of Israeli judicial review in the context of Mohammed al-Qeeq's hunger strike... </p>

                <p><strong>A</strong>fter 93 days of refusing food, an emaciated Palestinian journalist named Mohammed al-Qeeq resumed eating on February 26. He began his hunger strike to protest being held by Israeli military officials without trial in a system known as administrative detention and ended it when Israel agreed to release him in May, when his detention order will expire.</p>

                <p>The circumstances of his arrest are typical of Israel's administrative detention system, in which nearly 600 Palestinians are being held without trial, according to the Israeli human rights group <a href="http://www.btselem.org/statistics/detainees_and_prisoners">B'Tselem</a>. Israeli security officials claim that releasing him would endanger security because, they say, he is active in the militant group Hamas. But they also say that showing him the evidence against him would endanger security, so he has no chance to refute the charges&#8212;typical in these cases. His wife told Human Rights Watch he was arrested because of his writing and political activism critical of Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</p>

                <p>Administrative detention, like other restrictive measures permitted under the law of occupation, is supposed to be exceptionally tolerated as a necessary but temporary rights restriction, applicable in emergencies. Yet Israel's use of the practice has nearly quadrupled since a low point in 2013, according to B'Tselem. Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is nearing the half-century mark, raising even more questions about the use of supposedly temporary and exceptional measures that inherently trample on the right to due process.</p>

                <p>As part of my legal training, prior to litigating human rights cases before the Israeli Supreme Court, I clerked on the court and saw this system in action over and over again. Al-Qeeq's case stands out for the price he was willing to pay to protest his detention&#8212;it is not clear to what extent his body and mind will recover from the starvation&#8212;but the judicial review he received was all too typical.</p>

                <p>Al-Qeeq challenged his detention before the Israeli Supreme Court, the only non-military court that has jurisdiction. As it has in other such cases, the court refused to cancel his administrative detention but said that it would be "suspended" so long as Al-Qeeq's medical condition neutralized any potential threat. The decision put him into legal limbo, no longer chained to his bed, but not free to leave the Israeli hospital where he was held. Medical reports submitted to the court reported that al-Qeeq had become drowsy, was intermittently unable to hear or speak and suffered constant pain.</p>

                <p>With the exception of a few days in January in which Israeli prison authorities forcibly connected him to an intravenous drip believed to contain vitamins and minerals, he took only water from November 25 to February 26. He survived one of the longest hunger strikes ever carried out by a Palestinian prisoner.</p>

                <p>No one seems to have really known what it meant for an administrative detention order to be suspended, but the court clarified that the order could be renewed if and when al-Qeeq's condition improved and, presumably, he would regain the capacity to pose a threat.</p>

                <blockquote>We are talking unequivocally about a Hamas activist participating in military terrorism</blockquote> <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/16/520/004/t14/16004520.t14.htm">wrote Justice Elyakim Rubinstein</a> [Hebrew], a former attorney general and one of the most senior justices on the court.

                <p><strong>Could that determination really be unequivocal, even by the standards of the Israeli justice system?</strong><br />
                    Israel proclaims that Palestinians can challenge their detention before its highest court, but that review process is so flawed, it has little value beyond the chance it offers lawyers to push the government to compromise&#8212;in this case, to remove al-Qeeq's shackles while keeping him in custody. The court will uphold an order if security officials produce evidence of danger. Such evidence can include accusations from paid informants who do not appear in court, confessions by other detainees, or even the involvement of a detainee's family members in armed activity.</p>

                <p>The evidence is presented in a closed-door hearing attended only by judges and state officials. Judges are supposed to cross-examine the evidence, playing the role of defense lawyer on behalf of the detainee, who is not allowed to know the claims against him. In my experience, however, the judges' role is generally passive. They are presented with binders, sometimes thick and sometimes thin, containing warnings by senior security officials of the harm that would befall the State of Israel and its citizens if the petitioner were released. To order release would be to take responsibility for defying those warnings. Since 1967 the Supreme Court has canceled just one such order against a Palestinian.</p>

                <p>As a court clerk, I assisted in or attended dozens of hearings in which secret evidence was presented. The procedure was routine: the petitioner's lawyers would argue his or her case and then leave the room. After five or 10 minutes, they would return to hear the judges recommend that they withdraw the petition.</p>

                <p>Once during a particularly long morning of hearings, the presiding judge surprised me by asking me to remain in the courtroom during the closed door phase, even though I did not have security clearance. She explained that it would be faster if I stayed, so that I could call the petitioner's lawyers back into the room more quickly.</p>

                <p>I sat at my clerk's post while two intelligence agents dressed in button-down shirts and khaki pants approached the bench with three binders, one for each judge. The judges flipped through the binders. The presiding judge asked whether the information was current. The agent said yes. The hearing ended, and the judges rejected the petition.</p>

                <p>Even if the judges played a more active role this time, how could a hearing held without Al-Qeeq or his lawyer possibly lead Rubinstein to conclude that he is "unequivocally" a terrorist?</p>

                <p>Al-Qeeq is due to be released on May 21, after his hunger strike put pressure on the Israeli authorities, who feared a strong reaction if he were to die. The Israeli Supreme Court maintained its role of watching, reviewing, but not really intervening.</p>

		<title>Why the Ferguson Consent Decree Matters for the First Amendment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=" https://www.brooklaw.edu/faculty/directory/facultymember/biography?id=jocelyn.simonson">Jocelyn Simonson</a> of <a href=" https://www.brooklaw.edu/">Brooklyn Law School</a> discusses the consent decree between Ferguson, Missouri, and the Department of Justice...</p><strong>L</strong>ast week, the City of Ferguson, Missouri, entered into a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/833431/download">consent decree</a> [PDF] with the Department of Justice (DOJ) under which it has agreed to overhaul its Police Department practices through a series of changes intended to promote transparency, community engagement, and law enforcement free of racial bias and excessive force. Reversing its previous position in opposition to the consent decree, the Ferguson City Council voted unanimously to approve the decree after a <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/online/letter-from-the-doj-to-the-ferguson-city-council/pdf_13281d4f-e217-524c-b17d-77159da3ceb6.html">letter from Deputy Attorney General Vanita Gupta</a>&#8212;as well as intense pressure from local activists. This consent decree is one of dozens into which the DOJ has entered under 42 U.S.C. § 14141, which allows the DOJ to sue police departments that engage in a pattern and practice of unconstitutional conduct. But the Ferguson consent decree is especially notable because it offers a possibility of beginning to remedy the policing practices that have become a national example of the racial profiling, excessive force, and profit-driven policing that too often infect local policing in America.</p>

<p>The Ferguson consent decree is important for another reason: it provides unprecedented recognition of the breadth of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> protections for civilians who peacefully observe, record, and contest police activities in public. Of the first 28 consent decrees signed between the Department of Justice and local police departments under § 14141, only three&#8212;those in <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/ehpdsettle_11-20-12.pdf">East Haven</a>, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/spd_consentdecree_7-27-12.pdf">Seattle</a> [PDF], and <a href="http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-LA-0001-0001.pdf">New Orleans</a> [PDF]&#8212;have included a provision regarding the right to record. The Ferguson decree's First Amendment provisions are by far the most detailed and robust to date, containing requirements that the Ferguson Police Department (FPD) develop new guidelines, training, and complaint mechanisms respecting the rights of civilians to observe and record police activity and to gather in groups for protests and demonstrations. (These provisions stemmed in part from a <a href="http://www.aclu-mo.org/download_file/view_inline/1263/535/">previous agreement</a> from August 2014 under which Ferguson, St. Louis, and the State Highway Patrol agreed that members of the public have "a right to record public events.")  </p>

<p>We should be celebrating the Ferguson consent decree's First Amendment provisions. These provisions recognize and support the importance of civilian resistance to, rather than only cooperation with, local policing practices. Much of the nationwide focus on improving policing in America has centered on the importance of "community policing"&#8212;of community members and police departments working together to improve local law enforcement. But equally important is the ability of local residents to publicly observe and contest policing practices. Ferguson provides a potent example of the importance of the rights to observe, record, and dissent: imagine a Ferguson following the death of Michael Brown <em>without</em> the presence of activists, protesters, and civilian videos of those protests. For civilian filming of the police is not only a tool of police accountability, but also a method of expression, of power transfer from police officers to the populations that they police. This transfer of power is especially important in the context of municipalities like Ferguson in which African-Americans make up a majority of the population, yet have relatively little political power.   </p>

<p>Filming by disempowered populations has its own term and meaning in social theory&#8212;<em>sous</em>veillance is a special term for when cameras are turned on those in power. Sousveillance&#8212;being watched from below, rather than from on high&#8212;facilitates the transfer of power from authorities to the less powerful. Many civilian filmers recognize the importance of this power shift. Organized copwatching groups, for example, have proliferated around the US in recent years, in part because they link the power transfer involved in filming the police to efforts at larger social change. Indeed, in Ferguson, the <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/copwatch-ferguson-michael-brown/">Canfield Watchmen</a> formed in the wake of the death of Michael Brown, using crowdsourced funding to equip local residents with body-worn cameras to film the police. Through acts like organized copwatching, filming police in public can become a form of civic engagement, a public gesture in which a civilian says through the pointing of a cell phone at an officer that they are holding that officer accountable in the moment. </p>

<p>A renewed recognition of the First Amendment rights to record, observe, and dissent are necessary to protect the ability of local populations to engage in these important practices. For despite a common understanding that there is constitutional freedom to record the police in public, there has been strong resistance to civilian recording of police officers from police departments around the country, based in large part on accusations that civilian filming "interferes" with police work, places officers in danger, or makes officers hesitant to engage in meaningful police work for fear of being filmed. The DOJ's <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf">Ferguson Report</a> [PDF] highlighted this police resistance to dissent in a nuanced way, documenting how the offense of "contempt of cop" has played out in Ferguson&#8212;not simply through arrests for filming in public (although these did occur with some frequency), but also through more subtle police retaliation for filming and verbal dissent in the form of arrests for disorderly conduct, failure to comply, resisting arrest, or the municipal code violation of Manner of Walking along Roadway, often referred to in Ferguson as "Walking while Black." Although it may seem uncontroversial to require that the Ferguson Police Department refrain from abridging the First Amendment rights of civilians, that requirement is actually crucial to the ability of civilians to regain democratic control of their own streets and roads.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Ferguson consent decree's First Amendment provisions make an important constitutional statement at a moment in which the First Amendment right to observe and record police activity in public is in flux. Although four circuit courts&#8212;the First, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh&#8212;have found that there is a First Amendment right to record the police, in many federal jurisdictions courts have yet to clearly articulate a right to record, and just last month a district court in Philadelphia <a href="https://phillylawblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/the-trial-court-opinion.pdf">held</a> [PDF] that there is no First Amendment right to record a police officer on duty because to film or record with a mobile device is not in itself expressive conduct. The Ferguson consent decree&#8212;and the experiences of activists in Ferguson&#8212;underscore the error of this First Amendment analysis of the Philadelphia District Court in <span class="casename">Fields</span>.  </p>

<p>Although a consent decree is not a precedential opinion, it nevertheless adds fuel to the fight to solidify a robust First Amendment right to observe, record and contest police practices. It remains to be seen if and how changes to local policing practices will play out in Ferguson, although the incredible energy of local activists are a promising sign that real change is possible. But one undeniable victory for police accountability is the recognition that the First Amendment protects the ability of civilians to challenge government authority in the moment&#8212;to resist and dissent from local government practices through the expressive act of holding a visible recording device or a protest sign. As the Supreme Court stated in 1987, "The freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST <a href="/commentary/contributing/2016/terrorism/addicott.php">Contributing Editor Jeffrey F. Addicott</a> of St. Mary's University School of Law discusses the assertion that waterboarding is torture...</p><strong>W</strong>ith the 2016 campaign for president heating up, many old issues are being revisited to include the false contention that "waterboarding" is torture. While some may claim, for example, that Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump is embracing a new and ugly pragmatism associated with fighting those that engage in terrorism (Trump approves of waterboarding), the fact is that the US has never engaged in torture and it is unlikely that any future Administration will ever slip into a "Star Chamber" mentality where torture is tolerated. So, once again the record needs to be set straight&#8212;waterboarding as the US practiced for a brief period after 9/11 is not torture. Torture is torture. So why all the confusion?</p>

<p>Allegations of torture roll off the tongue with great ease and have been used as a political piñata by a variety of individuals and interest groups often associated with fixed political agendas. Recognizing that not every alleged incident of mistreatment necessarily satisfies the legal definition of torture, it is imperative that one views such allegations with a clear understanding of the applicable legal standards set out in law and judicial precedent. </p>

<p>In fact, as a law professor specializing in national security law, I was asked in May 2009 to testify before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. The Senate hearing headed by the political party that then controlled the Senate majority (Democrats) was entitled:  "<em>What Went Wrong:  Torture and the Office of the Legal Counsel in the Bush Administration</em>."  In short, this was not a fact finding mission by the Senate&#8212;their minds were already made up! To be sure, the majority on the Senate panel did not take kindly to my legal opinion that waterboarding used against three high value detainees was not severe enough to rise to rise to the level of torture.</p>

<p>The fact is that we have not and will not engage in torture in violation of the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture, and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Torture Convention).<blockquote> [A]ny act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession...when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of...a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions. </blockquote>Obviously, as the next Administration deals with the issue of lawful interrogation techniques, it is important to understand where we have been on the matter of interrogation. In short, interrogation techniques&#8212;to include waterboarding&#8212;that were approved by President Bush's Department of Justice for use by the CIA did not constitute torture. (This is not to say that individuals in their individual capacity have not violated directives and even the law on "torture").  </p>

<p>None of the techniques employed by the US have ever involved unlawful interrogation practices&#8212;then or now. Existing international case law such as <u>Ireland vs. UK</u> sets extremely high bars for what would constitute torture. Even the worst of the interrogation practices, i.e., waterboarding, was clearly not torture when measured against <u>Ireland</u>. </p>

<p>So herein is a quick overview. In 2002, the Office of the Legal Counsel (OLC), Department of Justice, issued two legal memorandums under the signature Jay S. Bybee, Assistant Attorney General, OLC, regarding the interrogation of certain high value detainees captured in the wake of 9/11. Noting that the techniques produced no prolonged mental harm that would violate the Torture Convention, the classified Bybee memo authorized the CIA to use 10 of the 12 proposed enhanced interrogation techniques (EIT). Each technique was carefully described in the legal memorandum, along with restrictions and safeguards which required, for instance, the presence of psychologists and medical personnel along with the interrogator. The most severe techniques was: <blockquote>Waterboard: The subject is restrained on a bench with his feet elevated above his head. His head is immobilized and an interrogator places a cloth over his mouth and nose while pouring water onto a cloth. Airflow is restricted for 20 to 40 seconds; the technique produces the sensation of drowning and suffocation.</blockquote></p>

<p>Accordingly, from 2002-2005 top legal advisors concluded that the US could legitimately engage in interrogation practices that did not rise to the level of torture. By late 2005, however, the domestic law quickly changed (with the exception of US military personnel in training, no one has been waterboarded since 2005) and continued to the point of absurdity where interrogators today may essentially not question a detainee without the express permission of the detainee. In fact, when I visited GITMO in 2009, I discovered to my great disdain that it was forbidden for an American soldier who was not a Muslim to hand any religious object to a detainee as this would be "degrading" and in violation of Common Article 3! In short, our interrogation programs are now driven by "political correctness."</p>

<p>Indeed, with the Supreme Court's <u>Hamdan</u> case and the resulting 2006 Military Commissions Act which applied the provisions of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions to all detainees, America has essentially self-imposed a layer of protection that has swung the pendulum far away from any technique associated with physical pressure points. Executive Order 13441 issued by President Obama in January 2009, now requires all US agencies (to include the CIA) to comply with the new Bush-era Army Field Manual on interrogations (FM 2-22.3).</p>

<p>Finally, the number one terror threat to America emanates from the disciples of radical Islam. Hopefully all rational Americans understand that the best time to stop radical Islamic jihadists is not at the airport (9/11), the marathon race (2013 Boston Marathon attack), or the office Christmas party (2015 San Bernardino). Actionable intelligence must be obtained before the attack occurs. This intelligence can come in many ways to include "interrogation."  </p>

<p>One matter is fundamentally certain: if al-Qa'eda, ISIS, and other radical Islamic jihadist groups are to be kept at bay, the US must rely on detainee interrogation as an integral antiterrorist tool. The need for the interrogator to get information to protect the lives of innocents is a legitimate and perfectly lawful exercise. Even President Obama understands this truism.  His 2009 executive order does allow federal agencies to employ non-coercive techniques and established a High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group (HIG), composed of experienced interrogators and support personnel from law enforcement, the DOD, and the intelligence community.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the next president of the US will surround himself with legal and policy advisors that will provide him with the full range of lawful actions so that America can continue to function under our values while keeping our citizens safe. In turn, they will also keep in their back pocket the long standing common law doctrine of "necessity."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.usask.ca/find-people/faculty/newman-dwight.php">Dwight Newman</a> of the <a href="http://law.usask.ca">University of Saskatchewan</a> discusses what is happening with recent leave decisions related to Indigenous rights and Canadian energy regulation....<br />
</p><strong>T</strong>he Supreme Court of Canada's decision to grant leave to appeal in the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/03/inuit-appeal-seismic-testing-case-to-canadas-highest-court.php">Clyde River case</a> means that it will hear an appeal from the <a href="http://cas-cdc-www02.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fca-caf_eng">Federal Court of Appeal</a> <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fca/doc/2015/2015fca179/2015fca179.html?autocompleteStr=clyde%20river&autocompletePos=1">decision</a> in the case on November 30, 2016.  </p>

<p>The case is about allegedly insufficient consultation with indigenous residents in the context of the <a href="https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/index-eng.html">National Energy Board</a>'s approval of seismic testing for energy resources off the Arctic shores of <a href="http://www.explorenunavut.com/clyderiver.php">Clyde River, Nunavut</a>. At a more fundamental level, the case will see the Supreme Court of Canada revisit what role administrative boards and tribunals can play in the context of Canadian governments' legal duties to consult indigenous communities. As this comment will show, this has become a particularly heated topic; it is part of the atypical circumstances to the court's granting of leave to appeal in this case, and the decision in this case may yet have significant effects on many resource-sector cases. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Canada developed the modern form of this legal duty to consult in a series of cases starting with the 2004 <a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2189/index.do">Haida Nation decision</a>.  Because Canada constitutionally entrenched Aboriginal and treaty rights during its major constitutional <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html">amendments</a> in 1982, Canada's courts are engaged in an ongoing process of defining those rights and the related duties on government.    </p>

<p>In these consultation cases, the duty to consult is a proactive duty on governments (federal or provincial) to consult with indigenous communities whose Aboriginal rights or treaty rights might be adversely affected by a government decision prior to making that decision, even where there is ongoing uncertainty on the right. More complex parts to this case law say that the scope of what is owed under the duty varies in different circumstances and attempt to set out how. The duty itself has generated some types of uncertainty, but that has had some constructive effects, such as in often encouraging the negotiation of impact-benefit agreements between industry and indigenous communities (for discussion, see my May 2014 <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2517033">report</a> for the <a href="http://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca">Macdonald-Laurier Institute</a>).<br />
  <br />
In 2010 the court considered an issue that many saw as not clearly resolved in the jurisprudence to that point. In the  <a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/7885/index.do">Rio Tinto case</a>, which drew dozens of intervening parties to get at the various polycentric implications of the decision, the court sought to set out the rules on the role of administrative boards and tribunals in relation to the duty to consult. The duty is one owed by governments. The court in <span class="casename">Rio Tinto</span> effectively said that governments would define the role of administrative boards and tribunals in their statutory mandates. Some administrative boards or tribunals may carry out consultation, some may review it, and some may have nothing to do with consultation. Even in the latter case, though, the duty to consult does not disappear. The point of <span class="casename">Rio Tinto</span> is simply that governments themselves organize how they are going to deal with the duty to consult, and they choose whether they do so through a particular board or tribunal or in some other way.</p>

<p>The argument for leave to appeal in the <span class="casename">Clyde River</span> case was that the guidance provided by the earlier Supreme Court of Canada cases has still ended up in a cross-country patchwork in the regulatory context. In the context of the National Energy Board in particular, the applicants claimed that the ongoing application of a 2009 Federal Court of Appeal precedent from before the 2010 <span class="casename">Rio Tinto</span> decision, the <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fca/doc/2009/2009fca308/2009fca308.html?resultIndex=2">Standing Buffalo case</a>, results in too little analysis by the National Energy Board of consultation and should be revisited in light of the 2010 <span class="casename">Rio Tinto</span> decision. The federal Attorney General and other respondents <a href="http://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/info/mal-mdaa-eng.aspx?cas=36692">argued</a> in reply that the law is clear.</p>

<p>Timing, though, seemed to offer a fateful turn. Three days after the initial leave application document in <span class="casename">Clyde River</span> was filed, a differently constituted panel of the Federal Court of Appeal issued a split decision about consultation by the National Energy Board (though, notably, in relation to its operations under a significantly different section of its constituting Act). This decision, in <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fca/doc/2015/2015fca222/2015fca222.html?resultIndex=1">Chippewas of the Thames</a>, concerned a pipeline application by <a href="http://www.enbridge.com">Enbridge</a>, which sought to reverse the flow of Line 9 so as to bring Western Canadian oil to Quebec refineries. Around a month later, only one of the three respondent parties in <span class="casename">Clyde River</span> thought to mention the <span class="casename">Chippewas of the Thames</span> decision in the course of their written argument against the court granting leave to appeal, but the applicant went on to hammer home to the court the idea that the cases were connected and actually ultimately asked the court to hear them together.</p>

<p>The argument over leave to appeal in the <span class="casename">Chippewas of the Thames</span> decision itself saw a further fateful effect of timing. In the <span class="casename">Clyde River</span> case, the federal Attorney General filed a government reply opposing the granting of leave, with the filing of this argument taking place before Canada's October 2015 election. After the election, the new Liberal government has announced its intention to seek a different, nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous communities, and it indicated that it would take a different approach in relation to litigation. When the time came for arguments to be filed in the <span class="casename">Chippewas of the Thames</span> case, the federal Attorney General indicated that Canada would take no position on the leave application. This choice stands out as an unusual decision, in the context of the traditional practice of the Attorney General of defending decisions of major administrative boards from attacks and of trying to avoid seeing major legal issues revisited.    </p>

<p>There were other unusual aspects to <span class="casename">Clyde River</span> as well, as seen in some of the materials filed on <a href="http://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/info/mal-mdaa-eng.aspx?cas=36776">argument</a>. The applicant in the <span class="casename">Chippewas of the Thames</span> application for leave to appeal appended to the application a lengthy affidavit from the <a href="http://www.afn.ca/en/national-chief">Chief of the Assembly of First Nations</a> (AFN) commenting on why the court should grant leave and introducing a significant political dimension to the case. Although the respondent company, Enbridge, briefly commented on this in its reply, the absence of any Attorney General objection to this use of an affidavit stands out. Moreover, the applicant's reply document introduced for the first time an academic study of the National Energy Board's engagement with the duty to consult, with no other party having a chance to reply to that even when the study's conclusions arguably do not align well with what was asserted from it by the applicant.  </p>

<p>It will be interesting to see who says what about it when matters reach the Supreme Court of Canada at the end of November. The court ended up granting leave in <span class="casename">Clyde River</span> and <span class="casename">Chippewas of the Thames</span>, to be heard together. Without some fateful timing and some unusual aspects in the leave process, there might or might not have been such a result.  </p>

<p>Now, though, the Supreme Court of Canada has significantly opened a set of questions once again on the interaction of the duty to consult with the administrative regulatory process. <span class="casename">Clyde River</span> will not be a decision just about seismic testing near one hamlet in Nunavut, significant though that might itself be. <span class="casename">Clyde River</span> and <span class="casename">Chippewas of the Thames</span> will together see the court pronounce, at least, on the National Energy Board and consultation&#8212;and quite possibly in a way bearing on other regulatory contexts as well. With the Federal Court of Appeal having heard consultation-related challenges to the <a href="http://www.gatewayfacts.ca/About-The-Project/Project-Overview.aspx">Northern Gateway</a> project in October 2015, with its decision still under reserve, the Supreme Court of Canada will soon be pronouncing on issues that could bear on that case, adding an additional note of complexity. And in an era with many issues related to indigenous rights and regulatory processes, the effects could extend still wider.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://cuhk.academia.edu/GregoryGordon/Activity">Gregory S. Gordon</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.cuhk.edu.hk/en/">Chinese University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law</a> discusses the ICTY's acquittal of Vojislav Šešelj and the serious set-back it could represent for the development of international criminal law ... </p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n March 31, 2016, in a resounding victory for the culture of impunity, two Trial Chamber judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), over the strong <a href="http://www.icty.org/en/press/information-on-the-partially-dissenting-opinion-of-judge-lattanzi-in-judgement-in-the-case-of">dissent of a third</a>, <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/tjug/en/160331_judgement_summary.pdf">acquitted</a> [PDF] ultra-nationalist Serb Vojislav Šešelj of all charges against him in a case that had dragged on for nearly nine years. Already the poster child for judicial procedural mismanagement [see my op-ed in <a href="https://www.jurist.org/forum/2015/02/gregory-gordon-seselj-release.php">these pages</a> regarding delays in the case and Šešelj's pre-trial release], <span class="casename">Prosecutor v. Šešelj</span> now stands out as a substantive law disaster too. This poorly reasoned and unsubstantiated decision not only adulterates much of the ICTY's foundational work over the past two decades &#8212; it is in many ways entirely at odds with the international criminal justice enterprise since Nuremberg.</p>

<p>A prominent ultranationalist Serb during the early 1990s break-up of the former Yugoslavia, Šešelj founded the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism/Neofascism#ref742259">Serbian Radical Party</a> (SRS) and recruited disaffected co-ethnic youths, criminals and outcasts to serve in his militias, including the "<a href="http://www.britannica.com/topic/Chetnik">Chetniks</a>" and the "<a href="http://fas.org/irp/world/para/white_eagles.htm">White Eagles</a>" (collectively known as the "Seselievicj" or "Seseli's men"). Šešelj helped organize and train these hooligans to enter mixed-ethnicity enclaves in Croatia, Bosnia and parts of Serbia, so as to cleanse them of non-Serbs. In particular, he indoctrinated his charges and denigrated his victims, both in Belgrade and on the ground where the <a href="https://iwpr.net/global-voices/vojvodina-ethnic-cleansing-testimony">ethnic cleansing</a> took place, in speeches that were preludes and accompaniments to commission of crimes against humanity and war crimes in these localities.</p>

<p>In connection with this activity, the ICTY charged Šešelj with individual (via direct commission, instigation and aiding and abetting) and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/joint_criminal_enterprise">joint criminal enterprise (JCE)</a> liability for commission of war crimes (including torture and forcible transfer) and crimes against humanity (including murder and persecution). The JCE's purpose, established in numerous other cases, including <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/cis/en/cis_karadzic_en.pdf"> Prosecutor v. Radovan Karadžić</a> [PDF] most recently, was to engage in criminal conduct to drive non-Serbs out of a giant swath of the former Yugoslavia to create a "<a href="http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/seselj-s-goal-was-greater-serbia">Greater Serbia</a>."</p>

<p>The opening substantive paragraphs of the decision demonstrate immediately that the two majority judges take an unreasonably dim view of the prosecution's theory and approach to the evidence, well-established in previous jurisprudence, in contrast with the oft-rejected account the accused  proffered. Inexplicably, the judges seem to validate Šešelj's stance that "the Serbs . . . were victims of aggression perpetrated by the Croats and Muslims" pursuant to an "unconstitutional secession" that triggered an armed conflict wherein the Serbs were both defending both themselves and the constitutional integrity of the former Yugoslavia. For the majority, Šešelj thus offered "a different context for his speeches which, he contends, galvanized the soldiers fighting on his side and expressed his own political vision . . . which the Prosecutor incorrectly characterizes as acts of persecution and incitement to hate and forcible transfer."  This interpretation foreshadows their disastrous conclusions regarding crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>The judicial reasoning then gets even worse. Three paragraphs later, Jean-Claude Antonetti and Mandiaye Niang, the two majority judges, refer to a "certain vagueness in the Prosecutor's approach." And in the following paragraphs, they complain that the Prosecutor adduces the same facts in support of both the JCE and individual liability, noting that the Prosecutor uses "a circular approach, where nearly every crime is characterized in different ways and every mode of criminal participation seems absorbed by or superimposed upon the others." Unfortunately, this is just a convoluted way of complaining that the Prosecutor has charged in the alternative &#8212; a sensible and commonly used strategy. This expression of disapproval, even if not explicitly affecting the decision on the merits, is, at the very least, a disturbing augur of even worse to come.</p>

<p>And it does come. Flouting well-settled ICTY precedent, Antonetti and Niang then find that extremist Serbs did not carry out a widespread or systematic attack against non-Serb civilians. Instead, they supposedly operated in an ordinary armed conflict milieu, where civilians from all ethnic groups happened to participate in "street fighting" over contested territory, but no criminal actions were directed toward civilians. In a remarkable twist, the Chamber finds that, rather than engaging in ethnic cleansing, the Serb militias provided safe convoy for civilians "fleeing combat zones to seek refuge in localities where they could find members of the same ethnic or religious group . . . the buses chartered in this context were not for purposes of forced population transfers, but rather for humanitarian assistance for non-combatants . . ."  Absurdly, the two judges therefore conclude that the armed Serb extremists were essentially operating a form of gratuitous Greyhound bus service for non-Serb residents of the areas they attacked<strong>!</strong> So their conduct could not have been part of a widespread or systematic attack against those civilians.</p>

<p>Absent such an attack, a required pre-condition of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/crime_against_humanity">crimes against humanity (CAH)</a>, all CAH charges had to fail. Still, the Chamber reviews the speeches that were the object of the CAH-persecution charges.  And in an otherwise lamentable document, this segment of the opinion is probably the nadir. The majority simply ignores the existing authority and creates a new, unjustified and unsupported rule out of thin air! The International <a href="http://unictr.unmict.org/en/tribunal">Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)</a>, which has adjudicated, and issued more jurisprudence in relation to mass atrocity-context hate speech than any other judicial organ, has held that the gravamen of hate speech as persecution is the deprivation of fundamental human rights. In essence, hate speech denigrating victims in the context of crimes against humanity effectuates such a deprivation, regardless of whether the words explicitly urge violence. Granted, in contrast, the ICTY disagreed in <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kordic_cerkez/tjug/en/kor-tj010226e.pdf">Prosecutor v. Kordić (2001)</a> [PDF], indicating that the words must call for action against the victims, regardless of whether that action is actually carried out. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the majority opinion does not acknowledge this <a href="https://wp0.its.vanderbilt.edu/jotl/2013/04/hate-speech-and-persecution-a-contextual-approach/">split in approaches</a> or even reference the relevant ICTR/ICTY precedents. The decision does recognize in paragraph 335 that in certain speeches Šešelj called for expulsion of Croats from their homes and forcible transfers. Per <span class="casename">Kordić</span>, assuming the other CAH preconditions were met, this would have been a sufficient basis for a persecution count (and the ICTR would demand even less &#8212; mere denigrating words as part of a widespread or systematic attack would be enough). Nonetheless, the <span class="casename">Šešelj</span> Trial Chamber denies any persecution liability based on these speeches because it finds no evidence the speeches actually caused any forcible displacement! It is no surprise that the majority fails to cite any authority in support of this &#8212; causation has never explicitly been held to be an element of hate speech as CAH-persecution.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it would have been helpful to at least acknowledge the ICTR line of authority because, as the dissent notes, Šešelj "denigrated and dehumanized the Croats comparing them to 'primates' and 'vampires'" and calling the Bosnian Muslims "'balija' or 'pogani' which he himself translated as 'excrements'." In dissent, Judge Flavia Lattanzi also correctly points out that, the majority's opinion to the contrary notwithstanding, such speeches could have satisfied the <em>actus reus</em> requirements for aiding and abetting and the JCE.</p>

<p>The rest of Antonetti and Niang's decision is similarly horrible. War crimes liability can be dismissed, according to the majority, because the aim of sending armed forces to the areas in dispute was to establish a "Greater Serbia" &#8212; that was political, the judges note, not criminal. And Šešelj's recruited militia were sent to fight in support of this supposedly legitimate war aim. Unfortunately, this analysis confuses <em>jus ad bellum</em> (the law regarding resort to force) with <em>jus in bello</em> (the law regulating conduct during armed conflict). Even if the former were complied with (and, contrary to the majority assertion, there is no evidence that is true), the latter can still be violated &#8212; and the record in Šešelj of murder, torture and forcible displacement of non-Serb civilians, among other acts, proves it was.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the majority seems to say, even if war crimes could be proved, Šešelj could not be guilty of them because he was not in the direct chain of command of the Serb forces carrying out the ethnic cleansing operations.  This is also misguided analysis &#8212; Šešelj need not have been in the direct chain of command to be liable pursuant to proof of instigation, aiding and abetting, or JCE. As the dissent notes, at the very least, complicity was established by ample evidence of Šešelj's militia recruitment, which Judge Lattanzi states he "controlled with an iron fist." He then indoctrinated his recruits with violent speeches and selected the localities to which they would be sent. Once there, his militia participated in ethnic cleansing operations directed by Serb forces, often with Šešelj present to encourage the militia and lend them moral support.</p>

<p>Judge Lattanzi also powerfully observes in dissent that the majority pays no heed to Šešelj's obstructive and threatening behavior during the proceedings. The Trial Chamber's majority opinion never even alludes to it &#8212;  even indirectly. Nor does it take into account Šešelj's conduct since his absurd pre-trial release on health grounds in 2014 (he was supposedly dying of cancer &#8212; <em>see</em> my op-ed <a href="https://www.jurist.org/forum/2015/02/gregory-gordon-seselj-release.php">here</a> explaining how this decision was completely botched). Once released, Šešelj launched a steady stream of hateful Jeremiads against other ethnic groups and pugnaciously vowed never to return to the Tribunal, regardless of the case's outcome. Judges are permitted to consider post-charge conduct in adjudicating a defendant's culpability. Šešelj's conduct during and after the close of the proceedings in his case should have been factored in as evidence of a guilty mind. Unfortunately, consistent with so many other holes in this ghastly decision, there is no meaningful consideration of the defendant's <em>mens rea</em>. </p>

<p>The majority opinion in <span class="casename">Šešelj</span> is so bad and so off-base that it seems to be issued from an alternate universe, a universe where might makes right is a validly enshrined principle and international criminal law is viewed as an obscene affront to the prerogatives of sovereignty. Certainly, it would not be a universe where the <a href="http://www.nurembergacademy.org/the-nuremberg-legacy/the-nuremberg-principles/">Nuremberg Principles</a> hold sway or two decades of <em>ad hoc</em> tribunal jurisprudence even exists. The <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21696145-international-tribunal-creating-confusing-standards-war-crimes-and-politicians-vojislav">Economist has noted</a> that "the verdict will encourage nationalist Serbs to argue that their side did nothing wrong in the war." And Judge Latazzi powerfully states in closing her dissent: <blockquote>"On reading the majority's Judgement, I felt I was thrown back in time to a period in human history, centuries ago, when one said&#8212;and it was the Romans who used to say this to justify their bloody conquests and murders of their political opponents in civil wars: <em>'silent enim leges inter arma.'</em>" ["Laws are silent in times of war"]</blockquote> <br />
For the sake of the aggrieved citizens of the territories of the former Yugoslavia, and for the very health, if not survival, of the international criminal law project, we can only hope the ICTY Appeals Chamber looks favorably on the Prosecution's inevitable appeal. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://birzeit.academia.edu/ValentinaAzarova">Valentina Azarova</a> of Birzeit University Institute of Law discusses how the UK Note is a reminder that greater clarity is needed in the context of the use of boycotts as a means of international law enforcement... </p><strong>O</strong>n February 17, 2016, after much anticipation, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/crown-commercial-service/about">UK Crown Commercial Service</a> issued a "Procurement Policy Note: Ensuring compliance with wider international obligations when letting public contracts," which "aims to stop inappropriate procurement boycotts by public authorities." The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/500811/PPN_on_wider_international_obligations.pdf">Note</a> [PDF] was described as a win for pro-Israel activists, a loss for pro-Palestinian or anti-occupation groups and an undue limitation of the rights of municipalities to exclude companies seen to be involved in Israeli rights abuses from procurement contracts. Yet a closer look shows that in terms of international law and state practice, there is nothing new in the Note, which is not a result of amendments to primary legislation or the enactment of secondary legislation, and which does not criminalize boycotts or bar other measures that public bodies can adopt to achieve similar results.</p>

<p>In international law and relations, a <a href="http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e258">boycott</a> is defined as "a technique of economic coercion that involves the refusal to engage in certain economic interactions, particularly in buying or handling of goods and services from a target entity, typically for political reasons." Whether a boycott is intended to bring about compliance with international law or to further other aspects of domestic foreign policy, it is a decision based on government discretion.</p>

<p>The following discussion of boycotts in international and domestic law, observes three distinctions between boycotts and other measures intended to bring about compliance with or enforcement of international law: the status of boycotts as a prerogative of national sovereignty, their political basis and their ascribed purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Boycott: a national prerogative under government monopoly</strong><br />
The act of boycott in international affairs is deemed a prerogative of national sovereignty, consistent with the monopoly of each state's executive branch of government on the use of coercive measures and decisions affecting its trade policies. As the UK Note affirms, boycotts by public authorities&#8212;regardless of their aim&#8212;are deemed  "inappropriate, outside where formal legal sanctions, embargoes and restrictions have been put in place by the UK Government." </p>

<p>Although critics argued that the UK government's exercise of its monopoly on boycotts restrained freedom of expression, the Note is based on the claim that no such freedom of boycott exists. A pragmatic justification for the government monopoly on such decisions is that foreign policy would become impossible to manage if local government could institute boycotts. The <a href="http://ejil.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/1/63.full.pdf">potential consequences</a> [PDF] entailed by boycott-type measures may include destabilizing international relations, producing conflict between states and violations of the international law prohibitions on disproportionate and indiscriminate coercive measures for which the state would be held accountable. </p>

<p>The Note states that imposing such "local level boycotts" could "hinder Britain's export trade, and harm foreign relations to the detriment of Britain's economic and international security." The executive branch may preclude public bodies from adopting ad hoc, bottom-up decisions with potentially far-reaching implications for public and foreign policy. As cabinet office minister Matthew Hancock <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/15/councils-and-nhs-trusts-to-be-blocked-from-boycotting-israeli-products">said</a>, the Note's clarification of policy "will help prevent damaging and counter-productive local foreign policies undermining our national security."</p>

<p>In the UK and elsewhere, there is a long practice of executive branch monopoly over boycotts. The UK's 1988 Local Government Act banned town halls from <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/transformation/william-eichler/banning-boycotts-is-history-repeating-itself">using</a> political criteria to decide whom to award contracts, in response to the activism surrounding Apartheid South Africa. <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/enforcement/oac#whatsprohibited">In the US, examples include anti-boycott provisions</a> in the Export Administration Act 1977, and the recent US-Israel Trade and Commercial Enhancement Act 2015 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/06/30/new-federal-law-fights-european-boycotts-of-israel/">prohibiting</a> the use of economic boycotts against Israel. Of course, governments have also abused their authority to regulate boycotts. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/18/dispatches-israeli-supreme-court-upholds-anti-boycott-law">Israel's 2011 Law for Prevention of Damage to the State of Israel Through Boycott</a> subjects to lawsuits and damages anyone who calls on companies to avoid doing business with settlements, a draconian approach that both sanctions <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/18/dispatches-israeli-supreme-court-upholds-anti-boycott-law">violations of international law</a> and produces violations of individual rights.</p>

<p>As the Note further holds, the need to limit such measures at the domestic level is based on the state's monopoly on the right to provide an exemption to non-discrimination rules on trade&#8212;and as such protects suppliers from such exemptions being adopted by public bodies without their being mandated by public policy. Moreover, under UK and EU law, the Note warns, a procurement decision not prescribed by law could be deemed "unlawful and lead to severe penalties against the contracting authority and the Government" for its disproportionate and indiscriminate effect.</p>

<p>Sanction regimes including boycotts that have a disproportionate and negative impact on the target entity or the population under its authority, may amount to and produce <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1886&context=fss_papers">violations of international law</a>. They could be deemed acts of interference with a state's domestic affairs, produce widespread violations of human rights, and in some cases even amount to an act of aggression in violation of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/">UN Charter</a>. While nothing in WTO law prevents the state from restricting trade, Article XXI of the GATT deems "secondary boycotts"&#8212;those carried out by individuals, groups, businesses and firms&#8212;to be discriminatory unless based on national security. The state would be in violation of these rules by not enforcing its monopoly and permitting discrimination by its own economic operators or public bodies. Primary boycotts, those adopted by a government directive, may only legitimately be initiated on national security grounds. The government becomes responsible for mandating the act of discrimination for a boycott, and could be held accountable for such infringements by the international system, even if they resulted from the actions of public bodies under its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>To uphold a common interest of conflict prevention in both inter-state relations and the domestic domain, international law and practice maintain that a decision to impose a boycott should be based on a complex set of considerations, consistent with international legality, and as such, not unlike the decision to use force, is a sovereign prerogative of the executive branch of government.</p>

<p><strong>Domestic legal obligations</strong><br />
Civil society actors who call for boycotts as a tool to improve respect for human rights or other international law may find this analysis disheartening. Yet a different type of measure&#8212;one that eschews the political muscle-flexing and sometimes counterproductive contention associated with boycotts&#8212;has the potential to transform a wrongdoing supplier's conduct.</p>

<p>Boycotts are politically driven restrictions based on a supplier's sector, situation, geographical location or other grounds that may be deemed discriminatory in the absence of a government decision for lack of a political or legal basis. By contrast, as the Note affirms, public procurers are legally charged to assess whether each supplier's commercial activities comply with transactional considerations embedded in UK law, including by balancing ethical and social considerations against the "value-for-money" principle, which guarantees suppliers from "third countries" (including those not in a preferential trade agreement with the EU) the same treatment as local suppliers.</p>

<p>Although public bodies may not institute boycotts or other legal sanctions that require government decisions, they are not precluded from assessing third party compliance with domestic laws, where such assessments have a basis in specific provisions of domestic law. UK law, as the Note recalls, permits public procurers to vet suppliers on the basis of "social and environmental" factors enshrined in the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/102/pdfs/uksi_20150102_en.pdf">2015 Public Contract Regulations</a> [PDF] (based on the EU procurement directive).</p>

<p>The right granted to public bodies by UK procurement law is limited to the exclusion of a specific supplier from a specific contract on the basis of specific misconduct. Unlike broad-based boycotts, the Regulations allow UK contracting authorities "to exclude [...] from participation in a procurement procedure any economic operator guilty of grave professional misconduct," requiring case-by-case assessments. This requirement precludes public bodies from signing onto or creating a 'blacklist' based on broad, prima facie criteria&#8212;even if the criteria are broadly in line with domestic law and public policy&#8212;unless a specific policy to adopt such a boycott or blacklist was sanctioned by the government.</p>

<p>If a decision to exclude a specific supplier from procurement lists is firmly grounded in specific provisions of UK law, the decision should withstand allegations that it constitutes an act of boycott, since it was not adopted on the basis of a sweeping, politically-driven boycott that targets commercial sectors, governments, or situations.</p>

<p>In addition, many areas of domestic legislation and implementing rules apply the principle of non-recognition of acts and facts occurring under the jurisdiction of a foreign authority that contravene domestic public policy on their legality, including under international law. Consistent with the same principle in the international law of state responsibility codified in the ILC Draft Articles, some states have operative rules and laws that require the principle to be implemented domestically, to ensure consistency between public policy and domestic law. When a state adopts a position concerning the illegality of certain acts taking place abroad, all its legal subjects are precluded from giving legal effect to facts arising from such international wrongdoing.</p>

<p>For example, EU-based companies and governments have adopted a number of measures in recent years, often mischaracterized as boycotts or sanctions, that preclude the recognition of acts and facts that result from Israel's internationally unlawful exercise of its domestic jurisdiction in occupied territory. Other examples from the context of inter-state relations include, as discussed by the <a href="http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/EuDifferentiation-final3.pdf">ECFR</a> [PDF], the EU's funding guidelines for entities based or operating in Israeli settlements and Horizon 2020 and the labeling of Israeli settlement products. Such measures remain piecemeal, but have already achieved legally-driven policy changes: 18 EU government advisories warning companies of the "legal risks" of such dealings (e.g. the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-business-risk-israel/overseas-business-risk-israel">UK advisory</a>); and albeit fewer measures by state regulatory authorities to ensure the full implementation of domestic law (e.g. the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0045/00458485.pdf">Scottish Policy Note</a> [PDF] on 'public procurement and illegal settlements'). On 22 March 2016, a UN Human Rights Council resolution requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to compile and annually review a database of companies involved in settlements.</p>

<p>These measures are based on a twofold rationale of domestic legal necessity: compliance with domestic law provisions on ethical procurement, and a need to uphold public policy by avoiding giving legal effect to internationally unlawful acts (e.g. "<a href="http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/eu_differentiation_and_israeli_settlements3076">differentiate</a>" between dealings with Israel and with Israeli settlements in the occupied territory where Israel unlawfully exercises sovereign authority).</p>

<p><strong>International law enforcement</strong><br />
If boycotts are the discretionary monopoly of central government, they are also hard-power measures that follow a logic of coercion. Further, boycotts or other sanctions are often imposed for political reasons; not all such measures are imposed to coerce conformity with international law. States that change their behavior in response to such sanctions may do so to end the coercion rather than to comply with international law. </p>

<p>In cases where boycotts are imposed as legal sanctions against a foreign wrongdoing authority, they are daring attempts to coerce compliance or, at least, a situational conformity. But in no circumstance does international law prescribe that individual states are under a positive obligation to adopt an economic boycott as a form of enforcement against a wrongdoing authority&#8212;they have a 'right' to do so within the confines of international law, but will not under contemporary international practice be held accountable for wrongful omission.</p>

<p>The degree to which international law compliance and mutual enforcement depends on the good will of individual states cannot be overstated. International law can demand the adoption of measures of condemnation and retorsion (and can be the basis for measures of diplomatic affront), but it does no more than strongly encourage certain responses between states to ensure respect for certain bright-line rules and uphold the law's integrity, including through permissible collective and unilateral countermeasures and sanctions. Even in the most egregious cases of mass atrocities, the specific content of this obligation (as well as the normative scope of the 'Responsibility to Protect') remains at best a <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2016/dsgsm943.doc.htm">work in progress</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast to coercive, discretionary measures of enforcement, the domestic state practice of non-recognition discussed above includes measures to ensure compliance that are based on internalized criteria of legality from international law. Public bodies reserve the right to adopt decisions to comply with international law&#8212;and indeed are under an obligation to do so in certain areas of domestic law&#8212;so long as they do not adopt sweeping measures boycotts in the absence of a formal government directive. Such measures are driven by state's self-reflexive need to ensure the full implementation of domestic law, in order to avoid a penalty that would result from the public body giving legal effect to internationally unlawful acts in the implementation of its domestic law obligations; e.g. applying the prequalification criteria for choosing suppliers. Although such measures have often been misperceived as boycotts or sanctions&#8212;as though they were voluntary acts of compliance with international law, or of discretionary enforcement&#8212;their underlying rationale should be distinguished.</p>

<p>As a rule, measures that exclude businesses from public contracts are lawful so long as they are based on exclusion requirements provided in domestic law, such as exclusion for violations of environmental, social and labor law. Under the EU <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2014_094_R_0065_01">procurement directive</a>, Member States may transpose both discretionary and mandatory criteria for exclusion of businesses from public contracts. For instance, both EU and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/417963/4279-15_GN_PQQ_Lord_Young_Guidance.pdf">UK law</a> [PDF] provide for the exclusion of an economic operator that "has been guilty of serious misrepresentation in supplying the information required for the verification of the absence of grounds for exclusion or the fulfillment of the selection criteria". A business involved in extraterritorial wrongdoing, which knowingly misrepresents its activities, may be promptly excluded from public contracts if the misrepresentation had significantly altered the public body's assessment of the company under the exclusion criteria.</p>

<p>The public storm over the UK Note is a reminder that greater clarity is needed about the limited use of boycotts as a means of international law enforcement, and about the actual workings of international law enforcement machinery at the domestic level.  Such clarity could help to avoid misperceptions (and misrepresentations) of the conduct of states and international actors, as well as effectively challenge and critique the present state of affairs that limits the public's participation in international law enforcement, including through the initiation of boycotts. </p>

		<title>Baby Steps on the Long Road to Justice for Atrocities in Syria</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Neil Sammonds, a Syria Researcher at Amnesty International, discusses the upcoming negotiations and possible solutions regarding the violence in Syria...</p><br />
                <br />
                <strong>T</strong>he negotiations set to recommence in Geneva on April 11, 2016 and the recent reduction of hostilities in Syria may represent important steps towards a peaceful solution to more than five years of turmoil. Few would not welcome the guns falling silent once and for all and for an end to the suffering of civilians.  <br />
                <br />
                With war crimes, crimes against humanity and other abuses being committed with impunity in Syria it is essential that justice, truth and reparation form a key part of any agreement. Those who ordered, carried out or allowed such crimes to happen must be brought to justice. Yet this crucial pillar is not on the agenda in Geneva and risks being sacrificed in the interests of political expediency. <br />
                <br />
                The absence of a tribunal in Syria capable of tackling the justice deficit is patently clear. The judicial system in Syria is mostly subservient to the political authorities and the security and intelligence agencies. Over the last five years, tens of thousands of civilians have been detained without trial, often forcibly disappeared. Thousands have died in custody. <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Failure to Address Impunity</strong></p>

                <p>The gravity and scale of abuse and impunity in Syria became evident within the first few months of the crisis. Yet the UN Security Council has abjectly failed to refer the situation in Syria for investigation by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), despite repeated calls by international organizations, at least 65 states and the UN&#8217;s own Secretary General. An ICC investigation would have sent a powerful warning to commanders ordering war crimes and crimes against humanity. <br />
                    <br />
                    The Security Council could also have established an ad hoc international criminal tribunal, as it did with the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia; at the moment this remains a remote possibility.  Another option would be to establish an internationalised criminal court for Syria, as occurred for Sierra Leone and Cambodia. It is hard to imagine that such a court could be established and be effective without the consent of the Syrian government&#8212;which is currently inconceivable. Alternatively, a neighbouring country might consent to a tribunal being set up on its own territory, but this too remains an elusive prospect particularly as many of Syria&#8217;s neighbours have themselves been directly involved in the conflict.  <br />
                    <br />
                    These obstacles mean that the only realistic avenue to address impunity at this time is for national authorities of other countries to exercise universal or other extraterritorial jurisdiction over crimes under international law&#8212;including crimes against humanity and war crimes. <br />
                    <br />
                    The flow of people out of Syria presents fresh opportunities to gather evidence of abuses from victims and witnesses and to investigate and prosecute suspected perpetrators. These include people seeking refuge or participating in business or negotiations. Amnesty International firmly holds that anyone who has sought refuge from the conflict in Syria should be granted sanctuary.  <br />
                    <br />
                    Countries have both the right and the obligation to carry out investigations into allegations that individuals under their jurisdiction may have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity or other serious human rights abuses. In the event of such suspects having diplomatic or other privileged status, checks should be carried out into whether such status may grant immunity and under what, if any, circumstances that status may be removed and by whom.  Civil society organizations and others should be vigilant and well-informed as to which legal organizations and individuals may be best able to advise and potentially file criminal complaints. </p>

                <p>Opportunities for international justice may come at short notice and require preparedness to act promptly and decisively. <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>First Steps to Confront Atrocities</strong> </p>

                <p>At least 166 countries are able to exercise universal jurisdiction over at least one crime under international law&#8212;usually war crimes&#8212;regardless of the nationality of the suspect or of the victim. In recent months countries including Germany, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-sweden-idUSKCN0WG1PL">Sweden and France</a>, have opened such investigations into suspected international crimes in Syria. In January 2016 there were reports that a Syrian man was arrested in <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12115037/Suspected-Syrian-jihadist-arrested-in-Germany-for-war-crime.html">Germany</a> on suspicion of war crimes relating to the kidnapping in Syria of a UN observer. In Sweden, a Syrian asylum-seeker appeared in court accused of war crimes committed in Syria. In France, a Syrian asylum-seeker is <a href="http://www.rtl.fr/actu/societe-faits-divers/syrie-un-ancien-tortionnaire-du-regime-de-bachar-al-assad-parmi-les-refugies-en-france-7781694489">being investigated</a> for his alleged involvement in torture and killing of government opponents. Just last month a Syrian asylum-seeker in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/world/europe/syrian-asylum-seeker-linked-to-mass-execution-is-arrested-in-sweden.html?_r=3&#8221;">Sweden</a> had criminal charges filed against him regarding his suspected involvement in the killing of captured government soldiers. <br />
                    <br />
                    States whose nationals have travelled to Syria to fight should also investigate any allegations of crimes under international law and, where sufficient admissible evidence exists and laws provide, seek to prosecute them before their national courts.<br />
                    <br />
                    States that have ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance have an express obligation to exercise jurisdiction over those crimes allegedly committed by their nationals abroad. Sweden and Germany are also actively investigating returnees from the conflict in Syria and in December 2015, Sweden sentenced two of its nationals to life imprisonment for their role in killings by the armed group calling itself the Islamic State (IS).<br />
                    <br />
                    These moves by the international community are small but deeply significant steps in the right direction. The crimes they relate to and the individuals affected are greatly eclipsed, however, by the colossal scale of the violations and impunity in Syria.<br />
                    <br />
                    There are some misgivings that suspected perpetrators on the government side, whose forces are responsible for the overwhelming majority of serious violations in Syria, are less likely to travel outside the country. But that may well change. And states with the capacity and commitment to undertake investigations and trials should make sure that they are prepared to act quickly. <br />
                    <br />
                    As it stands, the enormity of the injustice and impunity reigning in Syria dictates that the road to justice, truth and reparation has to start somewhere and as such, any opportunities that arise must be seized and built upon.</p>

What are these bills, and why are they making headlines lately? Do they protect rights, take rights away or something in between? The answer is complicated. </p>

<p>Let us start with some <a href="http://concurringopinions.com/archives/2014/02/license-to-discriminate-religious-freedom-discrimination-elane-photography-and-s-b-1062.html">general background</a>. As a general matter, workplaces and businesses discriminate all the time, for a variety of reasons, as they make choices about who to hire or promote or serve. A policy of "no shirt, no shoes, no service" discriminates against people who do not want to wear shoes. It is generally legal for businesses to differentiate between categories of people, based on any of a number of criteria.</p>

<p>However, businesses cannot discriminate based on certain impermissible criteria. Many of these categories are set out in federal anti-discrimination law. For instance, businesses are barred from discriminating on the basis of race, gender, religion and some other categories, under the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/civil-rights-act/civil-rights-act-of-1964.html">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> and related federal statutes. (There are some exceptions. For instance, an organization could discriminate on the basis of religion when hiring a new Rabbi or parish priest, even if it could not discriminate when hiring a paralegal or electrician.)</p>

<p>Until recently there has been little recourse for LGBT individuals under anti-discrimination laws. Sexual orientation is not an enumerated category under federal antidiscrimination law, and so until recent years it was pretty much legal everywhere for businesses to refuse to hire or serve based on a person's sexual orientation. (In fact, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZO.html">until 2003</a>, some state statutes labeled same-sex sexual activity a criminal act which could result in jail time.) </p>

<p>However the <a href="http://prospect.org/article/how-gay-rights-movement-won">gay-rights revolution</a> of recent years has altered the legal landscape. For instance, the US Supreme Court recently ruled in favor of marriage equality, holding that state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage are <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/26/politics/scotus-opinion-document-obergefell-hodges/">unconstitutional</a>. On the anti-discrimination front LGBT advocates have <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/wysk/enforcement_protections_lgbt_workers.cfm">won some protections </a>at the federal agency level. (Advocates continue to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-next-battle-in-gay-rights-movement-kicks-off-on-capitol-hill/2015/07/23/0d565804-314b-11e5-8f36-18d1d501920d_story.html">propose</a> adding sexual orientation to federal antidiscrimination law.) And a variety of states such as California have in the past decade enacted<a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=51"> state statutes</a> which prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. </p>

<p>State-level anti-discrimination statutes have resulted in significant victories for LGBT advocates. For instance a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/elane-photography-llc-v-vanessa-willock-opinion?redirect=lgbt-rights/elane-photography-llc-v-vanessa-willock-opinion">photographer</a> in New Mexico was fined for violating the state's anti-discrimination law; this case and others have generated a firestorm of critical commentary from conservative critics, sometimes in <a href="http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1890523,00.html">apocalyptic imagery</a> and sometimes incorrectly tied to questions of same-sex marriage legalization. </p>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/">post-Obergefell</a> world, these anti-discrimination issues stand out more clearly, and conservatives remain alarmed. For instance conservative blogger Matt Walsh <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/pay-attention-christians-theyre-coming-after-the-churches-now/">recently wrote</a> that "This is not about photographers and bakers anymore. Christianity itself is bigoted and hateful, [activists] believe ... Batten down the hatches, Christians. War has been declared." (Walsh also <a href="http://themattwalshblog.com/2015/03/27/sorry-gays-you-dont-have-the-right-to-be-free-from-discrimination/">wrote</a> that "gays don't have the right to be free from discrimination.") In other statements, some religious organizations <a href="http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/elder-oaks-religious-freedom-Chapman-University">have</a> <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2254634">worried</a> that religious officiants may be forced to solemnize same-sex marriages, or that churches who refuse to do so may lose their tax exemptions. Some conservative critics warn of a sinister "<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/04/08/gay_mafia_why_are_conservatives_afraid_of_lgbtq_activists.html">gay mafia</a>" of "<a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/david-lane-homosexual-fascism-will-destroy-america">fascist</a>" LGBT activists who will use antidiscrimination laws as a bludgeon against religious organizations and their members. This narrative paints LGBT activists as interested in taking away the freedom of religious organizations and their members (such as freedom to preach that homosexuality is a sin and that God supports only heterosexual unions); in this story, it is churches and their members who are the real victims of discrimination. And in response to this perceived threat, religious organizations have urged states to pass a variety of state statutes based on the principle of religious freedom. </p>

<p>Religious freedom is itself a fascinating paradox. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> guarantees a right to "free exercise" of religion. But what if religious worship clashes with other laws? We may want to be cautious about letting religion override other laws, or we run the risk of someone saying, "I belong to the Church of Bank Robbery" to try to escape criminal punishment. </p>

<p>Courts have taken different stances over time on the question of balancing religious freedom against other goals. In the late 1800s, the Supreme Court held in the high-profile <span class="casename"><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/98us145">Reynolds</a></span> case that the First Amendment protects beliefs but not actions, and thus <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/approachingjustice/2013/12/13/nate-oman-on-reynolds-polygamy-and-mormonism/">did not protect the practice</a> of Mormon polygamy. (Shortly after Reynolds, the mainstream Mormon church <a href="http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Manifesto_of_1890">renounced polygamy.</a>) However, a variety of other cases challenged that notion. And of course religious practice often includes not only belief, but also action: Attending church and taking sacraments, to be sure, but also sometimes practices like wearing specific clothing or avoiding military service. Given that reality, it is entirely possible that facially neutral laws which regulate action will have a disproportionate impact on religious practice.  </p>

<p>The federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act </a>(RFRA) was passed in response to just this sort of tension&#8212;a set of court cases involving federal drug laws and Native American religious use of peyote. Under RFRA, a federal law (even if generally applicable) cannot substantially burden someone's religious belief unless it is narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. A variety of states have passed state RFRAs as well. (Federal RFRA does not apply to the states.) </p>

<p>Given this backdrop, a number of states have considered state RFRA legislation to protect against perceived anti-religious overreaching by LGBT rights advocates. In the past few years <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/51leg/2r/bills/sb1062s.pdf">Arizona</a> [PDF] and <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/01/indiana-religious-freedom_n_6984156.html">Indiana</a> have made news for these statutes; last week Georgia and Mississippi joined the fray. The popularity of these statutes highlights the fundamental question at issue: <em>Do LGBT rights create burdens on religion, from which churches and their members should be protected? </em></p>

<p>The bills are framed in exactly that way. For instance, <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2016/html/HB/1500-1599/HB1523SG.htm">Mississippi's House Bill 1523</a> has the melodramatic title of "Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination." Georgia's proposed <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/20152016/154497.pdf">HB 757</a> [PDF] was less melodramatic in its language but clearly responded to similar concerns.</p>

<p>As far as the legal effects of the bills and proposals, it is complicated. They often contain a combination of innocuous content alongside more troubling provisions. For instance, Georgia's proposed bill explicitly provided that religious officiants were not required to solemnize same-sex weddings, which is a harmless enough provision. LGBT rights groups have no desire to force priests to solemnize weddings. Similarly, HB 757 set out that no individual would be required to attend a wedding against their wishes. These provisions are harmless, if a little silly. There is no threat of such thing happening, and if it makes people feel better, there is no real downside to setting these out in writing. </p>

<p>A second set of provisions in these bills deals with religious auxiliaries such as schools. These are more controversial. Churches often own or operate a variety of entities that are not openly religious in nature. Should those entities be exempt from antidiscrimination laws? </p>

<p>The most controversial part of the bills are their RFRA-like provisions which would potentially allow private individuals to refuse to serve LGBT people based on religious belief. Should a doctor or accountant or pizza maker have a religious-freedom right to refuse to serve gay or lesbian customers? Is this in effect a "<a href="https://archive.azcentral.com/insiders/ejmontini/2014/02/19/legislatures-ungodly-view-of-religious-freedom/">license to discriminate</a>"? Where does one right end and another begin? (The area of private religious freedom <a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/02/gay-rights-and-religious-freedom">versus</a> LGBT accommodation is <a href="http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vol128_horwitz_comment.pdf">highly contentious</a> [PDF]; for extended discussion, see this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Same-Sex-Marriage-Religious-Liberty-Conflicts/dp/074256326X">book</a>, or basically the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1441497">entire</a> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1969560">oeuvre</a> of <a href="https://law.ucla.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/douglas-nejaime/">Doug NeJaime</a>.) Similar questions arose during the passage of the original 1964 Civil Rights Act, as politicians like <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/04/the-fallacy-in-the-religious-libertarian-argument-against-enda/237401/">Barry Goldwater</a> argued that civil rights legislation would take away the freedom of white business owners to exclude Black customers. (Such arguments are mostly rejected today, though a <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8104&context=journal_articles">few scholars</a> still make those claims.)</p>

<p>The surprising new twist in the story today is the new muscle of social media campaigns and business pressure, similar to that used by <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2012/0115/Martin-Luther-King-Jr.-8-peaceful-protests-that-bolstered-civil-rights/Montgomery-bus-boycott-1955-56">civil rights leaders decades ago</a>. Georgia faced intense pressure from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/03/19/nfl-suggests-religious-liberty-bill-could-affect-georgias-super-bowl-bid/?tid=sm_fb">entertainment groups</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/03/19/nfl-suggests-religious-liberty-bill-could-affect-georgias-super-bowl-bid/?tid=sm_fb">major business interests</a>, and as a result Georgia's governor <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/us/georgia-governor-rejects-bill-shielding-critics-of-gay-marriage.html">vetoed the proposed bill</a>. </p>

<p>But in the wake of the Georgia veto, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-georgia-evangelicals-20160331-story.html">conservatives are doubling down </a>(although some have <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2016/03/30/no-the-veto-of-georgias-religious-freedom-bill-doesnt-mean-churches-are-in-danger/">criticized this effort</a>). <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/03/31/mississippis-senate-just-approved-a-sweeping-religious-liberty-bill-that-critics-say-is-the-worst-yet-for-lgbt-rights/">A new bill in Mississippi </a>is even broader in scope, potentially affecting heterosexual couples as well if they are not married. (Mississippi, without Georgia's extensive business community, may be less susceptible to business pressure.) Meanwhile North Carolina enacted a <a href="http://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/blog/pro-equality-groups-considering-legal-challenge-to-north-carolina-s-sweeping-anti-lgbt-law.html">state-level ban on local transgender-protection ordinances</a>; this has resulted in business fallout as well, such as <a href="http://www.citylab.com/work/2016/04/paypal-withdraws-from-charlotte-over-north-carolinas-lgbt-law/476928/?utm_source=atlfb">Paypal canceling</a> a planned expansion. </p>

<p>It seems like for every action there is an opposite reaction. States and cities have<a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/EO_155.pdf"> banned official travel </a>[PDF] to North Carolina; a conservative writer says that this is a <a href="http://theresurgent.com/ny-gov-andrew-cuomo-reignites-the-civil-war//">new Civil War</a> about "slavery to liberal dogma that LGBT-worship beats freedom to worship and serve God." Bruce Springsteen <a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/">cancelled a planned concert</a>; critics called him a <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/north-carolina-congressman-bruce-springsteen-882208">bully.</a> There is a social media war for hearts and minds, and the business community seems ready to come out in support of LGBT rights.</p>

<p>In the words of the <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/chimes-of-freedom-lyrics-bruce-springsteen.html">Boss</a>, LGBT advocates can now sing: </p>

<p><em>Tollin' for the rebel, yeah, tollin' for the raked<br />
Tollin' for the luckless, the abandoned and forsake<br />
Yeah, tollin' for the outcasts, burnin' constantly at stakes<br />
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'</em></p>

		<title>Anti-LGBTQ Legislations: The Extent of Religious Protections and Sexual Orientation Antidiscrimination</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <em><a href="https://www.umassd.edu/law/faculty/jeremiahho/">Jeremiah A. Ho</a> of the University of Massachusetts School of Law, discusses the recent anti-LGBTQ legislations in several conservative states and suggests that marriage equality is not enough to protect the LGBTQ minority group...</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>f it had not been clear enough since last spring's brief controversy over <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2015/bills/senate/101#document-92bab197">Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a>, the struggle for sexual orientation antidiscrimination was not about to cease with merely a single, pro-LGBTQ US Supreme Court marriage decision over the summer. In fact, the recent news of anti-LGBTQ legislation emerging in several conservative states with large evangelical constituencies&#8212;for instance, in <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/03/georgia-legislature-passes-controversial-religious-freedom-bill.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/04/mississippi-governor-signs-religious-freedom-bill-into-law.php">Mississippi</a> and North Carolina&#8212;give pause for thinking that marriage equality was just not enough full equality for sexual minorities. Rather, a more direct and robust fight for sexual orientation antidiscrimination is perhaps rising before us presently. </p>

<p>Some might think that these recent legislations contribute to a step backward from <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3463620945980488666">Obergefell v. Hodges</a>. But actually, they represent part of the process of political incrementalism that is keeping the importance of full equality for sexual minorities alive in the national political imagination. And that might not be so debilitating in the long run because often in countries in which same-sex marriage has been achieved, the focus and momentum on gay rights taper down temporarily. That is not to say that there are no grave risks involved for sexual minorities in states where they potentially face the discrimination that these kinds of legislations, if passed, would promote. But <u>Obergefell</u> was not&#8212;and should not be considered&#8212;the full-stop to progress in gay rights. So with the recent rise of conservative state legislatures passing bathroom bills against transgender school children and passing legislation that would consequently allow faith-based groups to deny services against same-sex couples and LGBTQ individuals, the movement presses on.  </p>

<p>The history of gay rights struggle has been contextually one in which religion has served as both sword and shield. First, religion was used to carve out the idea that sexual minorities represented behavior and conduct that was immoral and thus these individuals should be denied protections regarding their civil liberties. But once morality was no longer the effective underlying logic, the rise of religious liberty rhetoric began to spread in the debate over gay rights. No longer relying on morals standards held by certain faiths, those against gay rights used the protection of religious freedom to justify marginalizing sexual minorities. In the aftermath of <u>Obergefell</u>, where same-sex couples were extended the right to partake in an institution that has both civil and religious significance, the defense of religious liberty was emblematically evoked by the likes of <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/02/federal-judge-rules-kentucky-clerk-obeying-law-in-issuing-marriage-licenses.php">Kim Davis</a>, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Davis defended her actions by claiming that her religious beliefs conflicted with homosexuality and her freedom of religious exercise shielded her from having to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. In effect, she relied on her religious conscience to justify her refusal. </p>

<p>Many of these recently proposed state laws&#8212;such as the Georgia bill that had passed through its state legislature but was eventually vetoed by Governor Deal, or the Mississippi bill that was signed into law&#8212;that permit faith-based groups, individuals, or small businesses to deny services to sexual minorities are now positively legislating the conscience exemption. On the one hand, these legislations are broadly reminiscent of the facts involved in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17758055891258118781">Romer v. Evans</a>&#8212;the 1996 Supreme Court decision that rendered unconstitutional a state-wide public amendment to Colorado's constitution that would have prevented any municipal or county actions to protect sexual minorities from discrimination. On the other hand, the social and political climate for LGBTQ individuals is much more positive and pro-LGBTQ than when <u>Romer</u> was decided. We now recognized through <u>Romer</u> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">US v. Windsor</a> that in the gay rights context that laws created out of animus toward sexual minorities could invariably be rendered unconstitutional. Based on such doctrinal precedence alone, perhaps courts might later find that these recent laws are also unconstitutional&#8212;if in fact animus is found here as well. The dignity rights of sexual minorities reinforce protections of their private conduct under constitutional due process theories promulgated by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas</a>. LGBTQ individuals are more visible in popular media. Big businesses, such as Disney and the NFL, are coming to the aid of LGBTQ individuals in light of these recent laws, trying to use their financial and entrepreneurial powers to influence states from putting these discriminatory laws on the books. And of course, same-sex couples can now legally marry. <br />
  <br />
But the complexity this time around is the religious freedom issue. This is the shield, and yet it is also the distraction. And unfortunately, <u>Obergefell</u> does not necessarily help this debate. The same-sex marriage decision is finite in its application for sexual orientation antidiscrimination. Kennedy's use of dignity rights was mostly limited and narrowed to the marriage context. Thus, in the absence of more prominent and far-reaching protections of sexual orientation&#8212;such as protected class status or <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e">Title VII</a> recognition&#8212;conservative state legislatures have had the ability to positively protect acts of discrimination by shielding behind insistence on religious freedom. </p>

<p>More clearly than ever, the debate now should move forth to investigate where one particular right begins and another ends. Religious freedom is an imperative liberty in this country and it should be maintained in a society that embraces many different religious practices and ideologies. But rights and freedoms are not absolute&#8212;and this notion includes the freedom to exercise religious beliefs. What ought to occur every time religious freedom is used to combat the recognition of gay rights is not merely the acknowledgment that the exercise of religion already deserve protection under the Constitution. We know that already; and frankly this is the distraction in the political and legal rhetoric that leads to bills such as the one in Georgia or to the Kim Davis incident last fall&#8212;all pronouncements from an anxious body politic that craves that validation. But rather, the true doctrinal debate is whether the exercise of religion has overreached against the recognition and protection of gay rights so substantially that a cognizable harm to the civil liberties of sexual minorities has been produced&#8212;whether that's a dignitary harm or some other legally-recognized injury.  </p>

<p>On this note, however, the pro-LGBTQ activists, lawyers and litigants need to start over somewhat from scratch. Despite its importance, what was dismaying about <u>Obergefell</u> was that any potential to draw out dignitary harms based on sexual orientation discrimination was muted within the context of marriage and within Kennedy's due process theory. Kennedy used a fundamental rights analysis to resolve the case rather than a heightened scrutiny analysis under equal protection&#8212;which could have located sexual minorities within a protected class based on sexual orientation. And within <u>Obergefell</u>'s fundamental rights, the harm in denying same-sex couples the right to marriage was illuminated by the disparity in which state marriage bans prevented the occasion to dignify same-sex couples the way legal access to marriage did for opposite-sex couples. The case was more about discrimination against same-sex couples rather than discrimination purely on the basis of sexual orientation. Those involved in facing these anti-LGBTQ legislation head on will need to demonstrate material and dignity injuries in another way.  </p>

<p>To be sure, one's religious conscience is important to protect because it reflects the exercise of beliefs, faiths and values that the Constitution permits. But this constitutional protection in one person or entity cannot result in facilitating harms to other individuals. If such anti-LGBTQ legislation continue to rise and persist in other states through the use of religious liberties, the result of such legislation may lead to the repeated denial of goods and services to sexual minorities, to the refusal of needed housing for same-sex couples or gay individuals, to the unavailability of safe restroom services to transgender individuals and/or to the absence of protections against general discrimination to individuals based on sexual orientation. All of these incidents must be litigated and phrased in terms of harm, both materially and dignitary, in order to show that in an ordered and pluralistic democratic society that religious freedom must be balanced alongside other individual rights protections in the panoply of civil liberties afforded by the Constitution and  that religious freedom ought not to be used improperly as a shield to justify discrimination and bias.    </p>

		<title>The Illegality of Waterboarding</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.ictj.org/about/cristian-correa">Cristián Correa</a> of the <a href="https://www.ictj.org/about">International Center for Transitional Justice</a> discusses how waterboarding, if not torturous treatment, is at the very least illegal... </p> <strong>I</strong>n a recent academic commentary, Professor Jeffrey F. Addicott <a href="/forum/2016/04/jeffrey-addicott-waterboarding-torture.php">claims</a> that the use of waterboarding by the US has not involved torture in violation of the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture, and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. His commentary offers an opportunity to discuss this important issue, particularly given the perception of threat and the voices raised in the country about the need to use waterboarding and other methods of interrogation against suspected terrorists.</p>

                <p>Professor Addicott affirms that waterboarding, subjecting a detainee to a suffocation experience, "was not severe enough to rise to the level of torture." He bases his claim on the <span class="casename">Ireland vs. UK ECtHR</span>  decision, as well as on the 2012 Office of the Legal Counsel memos. However, this, by any means, can lead to the conclusion that waterboarding is a legal practice under such Convention, since the UK in the case was condemned for violations of <a href="https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/incorporated-rights/articles-index/article-3-of-the-echr/">article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights</a>.</p>

                <p>In <span class="casename">Ireland vs. UK ECtHR</span>, the European Court of Human Rights examined, among other issues, whether five interrogation techniques used by the UK against detainees were contrary to the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment established by article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights. The five techniques were the following: wall-standing; hooding; subjection to noise; deprivation of sleep; and deprivation of food and drink. Examining each technique, the court concluded that they "constituted a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment, which practice was in breach of Article 3."</p>

                <p>Subjecting a detainee under interrogation to a near-death experience of suffocation through drowning is clearly a more severe treatment than the five techniques <span class="casename">Ireland vs. UK ECtHR</span> examined. Thus, even if waterboarding could be considered not to be torture, it is clear that it violates the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/49e479d10.html">1984 UN Convention against Torture</a>, because the Convention also prohibits other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p>

                <p>Moreover,  subsequent decisions by the ECtHR, particularly <span class="casename">ISelmouni vs. France</span> where the Court <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#%7B%22appno%22:[%2225803/94%22]%7D">considered</a> that,</p>

                <blockquote>certain acts which were classified in the past as "inhuman and degrading treatment" as opposed to "torture" could be classified differently in future. It takes the view that the increasingly high standard being required in the area of the protection of human rights and fundamental liberties correspondingly and inevitably requires greater firmness in assessing breaches of the fundamental values of democratic societies (101).</blockquote>

                <p>It is not clear that waterboarding does not reach the severity threshold to be considered torture. The severity threshold that is determinant to distinguish between torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is a matter of gradation that relies on several components, but that cannot be limited to the existence of physical injuries. One relevant factor is the existence of long-lasting effects. The question that follows then is whether or not the experience of being submitted to a near-death experience by suffocation while in custody has long lasting effects. This is consistent with the notion of prolonged mental harm, used by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/safefree/yoo_army_torture_memo.pdf">March 14, 2003 OLC memo</a>[PDF], understood as capable of causing "some lasting, though not necessarily permanent damage." The memo even includes the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, which can last for a considerable period of time if untreated, as a condition that might satisfy the prolonged harm requirement.</p>

                <p>Testimonies of survivors of torture through the application of suffocation techniques affirm the long term effect of that experience. The report of the National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture, a commission appointed by the President of Chile to examine allegations of torture during the Pinochet dictatorship, reported long lasting consequences on victims of suffocation techniques. Thirty years after being tortured by such method a victim <a href="http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/vol14/iss2/5/">said</a>, "Even today I wake up because of nightmares of dying from drowning."</p>

                <p>Waterboarding also complies with two conditions under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2340">18 U.S.C. § 2340(2) for the definition of torture</a>: (a) the intentional infliction of severe physical pain or suffering; and (c) the threat of imminent death. The near-death experience by intentional suffocation under captivity is clearly an act of intentionally causing such pain or suffering. It is even more than a mere threat of imminent death, it is the actual experience of almost drowning.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, according to international law, the distinction between torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, even if relevant, does not make the latter legal. The UN Committee against Torture had <a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT/C/USA/CO/2&">observed</a> in regards to the US that,</p>

                <blockquote>The State party should ensure that acts of psychological torture, prohibited by the Convention, are not limited to "prolonged mental harm" as set out in the State party's understandings lodged at the time of ratification of the Convention, but constitute a wider category of acts, which cause severe mental suffering, irrespective of their prolongation or its duration.</blockquote>

                <p>This decision was <a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT%2FC%2FUSA%2FCO%2F3-5">reiterated</a> in 2014.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, if despite its long lasting effects, waterboarding is considered a form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and could be narrowly qualified as not being torture, the practice of waterboarding still constitutes a violation of Article 1 of the 1984 UN Convention against Torture. As such, it constitutes an illegal practice that can lead to the international condemnation of the US as a state engaged in violations of one of the core provisions of international human rights. However, the narrow definition to which Professor Addicott adheres should be brought into question, considering the long term effects that a near-death experience, like waterboarding, has been proven to cause.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.ucdavis.edu/faculty/ikemoto/">Lisa C. Ikemoto</a> of <a href="https://law.ucdavis.edu/">University of California-Davis School of Law</a> discusses the latest ACA challenge to appear in front of the US Supreme Court...</p><strong>T</strong>he US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/zubik-v-burwell/">Zubik v. Burwell</a> on March 23, 2016, six years to the day the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/about-the-law/read-the-law/">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) became law. The petitioners, a group of religious organizations, have challenged the ACA's contraceptive coverage requirement. The challenge is a free exercise claim under the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2014/07/24/act-pl103-141.pdf">Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)</a> [PDF], a federal statute. The court has now heard four challenges to the ACA.</p>

<p>The contraceptive coverage requirement is part of a broader provision that requires coverage for preventive health care without cost-sharing. This provision serves the ACA goals of improving health care access and reducing health care disparities among populations. Even small co-pays create barriers to health care. The ACA emphasizes the importance of preventive health care by removing that barrier.  </p>

<p>Cost-sharing mechanisms like co-pays reflect the fact that health care services are delivered in a commercial market. The ACA coverage requirement applies to FDA-approved contraceptives. Prices for drugs and devices in the US are among the highest in the world. Contraceptives are distributed within that market. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/business/valeants-drug-price-strategy-enriches-it-but-infuriates-patients-and-lawmakers.html?action=click&contentCollection=Business%20Day&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article">Recent stories</a> about the role of profit-motive in pharmaceutical pricing highlight <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-art-of-setting-a-drug-price-1449628081">new cancer drugs</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/business/gilead-faces-fights-over-hepatitis-c-and-hiv-drugs.html?_r=0">Hepatitis C drugs</a> that cost several hundred thousand dollars a year. Plain old oral contraception, the most widely used contraceptive, can cost close to $1,000 per year for those without insurance coverage.  <a href="http://kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/intrauterine-devices-iuds-access-for-women-in-the-u-s/">Intrauterine devices</a>, a type of long-acting reversible contraception, typically cost $500 to $1,000. Those amounts are less than 1 percent of the highlighted examples, but they are a great deal more than many can afford. Because most FDA-approved methods are available on a prescription-only basis, obtaining contraception also requires the time and cost of visiting a doctor. Oregon and California have enacted law making some contraceptives (the pill, the ring and the patch) available over-the-counter, with a pharmacist prescription. Those laws make the doctor's visit, and the accompanying costs, unnecessary for most. People without coverage, however, will still face out-of-pocket costs for the contraceptives.</p>

<p>The contraceptive coverage requirement applies to employers who provide health insurance as a benefit. The <span class="casename">Zubik</span> petitioners are religious organizations who hire employees and run colleges. Their employees and students rely on petitioners for health insurance access, but do not all share the petitioners' religious objections to contraceptive use. The ACA provides <a href=" https://www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/fact-sheets-and-faqs/womens-preven-02012013.html">accommodation</a> for religious employers, which removes petitioners from the responsibility of paying for coverage and yet makes coverage available to employees and students. Petitioners, however, claim that submitting the one-page form to obtain the accommodation makes them complicit in providing contraceptives.  </p>

<p>The arguments were fascinating. You can <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/audio/2015/14-1418">listen</a> to or <a href="/http:/www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-1418_j4ek.pdf">read</a> [PDF] them. RFRA requires that petitioners show the contraceptive coverage requirement imposes a substantial burden on free exercise of religion. If petitioners can do that, the government must justify the burden by showing that the contraceptive coverage requirement is based on a compelling state interest and that there is no less restrictive means of achieving that interest. The justices and lawyers spent much of oral argument addressing the substantial burden requirement. In an exchange with Justice Kagan, Paul Clement, representing petitioners, distinguished between an authorization form and an opt-out form. Clement seemed to suggest that an opt-out form would not make petitioners complicit, while an authorization form would, and thus, substantially burden free exercise. Much of the substantial burden argument turned into a battle of analogies. Noel Francisco, also representing petitioners, characterized the coverage requirement as "seizing control." The most bandied-about analogy was "hijacking"&#8212;as in, by requiring contraceptive coverage, the government is hijacking the religious employers' benefit plans. Chief Justice Roberts fully embraced the hijacking analogy. In the meantime, Justices Sotomayor and Kagan challenged Clement on petitioners' analogy to military objectors during war. Clement agreed that laws penalizing conscientious objectors substantially burdened objectors' free exercise, but asserted the objectors had to affirmatively object, while petitioners should not have to in order to obtain accommodation.  </p>

<p>Donald Verrilli represented the US government in arguments. (Because he is the US Solicitor General, the justices call him "General Verrilli.") He argued that the procedure for obtaining an accommodation would not substantially burden petitioners' free exercise of religion. He and Justice Alito spent some time in the weeds about the fact that employers with self-insured plans must submit not one, but two pieces of paper. The existing accommodation exempts religious employers from paying for contraceptives regardless of whether the plan is fully insured or self-insured. So the only difference is, in fact, the extra piece of paper.  </p>

<p>Verrilli marshaled his time to address petitioners' proposed alternatives to the existing accommodation. Petitioners' briefs proposed that rather than obtaining contraceptive coverage through employer-sponsored or student insurance, employees and students could use Medicare, Medicaid, Title X, contraception-only insurance policies or individual policies purchased in the insurance marketplaces. Some of these proposals do not exist. For example, insurers do not offer contraception-only policies. Even if available, a separate policy might very well offer a different provider network than a petitioner's plan. All of the proposals, including individual policies, would raise barriers to access and undermine the purpose of requiring preventive care coverage without cost-sharing. None, as Verrilli pointed out, are available under existing law. Access to Medicare, Medicaid, Title X and the marketplaces would require significant amendment of eligibility laws. </p>

<p>Near the end of Verrilli's allotted time for argument, Sotomayor returned to the conscientious objector analogy. She distinguished conscientious objectors in wartime from the <span class="casename">Zubik</span> petitioners' challenge to the accommodation. In Sotomayor's view, conscientious objectors do not trigger regulatory power over third parties, but the effects of <span class="casename">Zubik</span> petitioners' request would rebound on petitioners' employees and students. Sotomayor's distinction points to the origins of the RFRA. Congress enacted RFRA in response to a 1989 Supreme Court decision called <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10098593029363815472">Employment Division v. Smith</a>. The late Justice Scalia wrote the majority opinion, in which the court stated that the Constitution's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/free_exercise_clause">Free Exercise Clause</a> did not excuse an individual from complying with a generally applicable law. In other words, the Constitution does not require accommodation for those whose religious beliefs place them in conflict with the law. Scalia's opinion listed examples&#8212;laws requiring military service, payment of taxes and vaccination. RFRA passed with bi-partisan support. Many supporters worried that the Supreme Court had peeled back protection for members of minority religions whose beliefs are more likely to differ from majoritarian norms underlying law.  In <span class="casename">Smith</span>, for example, the court rejected free exercise claims by two Native Americans who were fired and denied unemployment benefits after using peyote in a religious ceremony. Before <span class="casename">Smith</span>, the court had recognized free exercise claims by a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church who was fired for refusing to work on Saturday, the Adventist Sabbath. In those two cases, exempting the religious claimants from state unemployment compensation laws did not interfere with others' rights. Exemption may have inconvenienced the state unemployment office, but it did not produce interference with third party rights.  </p>

<p>With Scalia's death, it seems very likely the eight justices may split. Questions and statements in oral argument, as well as prior votes, indicate that Roberts, Alito, Thomas and perhaps Kennedy will hold that the existing accommodation violates petitioners' statutory rights under RFRA. Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan and Sotomayor, on the other hand, seem likely to find no violation.  </p>

<p>In the meantime, the court has taken an unusual step. On March 29, the court issued an <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/032916zr_3d9g.pdf">order</a> [PDF] directing the parties to file additional briefs. The briefs are to address "whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners' employees through petitioners' insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees." The Order includes an example for the parties to consider. What if petitioners contracted with an insurer and informed the insurer that they did not want to include contraceptive coverage and the insurer notified employees that it would "provide cost-free contraceptive coverage and that such coverage is not paid for by petitioners and is not provided through petitioners' health plan." The example echoes a hypothetical that Clement and Francisco used in arguments. They posited an "uber-insurance policy" that provides contraceptive coverage to all women in the US, as a counterpoint to the alleged hijacked plans offered by petitioners to employees and students. In essence, they described a private single-payer plan for contraception. Both the court's example and the uber-policy scenario rely on the fictional existence of contraceptive-only plans. Even if petitioners and five justices will this type of plan into existence, it would require significant government intervention in the market, as well as two forms of insurance and the possibility of two different provider networks for petitioners' employees and students.</p>

<p>The order and the question it poses signals what the vote will hinge on. More specifically, it indicates Kennedy's attentiveness to the complicity concerns and the fact that RFRA does not permit religious claimants to hijack the government's administrative and regulatory systems to implement an accommodation. The court may split along other lines, as well. Ginsburg asked whether religious organizations should necessarily receive the same protection under RFRA as a church. Kennedy asked whether a church organization should be treated the same as a university.  As noted, petitioners consist of both church-affiliated organizations and religious universities. The questions suggest that universities may be less likely to receive accommodations that impose burdens on third parties. On the other hand, Ginsburg and Kennedy's questions may just have been aimed at Francisco's sweeping assertions about the RFRA's scope of protection for free exercise.   </p>

<p>What should be notable is that because the parties to the case are religious employers and the federal government, people who use contraceptives&#8212;mostly women, are positioned as third parties. Yet, the so-called third parties have a significant stake in this case: health, autonomy and equality. When you set aside the analogies and hypotheticals, the case positions women between the privatization of health care and the religious beliefs of others.</p>

		<title>Waterboarding Is Decidedly and Manifestly Torture</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Colomnist <a href="https://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan J. Paust</a>, the Mike & Teresa Baker Professor at the Law Center at the University of Houston, discusses how waterboarding is a form of torture...</p><strong>P</strong>rofessor Jeffrey Addicott has made false statements about Bush/Cheney interrogation tactics in a recent commentary <a href="/forum/2016/04/jeffrey-addicott-waterboarding-torture.php">piece </a>. Among them are the manifestly erroneous assertions that "the US has never engaged in torture," "we have not ... engaged in torture," "[n]one of the techniques employed by the US have ever involved unlawful interrogation practices," "waterboarding ... was clearly not torture" and "the techniques produce no prolonged mental harm that would violate the Torture Convention."  </p>

<p>Use of computer-assisted research would easily disprove each of the quoted assertions. First, George W. Bush, Cheney and others have admitted that they either <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1989099">authorized or facilitated use</a> of waterboarding. Computer-assisted research of US cases, not to mention scholarly works written since disclosures of the infamous <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB127/02.08.01.pdf">Yoo-Bybee memos </a> [PDF] in 2002 and the equally infamous <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/legacy/2013/10/21/memo-bradbury2005.pdf">Bradbury memos</a> [PDF] in 2005, will disclose that at the time of the erroneous 2002 and 2005 memos at least twenty-nine US federal and state court cases had <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1331159">recognized</a> that waterboarding and related inducement of suffocation by water is torture. The same recognition appeared in three cases from the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR)</a>, the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/">Inter-American Court of Human Rights</a> and in seven <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/">US Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> of other countries. Not one of these cases was cited in the 2002 or 2005 memos, and not one of the seven US Department of State reports was cited in the 2002 or 2005 memos.  Further, US soldiers had been prosecuted in 1902 in the Phillipines for using water-boarding during the Spanish-American War and in 1968 in a US courts-martial in Vietnam.  Water torture was also prosecuted at the IMT at Nuremberg, the IMT for the Far East, Norway, tbe UK, Singapore, and US military commissions in Europe after WII. [43 Valpo. U. L. Rev. at 1554-55 n.69 - click-on].  </p>

<p>It is incorrect to cite to the ECtHR case,  <u>The Republic of Ireland v. The United Kingdom</u>, 1978 [<a href="https://www.jurist.org/forum/2014/12/philip-leach-hooded-men.php">re-opened case</a>] involving five UK interrogation tactics that were found to be unlawful as inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of human rights law, because none of the tactics involved waterboarding. Inhuman and degrading treatment during an armed conflict would also be a war crime under treaty-based and customary laws of war if practiced on any detainee of any status for any reason. These forms of illegal treatment are also addressed in <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Article 16</a> of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which is applicable in time of war or peace.</p>

<p>Second, a claim that "prolonged mental harm" is needed to "violate the Torture Convention" is clearly belied by the definition of torture set forth in <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx">Article 1</a> of the Convention, which expressly and unavoidably covers "any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted."</p>

<p>Third, the stark assertion that "[n]one of the techniques employed" during the Bush/Cheney program "have ever involved unlawful interrogation practices" is legally unsupportable. As in the case of waterboarding, adequate research during the erroneous 2002 memos would have easily demonstrated that several tactics authorized and abetted in violation of human rights law, the customary and treaty-based laws of war and the Convention Against Torture were torture. For example, fourteen US federal and state court cases, one case in the ECtHR and two US Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights had recognized that the cold-cell and related inducement of hypothermia <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1331159">constitutes torture</a>. None of these cases or Department of State reports were mentioned by Professor Addicott or in the infamous 2002 and 2005 memos. Additionally, the use of dogs to instill intense fear or terror and death threats had been recognized as constituting torture in US cases and US Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights, which were also easily discoverable. Yet again, these materials were neither utilized nor analysed in the discussion of the topic, nor during the creation of the infamous 2002 and 2005 memos.  A number of other tactics were, if not torture, recognizably cruel, inhuman or degrading, as the Convention Against Torture Committee later pointed out to the US in a country-specific report on Bush/Cheney tactics of sexual humiliation, short shackling and use of dogs to induce fear.</p>

<p>Fourth, Professor Addicott prefers that advisers to the next president "keep in their back pocket the long standing common law doctrine of 'necessity.'" Nonetheless, it is widely known that alleged necessity is not a defense to violations of treaty-based and customary laws of war that proscribe every form of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and that <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx">Article 2, paragraph 2</a>, of the Convention Against Torture expressly warns that "[n]o exceptional circumstances whatsoever ... may be invoked as a justification for torture."  Further, it is widely known that human rights law similarly provides an absolute prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of any human being and that such a prohibition is part of peremptory rights and prohibitions <em>jus cogens</em>. It is widely known that torture by US officials or agents will violate the <a href="http://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-v">Fifth Amendment</a> to the US Constitution, as well as the<a href="http://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-viii"> Eighth Amendment </a>(where applicable) and that no alleged "common law" could lawfully prevail domestically over the US Constitution, treaty law of the US or customary international law. Further, an alleged common law doctrine of necessity is inapt with respect to the constitutionally-based limitations on executive authority famously recognized, for example, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9985485675344493119&q">Ex parte Milligan</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, one wonders whether the failure of President Obama to comply with his unavoidable constitutional duty faithfully to execute the laws, which require initiation of prosecution or extradition of all persons who are reasonably accused of having authorized, abetted or committed international crimes addressed herein (like  Bush, Cheney, Rice, Gonzales, Rizzo, Yoo, Bradbury and so many others), has contributed to statements by certain presidential candidates that they might use waterboarding and other manifestly unlawful tactics.</p>

<p>Before the International Criminal Court (ICC), mistake of law and manifestly unlawful authorizations or facilitating memos would not provide limitations of individual criminal responsibility.  Even though the US is not a party to the Rome Statute of the ICC, US nationals can be prosecuted by the ICC if alleged crimes took place (even partly) within the territory of a party to the treaty, such as Afghanistan, Jordan, Lithuania, Poland or Romania.  Further, an ad hoc international criminal tribunal could be created that uses the same standards for individual criminal liability. </p>

		<title>The Unanswered Questions in Evenwel: Voters, Undocumented Immigrants and the American Political Community</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.barry.edu/law/future-students/faculty/staff/mmorley.html">Michael T. Morley</a>, assistant professor at <a href="https://www.barry.edu/law/">Barry University School of Law</a>, discusses the recent Supreme Court decision regarding voting districts...</p><strong>T</strong>he Supreme Court's recent ruling in <span class="casename"><a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-940_ed9g.pdf">Evenwel v. Abbott</a></span> [PDF] lies at the potentially explosive intersection of voting rights and illegal immigration.  In a virtually inevitable yet surprisingly weak opinion, the Court affirmed the constitutionality of the procedure that states presently use for drawing legislative districts, in which they attempt to equalize each district's total population.  The Court left open the question, however, of whether states may exclude non-voters in general, or undocumented immigrants in particular, from the population count when drawing districts and apportioning state representatives.  </p>

<p>The Court was unlikely to invalidate currently accepted redistricting standards due to practicality concerns, the magnitude of the political consequences, and the absence of any real constituency or public pressure for changing them.  Other lines of supreme Court authority, however, strongly suggest that states have constitutional discretion to decide for themselves whether to include undocumented immigrants in the population count when allotting state representatives.  A state is required neither to recognize undocumented immigrants as part of its political community, nor reward regions that welcome large populations of undocumented immigrants with "extra" political power. </p>

<p><em><span class="casename">Evenwel</span>'s Background</em></p>

<p>Every state is divided into legislative districts; each district elects one or more members to the state legislature.  For over a half-century, the supreme Court has held that a state's legislative districts must contain roughly equal numbers of people&#8212;this is the famous "one person, one vote" principle.  In <span class="casename"><a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/377/533.html">Reynolds v. Sims</a></span>, for example, the Court struck down a legislative apportionment scheme in which the state's smallest district was assigned one representative for its 13,462 residents, while the largest district received one representative for every 90,694 residents.  Such disparities, the Court concluded, impermissibly gave residents of less populous districts a proportionally greater voice in determining the identity of their representatives than residents of more highly populated districts.    </p>

<p>The plaintiffs in <span class="casename">Evenwel</span> contended that allocating representatives based on pure population, rather than the number of eligible voters in each district, can result in comparable unfairness.  Assume that District A and District B each have 100,000 residents and are each entitled to a single representative in the legislature.  If 80,000 of District A's residents and only 50,000 of District B's residents are eligible voters, then each voter in District B has a proportionally greater say in determining the identity of his or her representative than District A's voters.  Although the districts' overall populations are equal, each vote from District B reflects 1/50,000 of the power to determine that district's representative, while each vote from District A constitutes only 1/80,000 of that power.  Such disparities, the plaintiffs argued, are inconsistent with the "one person, one vote" imperative underlying cases such as <span class="casename">Reynolds</span>.  </p>

<p><em>Deconstructing <span class="casename">Evenwel</span></em></p>

<p>The <span class="casename">Evenwel</span> Court rejected that argument in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-940_ed9g.pdf ">an opinion</a> [PDF] with which each of the Justices either joined or concurred.  The six-Justice majority held, "[B]ased on constitutional history, [the] Court's decisions, and longstanding practice . . . a State may draw its legislative districts based on total population."  The Court began by noting that representatives in Congress are allocated among states based on total population, rather than eligible voters or some other metric.  "It cannot be," the Court opined, "that the Fourteenth Amendment calls for the apportionment of congressional districts based on total population, but simultaneously prohibits States from apportioning their own legislative districts on the same basis."  The Court disregarded the fact that it regularly distinguishes between the national government and state governments when applying Equal Protection principles to disputes over representation.  In <span class="casename">Reynolds</span>, for example, the Court held that states may not assign an equal number of state senators to counties with substantially different populations, even though the Constitution assigns an equal number of US Senators to each state despite substantial population disparities among them.  </p>

<p>The Court also pointed out that many of its precedents speak about the need for "equality of representation" rather than "voter equality."  But the Court selectively ignored numerous <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/397/50.html ">other rulings</a> in which it emphasized the importance of ensuring that the relative weight of all votes for legislators is the same, regardless of the district in which a voter lives.  Thus, the Court's discussions of the Constitution's text, which does not address state legislative apportionment, and its own precedents, which offer conflicting mandates at best, do little to support its holding.  </p>

<p>The Court's third main explanation, concerning "settled practice," is the true foundation for its ruling.  It explained, "Adopting voter-eligible apportionment as constitutional command would upset a well-functioning approach to districting that all 50 States and countless local jurisdictions have followed for decades, even centuries."  The plaintiffs "have shown no reason for this Court to disturb this longstanding use of total population."   The Court conveniently overlooked the fact, however, that when it crafted its "one person, one vote" jurisprudence, those cases were inconsistent with the then-settled practices of allotting state representatives by counties and crafting districts with dramatically differing populations.  <span class="casename">Reynolds</span> and its progeny are based on principle, not practice.  The Court's selective reliance on practice in <span class="casename">Evenwel</span> is therefore puzzling.  </p>

<p><span class="casename">Evenwel</span> was inevitable because the Court was extremely unlikely to invalidate the procedure that every state in the nation uses to allocate state representatives.  It would have been unseemly, if not outright improper, for the Court to conclude that the procedure is unconstitutional, yet decline to grant relief because it is so widely accepted, or based on the inconvenience or disruption of the political system that changing the process would cause.  The Court therefore chose instead to treat state practice as influencing the Constitution's meaning, creating a "gloss" on the proper interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause.  In the Court's view, the states' practice of allotting state representatives based on total population liquidates the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.  The practice creates a type of self-fulfilling prophecy; by its very existence, the practice is treated as fleshing out and satisfying the Clause's otherwise vague mandate of equality.  Though the Court frequently relies on such reasoning, particularly in cases dealing with separation of powers or the structure of government, its normative power is debatable.   </p>

<p><em><span class="casename">Evenwel</span>'s Unanswered Question</em></p>

<p>While <span class="casename">Evenwel</span> approves the use of total population as a basis for allotting state representatives, it does not address the closely related issue of whether states have discretion to choose to exclude non-voters in general, or undocumented immigrants in particular, from that population count.  <span class="casename">Evenwel</span> explains that states have an interest in "ensuring that each representative is subject to requests and suggestions from the same number of constituents," emphasizing that constituents often need "help navigating public-benefits bureaucracies."  While this reasoning might support counting children and lawful permanent residents when allocating representatives, it does not necessarily apply with the same force to undocumented immigrants.  States may validly conclude that members of the legislature should be primarily responsive to the needs of their constituents, the state's citizens and other lawful members of the state's political community.  Moreover, rewarding areas that welcome, encourage, and protect undocumented immigrants with additional political power creates bizarre incentives for municipalities and counties to flout federal immigration law.   </p>

<p>The Supreme Court has repeatedly <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/467/216.html">held</a> that non-citizens may be excluded from activities that are "intimately related to the processes of democratic self-government," such as serving as a juror or working as a police officer.  "[A] State's historical power to exclude aliens from participation in its democratic political institutions," the Court <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/435/291.html">has explained</a>, "[is] part of the sovereign's obligation to preserve the basic conception of a political community."  This recognized constitutional prerogative to exclude non-citizens from a state's processes of democratic self-governance implies, at a minimum, the authority to refuse to count such individuals when allocating seats in the state legislature.  Thus, while <span class="casename">Evenwel</span> holds that states cannot be compelled to exclude undocumented immigrants from the basis of representation when drawing state legislative districts, the Equal Protection Clause likely leaves them discretion to do so.  </p>

<p>States should exercise this authority by redrawing legislative districts to equalize the number of US citizens and lawful permanent residents they contain, rather than total population.  Voters in areas with large numbers of undocumented immigrants should not have their voices in the political process effectively amplified simply due to the federal government's persistent refusal to enforce immigration law.  Taking undocumented immigrants into account when allotting state representatives only magnifies the consequences of the federal government's refusal to secure the nation's borders.   </p>

<p>The plaintiffs in <span class="casename">Evenwel</span> sought a quick victory by asking the Court, as a matter of constitutional law, to unilaterally change the rules for drawing state legislative districts across the nation.  <span class="casename">Evenwel</span> leaves them free to pursue the change they seek but, if they do, it must be through a series of hard-fought, state-by-state political battles.</p>

		<title>Newtown Families&amp;apos; Suit Against Gunmakers Will Likely End in Dismissal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/info/23149/nicholas_johnson">Nicholas Johnson</a> of the <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/info/20346/school_of_law">Fordham University School of Law</a> discusses the recent suit filed by the families of the Newtown victims...</p><strong>S</strong>ome of the families who survived the horror of the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting are suing the manufacturer and distributors of the Armalite Rifle Model 15, or "AR-15" that was used by the deranged gunman who murdered 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The recent denial of Defendants' motion to dismiss <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2803337/Bushmaster-Sandy-Hook-Judges-Decision.pdf">Soto v. Bushmaster</a> [PDF], has generated a great deal of attention. Some of that commentary reflects the hope that Judge Barbra Bellis' denial of the motion to dismiss might prefigure a blow against the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/s397/text">Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act</a>, (PLCAA) which grants gun manufactures limited immunity from this sort of litigation.  This hope is likely to be disappointed.     </p>

<p>The denial of the motion to dismiss is attributable to a quirk in the Connecticut pleading rules that makes the ruling far less suggestive than an equivalent dismissal in federal court. The central element of Judge Barbara Bellis' opinion is that the PLCAA does not deny courts subject matter jurisdiction, which is the Connecticut requirement for dispensing with Plaintiff's claim at this stage of the litigation.</p>

<p>Judge Bellis simply concluded that the PLCAA does not "limit the power of the courts". Rather "it is a limitation on the rights of litigants." Thus, within the procedural context of the case, Judge Bellis has simply concluded that the PLCAA does not limit her authority to hear the case.  </p>

<p>Judge Bellis' ruling seems to have drawn attention because the PLCAA actually has been the basis for successful motions to dismiss in similar federal court cases. So some have inferred that the denial of a motion to dismiss in <span class="casename">Soto</span> signals Bellis' skepticism about the scope of the PLCAA. But all that this really signals is a difference in federal and state pleading rules. As judge Bellis makes clear, those prior federal cases proceeded under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), where a motion to dismiss "is used to challenge the legal sufficiency of a pleading, not the court's jurisdiction."</p>

<p>Judge Bellis' denial of defendants' motion is, in contrast, grounded on whether she has subject matter jurisdiction, and is in no way a comment on the threshold sufficiency of the plaintiffs' claim. In Judge Bellis words, "at this juncture, the court need not and will not consider the merits of plaintiff's negligent entrustment theory or the <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2011/pub/chap735a.htm">CUTPA's (Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act) </a>applicability to the sale of marketing of firearms."</p>

<p>All this said, there is still no denying that the shooting in Newtown left deep scars that might prompt exceptional judicial activity. And that possibility warrants an examination of viability of the substantive claims that Judge Bellis deferred. </p>

<p>The <span class="casename">Soto</span> litigation is precisely the sort of action that is barred by the PLCAA. Following the lead of thirty states that passed similar legislation, Congress passed the PLCAA in response to several years' worth of lawsuits against the gun industry grounded on a variety of novel theories. Former Pennsylvania Governor <a href="http://www.edwardrendell.com">Ed Rendell</a> explained in a speech to the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/aba.html">American Bar Association</a> that the litigation was designed to avoid consolidation and stretch the ability of gun makers to pay for legal defense in dozens of jurisdictions at once.</p>

<p>Some of those claims dripped with irony. One legal theory was that gun manufacturers&#8212;defying the profit motive&#8212;were negligently marketing and oversupplying firearms to distressed communities. The irony was that the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB94219170035109720">only real evidence</a> of product-dumping was that some of the plaintiffs had upgraded the police arsenals of their cities by selling large lots of used police guns at below-market prices.</p>

<p>The PLCCA allows manufacturers to be sued for selling defective firearms and for violating the complex system of laws and regulations directly governing firearms. But sellers of properly functioning firearms who comply with the National Firearms Act, the Gun Control Act of 1968 (with its many amendments) and myriad other federal and state laws governing the manufacture and sale of firearms, cannot be sued for criminal use of their products.</p>

<p>The <span class="casename">Soto</span> <a href="http://www.koskoff.com/In-the-News/Sandy-Hook-Families-Complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [PDF] attempts to carve out an exception to the PLCCA with the claim that the AR-15 is unique; that government and military have taken special efforts to keep these guns exclusively in government and military hands, and; that manufacturers like Bushmaster, defying these efforts, have "negligently entrusted" the AR-15 to civilians. There is no such exception in the PLCCA. So the suit attempts to establish an implied, overriding qualification, that the AR-15 are in such a different, extraordinary category that an exception to the PLCCA is implicit.</p>

<p>The answer to this argument is evident in the national norms that are demonstrated by the basics of U.S. firearms regulation. It is plain that Congress itself has explicitly entrusted semiautomatic firearms, including the AR-15, to civilians through a variety of affirmative legislative choices. The <a href="https://homicide.northwestern.edu/docs_fk/homicide/laws/national_firearms_act_of_1934.pdf">National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA)</a> [PDF] and the <a href="http://thecmp.org">Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP)</a>, are two of the most pertinent. </p>

<p>The NFA places heightened restrictions on owning fully automatic firearms and destructive devices that Congress deemed exceptional and that are technologically distinct from the broader pool of common firearms. Common long guns and handguns, including repeaters like lever actions, revolvers, and semiautomatics with detachable box magazines (like the AR-15), were placed outside the strict regulations of the NFA.</p>

<p>More than 30 years later, those common firearms were subjected to the provisions of the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-82/pdf/STATUTE-82-Pg1213-2.pdf">Gun Control Act of 1968</a> [PDF]. The 1968 law and its many amendments restrict who may possess firearms, but explicitly entrust the spectrum of common firearms to law abiding citizens.</p>

<p>In 1994, Congress <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr4296/text">nominally banned guns deemed "assault weapons." </a>The ban was pure security theater. It prohibited further manufacture of guns based on appearance and left functionally identical guns in slightly different configurations freely available. The ban's main effect was to spur demand for the prohibited configurations. A decade later, when the ban expired, even a <a href="http://johnrlott.tripod.com/other/NPRSemiAutoBan.html">prominent original supporter</a> said the expiration would not make "one whit of difference."</p>

<p>Presumably <span class="casename">Soto's</span> lawyers would say that any congressional entrustment of the AR-15 and other guns to civilians here is implicit at best; that allowing trade in semiautomatic firearms under the Gun Control Act, and the failure to reenact the 1994 assault weapon ban are different from explicit federal entrustment of these guns to the public. </p>

<p>The pointed answer to that argument is the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP). Under the CMP, which has existed since 1903, the U.S. government has directly entrusted&#8212;meaning given and sold&#8212;actual military firearms, including semiautomatic rifles with detachable box magazines, to individuals and shooting clubs.</p>

<p>The CMP program was created to encourage civilian training and practice with military arms. It reflected the broad judgment that Americans were and should continue to be a nation of riflemen. Through a cooperative arrangement between the CMP and (for over 50 years) the National Rifle Association, citizens could purchase government-surplus rifles and handguns.</p>

<p>In 1994, the CMP was removed from the federal budget and required to sustain itself financially. Pursuant to <a href="http://us-code.vlex.com/vid/reservation-firearms-ammunition-parts-19229028">36 USC 40729</a>, it still promotes marksmanship training and national shooting competitions, and it sells semiautomatic military battle rifles to individual citizens and clubs. Over the decades, the federal government has directly entrusted to civilians, semiautomatic battle rifles and carbines that duplicate or exceed the capabilities of the AR-15. Although the government does not sell AR-15 rifles through the CMP, the AR-15 is one of <a href="http://thecmp.org/2016-cmp-rifle-and-pistol-rule-changes/">the most popular rifles </a>in CMP competitions. </p>

<p>The stalwart of the CMP program is the semiautomatic M-1 Garand in .30-06. General George Patton called the Garand the <a href="http://amhistory.si.edu/militaryhistory/collection/object.asp?ID=660">"greatest battle implement ever devised.</a>" Ballistically, the .223 cartridge fired by the AR-15 pales in comparison to the Garand's far more powerful .30-06 cartridge. Unlike the AR-15, the Garand is not a civilian likeness of a military arm. The Garand is the actual World War II battle rifle.</p>

<p>Also on the CMP list of federally entrusted firearms is the M-1 carbine. The M-1 carbine shares many of the characteristics of the AR-15. It is more compact than the Garand. It fires a lower powered cartridge than the Garand. The M1 Carbine's 110 grain, .30 caliber cartridge is in the same intermediate ballistics category as the AR-15's 55 grain, .223 cartridge. Like the AR-15 and the M-14, the M1 Carbine feeds ammunition through a detachable box magazine.</p>

<p>Although it is highly likely that the <span class="casename">Soto</span> suit will be dismissed long before this sort of evidence is introduced, the public decision-making surrounding the sale and distribution of firearms in the U.S. strongly refutes Plaintiff's negligent entrustment theory. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Joaquin G. Avila, a voting rights attorney, discusses the Supreme Court decision regarding voter populations...</p><span class="casename"><strong>E</strong>venwel v Abbott</span> was correctly decided. The Court basically held that states are not required to use eligible voter population data to create election districts that are equally populated. Based upon constitutional history, settled practice and precedent, the Court affirmed the use of population data to comply with the one person one vote principle. </p>

<p>The key issue is yet to be decided: whether it is constitutional to have legislative districts that are equal in eligible voter populations yet have disparities in total population. For the moment, states are free to choose a population base to redistrict election districts.</p>

<p>The practical result of having a redistricting plan based upon an eligible voter population base will be the creation of districts that vary widely in population. A contrary ruling that allows for such legislative districts with substantial population differences will have disastrous consequences on minority communities, especially Latino communities, which contain significant non-citizen populations. </p>

<p>These substantial population differences will in effect deny Latino communities of their First Amendment right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. In <span class="casename">Garza v LA County</span>, the ninth circuit held that, "interference with individuals' free access to elected representatives impermissibly burdens their right to petition the government. Since 'the whole concept of representation depends upon the ability of the people to make their wishes known to their representatives', this right to petition is an important corollary to the right to be represented." Furthermore, since non-citizens are entitled to various federal and local benefits, such as emergency medical care, the <span class="casename">Garza</span> decision affirmed their right to petition their government for services and to influence how their tax dollars were spent. As Justice Brennan explained in <span class="casename">White v Regester</span>, equal representation for equal numbers of people is "a principle designed to prevent diminution of access to elected representatives." In election districts that have large populations, Latinos will have greater difficulty in securing physical access to the offices of their elected officials. Such a redistricting will require governmental entities to expand the number of offices, especially in those communities where there is ineffective public transportation. The implementation of an eligible voter population redistricting base will require the development of new metrics to assure compliance with the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href=-" https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">14th Amendment</a> to our Constitution. This new metric will require the development of new judicial standards to measure the number of persons serviced by each legislative office. The development of this new access metric will require decades of new litigation. A denial of an explicitly written constitutional right is a serious matter even for originalists. </p>

<p>Moreover, a contrary ruling will undo several decades of voting rights jurisprudence that resulted during decennial redistricting cycles. This jurisprudence represents a delicate balance and calibration of state and federal interests. The redistricting metric based upon an equal population base was carefully incorporated and crafted by the Supreme Court over a period of decades.</p>

<p>Finally, a contrary result mandating eligible voter population or permitting eligible voter population equality at the expense of equally populated districts runs contrary to the practical realities of redistricting because the Bureau of the Census does not provide eligible voter population statistics at the block level. Rather, eligible voter population statistics are provided at the block group level. These larger Census administrative units make it nearly impossible to meet the exacting de minimis population deviation standards of congressional redistricting and court-ordered districting plans. </p>

<p>Experienced district drawers are keenly aware of the necessity for block level statistics in order to create districting plans that can accommodate both state and federal interests. Having drawn districts since the 1970s as part of my voting rights litigation, it was extremely difficult to draw equally populated districts at the local governmental level using enumeration district and block group totals. The 1980 Census was highly welcomed by redistricting mapmakers because of the expanded block program that facilitated the drawing of congressional districts and local government election districts down to the block level. Thus, even if such an eligible voter population redistricting was permissible, the Bureau of the Census would have to substantially expand the geographic scope of its publishing data down to the block level. Given that the eligible voter population is based upon a sample basis, ACS, it may be statistically impossible for the Census Bureau to publish and disseminate accurate and reliable city block level data for eligible voter population groups.</p>

<p>There are additional practical concerns relating to increased public expenditures. An expansion of the ACS program to the block level will require greater expenditures by Congress, an unlikely outcome given the existing political gridlock in DC. Increasing the number of legislative offices at the state level in highly populated areas will also require the expenditure of scarce public funds, again a highly unlikely outcome given the scarcity of available public funding.</p>

<p>A contrary result in <span class="casename">Evenwel</span> will, in effect, result in an unfunded federal government mandate. In summary, as a practical matter, basing a redistricting plan on an eligible voter population will 1) create Equal Protection concerns in Latino communities, 2) be highly impractical; and 3) validate the perception that there are limits to federal court intervention, thereby undermining the authority of the federal judiciary. It will be similar to Justice Holmes' observation in <span class="casename">Giles v Harris</span> (1903) that a federal court's authority will be undermined when a federal court issues a specific order on paper that is impractical and, thus, unenforceable. (See Michael J. Klarman, From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: the Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality by (Oxford University Press) (2004)). Here, as in the <span class="casename">Giles</span> opinions where Supreme Court justices conceded they could provide no remedy even if Alabama was violating the <a href=" https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxv ">15th Amendment</a>, a contrary result would undermine Congressional authority to enforce the federal <a href=" https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act ">Voting Rights Act</a> and undermine <a href=" https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">the Supremacy Clause</a> that binds the states and the federal court to the Constitution.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu/faculty/directory/fulltime/malcolm_joyce">Joyce Lee Malcolm</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu">George Mason School of Law</a> discusses judicial precedent for Second Amendment rights...</p><strong>T</strong>he decision of Connecticut judge Barbara Bellis to ignore federal law by permitting gun manufacturers to be sued for criminal use of a gun is part of a disturbing pattern. The affirmation of a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> right of individuals to be armed seems to be provoking otherwise sober-minded judges to nullify U.S. Supreme Court decisions and now federal law. </p>

<p>In the landmark case <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [PDF] (2008), for example, the Supreme Court affirmed the individual's right to keep and bear those weapons in common use for self-defense and other lawful purposes. Two years later in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1521.pdf">McDonald v. City of Chicago</a> [PDF], the court incorporated the Second Amendment protection, finding the right to be armed "fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty and system of justice."  Nevertheless writing for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1698803.html">Friedman and Illinois State Rife Association v. City of Highland Park</a> five years after <span class="casename">McDonald</span>, Judge <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/easterbrook">Frank Easterbrook</a> upheld Highland Park's ban on "assault weapons" which it defined as any semi-automatic rifle taking a large capacity magazine and sporting certain cosmetic features. The city branded these guns "dangerous and unusual."  Since these firearms are among the most popular hunting rifles and used safely by millions of Americans, Easterbrook thought "it better to ask whether the regulation bans weapons that were in common use at the time of ratification and [relying on the 1939 case <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/307/174">United States v. Miller</a>] weapons that have `some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.'" Both arguments&#8212;that the Second Amendment protects only weapons in use at the time of ratification and weapons related to militia use&#8212;were explicitly and emphatically rejected by the Supreme Court in <span class="casename">Heller</span> and <span class="casename">McDonald</span>. In <span class="casename">Heller</span> Justice Scalia found the argument that only Eighteenth-Century weapons were protected "bordering on the frivolous" noting "[w]e do not  interpret constitutional rights that way" while he characterized that interpretation of <span class="casename">Miller</span> as a "startling reading." Judge Manion, the dissenter in <span class="casename">Friedman</span>, was amazed his two colleagues came "not to bury <span class="casename">Miller</span> but to exhume it.  To that end," he wrote, their opinion "surveys the landscape of firearm regulations as if Miller were still the controlling authority and <span class="casename">Heller</span> were a mere gloss on it." Regrettably the Supreme Court refused to hear the case and Highland Park's ban stands.</p>

<p>Last year the justices of the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/court-info/sjc/">Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts</a> in a unanimous opinion again defied the Supreme Court's Second Amendment rulings.  In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-10078_aplc.pdf">Caetano v. Massachusetts</a> [PDF] the justices upheld their state's ban on the stun gun Ms. Caetano had brandished to protect herself because stun guns did not exist when the Second Amendment was ratified. If they had somehow overlooked Justice Scalia's dismissal of that interpretation in <span class="casename">Heller</span>, Justice Alito writing for the majority in <span class="casename">McDonald v. City of Chicago</span> was clear: "The Court has held that the Second Amendment extends,<em> prima facie</em>, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding." Can the members of the highest Massachusetts court read? The <span class="casename">Caetano</span> case was appealed to the US Supreme Court where, by 8 to 0, the Court found the Massachusetts law unconstitutional. In a concurring opinion Alito and Thomas wrote, "Although the Supreme Judicial Court professed to apply  <span class="casename">Heller</span>, each step of its analysis defied <span class="casename">Heller's</span> reasoning."     </p>

<p>Now we find Connecticut Judge Barbara Bellis permitting a law suit against gun manufacturers to go forward despite a federal law banning such suits. A bit of history is in order. In the late 1990s individuals and municipalities began suing gun manufacturers holding them responsible when guns they produced were used in violent crime. More than twenty law suits were launched, beginning with <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9810/30/no.gun.lawsuit/">New Orleans in 1998</a>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/13/us/chicago-is-suing-over-guns-from-suburbs.html">Chicago sued 22 gun manufacturers</a> for $433 million dollars arguing the gun companies were "a public nuisance." Boston sued 31 named defendants for millions of dollars in compensation for the salaries and even the pensions of police, firemen, and medical personnel, claiming the companies were marketing an unsafe product and failed to keep guns from the hands of criminals. The advertised aim was to force the companies to include more safety modifications but the more fundamental goal was to drive them into bankruptcy. Then Housing Secretary <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov">Andrew Cuomo </a> warned the companies they would face "death by a thousand cuts." <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/eliot-spitzer-279076">Eliot Spitzer</a>, New York's attorney general, <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r106:H11AP0-0007:">threatened</a> if Glock did not settle the state's claim, "your bankruptcy lawyers will be knocking at your door."  <br />
     <br />
Law suits, however frivolous, are expensive to fight and companies that manufacture properly made legal products are not responsible for their misuse unless they sell them to dealers or individuals who they have reason to know may employ them for criminal ends. No one would hold a car manufacturer liable for a fatal accident caused by a purchaser. Apart from a few cases that settled, the courts dismissed all the law suits. The Boston suit, meant to be the first to go to trial, was <a href="http://napavalleyregister.com/news/boston-drops-lawsuit-against-gun-industry/article_6306b972-dec6-5973-91cd-68fa94bf72cb.html">withdrawn</a> in 2002, the mayor claiming it was too expensive to proceed.<br />
     <br />
Finally, in 2005 Republicans in Congress joined by 60 Democrats passed the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/s397/text">Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act</a>. The law shields licensed manufacturers, dealers, and sellers of firearms or ammunition and trade associations from any civil action "resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse" of a firearm or ammunition. Seeking to hold "an entire industry for harm that is solely caused by others," the statute stated, "is an abuse of the legal system." The 2005 law contains some six common-sense exceptions such as evidence that the product was defective or that a weapon was knowingly sold to an individual intent on using it for criminal purposes.  <br />
     <br />
The <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2803337/Bushmaster-Sandy-Hook-Judges-Decision.pdf">Connecticut suit</a> brought by the parents of nine victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre does not fall under any of the law's exceptions. Defendants are accused of producing a weapon unfit for civilian use and selling it to a person known to pose a risk. Since the gun was sold to the shooter, Adam Lanza's, mother and is a model used by millions of civilians, the arguments are clearly false. Further the manufacturer, Bushmaster, had no reason to know the circumstances of the sale. The judge did not rule on the merits but allowing the suit to go forward violated the law. We expect judges to ensure the law is followed, not circumvented to achieve a result they favor. Bellis has failed in that fundamental duty.</p>

		<title>Waterboarding is &#034;Torture&#034;? &#8212; The Agenda-Driven Argument</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST <a href="/commentary/contributing/2016/terrorism/addicott.php">Contributing Editor Jeffrey F. Addicott</a> of St. Mary's University School of Law continues the discussion on the legality of waterboarding...</p>This article is written in response to certain scholars that published their views in a <a href="/forum/2016/04/jordan-paust-waterboarding-torture.php">recent JURIST article</a> concerning my views on "waterboarding," also published in JURIST. Anticipating the opprobrium that my initial piece was sure to generate, I alluded to the fact that waterboarding was one of the "sacred cows" of the mainstream elites and any dissension to the foregone conclusion that waterboarding is torture arouses great emotional consternation to the agenda driven. </p>

<p>There is no question that the public brainwashing that "waterboarding is torture" is breathtaking and has a deep negative impact on our society. However, isn't the legal community and the public at large better served by a logical discussion of the facts and applicable law rather than a tirade of desperate <em>ad hominem</em> attacks? </p>

<p>Obviously, given the limited parameters of the word count, I am not able to fully address each of the cherry-picked bait-and-switch points associated with their critiques (recall our domestic law and policy has now changed from what it was immediately following 9/11). I do, of course, fully grant that my critics are certainly entitled to their own opinions, but I do not share them. If they are serious about learning more on the topic, I would point them to read carefully my law several review articles, sworn testimony before the US Senate, and perhaps purchase a copy of my latest textbook: Terrorism Law: Materials, Cases, Comments (7th Edition, 2014). In addition, as the senior legal adviser of all the US Army Special Forces, I do have a working knowledge of the "real world" in terms of various interrogation techniques.  </p>

<p>In the kindest light, perhaps part of the problem in understanding the issue of waterboarding is that key language in the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Torture Convention</a> is not particularly precise, opening the door to differing interpretations. In the Torture Convention, torture is defined as "severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental."  The immediate question to the thoughtful scholar is this: what then constitutes "severe"? While some may think the Department of Justice approved waterboarding technique that was employed on three detainees as "severe," I do not. In turn, I do not believe that the technique constituted the lower level of prohibited conduct called "ill-treatment." It was a level of interrogation that was "stress and duress" at best. The average session lasted ten seconds, and a medical doctor was in place.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the term "waterboarding" itself is problematic. For example, the same term is used to describe techniques employed by the US military in SERE (search and rescue) courses and to describe the real torture employed by the Japanese in World War II. All use the same term "waterboarding," but each varies in the technique. Holding someone's head under water is not the same as putting water up the nostrils to cause an automatic response.  </p>

<p>In any event, the real question is who gets to decide what is "severe"? Is it a law professor pontificating in a law review article? Is it an angry commentator on MSNBC? Is it a leftist political candidate? Of course, it is none of the above. In our Anglo-Saxon legal tradition it is a competent court that will define the language &#8212; the higher level of jurisprudence, the better.  </p>

<p>Obviously, we can all pop up numerous cases that are associated with the term "waterboarding," but where is the court case &#8212; state, federal, or international &#8212; that examined our DOJ approved techniques during the time frame in question (to include waterboarding) and ruled them torture? The answer, as my critics openly recognize in their own article, is that there is no such court case!  </p>

<p>Thus, without direct case law on point, this means that advocates for one side or the other will marshal facts that best fit their side of the argument and present them for consideration. In this context, it is efficacious to explore similar case law and then extrapolate, although many will include memorandums, law review articles, and the like as well. This is what I have done. The difference is that I do not agree with the mainstream analysis. This "sin" I freely confess to.</p>

<p>As I previously indicated the number one international court in the world (and it is not a "right-wing" court) ruled in <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-57506#{"itemid":["001-57506"]}">Ireland v. UK</a> that the British interrogation techniques used against certain IRA detainees did not rise to the level of torture (ill-treatment is not torture). Although <span class="casename">Ireland</span> was decided just prior to the 1984 Torture Convention, the language of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [PDF] is identical to the Torture Conventions' definition of torture and ill-treatment. In fact, in <span class="casename">Selmouni v. France</span>, the European Court of Human Rights cited Ireland with approval in this context.  </p>

<p>All commentators lament the fact that the Obama administration never proceeded with criminal charges to back up their political rhetoric about waterboarding constituting torture. However, it is interesting to note that when certain individuals in Obama's Justice Department sought to punish the DOJ attorneys at a lower administrative level, it backfired. In July 2009, the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) issued a report entitled <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/natsec/opr20100219/20090729_OPR_Final_Report_with_20100719_declassifications.pdf">Investigation into the Office of Legal Counsel's Memoranda Concerning Issues Relating to the Central Intelligence Agency's Use of "Enhanced Interrogation Techniques" of Suspected Terrorists</a>. The OPR report concluded that former OLC lawyers, John Yoo and Jay Bybee, had engaged in professional misconduct by failing to provide "thorough, candid, and objective" analysis in memoranda regarding the interrogation of detained terrorist suspects." The OPR indicated that it would refer its findings of misconduct to the state legal bar for disciplinary action. Then, in January 2010, the DOJ Office of the Deputy Attorney General issued its own memorandum objecting to the findings of the OPR report and refused to "authorize OPR to refer its findings to the state [sic] bar disciplinary authorities in the jurisdictions where Yoo and Bybee are licensed." In short, the DOJ determined that Yoo and Bybee had not engaged in professional misconduct in advising the CIA on the legality of enhanced interrogation techniques (EITs) based on existing law at the time.  </p>

<p>Intellectually, I side with Yoo and Bybee. They are men of great courage and integrity. The CIA did not engage in torture between 2002 and 2005. Leading international case law such as <span class="casename">Ireland</span> and <span class="casename">Public Committee</span> (Israel, 1999) clearly set an extremely high bar for what would constitute torture. While individual members of the CIA and military have engaged in murder, torture, and other misconduct in their individual capacities and should be punished, the United States of America never authorized torture.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/expert/eric-ruben">Eric Ruben</a> of the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org">Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law</a> responds to a <a href="https://www.jurist.org/forum/2016/04/joyce-malcolm-judicial-nullification.php">recent JURIST article</a> about the Second Amendment and firearm industry immunity....</p><strong>E</strong>ight years after the Supreme Court struck down a handgun ban in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZO.html">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>, Second Amendment law has not developed the way gun advocates hoped. They expected that popularly enacted gun laws would fall like dominoes. But lower courts for the most part have repeatedly upheld restrictions that stopped short of handgun bans, consistent with Heller's careful signal that the opinion <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2016/02/antonin-scalia-legacy-gun-rights/">left plenty of room for reasonable regulations</a>. That result is deeply dissatisfying to the advocates, who have resorted to a tired attack on the courts for what the <a href="https://home.nra.org">National Rifle Association</a> called a "<a href="http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2013/08/the-nra-takes-on-the-courts/">pervasive pattern of stubborn resistance</a>." Given that the Supreme Court has had <a href="http://smartgunlaws.org/protecting-strong-gun-laws-the-supreme-court-leaves-lower-court-victories-untouched/">over 60 opportunities</a> to correct lower court rulings in Second Amendment cases, but has chosen to do so <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-10078_aplc.pdf.">only once</a>, this critique is increasingly strained.</p>

                <p>In an attempt to show just how rebellious judges have been, historian <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu/faculty/directory/fulltime/malcolm_joyce">Joyce Lee Malcolm</a> opens a new line of attack in her <a href="/forum/2016/04/joyce-malcolm-judicial-nullification.php">recent JURIST commentary</a>. Malcolm asserts that the "disturbing pattern" of "nullification" is seen not only in Second Amendment cases, but also in a case brought against a gun manufacturer by the families of the children shot and killed at Sandy Hook:<br />
                <blockquote>The decision of Connecticut judge Barbara Bellis to ignore federal law by permitting gun manufacturers to be sued for criminal use of a gun is part of a disturbing pattern. The affirmation of a Second Amendment right of individuals to be armed seems to be provoking otherwise sober-minded judges to nullify U.S. Supreme Court decisions and now federal law.</blockquote> </p>

                <p>This novel allegation is both baseless and misleading about just how obstructive the federal immunity statute has been. Far from ignoring industry immunity, courts have applied it repeatedly, giving the firearm industry a free pass no other business enjoys, let alone one that manufactures a lethal product like the assault rifle used to spray 154 bullets in under five minutes in Newtown, Connecticut.</p>

                <p>If the Sandy Hook defendant did not sell guns, the parents of the slain children would be entitled to make a case. If the case lacked merit under ordinary liability principles, they would lose; otherwise, they would win. But as Malcolm concedes, firearm manufacturers are different&#8212;industry lobbyists in 2005 secured immunity from liability at the expense of gun victims in a federal statute called the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/s397/text">Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act</a> (PLCAA). </p>

                <p>As a result, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/14/an-unprecedented-jury-verdict-orders-gun-shop-to-pay-nearly-6-million-to-injured-police-officers/">only two cases</a> against gun dealers have fit into one of PLCAA's narrow exceptions and reached a jury since the federal immunity benefit was granted to the industry. Needless to say, this hardly reflects what Malcolm characterizes as a "disturbing pattern" of judicial defiance.</p>

                <p>Indeed, even the claim of judicial "nullification" in the Sandy Hook case is demonstrably unfounded and belies a misrepresentation of the case's procedural posture. According to Malcolm, Bellis "ignor[ed] federal law by permitting gun manufacturers to be sued." But, as a practical matter, the immunity statute does not prevent a gun manufacturer from "be[ing] sued." Rather, as interpreted by numerous courts, it provides the gun manufacturer with a defense against many types of claims after they are sued. </p>

                <p>In fact, Bellis has not even ruled whether immunity applies in the case, so Malcolm's argument is a red herring. Although Bellis rejected the gun manufacturers' motion to dismiss in April, <a href="http://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/DocumentInquiry/DocumentInquiry.aspx?DocumentNo=10333999">she did not rule on immunity</a> [PDF]. Perhaps the confusion is that a federal motion to dismiss would be a procedural vehicle for raising and deciding the issue. This case is pending in Connecticut state court, however, where Bellis will await a separate "motion to strike" to consider whether the gun maker is immune from liability. </p>

                <p>The sad reality is that the Sandy Hook plaintiffs &#8212; like all gun violence victims &#8212; face an uphill battle because of PLCAA. At a minimum, however, the plaintiffs deserve a thoughtful determination whether, among other things, the civilian marketing and sale of the assault rifle constituted a "negligent entrustment," an exception in the statute, in which case immunity would not apply and the case could proceed. </p>

                <p>No basis exists to assert a "disturbing pattern" of judges "nullifying" the federal law providing firearm industry immunity. More relevant than arguing about whether courts have heeded the immunity statute &#8212; they have &#8212; is considering whether it is just to slam the courthouse door on victims solely because they had the terrible misfortune of being harmed by a deadly product manufactured by a powerful industry.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Christina Alam of the <a href="http://law.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> discusses the negative effect corporate mergers have on preserving American jobs... </j:header><strong>W</strong>hile some public figures paint horror stories of how immigrants steal American jobs, subtler, but yet powerful forces leave thousands of American employees jobless. These forces are corporate restructuring and downsizing. And the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/25/investing/kraft-heinz-merger-3g-capital/">2015 merger</a> of two iconic brands &#8212; Kraft and Heinz &#8212; is a good example of this phenomenon. </p>

<p>The two companies announced their merger in March 2015 backed by two affluent groups of investors: for Heinz, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1999-07-04/the-warren-buffett-you-dont-know">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway</a>, and for Kraft, Brazilian venture capital fund <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=23471434">3G Capital</a>. With an estimated <a href="http://news.heinz.com/press-release/finance/hj-heinz-company-and-kraft-foods-group-sign-definitive-merger-agreement-form-k">$10 billion from these investors</a>, the merger was supposed to generate significant synergies in what would become the fifth largest food and beverage company in the world.</p>

<p>But in reality, "synergy" was just a euphemism for "<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/kraft-foods-heinz-synergy-2015-3">severe cost cutting</a>." As was the case with other past acquisitions, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/business/dealbook/kraft-and-heinz-to-merge.html?_r=2">3G Capital's <em>modus operandi</em></a> was to introduce aggressive cost reduction policies as a way to improve profitability. The core of these policies was "<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/from-heinz-to-kraft-zero-based-budgeting-sweeps-across-america-1427308494">zero-based budgeting</a>," where the management had to justify its expenses every single year as if no money had existed the previous year. Other policies were more far-reaching &#8212; such as massive reductions in the work force and complete closure of unprofitable manufacturing lines &#8212; while other policies were almost beyond belief &#8212; such as requiring permission to make color photocopies and counting how much paper and soap employees used. Generally, the gist of 3G Capital's strategies fits well within the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kraft-deals-analysis-idUSKBN0MM06020150326#cZLYQOk4rp88G2hA.97">words of Gary Stibel</a>, the founder of the New England Consulting Group, whose clients have included both Kraft and Heinz: "When [3G Capital] see[s] something that isn't working, [it] eliminate[s] it." The empirical evidence of this hypothesis followed &#8212; in November 2015, the management announced the plan to close <a href="http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-kraft-lehigh-valley-plant-closing-20151104-story.html">seven of its facilities</a> that would eliminate 2,600 jobs in the U.S. and Canada. </p>

<p>The question arises whether there are legal ways to stop this process. Unfortunately, under the well-established <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/business_judgment_rule">business judgment rule</a>, courts will not second-guess the policies and tactics of corporate management, unless there is "self-dealing, conflict of interest, or illegality." Most states, however, modified this rule by enacting <a href="http://www.elon.edu/docs/e-web/law/law_review/Issues/Elon_Law_Review_V4_No2_Standley.pdf">constituency statutes</a> [PDF]. These are the laws aimed to allow the board of publicly traded corporations to <a href="https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&doctype=cite&docid=61+Geo.+Wash.+L.+Rev.+14&key=88c0fddd068f97c660d3cda4dc6d075a">consider an expanded group of "interests</a>" when making decisions on behalf of the corporation or, more precisely, decisions concerning the course of the corporation's business." Specifically, these statutes authorize corporations to consider <a href="http://www.hblr.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4.2-5.-Strine-Do-the-Right-Thing.pdf">interests of different corporate constituencies</a> [PDF] besides merely shareholders, and thus shield corporate management from liability if the management sacrificed shareholders' interests to interests of other constituencies. </p>

<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13943205491007746745&q=646+F.+Supp.+690+&hl=en&as_sdt=3,39">Baron v. Strawbridge & Clothier</a> well demonstrates the benefit of the constituency statutes. In that case, Ronald Baron, a Strawbridge & Clothier's shareholder, attempted to cause several bidders to target the company in order to inflate the company stock price, so that Baron could later sell his shares at a premium. After Strawbridge & Clothier adopted a series of anti-takeover measures, Baron challenged the board's actions. The court, however, found that the management adopted the measures to keep the family business nature of the corporation intact and to protect its employees from potential downsizing, and therefore dismissed the action. The court also noted that the management acted in good faith and with due care, and that it was proper for the management to turn down the hostile bidder's offer, instead considering the interests of the company's "employees, customers and community." Although the decision does not expressly mention the constituency statute, it impliedly endorses the extension of the business judgment rule to consider the interests of non-shareholder constituencies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the situation described in <span class="casename">Baron v. Strawbridge & Clothier</span> is only one side of the coin. While the constituency statutes help <a href="http://nclawreview.org/documents/94/2/Shealy.pdf">keeping local jobs</a> when the corporate board itself desires to protect the jobs, the statutes are toothless in making the board consider such interests, when the board is unwilling to do so. </p>

<p>The reason behind it is that most constituency statutes are only <a href="http://nclawreview.org/documents/94/2/Shealy.pdf">permissive</a> [PDF], i.e., the board has a right, but not an obligation, to consider the interests of different groups. Although the state of Connecticut initially passed a constituency statute that required the board to consider the interests of all corporate constituencies, the law was later amended to reflect permissive standard.</p>

<p>More importantly, non-shareholder constituencies do not even have standing to sue the board for failure to consider their interests or for the breach of fiduciary duties. For example, in <a href="http://www.cplpej.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Silver-Thompson-Maxwell.pdf">Dugan v. Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby, Inc.</a> [PDF], the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania held that the duty of the board to act in the best interests of the corporation "may not be enforced directly by a shareholder or by any other person or group." Therefore, due to the <a href="http://www.hblr.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4.2-5.-Strine-Do-the-Right-Thing.pdf">lack of any enforcing mechanisms</a> [PDF], corporate constituencies can only rely on the pure and not self-serving intentions of the corporate board.</p>

<p>Back to the Kraft Heinz merger... Did the merger affect employees? Most certainly: <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/08/12/kraft-heinz-layoffs/">5 percent of Kraft employees have already lost their jobs</a> and more are yet to come. Kraft executives also felt the hit &#8212; <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150629/NEWS07/150629781/10-kraft-execs-to-hit-the-exits-following-heinz-merger">10 out of 12 Kraft top executives are not joining the new Kraft Heinz</a>. Consequently, the merger negatively affected Kraft employees on all levels. </p>

<p>Answering the question if the employees have any remedies, we have to admit that they do not. Kraft employees are unable to change the course of events simply because they do not have an opportunity to challenge Kraft CEO Cahill's decision to merge with Heinz. Likewise, Heinz employees were unable to challenge <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/berkshire-and-3g-capital-to-buy-heinz-for-23-billion/">3G Capital acquisition of Heinz in 2013</a>.  However, in both the 3G Capital acquisition of Heinz and the Heinz acquisition of Kraft, these constituencies paid the most in the course of merger. While it might be too late for Pennsylvania and Illinois employees, there are other corporations that can be <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/kraft-heinz-is-still-taking-shape-after-its-own-merger-1438829695">new targets of aggressive merger and acquisition strategies</a> as employed by 3G Capital. Therefore, states should consider whether it is time to revisit constituency statutes to make them actually workable by providing different corporate constituencies with standing to challenge major corporate changes. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Mahmudul Hasan, an LLM student at the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, discusses the impact of climate change on vulnerable world populations and its relation to international migration and refugee situations...</j:header><strong>A</strong>s global climate change and the resulting implications on ecosystems and livelihoods affect the viability of traditional lifestyles in many parts of the world, some global bodies are taking notice of the substantial exodus of populations from areas that are more vulnerable to climate change. While much of environmental law is developed in piecemeal fashion at both global and national levels, the urgency of climate migrants may cause governments and institutions to develop legal and infrastructural solutions with an ad hoc approach. Nonetheless, guidelines and responsibilities provided by international organizations such as the <a href="http://www.ibanet.org/">International Bar Association (IBA)]</a>, the <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change</a>, and the <a href="https://donate.unrefugees.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1873&ea.campaign.id=49686&ea.tracking.id=D15XSX163XXS">United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)</a> may offer a set of norms for the global community to address the migration caused by global environmental change. These norms will create a space where discourses over environmental laws and humans rights laws are no longer treated as totally separate from one another. This will stimulate a paradigm shift when this entanglement is publicly and widely acknowledged. However, in order for this change to occur, logistical problems nations now face must be approached with legal intersectionality in mind; the paradoxes, divergences and conflicts between different legal regimes needs to be actively acknowledged to address the complex non­linear issues of climate change and human rights. In fact, any kind of legal infrastructure should always have an explicit cognizance of climate change as a fundamental condition in the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/science/Anthropocene-Epoch">Anthropocene</a>. </p>

<p>One key challenge in preparing for the expected humanitarian crisis triggered by climate change is understanding the ways in which environmental laws and human rights laws may intermingle, especially when it concerns migrants driven out by environmental change. While it is expected that, due to unfeasible living conditions caused by climate change many communities will be forced to move elsewhere, the designation of these communities as "refugees" still causes contention. Traditionally, the UNHCR identifies and defines refugees as people leaving conflict areas or escaping persecution by seeking asylum in another country.  However, climate change refugees present several challenges to this traditional definition. First, many of these communities are expected to flee their places of residence not because of armed conflict among humans, states, communities, tribes or organizations, nor because of persecution based on their lifestyles, sexualities, gender, religion and other identities, but because of natural circumstances that threaten their livelihood and security. Of course, many of the social threats they may face, like persecution or armed conflict may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change, such as: food insecurity, drought, floods and other naturally derived phenomenon, the essential cause of their emigration will remain something that is anthropogenic in nature, and yet still outside of human political and social control. Consequently, the notion of climate change refugees poses various paradoxes in the understanding of agents and actors within the realm of international environmental law, as well as the understanding of refugees in the framework of international human rights laws.</p>

<p>For instance, the number of people fleeing their localities due to environmental change has been estimated to be <a href="http://http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/library/Media/201507-globalEstimates-2015/20150713-global-estimates-2015-en-v1.pdf">between 25 million to 1 billion people</a> [PDF, report]. However, because <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2015/11/climate-refugees-151125093146088.html">terms such as "'climate refugee' and 'environmental refugee' are still not classified as legal categorizations</a>..., [it is] difficult to determine whether a person is fleeing their home because of an environmental disaster, lack of work, or the established, long term impacts of climate issues like drought or rising sea levels.". Thus, it is particularly challenging to ascertain the nature of climate change-driven migrants, and provide for their needs and safety through formal international legal and logistical means. Although many cities such as Mumbai, Dhaka, Kolkata, Bangkok, Shanghai, and Miami are expected to receive many of these migrants over the next several decades, environmental and climate migrants are still not considered in urban development plans, and there are no binding global agreements among states to address this impending issue, even though the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has explicitly outlined <a href="http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=broRL5Q2lB4">mass human migration as one of the major impacts of climate change</a> [video]. While international legal norms and procedures exist to ensure the "right to life", and by extension, right to food, water, shelter and safety of communities around the world, there has yet to be an explicit set of norms established between states to handle what will eventually be an enmeshment of environmental and human rights laws. This is perhaps driven by the perceived separation between the different legal regimes and the illusion that environmental laws, trade laws, and human rights laws can operate separately without impacting the overall survival and sustainability of societies. The immediate and most obvious result of this is many individuals who are trapped in deteriorating environmental conditions do not have the legal means, resources, or capacities to escape their conditions by adapting to climate change or by migrating as a refugee elsewhere. Until an explicit acknowledgement of intersectionality between different legal regimes is put in place and made widespread, many of these problems will remain unresolved.</p>

<p>In an effort to address some of these gaps in international law, IBA formed a task force to address the upcoming crisis of "climate justice," which offers some means to reconcile the sometimes divergent aims of international, environmental and human rights legal regimes.  The <a href="http://www.ibanet.org/PresidentialTaskForceClimateChangeJustice2014Report.aspx">IBA report</a> and task force on climate change justice aims to: <br />
<blockquote>...ensure communities, individuals and governments have substantive legal and procedural rights relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment and the means to take or cause measures to be taken within their national legislative and judicial systems and, where necessary, at regional and international levels, to mitigate sources of climate change and provide for adaptation to its effects in a manner that respects human rights.</blockquote></p>

<p>Implicit in the definition of climate change justice for the IBA is the understanding that climate change does not affect populations around the world equally, and that the biggest perpetrators of climate 'injustice' (that is, the nations with the largest carbon footprints that ultimately lead to climate change) are often frequently shielded from the graver impacts of climate change due to their larger pool of resources that make adaptation to climate change far more feasible. Consequently, nation-states with smaller carbon footprints face tremendous logistical and socioeconomic challenges to responding effectively to climate change. Thus, climate change justice as advocated by the IBA, wishes to center human rights discourses within climate change mitigation and adaptation conversations. The IBA climate justice report outlines their approach further, stating that: <br />
<blockquote>"[b]y adopting a justice and human rights-­centred approach, the IBA intends to shift the focus of much­-needed reform from purely economic and scientific considerations to the human rights and equity consequences of climate change. In doing so, the IBA hopes to advance equity and justice by listening to the human rights concerns of the communities most vulnerable to climate change. The Report reminds its audience that failure to address the challenges posed by climate change will have devastating consequences for hundreds of millions around the globe, in both the industrialized and developing world, and that, in the drive to confront this potentially existential threat to our civilization, not a moment should be lost."</blockquote></p>

<p>One of the key changes that the IBA advocates is a paradigm shift that will treat climate change as an external, environmental problem in the realm of environmental laws and governance. This means that climate change will be treated as an environmental problem that should be under consideration from all forms of governance, moving it from the realm of economic and scientific problems to one that affects all domains of society. In the past, we have observed how environmental laws sometimes came into being as an extension of human rights laws such as "right to life" <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Environment/SREnvironment/Pages/SRenvironmentIndex.aspx">discourses</a>. Now, there is a reintegration of environmental governance with other areas of human governance, which presents an interesting turn for paradoxes previously present between the civic/human laws and environmental laws. </p>

<p>The reconciliation, or rather reintegration between international environmental law and human rights laws create new responsibilities for states and other governing bodies. The IBA report also highlights that:<br />
<blockquote>"While human rights laws may provide an avenue for individuals and communities to seek redress for harms caused by global climate change. There is little doubt that climate change affects peoples' human rights directly. Rights to life, health, food, shelter and water are all plainly affected by the ravages of climate change. These effects can be characterised as 'rights violations' (rather than mere bad luck) because climate change is a preventable man­made phenomenon. Nevertheless, it is not easy, as a matter of law, to join up the dots between those emitting excessive greenhouse gases and those suffering the consequences - the law is not designed to that end, and difficult questions of causation and standing arise. Possible avenues of redress may include class actions, targeting major groups of emitters or holding public officials responsible for failures of due diligence. Many of these strategies are currently being explored. Another possible avenue may be the development of 'environmental rights', now recognised in a number of national constitutions."</blockquote></p>

<p>It is not clear how to set up mechanisms for provisions and accountability within international environmental law, as some schisms between international law (such as each nation state's control over its resources) and environmental law (i.e. right to good environment for neighboring nations) and human rights laws (i.e. right health and good livelihoods, right to security); however, IBA has noted the intersectionality of these somewhat fundamentally related but ultimately divergent legal regimes. Accordingly, new procedures and mechanisms need to be proposed to account for an increasingly intertwined international legal regime. </p>

<p>When discussing climate change justice, specifically related to the fate of climate change refugees and environmental refugees, the principle of intersectional-systems-thinking must be at the core of all decision making and governance processes in both domestic and international levels. Climate change is a fundamentally multi­process development that implicates ecosystems, societies, and economies of various scales. Thus from a legal stand point, it no longer makes sense to treat climate change as part of discrete international legal regimes. The awareness of climate change as an underlying condition should be stipulated within legal infrastructures, so that it is always considered as an important variable when making decisions. Such an approach of environmental intersectionality would revolutionize the way human rights policies are drafted, especially in cases where environmental justice concerns are intimately intertwined with those relating to social and economic equity. By removing bureaucratic hurdles presented by the narrowness of certain definitions within human rights laws, more robust processes and infrastructures may be created to address the complex human nature relations in the Anthropocene. Fundamentally at its heart, these processes need an acknowledgement of the crucial intersections between human societies and ecosystems. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Abed Awad of Awad & Khoury, LLP, discusses the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement...</p><strong>I</strong>n 1880, English Captain Charles C. Boycott led an eviction campaign against tenants in Ireland. Appalled at the inhumanity of Mr. Boycott's ruthless actions, his employees refused to work for him.  These events introduced the word "boycott" to the English language as a way to describe economic protest to effect social, political and economic change. <br />
                <br />
                Boycotts in the 20th Century have ignited and facilitated historic social and political change. The <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/montgomery-bus-boycott">Montgomery, Alabama, Bus Boycott</a> against racial segregation, <a href="http://www.ufw.org/_board.php?mode=view&b_code=cc_his_research&b_no=10482">Cesar Chavez's grape boycott</a> against abuse of farm workers, <a href="http://www.remember-them.org/milk.htm">Harvey Milk's boycott against LGBT discrimination</a>, <a href="https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/the-anti-apartheid-struggle-in-south-africa-1912-1992/">the Anti-Apartheid boycotts in the 1980s against the Apartheid regime in South Africa</a> are but a few examples of boycott activism against injustices and human rights abuses.<br />
                <br />
                American may be surprised to learn that state lawmaker are currently considering bills intended to abridge the freedom of speech of Americans, American businesses and institutions to engage in such peaceful protests of injustice.<br />
                <br />
                In <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/creation-israel">1948</a>, Israel was established resulting in the displacement of the indigenous Palestinians. While hundreds of thousands became stateless refugees, a sizable number of Palestinians remained. Currently Palestinian citizens of Israel make up about 20 percent of the population. They are subjected to systemic institutional discrimination. Non-Jewish Israeli citizens are legally excluded from living in more than 400 Jewish communities. Palestinian citizens suffer legally sanctioned discrimination with close to 50 discriminatory laws against Palestinian citizens of the state in employment, education, housing and land ownership.<br />
                <br />
                After the <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/six-day-war-ends">1967 Arab-Israeli War</a>, Israel occupied the rest of historical Palestine&8212;East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Since 1967, Palestinians in the Occupied Territories have been living under Israeli military occupation. Israel restricts and denies Palestinians their basic human rights. Israel continues to confiscate Palestinian land to build and expand illegal settlements. The demolition of homes, uprooting of crops, restriction of movement and numerous other abuses documented by human rights groups like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and B'Tselem have become routine.<br />
                <br />
                <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/">The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement</a> seeks to pressure Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian territories and comply with international law. The US civil-rights and South African anti-apartheid movements inspire and guide BDS. BDS is a peaceful tool to achieve justice and equality.<br />
                <br />
                BDS is gaining traction in American civil society. The United Methodists, the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the United Church of Christ have all endorsed elements of BDS. Academic associations, university student governments, labor groups and others have similarly supported BDS. This is a healthy development forcing a serious public debate on Israel's treatment of Palestinians.<br />
                <br />
                As of this writing <a href="http://palestinelegal.org/legislation/">nine states have passed anti-BDS laws</a>. At least nine other states have considered or are considering similar laws so far this year. Even county and municipal governments are considering such legislation. There are three common threads in the legislation aimed at curtailing the BDS movement that is pending or has passed. Bills that condition the receipt of state funding for higher education institutions on non-engagement in boycotts of Israel have so far been defeated because of their blatant unconstitutionality in states including Illinois and New York. Such bills are still pending in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Other bills legislation prohibits the investment of State public retirement funds in entities that boycott Israel. Some legislation goes as far as prohibiting the state from entering into contracts with companies that boycott Israel.<br />
                <br />
                Much of this legislation makes it a condition that recipients of government benefits espouse the State government's anti-BDS position. The effective result of these bills is that any opposition or critique of the state of Israel is treated as an exception to the First Amendment. Their unconstitutionality is blatant.<br />
                <br />
                Many lawmakers are entitled to disagree with my opinion. But it is unthinkable for a state legislature to suppress a citizen's right to participate in a peaceful boycott against human rights abuses.<br />
                <br />
                That boycotts are a recognized form of political speech is well-established in American jurisprudence. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7271075303659098319">NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co</a>, for example, the NAACP organized a boycott of white-owned businesses to pressure government officials to meet their demands of equality and non-discrimination. The Supreme Court explained in that case that political boycotts are protected First Amendment activities directed at issues of public concern, and on the highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values. By succumbing to Israeli government pressures to suppress BDS, State lawmakers are using their state's economic leverage to restrict, discourage and silence constitutionally protected boycott activities of Americans.<br />
                <br />
                Moreover the Supreme Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4415013413682250783">Perry v. Sindermann</a> held that the governments;may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests - especially, his interest in freedom of speech.<br />
                <br />
                Recently the United States Supreme Court in <a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/tlr93&div=51&g_sent=1">Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc. (2013)</a> held that requiring that organizations receiving funding under the T<a href="http://www.state.gov/j/tip/laws/">rafficking Victims Protection Act</a> to have a policy expressly opposing prostitution violated <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> free speech protections.<br />
                <br />
                Like in <u>Claiborne</u> BDS supporters are exercising their rights to free speech and association to effect justice and equality for Palestinians. Like in <u>Perry</u> and <u>Agency for International Development</u>, requiring organizations receiving government funding to hold or reject a particular social policy or political position cannot survive constitutional scrutiny.<br />
                <br />

		<title>After Texas: What&#039;s at Stake for the Rest of the Country in Whole Woman&#039;s Health v. Hellerstedt</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.case.edu/Our-School/Faculty-Staff/Meet-Our-Faculty/Faculty-Detail/id/821">B. Jessie Hill</a> of <a href=" http://law.case.edu/ ">Case Western Reserve University School of Law</a>, Judge Ben C. Green Professor of Law and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, discusses the newest Supreme Court abortion rights case...</p><strong>O</strong>nly a few weeks remain in this Supreme Court term, and <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt</span> has yet to be decided. Is it still likely to be the most important abortion case since <span class="casename"><a href=" https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/833">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a></span>? And what does it mean for abortion restrictions in the rest of the country outside Texas, especially now that the possibility of a 4-4 split looms in the absence of Justice Scalia? The short answer is that the worst-case-scenario for the plaintiffs now appears to be off the table, but beyond that, it's anyone's guess.</p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span>, the Supreme Court is considering the constitutionality of a Texas law that requires abortion clinics to meet the standards that apply to ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) and requires physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Because these requirements are, for some clinics, either prohibitively expensive to meet (in the case of the ASC standards), or simply impossible to attain (in the case of admitting privileges), they will shut down almost all of the abortion providers in Texas, likely leaving the state with fewer than 10 clinics, most of them clustered in the larger cities.</p>

<p>At the heart of the case is a dispute between the defendants and the plaintiffs over the application of <span class="casename">Planned Parenthood v. Casey </span>'s "undue burden" standard for evaluating the constitutionality of abortion restrictions. The ASC and admitting-privileges requirements are justified by the state as advancing the state's interest in making abortion safer for women. Texas claims that this purpose is legitimate and that the reduction in access to abortion does not rise to the level of an undue burden. The plaintiffs&#8212;abortion providers in the state of Texas&#8212;argue, by contrast, that these legal mandates have both the purpose and effect of imposing an "undue burden" on abortion access. Central to their argument is the essentially undisputed proposition that these requirements have no, or almost no, actual impact on patient safety while severely limiting abortion access in the state. </p>

<p><em>Kennedy is Still the Key</em></p>

<p>The sudden death of Justice Scalia means that it will be virtually impossible to assemble a five-justice majority behind a decision that radically alters the future of abortion rights. Of the eight remaining justices, only Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas and Alito would conceivably stake out such a hardline position against abortion access; the four liberal justices (Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan) are all but certain to vote in favor of the plaintiffs on grounds that are broadly protective of abortion rights. Thus, Justice Kennedy's view will likely determine the outcome. If he decides to side with the liberal wing of the court, this will result in a 5-3 victory for the plaintiffs. On the other hand, if Justice Kennedy chooses to join the more conservative justices in voting to uphold one or both sets of requirements, this would likely create a 4-4 split on one or both issues, thus leaving the Fifth Circuit decision upholding the laws intact but creating no binding precedent. </p>

<p>A couple of other alternatives exist. One is that the court will send the case back to the lower court for further fact-finding. There was some suggestion by Justice Kennedy at oral argument that the record was not sufficiently developed on the impact of the challenged laws. Since the court remanded without deciding <span class="casename"><a href=" https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/14-1418">Zubik v. Burwell</a></span>, the Obamacare contraceptive mandate case, it's possible it might remand here as well. This case is different from <span class="casename">Zubik</span>, however. In <span class="casename">Zubik</span>, the court sent the case back to the lower courts with directions for the parties to, essentially, try to work out a compromise. The court could have at least thought that it would end up avoiding a divisive ruling or a 4-4 split if a reasonably acceptable solution could be found. At worst, the court was buying itself time. In <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span>, however, there would be little to gain from such a move. Unlike in <span class="casename">Zubik</span>, where there is a single regulation and a single defendant on one side (the federal government), there are numerous state laws and numerous plaintiffs litigating the constitutionality of admitting-privileges and ASC requirements. Circuits have split, and there are currently two other certiorari petitions pending, with more undoubtedly to come. The court would only buy itself some time by sending the case back&#8212;not open the possibility of a nationwide compromise&#8212;and it would not even buy itself very much at that. The court could accomplish the same thing by simply holding the case over to its next term.</p>

<p>Another alternative is that Justice Kennedy does not join either the liberals or the conservatives, but instead writes his own separate opinion, perhaps splitting the difference in some way. In this scenario, it could matter greatly what, exactly, Justice Kennedy says, even though he is writing only for himself, and how his opinion relates to the other Justices'. In other words, lower courts might be left to piece together a binding rationale based on a fragmented set of opinions.</p>

<p>In any case, the upshot is that, as before Justice Scalia's passing, Justice Kennedy is still the swing vote, and he will decide how and whether this case comes down. </p>

<p><em>Laws in Other States</em></p>

<p>Numerous states now have laws like Texas's, and some of these are currently being litigated. In seven states (Wisconsin, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Kansas, Mississippi and Louisiana), litigation over admitting-privileges laws is ongoing. In two of those cases (Wisconsin and Mississippi), certiorari petitions are pending; in the others, the laws have been enjoined while the proceedings play out or the case is stayed awaiting the outcome in <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span>. In all of these cases, the courts could easily assimilate the Supreme Court's imminent ruling and apply it to the pending cases&#8212;assuming, again, that the court issues a clear and precedential ruling. </p>

<p>There are also older laws like Texas's on the books in some states. The Eighth Circuit upheld Missouri's surgical-privileges law in 1989, before the <span class="casename">Casey</span> decision. Utah's admitting-privileges requirement, which has been in place for several years, does not appear to have been challenged. Similarly, <a href=" https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/spibs/spib_TRAP.pdf">22 states currently have ASC-type requirements</a> [PDF] (including Texas), and most of these are currently in effect. Some of these, too, have been litigated and upheld; others have not been challenged.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that a five-justice majority votes to uphold the constitutionality of the ASC rule, the admitting-privileges requirement, or both, then the laws currently on the books would obviously remain in effect. This is the one scenario that almost certainly will not come to pass, however. If the Court divides 4-4&#8212;a somewhat more likely outcome&#8212;then the decision will not affect any of the laws or litigation currently pending elsewhere in the country. Thus, although in Texas a large number of clinics would close or remain closed, uncertainty and disagreement about the status of these requirements would continue in the rest of the country at least until another justice is appointed.</p>

<p>If the court holds the Texas law unconstitutional, these older laws that are currently in effect may be in jeopardy. If the court holds that such laws always create an undue burden, for example, this would lead to the conclusion that the laws in other states are unconstitutional as well, and it is likely that they would simply no longer be enforced, much as most states simply ceased enforcing their criminal abortion laws after <span class="casename"><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113">Roe v. Wade</a></span> was decided. If the decision in <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span> is more fact-specific, however, it might simply open the door to a new challenge under the standard set forth by the court.</p>

<p><em>Predictions and their Perils</em></p>

<p>Aside from the obvious uncertainty brought about by Justice Scalia's death, there are a few features that make predictions about <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span> and its likely long-term impact particularly difficult. One is that the undue burden inquiry has generally been a fact-intensive one. In putting forth a test that focuses on the lack of health and safety benefits of the law, the plaintiffs have wisely attempted to shift the case's center of gravity away from questions about geography, demographics and the like. However, some of the questioning at oral argument did focus on such issues, which have often been the basis of lower court decisions. If the court's ultimate disposition centers on facts peculiar to Texas, it may result in a victory or partial victory for the plaintiffs in Texas that does little for clinics outside that state. In other words, given the extreme nature of the Texas law and its almost unquestionably severe impact on abortion access in the state, <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span> is arguably too easy. A ruling that says, essentially, "If anything is an undue burden, this is it" will not provide much guidance to courts or comfort for clinics in less extreme circumstances. Litigation will continue for some time around the question whether other states' laws are as bad as Texas's or as extreme in their impact as Texas's.</p>

<p>Another feature making this case difficult, of course, is the enigma that is Justice Kennedy. Where, exactly, does he stand on the abortion issue? He has progressively moved to the left in recent years on the issue of gay rights&#8212;a fact that may give the plaintiffs hope. But he has been much harder to read on abortion rights. Although Justice Kennedy formed part of the three-justice plurality that saved <span class="casename">Roe</span> in <span class="casename">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</span>, he voted to uphold the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in the Supreme Court's last major abortion case, <span class="casename"><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/05-380">Gonzales v.

Moreover, in that case and others, he has penned language favoring deference to legislatures on disputed questions of medicine and science, which are arguably the sorts of questions at issue in this case.<br />
	<br />
Nonetheless, it seems to safe to predict there will be some pressure not to allow a 4-4 split, since the issues arising in <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span> extend well beyond Texas. A 4-4 split would mean many cases, currently on hold, would have to remain in limbo until a new justice is appointed, or we would simply have to live with a circuit split.</p>

<p>Then again, since decades of uncertainty over the undue burden standard have already been produced by the <span class="casename">Casey</span> decision, that result may not be so unimaginable after all.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.lvcriminaldefense.com/about-firm/">Nicholas M. Wooldridge</a> discusses judge Aaron Persky's sentencing of convicted Stanford sex offender Brock Turner...</p><strong>B</strong>rock Allen Turner was convicted of three felony counts related to his digital penetration of an unconscious victim behind a dumpster at a frat party and sentenced to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/13/stanford-sexual-assault-aaron-persky-brock-turner-transcript">short six month period of imprisonment</a>. Turner's sentencing generated public outrage, especially after the long, visceral and rambling 7,400 <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/heres-the-powerful-letter-the-stanford-victim-read-to-her-ra">letter</a> by the anonymous victim read to Turner in court went viral. Deeming Brock's sentence "too lenient" and faulting the judge for considering the "severe impact" of imprisonment on Brock, self-proclaimed social justice activists <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36537296?ocid=socialflow_facebook&ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbcnews&ns_source=facebook">launched petitions</a> on Change.org, seeking the sentencing judge's recall. Members of Congress&#8212;both right and left&#8212;have chimed in <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/stanford-rape-case-ted-poe-brock-turner-judge">proclaiming</a> that "the punishment for rape should be longer than a semester in college." <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/opinion/when-feminists-take-on-judges-over-rape.html?_r=0">Leading the charge to remove Judge Persky</a> is none other than a tenured Stanford University Law Professor, <a href="http://ebf.stanford.edu">Estelle Freedman</a>, a self-proclaimed progressive, who seems far more interested in gaining national attention for herself than the fundamental principles of due process and progressivism, which she brushes aside, because, well, sexual assault cases, at least to Prof. Freedman, are different. </p>

                <p>But before we get to the substantive discussion, let's start with the not-so-pleasant facts of Brock's case. A jury convicted Former Stanford University swimmer, Brock Allen Turner, in March of assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated woman, sexually penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object (his finger) and sexually penetrating an unconscious person with a <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_29667539/witness-stanford-rape-defendant-had-victims-dna-fingers">foreign object</a> (his finger). The first offense&#8212;assault to commit rape&#8212;carried a mandatory prison sentence. But Judge Aaron Persky, citing Brock's youth, lack of a criminal record, the fact that alcohol was involved in the January 2015 assault, said that sending Brock to prison would have a "severe impact" on him, that he did not believe that he would be a danger to others and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/stanford-swimmer-sexual-assault-brock-allen-turner-palo-alto">sentenced him</a> to six months in the Santa Clara County jail followed by three years of formal probation. With good behavior, Brock may have to serve only three months of his sentence. However, he must also <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/15938889/brock-turner-former-stanford-cardinal-swimmer-sentenced-six-months-jail">register as a sex offender for the rest of his life</a> and participate in a <a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com/2016/06/02/brock-turner-sentenced-to-six-months-in-county-jail-three-years-probation/">sex offender rehabilitation program</a>.</p>

                <p>Brock's unquestionably lenient, yet legally sound sentence under California law&#8212;and the visceral response to the sentence&#8212;underscore what's wrong with criminal justice policy in the United States at large.  </p>

                <p>First, public scrutiny of judicial decisions is a good thing and uncontroversial, especially, where the judge, like Judge Persky, is elected. However, if a single decision by a judge, no matter how wrong, is reason enough to remove that judge, then why stop there? Should other judges or members of the other two branches of government be removed from office for a single decision, even a very poor one? As <a href="http://mimesislaw.com/fault-lines/brock-turner-eliminating-the-sentencing-judges-bias/10355">noted by one sitting federal judge</a>, <a href="http://www.iand.uscourts.gov/e-web/home.nsf/0/17a5762715fa4c52862573c90079072c">Hon. Mark Bennett</a> of the United States District Court for the District of Iowa,"[i]sn't it wiser to judge a public servant on their whole body of work rather than a single decision one disagrees with?" The fact that a Stanford law professor is leading the charge is all the more remarkable because Prof. Freedman, of all people, should know better: what if a tenured law professor could be removed for one poor decision? As noted by Judge Bennett, "[n]o one would be left on law school faculties&#8212;or anywhere else for that matter."  </p>

                <p>Second, there is increasing occurrence, in fact, an expectation, that prosecutors and judges must respond and reward populist punitiveness, whether it is a sex crime or any other crime, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9ExuP6ve4MAC&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false">without regard to the effectiveness of a penal policy</a> in a given case. However, the aims and purposes of punishment and the government's authority to punish are not to satiate the retributive lust of a mob, even a mob composed of the putative offender's victims. <br />
                    <br />
                    As noted by numerous contemporary commentators, throughout history, <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2782&context=lawreview">several explanations</a> have been used to explain the aims and purposes of punishment. A citizen may <a href="http://www.robertblecker.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2012/02/Haven-or-Hell.pdf">demand</a>:</p>

                <blockquote>[f]irst, get them off the streets; keep them away from us. Make them suffer: they deserve it. Teach them a lesson they will not forget. And let their pain and sufferings be an example to others. Maybe then, having been punished, someday, somehow, these criminals will feel remorse, change their attitudes, and productively reintegrate into society.</blockquote>

                <p>Drawing upon concepts and perspectives implicit in the Bible and the works of, amongst others, Plato, Hobbes, Beccaria, Kant, and Bentham, legal scholars have explained the aims of punishment as "reinforcement of sovereign authority," "incapacitation," "retribution," "deterrence," and "rehabilitation." Each of these aims suggests a distinct normative foundation for punishment used to justify various strategies of response to criminal behavior; however, none of them permit or allow mob justice to determine a defendant's sentence. </p>

                <p>Judge Persky sat through a lengthy trial. He heard every piece of evidence, not just the small snippets of evidence reported in the media, which on more than one occasion erroneously depicted the victim's rape as sexual intercourse, including penile penetration, not that it lessens the impact on the victim&#8212;but the popular and frequent use of term rape has lost all meaning. Judge Persky meaningfully considered the need for retribution, deterrence (both specific and general), and the need for rehabilitation. Again, none of the factors include mob justice or satisfying his electorate. In the end, despite the woefully inarticulate, misguided, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2852614-Letter-from-Brock-Turner-s-Father.html#document/p3/a300156">self-serving and dumb letters of support</a> and statements from both Brock and his father, the judge determined that the purposes of retribution, deterrence, incapacitation and rehabilitation were amply served by the sentence of six months, followed by three years of probation, sex offender treatment, and lifetime registration as a sex offender.  This could be because academic studies and <a href="http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FCO%2020121218222/U.S.%20v.%20CRAIG">courts have realized</a> the need to be "realistic about the incremental deterrent effect [if any] of extremely long sentences."</p>

                <p>Based on analysis by the <em>independent</em> probation officer, Judge Persky found that there was little to no risk of recidivism by Brock. In other words, there was a limited need for incapacitation to protect the public from future offending by Brock. Next, in sentencing remarks that could have been better phrased and explained, Judge Persky stated that sending Brock to prison would have a "severe impact" on him. This observation, which drew enormous criticism in the media, is, in fact, not only true but also an understatement. What does "severe impact" mean? </p>

                <p>As observed recently by a distinguished and well-respected federal judge, <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/content/judge-frederic-block">Hon. Frederic Block</a> of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, there are more than<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/nyregion/in-a-striking-move-brooklyn-judge-orders-probation-over-prison-in-felony-drug-case.html"> 1,200 collateral consequences for a felony conviction</a> in the United States. For sex offenses involving sex offender registration, there are an untold number of consequences, and they are permanent. They include public disclosure, exclusion from most educational programs, restrictions on movement, including visitation of certain areas, occupational restrictions, residency restrictions, as well as travel restrictions outside of the United States due to recent legislation passed by Congress requiring the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/law-creating-passport-mark-for-sex-offenders-faces-first-challenge-1459276253">passports of certain convicted sex offenders be marked</a> to notify even anyone outside the United States that an individual is a sex offender.  </p>

                <p>It is not unusual or inappropriate for a sentencing judge to take into account the magnitude of a defendant's fall from grace in fashioning an appropriate sentence. For example, in several high profile cases, including, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/27/business/27enron.html?fta=y">Mark Fastow</a> (the former CFO of Enron), <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/rowland-a-year-and-a-day-later.html">John G. Rowland</a> (former Governor of the State of Connecticut), <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/6/bob-mcdonnell-sentenced-2-years-prison-public-corr/">Robert "Bob" McDonnell </a> (former Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/ex-judge-camp-sentenced-to-30-days-in-prison/nQrRq/">Jack Tarpley Camp, Jr.</a> (former federal district judge for the Northern District of Georgia), the sentencing judge departed downwards from the agreed upon or recommended guideline range because of the severe impact on their future. </p>

                <p>Unfortunately, punishment in the U.S. is only measured in terms of the number of months or years an offender is sent to prison to the exclusion of everything else. Brock will pay a very serious price&#8212;a lifelong price. Just as the victim was violated from within, he will be violated from the outside in until the day he dies without any possibility of restoration to the position he was in before he committed his offense. Brock is unlikely to ever complete his education, whether at Stanford or elsewhere, or even obtain a job&#8212;a crucial predictor of recidivism. Unless, Brock stands to inherit a sizeable fortune from his family, he has a pretty bleak life ahead of him.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, the victim may eventually heal. She will get to work. She can live wherever she wants without restrictions. She will be able to move wherever she wants without restriction. She will be able to get an education. The victim can eventually have kids. The victim can and will do anything she wants the rest of her life without interference of the criminal justice system. Of course, the victim may also never heal, but she will have that chance. On the other hand, Brock cannot. His sentence is lifelong. He will not be able to do any of those things. Ever. His punishment will not end when he is released from his six-month jail sentence. Viewed from this angle, Brock has suffered a "severe impact," arguably even a disproportionate impact, and any more would have simply been greater than necessary to fulfill the purposes of punishment.</p>

                <p>Third, the widely lauded <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2852615-Stanford-Victim-Letter-Impact-Statement-From.html">victim impact statement</a> Brock's victim read during the sentencing hearing underscored the detachment between what victims expect from the criminal justice and what the criminal justice system is designed to deliver. Her victim impact statement was an attack on the system&#8212;she wanted a trial where Brock admits his guilt&#8212;that's not what happens in an adversarial system. A trial is a contact sport with a binary outcome: guilty or not guilty. The victim expected something from the criminal justice system that it was never designed to provide outside of the movies, at least, so long as fundamental principles such as the presumption of innocence or due process are to have any meaning. The victim is very much entitled and has a right to expect some responsibility, accountability, remorse and perhaps understanding and support from her attacker (by not having put her through the trial process in the first place)&#8212;but the criminal justice system is a blunt force tool not designed to provide any of the things that she desires.  And, even after conviction, many defendants choose to appeal, so to expect a confession at that point, is a non-starter.  </p>

                <p>In a restorative justice system, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/17/victims-face-their-molester-in-victorias-world-first-restorative-justice-program">primarily used in domestic abuse and violence cases in Australia</a>, the victim may have received exactly what she was looking for&#8212;understanding by the perpetrator, an apology, an explanation and less exposure or dissection in the public sphere&#8212;but the trade off would have been even less jail time for Brock and far fewer collateral consequences.</p>

                <p>I am glad the victim wrote an extraordinarily powerful letter and glad so many millions have read and been moved by it. But it had absolutely no place in the courtroom. None. As <a href="http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1071&context=bjcl">noted by numerous commentators</a>, and highlighted above, victim impact statements introduce a massive amount of emotion into the proceedings and inject arbitrariness into a sentencing process that should be a product of logical reflection. The prosecutor, the probation officer, as well as the judge should have done a better job in managing the victim's expectations in this case. </p>

                <p>Brock Turner has been punished and the nature of his punishment ensures that he will suffer permanent and irreversible consequences for the rest of his life that will have a "severe impact" on him. If anything, Brock's punishment is hardly an "eye for an eye" and will have a disproportionate impact on him. For those who focus on the "short" duration of the prison sentence, whether the sentence was six months or six years is of no moment and misses the wood for the trees: a prison cell is not the exclusive domain of punishment and would not have met the expectations or demands of the victim in this case. </p>

                <p>Calls to remove Judge Persky, especially by Stanford Law Professor Freedman, for no other reason except that the judge's sentence did not satiate the retributivist lust of the public or penal populism, highlights a willingness to jettison progressive principles in a profoundly misguided effort to stop sexual violence and cannot justify unraveling the most cherished safeguards of our criminal justice system. I wonder if instead of championing childish online petitions and fueling populist punitiveness, Prof. Freedman's time would be better spent exploring alternative mechanisms or modes of justice and punishment, such as the restorative justice pilot programs being tried in Australia.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=&#8221; http://www.cato.org/people/tim-lynch&#8221;>Tim Lynch</a> of <a href="http://www.cato.org/">The Cato Institute</a> discusses the right of defendants to choose between a trial by jury or trial by judge...</p><strong>T</strong>rial by jury is one of the most celebrated rights in the American Constitution, but what if the accused person would rather be tried by a judge instead? That question has vexed the American legal system for generations.</p>

                <p>Dylann Roof is facing the death penalty for the shocking murder of nine African-Americans during a church meeting in Charleston, South Carolina last year. Because of the publicity surrounding his case and the antipathy of the community, Roof requested that he be tried by a judge. Yet, under federal law, prosecutors have the option to accept or reject a jury trial waiver, and they quickly vetoed Roof&#8217;s bid. His trial is expected to begin in November.</p>

                <p>Prosecutors typically approach a jury waiver from a narrow, tactical mindset. That is, if they believe they have a better chance to prevail if the case goes to a jury, they will insist on that procedure. Of course, by requesting a trial before a judge, we know that the accused has reached the opposite conclusion&#8212;that an acquittal is more likely if the case were tried before the court. Between those two competing claims one would think that American jurisprudence would side with the individual, not the government.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, the modern trend favors the government. Today, prosecutors routinely deny jury trials to individuals who request them. Yet, in situations where the government is required by law to allow juries, prosecutors suddenly demand a jury when particular persons request to be tried by a judge. As a result, we now have the spectacle of prosecutors imposing bench trials on people who want jury trials and jury trials on individuals who request bench trials. If the decision were left strictly to the accused, the appearance of gamesmanship would end. Since prosecutors should already possess the evidence necessary to convict, they ought to be indifferent to the mode of trial. </p>

                <p>In 1965, a man named Mortimer Singer asked the Supreme Court to recognize an unconditional right to trial by judge.  He argued that the jury trial provision was written for the benefit of the accused and that each person should decide for himself whether to accept that benefit. That&#8217;s a strong argument. After all, the very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to protect the individual against overweening government. The Constitution guarantees a right to a &#8220;speedy trial,&#8221; but it would be perverse to arrest a man one evening and then prosecute him the following day before a legal defense could be thoroughly prepared. If the accused wants a speedy trial, he should get one, but if he wants to delay his trial so that his attorneys can properly prepare, he should get that also. The Constitution also guarantees &#8220;the assistance of counsel,&#8221; but it would be wrong for the government to say that a defendant cannot represent himself if that is how he wants to proceed. Alas, the Supreme Court has not followed this logic with respect to persons who wish to waive their right to a jury trial.	</p>

                <p>The court&#8217;s stubborn denial of an unfettered right to trial by judge is puzzling because it is hard to find a good reason for it. The impact on the overall system would be very limited. First, most cases are resolved by plea bargains, not trials. Second, a jury trial conviction requires a unanimous vote so the prosecution must persuade twelve jurors that the accused person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. For bench trials, the prosecution only needs to persuade one person, the judge. That math explains why the persons going to trial will ordinarily opt for a jury.</p>

                <p>Still, there are circumstances in which the accused may wish to take his case to a judge. Any case that has generated intense media coverage runs a risk that at least some jurors harbor some partial opinions before the case has begun. Even if jurors have not been following the news reports, some may not be able to withstand pressures from the community to render the conviction that some protesters and local activists demand.</p>

                <p>Some criminal cases may involve legal issues that are complex. A person accused of tax fraud, for example, might want a judge to hear how his tax return was prepared. Maybe the return contained errors, but a close examination of the tax laws may show an innocent explanation for those errors that would easily make sense to a person trained in the law.</p>

                <p>Sometimes a defendant wants to testify in his own defense, but will be advised against it. Public defenders fear that jurors will be hopelessly biased after hearing about a record of previous arrests. Under the evidence rules, prosecutors can use criminal records to cross-examine any person who takes the witness stand. Even though a 10-year-old arrest for assault and battery does not help to determine whether the accused committed a battery last month, it will sway the opinions of some jurors. Since judges see all kinds of cases in their courtrooms, they would be far less susceptible to prosecutorial rhetoric about the past offense and focus more intently on the evidence in the more recent incident.</p>

                <p>Interestingly, some state courts, such as Maryland, have recognized the right of the accused to opt for a trial by judge.  Two of the police officers in the Freddie Gray case have chosen to be tried by a judge instead of a jury. </p>

                <p>The political climate is supposed to be receptive to criminal justice reform. If that is so, lawmakers should tweak federal law and give persons who are accused of crimes the choice of judge or jury.</p>

		<title>Louisiana&amp;apos;s Designation of Anti-Police Bias as a Hate Crime Category</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=" https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.overview&personid=20016">James B. Jacobs</a> of <a href=" http://www.law.nyu.edu/">New York University School of Law</a> discusses the recent changes to hate crimes in Louisiana...</p> <strong>F</strong>ederal and state hate crime laws enhance criminal punishment for offenders motivated by certain widely condemned biases, the kinds of biases that are the target of laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing and education. But while those anti-discrimination laws involve discrimination by government officials and private actors who control access to jobs, housing and education, the hate crime laws involve criminal offenders' discrimination in choice of victim. While access to government benefits, employment, housing and education is socially beneficial unless allocated discriminatorily, criminal offending is never socially beneficial. All criminal conduct is condemnable. However, hate crime law designates criminal conduct motivated, in whole or in part, by specified biases as worse, morally and/or with respect to impacts, than criminal conduct motivated by idiosyncratic reasons or by biases that are not officially marked out for special condemnation. </p>

<p>Hate crime laws, which emerged in the 1980s, originally prescribed (sometimes discretionary; sometimes mandatory) enhanced punishment for offenders who select their victims based upon race, ethnicity and religion. Over the years, the number of disapproved biases covered by hate crime laws proliferated to include, first gender and subsequently, depending on each state's particular politics, biases based on age, sexual orientation, political party, veteran's status and others. Minority groups and identity groups have seen advantage in being recognized as a victim group. Politicians have seen little, if any, moral and sometime material advantage in opposing recognition of new biases for additional punishment. Courts have interpreted the hate crime laws to apply to minority group offenders motivated by anti-white bias in their selection of victims. Over time, a great deal of criminal conduct could be prosecuted as hate crime although if the offender commits his crime silently, without crude biased epithets, the necessary bias motivation is difficult to prove.</p>

<p>Hate crime laws are not needed to impose sufficient punishment on offenders especially for serious felonies like murder, arson, robbery and aggravated assault. There is no lack of sufficiently severe maximum sentences for violent crime. Indeed, currently there is a broad consensus that sentences on the books and sentences as applied, are too severe, having resulted in "mass incarceration," now widely recognized as a serious socio-political problem. Moreover, some states designate bias motive as an aggravating factor that elevates murder to aggravated murder qualifying for the death penalty. Ironically, in the name of promoting greater tolerance, certain biased offenders are made execution eligible. </p>

<p>Hate crime sentence enhancement could have the most impact on sentencing misdemeanors, like malicious mischief, trespassing, graffiti and simple assault, where maximum prescribed punishment is fairly lenient, although ample. But these are not the kind of offenses that animate the hate crime law movement. </p>

<p>Hate crime laws are predicated on imagery of vicious crimes committed by unremittingly biased sociopaths bent on terrorizing members of vulnerable groups. However, those kinds of crimes and criminals are thankfully rare. And when they do occur, they are already punishable by life imprisonment or its equivalent, or by the death penalty in some states. In practice, many individuals prosecuted on hate crime charges are juveniles and young adults who are not members of any organized hate group and whose motivations are confused. Nevertheless, the prosecutor need only prove that the offender was motivated <em>in part</em> by bias. Thus, the prosecutor can file a hate crime charge to strengthen her hand in plea bargaining.</p>

<p>Hate crime laws are meant to "send a message," first to the advocacy groups and their memberships, that "we stand with you and deplore your victimization." Second, there is a message for the general public&#8212;"your elected representatives deplore criminals, especially biased criminals." Third, there is a message for would-be biased criminals&#8212;"society regards selecting victims on the basis of disapproved bias as even more deplorable than selecting victims for no reason or for reasons other than those officially condemned." </p>

<p>Louisiana has a very broad hate crime statute covering specified person and property offenses if the victim is selected because of actual or perceived race, age, gender, religion, color, creed, disability, sexual orientation, national origin, or ancestry of that person or the owner or occupant of that property or <em>because of actual or perceived membership or service in, or employment with, an organization.</em> "Organization" includes any lawful corporation, trust, company, partnership, association, foundation or fund; any lawful group of persons, whether or not incorporated, banded together for joint action on any subject or subjects; <em>any entity or unit of federal, state, or local government.</em> As the italicized portions of the statute indicate, this law is already applicable to a person who selects his victim because that victim is a police officer.<br />
 <br />
A separate Louisiana statute, increases the maximum sentence for assault if the perpetrators knowingly assaults a "special victim," defined as a victim who is disabled, elderly, <em>law enforcement officer</em>, correctional officer, school employee (if the offender is a student), athletic contest official, bus or cable car operator for a public transport system, emergency room personnel, healthcare professional, and child welfare and adult protective services employee, if the defendant reasonably could have known that the employee or law enforcement officer was engaged in the performance of his duties. </p>

<p>Thus, Louisiana already treats criminal conduct directed against police officers as warranting enhanced punishment. This is unexceptional because assaulting a police officer is regarded as an attack on government authority as well as on the individual officer. In addition, individuals who attack, or even resist, police are routinely vigorously prosecuted and severely sentenced. Louisiana's addition of anti-police bias to its hate crime law authorizes still greater punishment capacity. </p>

<p>The recent addition of anti-police bias to the list of motivations covered by Louisiana's hate crime statute was not necessary to provide for adequate sentencing authority in cases of attacks on police. It was a message from the governor and legislature that, at this moment in time when police around the country are being widely criticized for abuse of force, "we stand with the police." On its face, there is nothing wrong with that message&#8212;police are often and rightly praised for their public service&#8212;unless, by negative implication, the message was meant to convey rejection of charges of police abuse of authority or even endorsement of such abuse. The sponsors of the law disclaim that intent, as well they should.<br />

		<title>Undisclosed Fraud Sinks Third-Party Benefits Lawsuit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.davidchristensenlaw.com/attorneys/david-e-christensen/">David Christensen</a> of Christensen Law discusses recent developments in Michigan auto law that affect third-party benefits... </p><strong>F</strong>or the past 40 years, plaintiffs' attorneys seeking no-fault benefits for their clients have relied on the<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_14"> innocent third-party rule</a>. This rule protected uninsured drivers, passengers and other claimants from fraud by the policy holder. But a recent published case from the Michigan Court of Appeals has stripped plaintiffs of this protection and left them vulnerable to dismissal based on no fault of their own.</p>

                <p><a href="http://publicdocs.courts.mi.gov:81/OPINIONS/FINAL/COA/20160614_C320518_109_320518.OPN.PDF">Bazzi v Sentinel Insurance Company</a> [PDF] asks one question: whether the innocent third-party rule survives the 2012 Michigan Supreme Court decision, <a href="http://courts.mi.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/Clerks/Recent%20Opinions/11-12-Term-Opinions/142774-Opinion.pdf">Titan Ins Co v Hyten</a>[PDF]. Titan in turn addressed &#8220;easily ascertainable&#8221; rule, first created in <a href="http://www.leagle.com/decision/197663567MichApp568_1559/STATE%20FARM%20MUT.%20AUTO.%20INS.%20CO.%20v.%20KURYLOWICZ">State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co v Kurylowicz</a> in 1976.</p>

                <p><strong>Kurylowicz and the Easily Ascertainable Rule</strong><br />
                    <span class="case name">Kurylowicz</span> interpreted the then newly created Michigan No-Fault Act to seek to protect Michigan motorists. It prevented auto insurance companies from avoiding the claims of innocent third-party plaintiffs by canceling or rescinding the policy on which the claim was based. In essence, it kept insurers from pulling the rug out from under innocent motorists' feet. According to <span class="case name">Kurylowicz</span>:<br />
                <blockquote>"It is the policy of this state that persons who suffer loss due to the tragedy of automobile accidents in this state shall have a source and a means of recovery."</blockquote></p>

                <p>Because of this, the court of appeals ruled that an insurance company couldn't declare a policy void at inception because of fraud when that fraud was easily ascertainable and the plaintiff is a third party not involved in the fraud. Those third parties would continue to be entitled to no-fault benefits, even if the policy holder&#8217;s own recovery was cut off. The case required insurance companies to comply with the Michigan No-Fault Statute&#8217;s 55 day limit on canceling a contract because of risk.</p>

                <p><strong><span class="case name">Titan</span> Changes the Rules</strong><br />
                    This was the law in Michigan for nearly 40 years. Then in 2012, in <span class="case name">Titan</span>, the Michigan Supreme Court overturned <span class="case name">Kurylowicz</span>. The court ruled that there was no public policy protection built into the No-Fault Act that wasn&#8217;t explicitly included in its terms. The court struck down the "easily ascertainable" rule and gave insurance companies access to traditional legal and equitable remedies including cancellation, rescission, and reformation, except as expressly limited by the statute.</p>

                <p>But even after the "easily ascertainable" rule fell, plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys were able to protect some of their clients using the innocent third-party rule. Because occasional drivers, passengers, and other claimants had no knowledge or participation in the fraud, it was thought they would still be covered. That is, until <span class="case name">Bazzi</span> was published on June 14, 2016.</p>

                <p><strong><span class="case name">Bazzi</span> Eliminates the Innocent Third-Party Rule</strong><br />
                    In <span class="case name">Bazzi</span>, the plaintiff was seeking PIP benefits for injuries resulting from his use of his mother's car. That car was insured through a commercial automobile policy held by his mother and his aunt. Sentinel Insurance Company had successfully rescinded the commercial policy in a separate third-party complaint against the plaintiff's mother and aunt based on fraud in the way that commercial policy was obtained= &#8212;specifically that there was no business entity connected with the policy and that the plaintiff was not named as a regular driver of the vehicle. Sentinel then used that rescission as a basis for summary disposition in the plaintiff&#8217;s case. The trial court denied the request based on the "innocent third party" rule.</p>

                <p>The court of appeals ruled that the "easily ascertainable" rule and the "innocent third-party rule" were one and the same. In doing so, it relied on the <span class="case name">Titan</span> summary of the rule stated in <span class="case name">Kurylowicz</span>:<br />
                <blockquote>"The principal question presented in this case is whether an insurer may avail itself of traditional legal and equitable remedies to avoid liability under an insurance policy on the ground of fraud in the application for insurance, when the fraud was easily ascertainable and the claimant is a third party." </blockquote></p>

                <p>Since both conditions were required for the "easily ascertainable" rule to apply, it didn&#8217;t make sense, the court wrote, for insurance companies to be on the hook to third parties for easily ascertainable fraud, but not those cases more difficult to prove.</p>

                <p>Nor was the court convinced that any statutory provision prevented the insurance company from rescinding mandatory no-fault benefits. The court ignored the limitations on cancellation outlined in <span class="case name">Kurylowicz</span> entirely, instead stating, "what coverages are required by law are simply irrelevant where the insurer is entitled to declare the policy void <em>ab initio</em>."  For there to be any protection, the court held that the legislature would have needed to expressly limit the availability of fraud defenses. Because it did not, the insurance company was allowed to rescind the policy and cut off benefits to the innocent third party.</p>

                <p><strong>Litigating Third-Party Claims Post-<em>Bazzi</em></strong><br />
                    <span class="case name">Bazzi</span> lands a major blow to plaintiffs' attorneys trying to protect third parties. Insurance companies now have no obligation to investigate possible fraud until they are faced with a claim. By the time a defendant company goes through its investigation and gets its summary disposition on the basis of fraud, it may be too late for third-party plaintiffs to refile against a different insurance company or the <a href="http://www.michacp.org/documents/MACP-Plan-of-Ops-Final.pdf">Michigan Assigned Claims Plan</a>[PDF]. This could leave injured motorists in the undesirable position of needing to bring their claims against the policy holders directly, many of whom will be simply uncollectible.</p>

                <p>To defend against these devastating summary disposition motions, trial attorneys should consider filing claims against every insurance company with a policy related to the accident. The Michigan No-Fault Act provides insurance companies a process to address priority among themselves while still protecting the injured motorist&#8217;s claims, and ensuring his or her relief isn&#8217;t delayed by industry jockeying. If the insurance company with first priority is able to rescind its plan based on fraud, the case will already be underway as to the next insurer, and no benefits will be lost due to untimely filing.</p>

                <p>At the same time, plaintiffs' lawyers should closely examine the cancellation terms of the underlying policy. Scrutinize whether the appropriate notices went out according to the statute. Look for differences in the way the policy defines legal terms of art like cancellation and rescission. This may allow protections contained elsewhere in the Michigan No-Fault Act to preserve a client's claim.</p>

                <p><span class="case name">Bazzi</span> undoubtedly made it harder to be a plaintiffs'  auto accident attorney in Michigan. It canceled out an important protection for innocent third-party motorists, and eliminated the insurance companies' duty to investigate their own policies. But that will not stop high-quality lawyers from going to bat for their clients and their families. It simply means trial attorneys will need to become more meticulous in how they do their work.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists Donnie W. Bethel and Stephen A. Cooper discuss how recent Supreme Court's decision related to the Hobbs Act only serves to further take up space and resources in the federal prisons... </p><br />
                <strong>P</strong>eople of all persuasions, political parties and philosophies have awakened to the terrible toll the crises of <a href="http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2550&context=facpubs">overcriminalization</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/nyregion/federal-judge-urges-us-to-jettison-the-madness-of-mass-incarceration.html?_r=1">mass incarceration</a> have wrought on America. </p>

                <p>Perhaps, as reported by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/nyregion/federal-judge-urges-us-to-jettison-the-madness-of-mass-incarceration.html?_r=0">The New York Times</a>, Judge Raymond J. Dearie of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn has now voiced his view of this disturbing trend better than anyone else. Judge Dearie, a former prosecutor and once the United States Attorney in Brooklyn, plaintively asked: "Why this love affair in this country with lengthy incarceration, to our great embarrassment as a civilized nation?"</p>

                <p>While not a complete answer to Judge Dearie's plea, one definite contributing factor to the problem is terrible court opinions like the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-6166_o7jp.pdf">Taylor v. United States</a> [PDF], decided June 20, 2016, by a 7-1 vote. </p>

                <p>Because of <span class="casename">Taylor</span>, more Americans, mostly minorities, will be exposed to federal prison cells for even more draconian periods of time than they are now. In <span class="casename">Taylor</span>, with the exception of (hold onto your hats) Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court gave all conscientious, sentencing-reform-minded folks&#8212;including Judge Dearie&#8212;a swift kick in the pants.</p>

                <p>As summarized by <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/taylor-v-united-states/">scotusblog.com</a>, Taylor holds that, <blockquote>"Because the Hobbs Act criminalizes robberies and attempted robberies that affect any commerce 'over which the US has jurisdiction,' the prosecution in a Hobbs Act robbery case satisfies the act's commerce element if it shows that the defendant robbed or attempted to rob a drug dealer of drugs or drug proceeds." </blockquote></p>

                <p>Distilling <span class="casename">Taylor</span> further,  <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rules-hobbs-act-applies-to-drug-robbery.php">JURIST</a> explains: <blockquote>"The Hobbs Act makes it a crime for a person to affect commerce, or to attempt to do so, by robbery. In an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, the Court found that because Congress has the power to regulate the marijuana under the Commerce Clause, Congress may also regulate drug theft.  'By targeting a drug dealer in this way, a robber necessarily affects or attempts to affect commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.'"</blockquote> Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion.  He would 'hold that the Act punishes a robbery only when the government proves that the robbery itself affected interstate commerce.'"</p>

                <p>Respectfully, we submit that in his dissent in <span class="casename">Taylor</span>, Justice Thomas is the lone Justice to get it right.  (And, one has to wonder if his position might have carried more weight&#8212;maybe even the day&#8212;had it had the backing of a still-alive, formidable and feisty, Justice Scalia).</p>

                <p>In his dissent, Justice Thomas writes: "When courts construe criminal statutes" it goes without saying that, "they must be especially careful. And when a broad reading of a criminal statute would upset federalism, courts must be more careful still."</p>

                <p>Thomas concludes that the majority opinion "fails to identify the language in the Hobbs Act that" unequivocally evidences "Congress' intention to reach the sorts of local, small-scale robberies that States traditionally prosecute."</p>

                <p>Taylor was convicted of two separate robberies of low-level marijuana dealers. The underwhelming spoils of Taylor's crimes: three cell phones, $40, some jewelry, and a marijuana cigarette&#8212;hardly, one would think, reason to invoke federal prosecution under the Hobbs Act&#8212;with each charged Hobbs Act violation exposing Taylor to up to 20 years in federal prison (where under federal sentencing law he will have to serve a minimum of 85 percent of his sentence, even with credit for good behavior). </p>

                <p>As observed by Garrett Epps in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/writ-of-fido/470868/">The Atlantic</a> ("Writ of Fido: The Supreme Court looks at how robbing a drug dealer can trip the Hobbs Act's commerce provision and bring a petty thief a lot of federal trouble," Feb. 25, 2016), "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked if the government was reaching down in this case to arbitrarily grab hold of a minor local crime: "It's very odd that this is a federal case. I mean, they&#8212;in fact, they took, what, a couple of cell phones, $40?"</p>

                <p>In 1998, evaluating a similar type case on the merits, where the two robberies at issue netted only a case of beer, a carton of cigarettes and $170 in cash from two businesses, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit - a Court not traditionally known for bending over backwards to advance defendants' rights (and, in fact, true to form, did not reverse the convictions at issue), nevertheless wrote: "the Hobbs Act was intended to address offenses with a broad impact on interstate commerce, as opposed to local robberies normally prosecuted under state law, especially petty robberies or extortions." (<em>See</em> <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/72784/united-states-v-paredes/">United States v. Paredes</a>, 139 F.3d 840, 844 (11th Cir. 1998)). </p>

                <p>While it did not help the defendant in <span class="casename">Paredes</span>, the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged what the United States Court of Appeals said two years earlier in <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/710922/united-states-v-thomas-lee-farmer/">United States v. Farmer</a>, 73 F.3d 836, 843 (8th Cir. 1996): <blockquote>"We have no doubt that Congress, when it passed the Hobbs Act, had in mind primarily offenses with a broad impact on interstate commerce, as opposed to local robberies normally prosecuted under state law."<br />
                </blockquote></p>

                <p><span class="casename">Taylor</span> guts the logic of <span class="casename">Paredes</span> and <span class="casename">Farmer</span> like yesterday's fish and opens up a Pandora's box of increased national federal prosecutions (and incarcerations) for crimes that states are more than capable of punishing without federal intervention.</p>

                <p>Considering all the missing mothers and fathers absent from their families, and especially their children's lives&#8212;languishing in federal jail cells long past the time that logic and reason would dictate&#8212;the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="casename">Taylor</span> is not just a small step in the wrong direction, it's a giant leap.</p>

                <p>One can only hope that Attorney General Loretta Lynch, whose experience tackling "<a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/236214-senate-gop-stop-the-gamesmanship-and-confirm-loretta-lynch">the over-criminalization of people of color</a>" was touted as reason for her confirmation, will make sure that her office uses the blank check of <span class="casename">Taylor</span> wisely, even-handedly, and&#8212;most importantly&#8212;sparingly. We do not need more people taking up space and scarce resources in the Federal Bureau of Prisons for stolen cell phones, trivial amounts of money, and a minuscule amount of marijuana.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username=henryj">Jessica Henry</a> of <a href="http://www.montclair.edu/">Montclair State University</a> discusses the recent additions to Louisiana's hate crime legislation...</p><strong>L</strong>ast month, Louisiana passed a "Blue Lives Matter" amendment to its hate crime statute. Under the newly-amended law, it is now a hate crime in Louisiana to target someone's "person or property" for a crime "because of actual or perceived employment as a law enforcement officer or firefighter." The definition of "law enforcement officer" under the amended law is expansive and includes active or retired law enforcement officers, peace officers, wildlife enforcement agents, correctional officers and parole and probation officers. </p>

<p>According to state Republican Senator Lance Harris, who sponsored the bill, additional measures were needed to protect state officers in Louisiana. Citing police shootings in New York and Texas, the Louisiana senator <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/24/479380240/louisiana-poised-to-expand-hate-crime-law-to-protect-police">explained</a>: "if you're going to have an extensive hate crime statute then we need to protect those that are out there protecting us on a daily basis." </p>

<p>In signing the bill, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/26/479634098/in-louisiana-its-now-a-hate-crime-to-target-police-officers">echoed these sentiments</a>: "The men and women who put their lives on the line every day, often under very dangerous circumstances are true heroes and they deserve every protection that we can give them. They serve and protect our communities and our families. The overarching message is that hate crimes will not be tolerated in Louisiana." </p>

<p>Police officers serve an incredibly important function: they protect our communities, resolve conflicts and prevent and solve crime. Policing is a challenging and difficult job. But Louisiana's leap from the premise that law enforcement officers have an important job to the conclusion that law enforcement officers need hate crime protections is largely unsupported. </p>

<p>First, Louisiana&#8212;and another 36 states&#8212;already have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/05/26/louisianas-blue-lives-matter-bill-just-became-law/?utm_term=.a6aa7ea76c91">laws that increase penalties</a> for police assaults.  In Louisiana, for instance, battery involving an officer has greater penalties than a typical battery. In states that retain the death penalty, killing a police officer can be an aggravating factor that elevates the crime to a capital case. As these laws demonstrate, attacks against officers are in many instances already punished more severely than other kinds of crimes.</p>

<p>Second, attacks against police officers, particularly lethal ones, against police officers are at their <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/05/26/louisianas-blue-lives-matter-bill-just-became-law/?utm_term=.a6aa7ea76c91">lowest rates in decades</a>. Nationally, fatal shootings of officers have decreased from an average of 127 in the 1970s to around 57 per year between 2000 and 2009. In 2015, 42 officers were fatally shot compared with 49 in 2014. In Louisiana, in 2015, there were nine officer fatalities and no officer fatalities so far this year. While even one officer shot and killed in the line of duty is tragic, there is no empirical evidence that lethal attacks, specifically targeting law enforcement officers, are on the rise. </p>

<p>Third, Louisiana's hate crime law already contained language that seemingly applied to crimes against police officers because of their occupation. Prior to the amendment, Louisiana law already provided <a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78262">enhanced punishments</a> to people who "select the victim...because of actual or perceived membership or service in, or employment with, an organization." In other words, Louisiana's hate crime law included crimes committed because of actual or perceived employment with an organization, which would likely cover crimes targeted against law enforcement.</p>

<p><em>So why the hate crime amendment?</em><br />
The first hate crime laws were enacted in the mid-1980s. Now nearly every state and the federal government has some form of hate crime law. These laws, in varying degrees, distinguish "ordinary" crime from those crimes motivated by specifically designated prejudices. Hate crime laws typically provide enhanced penalties for crimes motivated, in whole or in part, by bias or prejudice based on a victim's actual or perceived group affiliation. Some jurisdictions&#8212;including the federal government&#8212;have designated a hate crime as a separate substantive offense. Most hate crime statutes protect against groups that have historically been targets of bigotry; hate crime statutes across all states most commonly prohibit crimes based on race, religion and ethnicity. </p>

<p>Hate crime laws are popular because they send a largely symbolic governmental message that crimes motivated by certain types of bigotry will not be tolerated. As <a href="http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1557&context=faculty_scholarship">one scholar explained</a>, hate crime laws are largely perceived as expressing:</p>

<blockquote>Strong social condemnation of bias crimes...[C]ondemnation of hate crimes implies a general affirmation of the societal value of the groups targeted by hate crimes and a recognition of their rightful place in society. Hate crimes legislation is seen as reinforcing the community's commitment to equality among all citizens. </blockquote>

<p>And therein lies the rub. If hate crime laws send a message of equality and inclusion, then hate crime laws also can send messages of intolerance and exclusion.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1990 (HCSA), which requires law enforcement agencies to collect hate crimes data and report their finding to the FBI. The HCSA mandated the collection of data about hate crimes motivated by bias based on sexual orientation. But conservative senators balked at the inclusion of sexual orientation. And the only way that the HCSA was passed was with the inclusion of compromise language, insisted upon by conservative senators, including Senator Jesse Helms, which stated that "nothing in this Act shall be construed . . . to promote or encourage homosexuality." In other words, the HSCA, designed to capture the scope of hate crime in the United States, was accompanied by a governmental message of bigotry toward members of the LGBT community.   </p>

<p>This message of inclusion and exclusion continues today. Some states passed hate crime laws that include race, ethnicity and religion, but explicitly do not include sexual orientation or gender identity. And let's be clear, members of the LGBTQ community are targets of hate crimes. If the recent Orlando massacre at a gay club did not already prove that terrible truism, then just take a look at the FBI hate crime data, which shows that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/16/us/hate-crimes-against-lgbt.html?_r=0">LGBT people are twice as likely to be targeted</a> as African-Americans, and are targeted more frequently than Jews. When a state passes a hate crime law but omits sexual orientation and gender identity from its hate crime protections, a governmental message is arguably being communicated and it is not one of equality and tolerance for all.</p>

<p>The Anti-Defamation League, which helped originate the first hate crime laws and has authored model legislation that was adopted by states throughout the country, took a position against the Blue Lives Matter amendment. The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/26/us/louisiana-blue-lives-matter-law/">ADL argued</a> that hate crime laws should not include professional groups because that is not an immutable characteristic. That, too, is up for some debate, as certain states have included the category of being homeless (not immutable) or political affiliation (also not immutable) within its hate crime law parameters. Proponents of hate crime laws have expressed concern that the inclusion of characteristics such as employment dilutes the force and purpose of hate crime laws which, at least at their inception, were envisioned as protecting people who are targeted simply for being who they are. </p>

<p>The decision to include a group within a hate crime law can send a message that is more divisive than protective. Louisiana's decision to pass hate crime protections for a wide-range of law enforcement personnel seems unnecessary and superfluous given other existing state laws, and given the lack of evidence that officers are, indeed, frequent targets of hate crimes. Yet, in a state with a Republican congress and a Democratic governor who do not often agree, this bill sailed through the legislative process to passage. </p>

<p>Other states and the federal government are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/05/26/louisianas-blue-lives-matter-bill-just-became-law/?utm_term=.584e378b4cd3">considering the passage</a> of similar legislation. They would be wise to think carefully before doing so.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Lawrence-Eaker/78528924">Larry Eaker</a>, former Professor at the <a href="https://www.aup.edu">American University of Paris</a> discusses the possible legal consequences of the UK's decision to exit the EU... </p>

<blockquote>As a historian, I fear Brexit could be the beginning of the destruction not only of the EU but also of Western political civilization in its entirety.</blockquote>
<em>Donald Tusk, European Council President</em>

<p><strong>M</strong>any will consider as mere hyperbole the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36515680">statement of the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk</a>, to the effect that the United Kingdom's exit from the EU not only threatens the very existence of the EU but may, more importantly over the long term, aid in the undermining of the post-war global liberal order. However, populist and extreme nationalist political parties throughout Europe are not only succeeding in thwarting any further EU integration, but are currently gaining strength in their push to dismantle the EU and build walls between their European peoples. While this move will not, of course, at least within the near future, lead directly to all-out war between European neighbors as suffered twice in the Twentieth Century, this obsession with a return to complete sovereignty will most likely lead to a nasty "<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beggarthyneighbor.asp">beggar thy neighbor</a>" situation detrimental to the prosperity and freedoms of Europe's population. And, sadly for the many highly-educated, dynamic and cosmopolitan young people of Europe, this move by the UK threatens the loss of their cherished four freedoms as provided by the terms of the EU treaties&#8212;the free movement of goods, services, people and capital concerning relations with that great island nation.  Something their nations have painstakingly constructed since the devastation of World War II.</p>

<p>Clearly, the leaders of the EU need to be very careful and wise in handling the UK's exit from the EU; simultaneously guiding the parties along a peaceful and prosperous path to separation while providing disincentives for other EU member states from following the UK out the door. While skilled politics and diplomacy will play a great role in meeting these goals, it must be considered that a clear and efficient legal framework for withdrawal will be necessary to accomplish the task.  Unfortunately, however, the established legal framework providing for EU member state withdrawal is lacking in specifics and likely to lead to substantial legal uncertainty over an extended period of time. The now famous <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2016/577971/EPRS_BRI(2016)577971_EN.pdf">Article 50 of the Treaty of European Union</a>[PDF]&#8212;added by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009&#8212;provides for a two-year period of negotiations between the EU and the withdrawing member state from the date of filing the notice to withdraw in the hope of concluding an agreement on withdrawal. This agreement will be subject to guidelines set by the European Council's heads of state/government, without the participation of the UK leader. Pursuant to Article <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A12012E%2FTXT">218(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)</a>, the actual text will then be negotiated by the Commission and finally approved by the Council via a qualified majority vote (QMV) of 27 ministers (minus the UK), once consented to by a majority vote of the EU Parliament. Referring to <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A12012E%2FTXT">Article 238(3)(b) of the TFEU</a>, QMV in this case must include at least 72 percent of the 27 member states representing at least 65 percent of the population. No ratifications by the remaining 27 EU member states will then be required in order to bring into effect the UK-EU withdrawal treaty.</p>

<p>Should the EU and UK fail to reach an agreement on withdrawal within the two-year period, then two scenarios are possible. Either the European Council extends the negotiating period via an unanimous vote of the remaining 27 heads of state/government or the UK could decide to walk away without an agreement. In any event, the writ of EU law&#8212;both primary and secondary&#8212;will continue to apply until either an agreement is concluded or the UK walks out the door following this two-year period. It should be noted that the Court of Justice of the EU enjoys the jurisdiction to hear challenges to the legality of any such withdrawal agreement during the negotiating period lodged by either the Council, Commission, member states, or the Parliament&#8212;which could of course seriously delay the conclusion of any UK-EU agreement. In any event, it appears apparent that the world will experience a lengthy period of economic, political and legal uncertainty stemming from this Article 50 process.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Economic, Political & Legal Uncertainties&#8212;The Brexit Conundrum</strong><br />
While this Brexit is likely to spring many surprises upon the world community over this extended period, I would like to discuss three of the most likely of the economic, political and legal uncertainties that must be confronted by the EU, the UK, and the world at large once the deed is done.</p>

<p>First of all, the most troubling uncertainty facing the UK and EU over this unknown period is the final form of trade and investment relations between these parties. As the world's fifth largest economy and Europe's second largest, the UK's most important trading partner remains the EU&#8212;accounting for over <a href="http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06091#fullreport">40 percent of the UK's exports of goods and services and over 50 percent of her imports of goods and services</a>. Unlike her trade in goods, she enjoys a healthy surplus in services trade with the EU, greatly due to her strong financial services industry. Almost half of her <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukti-inward-investment-report-2014-to-2015/ukti-inward-investment-report-2014-to-2015-online-viewing">inward foreign direct investment stems from EU member states</a>, being valued in 2014 at nearly 500 billion pounds.  Thus, <a href="http://europa.eu/pol/singl/index_en.htm">three of the four famous freedoms of the EU's Internal Market</a> are of upmost importance for the new UK; i.e., the freedom of movement of goods and services, along with the capital to service this trade and investment. Most economists might agree that the free movement of persons is necessary in order to support the movements of goods, services, and capital. But this is the conundrum created by the UK's decision to abandon the EU ship&#8212;she wants to be able to enjoy the fruit of EU trade and investment, but without suffering&#8212;what her electors believe to be&#8212;the bitter burdens of the free movement of persons (especially emanating from Eastern European member states). Such attempt at so-called "cherry-picking" from the EU's plate is very likely to fail, as can be inferred from her past attempts to do such.</p>

<p>Although the UK may be successful in negotiating a unique relationship with the EU providing for the free movement of goods, services, and capital without being bound by the free movement of persons (surprise number one), it remains most likely that the UK's trade and investment relations will assume the form of one of three different existing models; to wit, the European Economic Area (EEA), Swiss, or World Trade Organization (WTO) models. It must be concluded that the <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact1_e.htm">WTO model</a>, which governs most nations trade relations with the EU (so-called "third countries"), would not satisfy the appetites of the UK's business class since it would not provide for tariff-free entry of UK goods to the EU and would be rather weak on services trade protections. It has the advantage, of course, of not impinging upon the UK's sovereign right to strictly control the right of EU citizens to work and reside in the UK. Thus, nationalism and xenophobia could trump the pocket book following the zeal expressed by many UK voters to build such barriers to free movement.</p>

<p>Most discussion of possible UK negotiating strategy has focused upon the adoption of either an EEA or Swiss model of  EU trade relations. The <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/eea/">EEA model</a>, as adopted by the <a href="http://www.efta.int/about-efta/european-free-trade-association">European Free Trade Association (EFTA) members Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland</a>, provides for the free movement of goods, services and capital but comes at a serious price&#8212;that of the free movement of persons. Ditto for the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/switzerland/">Swiss model</a>; Switzerland being a member of EFTA but not an EEA member, thus involving a multitude of bilateral treaties between the Swiss and EU parties.  In addition, both models involve the adoption of most of the famous <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/policy/glossary/terms/acquis_en.htm">EU acquis concerning the Internal Market</a>&#8212;constituting the primary and secondary law protections adopted by the EU institutions over the years&#8212;but without the right to vote thereon. Finally, and perhaps most troubling for the UK majority voters, is the fact that these non-EU members are required to contribute significant financing to the EU for this privileged access to the EU's Internal Market.</p>

<p>Therefore, it can be assumed that the UK will have extreme problems structuring their future trade and investment relations upon either the EEA or Swiss legal models. While a surprise is not out of the question, it is apparent that the EU will be very serious about imposing the free movement of persons in exchange for access to its coveted Internal Market of over 400 million persons. As proof, it should be noted that the EU has suspended negotiations with Switzerland concerning the Swiss demand to revise the existing free movement of persons agreement with the EU following their <a href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/missions/mission-eu-brussels/en/home/dossiers/personenfreizuegigkeit.html">2014 citizens' referendum imposing a constitutional amendment</a> restricting the right of foreigners to reside and work in Switzerland, including EU citizens. Importantly, the EU suspended such negotiations with Swiss authorities until the outcome of the UK referendum on EU withdrawal is known. Clearly, this was done in order not to prejudice the EU position on free movement of persons in the event the UK voted to withdraw and later demanded access to the Internal Market with no, or limited, EU citizen access to the UK. This being said, it is not out of the question that the EU might be willing to add a dose of "flexibility" to its demands for strict adhesion to free movement of persons protections&#8212;possibly with the use of a liberally drafted and applied "safeguard clause" allowing non-EU states to restrict access for EU citizens in the event of legitimate economic/labor market crisis situations (something which is at the heart of the on-going <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZkhgAoeT-jIJ:www.consilium.europa.eu/en/workarea/downloadasset.aspx%3Fid%3D40802190989+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">Swiss-EU dispute</a>).   </p>

<p>The second uncertainty concerns the possibility of a <a href="https://next.ft.com/content/d7ae7b70-361a-11e6-9a05-82a9b15a8ee7?siteedition=intl">UK constitutional crisis</a> and breakup of her constituent parts. While the referendum result is legally non-binding, the Cameron government has pledged to implement the people's decision and to request his successor to file the withdrawal notice with the European Council following the upcoming leadership change. British legal scholars are pointing out, however, that the British Parliament has the final and binding word on this issue of EU membership and measures necessary to effectuate any legal withdrawal. Thus, what happens in the event of a failure of the Parliament to ratify the people's choice?  Will there be constituted within the Parliament the necessary votes to approve the EU withdrawal and extensive implementing legislation, especially since new parliamentary elections are not likely before 2020? This is no small matter since a majority of Parliament members are in fact in favor of remaining within the EU.</p>

<p>In addition to this possible legislative crisis, the UK government has now precipitated an existential crisis of her own. By voting to secede from the EU, the people of the UK have opened the doors to their own secession debacle. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/nicola-sturgeon-new-scottish-referendum-brexit">The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon</a>, wasted no time in announcing her intention to schedule a second independence referendum in the near future&#8212;which, in light of the strong Scottish vote to remain in the EU, may well presage a breakup of the UK. She also announced the intention of the Scottish government to then seek accession to EU membership. If that's not troubling enough for the English nationalists, the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-northern-ireland-eu-referendum-result-latest-live-border-poll-united-martin-mcguinness-a7099276.html">Deputy First Minister for Northern Ireland, Martin McGuinness</a>, quickly demanded an independence referendum for the people of Northern Ireland with the eventual goal of joining the Republic of Ireland. Unfortunately for the British, they may well find themselves back in the throes of "The Troubles"&#8212;thus reaping the seeds of nationalism they have now sown in their own backyard.</p>

<p>The third uncertainty involves the UK's relations with the world at large, and the US in particular. Many third countries enjoy bilateral trade and investment treaties with the EU greatly facilitating cross-border trade and investment and securing such with effective dispute resolution methods. Thus, the UK might be facing at least the temporary loss of trade and investment protections provided by <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/accessing-markets/investment/">such EU trade and investment treaties</a> and the necessity of renegotiating the rights of UK businesses currently provided by such. Alas, the new UK may find itself at a distinct disadvantage when undertaking negotiations on these international economic relations, especially with powerful trading behemoths such as China. And while President Obama was quick to reaffirm the so-called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/world/brexit-obama.html?_r=1">US-UK "special relationship"</a> following the referendum, it must be remembered that he had warned the British before the vote that the US would not automatically place the UK at the head of the line for the conclusion of free trade agreements with non-EU states following withdrawal. Although his successor may change that position, it cannot be ignored that the US has now lost its most powerful ally in support of the proposed <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/index_en.htm">US-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a>. This TTIP agreement is already in serious trouble not only in many EU nations, but also in the US itself with the announced opposition by Donald Trump and questioning by Hillary Clinton. Thus, it looks as if the UK's trade and investment position with the US will be held in limbo for an extended period of time= &#8212;possibly longer than that necessary to reestablish trading relations with the EU. This does not portend well for US trade between, and investment within, a go-it-alone UK, essentially threatening the current use of the UK as an entry point into the EU Internal Market <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-usa-idUSKCN0Z826X">(with over $550 billion in US foreign direct investment settled in the UK)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Tying Up the Loose Ends of European Disintegration&#8212;Dismantling the UK's Participation within the Common Agricultural/Fisheries/Transport/Competition & Foreign-Security Policies&#8212;Not to Mention the Harmonization of Product Standards & Environmental/Health/Human Rights Protections</strong></p>

<p>While I was able to discuss three of the most obvious and important of the economic, political and legal uncertainties facing the UK following its momentous decision to leave the EU, it remains obvious that this divorce is going to create a Everest-high mountain of legal and regulatory uncertainties concerning the emerging UK stripped of over 50 years of EU acquis.  New UK laws will be needed to either readopt, abandon or modify the treaty provisions and hundreds of EU directives and regulations impacting her agricultural, fisheries, and transport industries. The UK's trade with the EU will of course be subject to existing EU product standards, environmental and health protections, and strict application of her competition policy. And, quite obviously considering the serious threats posed by Russian expansion and the Syria/Iraq wars, it will remain in the UK's best interest to maintain close relations and coordination with the <a href="http://europa.eu/pol/cfsp/index_en.htm">EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy</a>= &#8212;something that will not escape the watchful eye of other NATO members.</p>

<p>Finally, it should be noted that there exists a strong probability that any new conservative government in the UK, especially if closely in tune (or even aligned with) the nationalist parties, may well move to renounce the UK's accession to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">1950 European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and submittal to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights (EctHR)</a>&#8212;as now required by EU membership. Even David Cameron himself&#8212;not one known to be a rabid nationalist&#8212;has in the recent past <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/jun/03/cameron-refuses-to-rule-out-leaving-european-convention-on-human-rights">questioned the continued UK adherence to the ECHR</a> following several highly contentious EctHR decisions concerning the human rights protections enjoyed by alleged terrorists on UK soil.</p>

<p>By way of conclusion, I would like to mention the slight possibility that a new UK government may in the end thwart the people's will as expressed in the referendum by withholding the filing of any Article 50 withdrawal notification while using the threat of such as a powerful bargaining chip in the upcoming negotiations (surprise number two). And, it is not out of the question that a new British government may schedule another referendum on EU membership should she be able to work out another, more flexible relationship with the EU (surprise number three).  If she does in fact leave, let me sincerely wish my UK friends a smooth and prosperous national transition free from the constraints of EU membership. I can only hope that this divorce turns out to be amicable and advantageous for all parties concerned&#8212;especially for our children and grandchildren. But, unfortunately, such a positive outcome remains highly uncertain.</p>

		<title>When Prosecutors Parade, Criminal Justice Becomes a Circus</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists Stephen Cooper and Donnie W. Bethel discuss the effect of the behavior of Prosecutors who parade their cases to the media has on the Criminal Justice system... </p><br />
                <strong>C</strong>all us 'old school', but like the Honorable Scott Milne Matheson, Jr. put it, "lawyers, especially prosecutors, should not in [our] judgment, 'try their cases in the press.'"</p>

                <p>In 1990, Judge Matheson, then a distinguished law professor (who would later serve as the United States Attorney for Utah, before being appointed to serve as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit) made this statement in his 75-page law review article about the problem of "extrajudicial public comment from prosecutors." </p>

                <p>Judge Matheson bemoaned back then that this disturbing "<a href="http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2878&context=flr">phenomenon appears to be on the rise</a>."[PDF] </p>

                <p>Sadly, 26 years later, the problem of prosecutors unethically pandering and parading their cases before the press is more than just 'a rising phenomenon'&#8212;it's metastasized into full-blown cancer.  </p>

                <p>Prosecutors routinely call conferences to vet prosecution evidence under the glow of the media's klieg lights&#8212;as occurred in the much-publicized Brendan Dassey and Steven Avery case in Netflix's Making A Murderer&#8212;tainting the jury pool and infringing on Avery and Dassey's constitutional right to a fair trial (as ably reported upon earlier this year in John Ferak's column, &#8220;<a href="http://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/local/steven-avery/2016/01/15/kratzs-pretrial-behavior-called-unethical/78630248/">Legal experts blast Avery prosecutor's conduct.</a>&#8221;)</p>

                <p>The same questionable litigation tactics, dressed up in federal garb, are on full display in Jeffrey Toobin's May 9 <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/09/the-man-who-terrifies-wall-street">article</a> in The New Yorker, appropriately called, "The Showman," about United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara's infatuation with and misuse of the media.</p>

                <p>Moreover, should you still not be convinced about the magnitude of this problem, take a look at the official statement the Monroe County Prosecutor's Office in Bloomington, Indiana, <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/fox59/2016/06/27/monroe-county-prosecutor-frustrated-ex-iu-students-plea-deal-rape-cases/86436532/">provided</a> to the Indianapolis Star on Monday, June 27, following the plea agreement in the case of <u><a href="http://fox59.com/2016/06/27/prosecutors-office-explains-plea-deal-in-rape-cases-involving-former-Indiana-university-student/">Indiana versus John Enoch</a></u>.</p>

                <p>Enoch, a former Indiana University student, had been charged in two separate rape cases that suffered from massive evidentiary problems&#8212;the kind of problems that defense lawyers rightly call "reasonable doubt."  To resolve both cases, Enoch pled guilty to "battery with moderate bodily injury," and was eventually sentenced to one day in jail and one year of probation.</p>

                <p>Worrying about a public firestorm and clearly feeling the searing public scrutiny such cases can bring&#8212;<u>exhibit A</u>: the highly-charged sentencing of convicted Stanford rapist <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/06/us/sexual-assault-brock-turner-stanford/">Brock Turner</a>&#8212;the Monroe County Prosecutor's Office provided the Indianapolis Star a full official statement defending its decision to resolve Enoch's cases by way of a plea.</p>

                <p>The defensive, four-paragraph statement details evidence and legal arguments against Enoch in a major newspaper for all to see&#8212;and is so one-sided that Enoch's defense attorney felt compelled to respond with her own statement, also reprinted in full by the <em>Star</em>.</p>

                <p>One hundred and ninety-five (195) years ago, in 1821, the Supreme Court of the Unites States declared in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/19/204/case.html">Anderson v. Dunn</a>: <blockquote>"[C]ourts of justice are universally acknowledged to be vested . . . with power to impose silence, respect and decorum in their presence . . . and as a corollary to this proposition, to preserve themselves and their officers from the approach and insults of pollution."</blockquote>  Sadly, we've wandered a long way from this ideal. </p>

                <p>Nowadays when reading about legal cases in the news&#8212;even after a criminal case is complete&#8212;one can't help but observe that the 'insults of pollution' fly like spitballs in high school, littering our local and national press.</p>

                <p><br />
                    <em>Stephen Cooper worked as a DC public defender between 2003 and 2012 and as an assistant federal public defender in Alabama between 2012 and 2015.  He has contributed to numerous magazines and newspapers in the United States and overseas.  He writes full-time and lives in Woodland Hills, California. Donnie W. Bethel has litigated criminal cases as a prosecutor and a defense attorney for over 26 years in military courts-martial and in federal court, where he now practices as an assistant federal public defender in Alabama.</em></p>

		<title>Potential Legal Consequences of Mexico&#039;s Initiative to Legalize Same-Sex Marriage</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Colomnist <a href="https://cdp-hrc.uottawa.ca/en/people/jasa-silveira-graciela">Graciela Jasa Silveira</a> discusses potential legal and constitutional consequences as a result of Mexican President Peña Nieto's initiatives to support same-sex family rights...</p><strong>M</strong>exican <a href="http://en.presidencia.gob.mx/presidencia/presidente/">President Enrique Peña Nieto</a> made public two <a href="http://www.senado.gob.mx/sgsp/gaceta/63/1/2016-05-18-1/assets/documentos/Ini_Art4_Cons_Ejecutivo_Fed.pdf">bills </a> [PDF, in Spanish] to make-constitutional the right to marriage, and to amend federal family law to guarantee same-sex partners access to marriage and adoption on May 17. This is unquestionably an important event. If successful, the initiatives will legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, and have major effects on same-sex families in relation to a number of different public benefits regulated exclusively, or in part, by federal law (like labor, immigration, general health, federal crimes, among many others).</p>

                <p>However, the fact is that while proponents of marriage equality may cheer over the presidential initiatives, the initiatives also raise issues of profound constitutional and policy significance. First among these is the issue of federal legislative power in the family law domain. There is no such explicit federal power pertaining to marriage. Mexico, like the US, has a federal government. While the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm">US Constitution</a> enumerates certain powers for the federal government, responsibility for marriage and family issues is not among them, as this is an area of law reserved to states as part of their residual powers. Yet, the Mexico bills are controversial because they reflect a long-standing trend to federalize family law in Mexico. Historically, family law was codified exclusively at the local level by each individual state. However, since late 1800&#8217;s there has been concerted attempts by the federal government to centralize family law while preserving the authority of individual states to legislate in this matter. These measures include the enactment and maintenance of the federal civil code which Peña Nietos&#8217; bill aims to amend when jurist have long regarded this code as fundamentally incompatible with our constitutional system. This initiative can best be characterized as an attempt at relaunching the federal government&#8217;s role in steering national family law policy, which lost its influence after the year 2000 when Mexico City became a trailblazer of LGBT and women&#8217;s rights. </p>

                <p>The least controversial part of Peña Nietos&#8217; bill, the extension of including of the right to marriage in the constitution, also requires reconsideration. Many queer activists and scholars have relentlessly critiqued same-sex marriage advocacy. They have noted that the use of marriage as a reference point to advance LGBT rights has entailed prioritizing of the marital norm and orthodox gendered roles while doing little to advance the needs of the larger LGBT community, and of rights of families living outside of marriage. Thus, while the bill may pave the way for a culmination of LGBT advocacy, the question is still whether this progressive initiative will actually materialize into something much more meaningful that directs family law away from heterosexual and gendered family models.   </p>

                <p>The over-focus on same-sex marriage by the media has also missed some important provisions in the proposed legislation, where inter-state divisions are perhaps more legitimate: the elimination of no-fault divorce. While no-fault divorce has long been available in Mexico, only a few Mexican states have moved to eliminate fault-based divorce from their civil codes. However, no public debate has preceded this initiative, and it is not accompanied with a reform package to the address the issue of gender-related power differentials in divorce, as well as its negative economic impact on the main custodial parent, typically the mother.  It is a well-known fact that parents face a number of complex barriers in obtaining and enforcing a support order in Mexico. Family court users in Mexico have cited problems with obtaining agreement with respect to financial and custody issues, and have also expressed concern over the lack of support warranties in the use of voluntary judicial divorce. This is a vital problem considering that women-initiated support claims make up almost 40 percent of the family court's work. </p>

                <p>Additionally, there are also distinctive socio-economic issues affecting support recovery in Mexico. It is impossible or very difficult to enforce or guarantee support payments when parents work under informal work schemes, do not have property, or live and work illegally in the US (which is increasingly the case). These limits to support recovery negatively impact mothers who retain custody of their children, and thus have to devise ways to offset the would-be financial support and care-taking efforts of the absent parent. The shift in favor of no-fault divorce has made it more difficult for women to use divorce as a process to protect themselves from economic or physically abusive husbands while securing their status as primary family care-takers. This problem is very important if one considers that in Mexico, unlike Canada and the US, there are no government programs designed to facilitate access to spousal or child support to offset child rearing expenses. Nonetheless, it is ironic that Peña Nietos has made the move to essentially establish no-fault divorce as the law of the land, despite the concerted movement within US courts and legislatures seeking to counteract unilateral divorce laws, and its potential negative effect on families.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Stephen Cooper, a former DC public defender discusses how California's Proposition 66 will fail to reform California's fractured death penalty system... </p><br />
                "<strong><a href="http://www.deathpenaltyreform.com">C</strong>alifornians for Death Penalty Savings and Reform</a>"&#8212;an advocacy group spearheaded by district attorneys and several family members of murder victims&#8212;has collected enough signatures to qualify the <a href="http://deathpenaltyreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2016-Initiative-Final-10.20.15.pdf">"Death Penalty Reform and Savings Act of 2016"</a>[PDF] for placement on the November 8 ballot. On July 1, California's Secretary of State officially certified the measure, issuing it a number, "Proposition 66." The group claims this initiative will "reform" California's fractured death penalty and "speed up" executions in our state where currently <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/capital_punishment/docs/condemnedinmatelistsecure.pdf">748</a> [PDF] men and women wait to die. </p>

                <p>On the other side of the issue is "Justice That Works," lead by Mike Farrell, the actor who starred in MASH, a longstanding death penalty abolitionist and internationally renowned human rights activist. Joining Mr. Farrell are an impressive array of politicians from across the political spectrum, religious leaders, attorneys, writers, artists&#8212;and just like the Californians for Death Penalty Savings and Reform group&#8212; influential law enforcement groups and the family members of murder victims. They too secured enough signatures to qualify proposed new legislation, Proposition 62, &#8220;<a href="http://www.justicethatworks.org">The Justice That Works Act of 2016</a>,&#8221; for the November 8 ballot. Proposition 62, they say, would: <strong>(1) </strong>replace the death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of parole; <strong>(2)</strong> require death row inmates to work and pay wages to their victims&#8217; families; and <strong>(3)</strong> save California taxpayers a projected 150 million dollars a year.</p>

                <p>With these basics in mind about the grave and complicated choice Californians are soon to make&#8212;a decision  that will greatly influence the continued existence of the death penalty in America&#8212;I respectfully submit that, despite its fanfare, Proposition 66 is no "Eureka!" moment for Californians. Instead, unlike carpenter James Wilson Marshall's historic discovery of gold at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in 1848, Proposition 66's proposed turbo-charging of California's "machinery of death" is, underneath its sheen, twenty-four carat fool's gold.</p>

                <p>Out of the gate it needs saying that this "speedy death penalty" initiative, if it were to become law, would do absolutely nothing to reduce the current massive backlog of condemned state prisoners to whom it could not retroactively be applied without a long, bruising, legally dubious and extremely expensive fight. </p>

                <p>Perhaps of equal or greater importance, voters need to remember that, when we talk about a &#8220;backlog&#8221; of death row inmates, we are not talking about curtailing an exploding population of coyotes. We are talking about a population of human beings, many of whom suffer from <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/death-penalty/us-death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-and-mental-illness">serious mental illness, a frequent byproduct of a childhood where poverty, abuse, violence, and neglect were the norm</a>. Moreover, it bears noting that in order to clear this "backlog" of 748 souls, California would have to execute a person a day&#8212;every day, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays&#8212;for more than two years. </p>

                <p>If ushered into law, Proposition 66, intended to rev up California's "machinery of death" to similar macabre-type output, would do anything but. Not only would it deprive Californians of their rightful seat at the table of civilized, just and peaceful people around the world&#8212;whose countries long ago rejected capital punishment&#8212;it would result in a flurry of even more death penalty appeals (sucking money from voters' wallets and exhausted state coffers at a faster clip than wildfire burns).</p>

                <p><strong>Here are just three of the more obvious cataclysmically-bad provisions in the initiative:</strong><br />
                    <strong>1. </strong>The proposed law would &#8220;require attorneys who are qualified for appointment to the most serious non-capital appeals and who meet the qualifications for capital appeals to accept appointment in capital cases as a condition for remaining on the court&#8217;s appointment list&#8221;; this provision will open a floodgate of new ineffective assistance of counsel cases due to an increased number of incompetent, unqualified, and/or improperly trained lawyers taking death penalty cases&#8212;some motivated solely by financial need. </p>

                <p>Forcing lawyers to take cases they otherwise would not is death penalty proponents' wrongheaded way of addressing the fact that there are not enough willing and qualified lawyers in California to take these kinds of cases&#8212;the most difficult, emotional, time-intensive, resource-draining cases our legal system has. Clearly the logical answer is not the forced conscription of lawyers in these, the most serious of cases.      </p>

                <p><strong>2.</strong> The initiative's express language seeks to snatch the independence the law currently gives <a href="http://www.hcrc.ca.gov">California's Habeas Corpus Resource Center (HCRC)</a> to decide which attorneys are qualified to represent death row inmates in postconviction proceedings; specifically, the proposed language of the bill provides "that the final determination of whether to include an attorney in the roster shall be made by the Supreme Court and not delegated to the center."  </p>

                <p>The first of many problems with this provision is it constitutes a <em>per se</em> violation of <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/2011_build/death_penalty_representation/2003guidelines.authcheckdam.pdf">Guideline 3.1.B of the 2003 American Bar Association's (ABA) Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases</a>[PDF]. The ABA Guidelines are standards established by a blue-ribbon panel of experts in the capital defense arena including lawyers, judges, scientists, think tanks, and many other accomplished individuals and organizations. Guideline 3.1.B very explicitly makes clear that the HCRC "should be independent of the judiciary <em>and it, and not the judiciary</em> or elected officials, should select lawyers for specific cases."</p>

                <p>Second, it is hard to see this provision as anything but a desire by death penalty proponents to punish the HCRC for its long-standing and effective efforts advocating for the condemned&#8212;such as its litigation before United States District Court Judge Cormac Carney&#8212;leading to Judge Carney's ruling in <span class="casename">Jones v. Chappell</span>. (In that heralded case, Judge Carney vacated the death sentence of Ernest Dewayne Jones declaring <a href="http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/CarneyOrder.pdf">"California's Death Penalty System Unconstitutional"</a>[PDF] because it is arbitrary, it serves no penological purpose, and it violates the Constitution.  Judge Carney's order was subsequently overruled on procedural grounds, and not on the merits, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.)</p>

                <p>The insertion of this vindictive-minded provision, which does nothing but hurt the quality of California justice, underscores why the bill as a whole is not reform-centric and should be defeated.      </p>

                <p><strong>3.</strong> The bill arbitrarily ramps up filing periods and adjudication timetables for death row appeals and postconviction motions when more and more states&#8212;including California, which in 2012 lead the nation in <a href="http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/news/california-leads-nation-exonerations-wrongfully-convicted">exonerations of wrongfully convicted citizens</a>, are realizing the horrific mistakes caused by a rush to justice atmosphere these new deadlines would duplicate. (As just one of many examples of what can happen when there is a rush to judgment in the death penalty context, take the case in which <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/02/scalia-death-penalty_n_5756362.html">&#8220;Scalia Once Pushed Death Penalty For Now-Exonerated Inmate Henry Lee McCollum.&#8221;</a>)</p>

                <p>To sum up, the choice voters have to make in November&#8212;one that goes to the core of who we are as Californians&#8212;Proposition 66, the "Death Penalty Reform and Savings Act of 2016," is a wolf in sheep's clothing; it would yield no savings, and it does not reform. Reform and savings will only be realized when California's barbaric, antiquated, and failed experiment with the death penalty, ends. For this reason, and for many others, Californians would do much, much better to vote for Proposition 62, "<a href="http://www.justicethatworks.org">The Justice That Works Act of 2016</a>."  </p>

		<title>Egypt&amp;apos;s New Cybercrime Law: Another Legislative Failure</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/faculty-staff/profile.cfm?Id=607">Mohamed Abdelaal</a> of McKinney School of Law and Alexandria School of Law discusses the significance of Egypt's new cybercrime draft law... </p><strong>O</strong>n May 10, 2016, the Egyptian House of Representatives began to consider a new 33-article <a href="http://www.elwatannews.com/news/details/1163831">cybercrime draft law</a>[In Arabic] where a number of government officials, including representatives from the Defense and Interior Ministries, were invited to share their comments on the bill before being put to a pending parliamentary vote. The move came after MP Tamer El-Shahawy, a former military intelligence general, submitted the draft law for the legislative house for its consideration. According to the MP, his motion in suggesting the draft law was urged by a desire to criminalize electronic criminal practices, mail fraud and the establishment of websites promoting terrorism or the transfer of information.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that El-Shahawy's motive seems benign, the draft law possesses a serious threat to fundamental individual rights and freedoms, rule of law, and the freedom of information&#8212;to the extent that the law was heavily criticized by human rights organizations and political activists in Egypt&#8212;that is no more than an attempt to widen the government grip to suppress individual rights and freedoms. However, the draft law has been praised by MPs affiliated with the government, as well as pro-government TV shows, that it will help in fighting terrorism and lessen the severity of the security insurgency that is widely witnessed in the country. </p>

<p><strong>Below, I provide my analysis to some of the most controversial articles in Egypt's new cybercrime draft law.</strong><br />
Firstly, Article 11 punishes by imprisonment of no less than three (3) years and a fine of no less than 100,000 Egyptian pounds (equivalent to $11,250) for, "[t]he establishment of a website with the aim to promote the commission of any crime stipulated in the Penal Code or any of the State's special laws." According to one of Egypt's special laws, <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/87375.aspx">the Public Protest Law of 2013</a>, which regulates the act of protest and classifies it as a crime if committed without the permission of the competent authorities, and is punished by sentences from one year. Reading this law together with Article 11 of the cybercrime draft law reveals that, under the latter, inciting to protest could be a more serious crime than protesting itself. In other words, pursuant to Article 11, the establishment of a website to incite to protest could be punished by up to three years in prison and a fine of no less than 100,000 Egyptian pounds.  Conversely, pursuant to 2013 Public Protest Law, those who actually protest without the approval of the authorities could be sent to only one year in prison.</p>

<p>Secondly, Article 23, asserts that, <blockquote>"whoever commits any crime mentioned in this act with the aim of harming public order; endangering safety and security or society; endangering the life and security of citizens; preventing authorities from undertaking their duties; suspending the Constitution, laws or regulations; harming national unity or societal peace; defaming a heavenly religion; and assaulting rights and freedoms enshrined by the Constitution could face either life imprisonment or aggravated imprisonment." </blockquote><br />
In fact, this article failed to achieve one of the most important goals of any punitive legislation; that is that the criminal conduct must be unequivocally determined. More precisely, Article 23 committed the same mistake done by Egypt's most punitive legislations such as, the Public Protest Law of 2013 and the <a href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/EgyptSource/Egypt_Anti-Terror_Law_Translation.pdf">Anti-Terrorism Law of 2015</a>[PDF], when it deliberately calls for a criminal sanction in the event of a violation or a threat to some used loose terms like "public order," "national unity," and "societal peace." Moreover, the article failed to provide a precise definition to these terms or even to provide any guidance on what is exactly meant by these loose terms. Accordingly, citizens are likely to be subjected to the harsh criminal sanctions listed in the article based on the speculations of the authorities regarding the meaning of these loose terms&#8212;a situation that really hurts two of the most enshrined constitutional principles. Needless to say that the conduct of the article in using loose and vague standards in determining the content of a given crime significantly hurts two of the most enshrined constitutional norms; the principles of legality and legal certainty as asserted in <a href="http://www.sis.gov.eg/Newvr/Dustor-en001.pdf">Article 95 of Egypt's Constitution of 2014</a>[PDF].</p>

<p>Apart from the loose and sweeping-broad terms used by Article 23, the article sets a sanction of either life imprisonment or aggravated imprisonment for defaming a heavenly religion. However, pursuant to <a href="http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/Egypt/criminal-code.pdf">Article 98(f) of the Penal Code of 1937</a>[PDF], as amended by Law 147/2006, blasphemy is a crime that should be punished by "imprisonment for a period of no less than six months and not exceeding five years, or a fine of no less than five hundred pounds and not exceeding one thousand pounds."</p>

<p>A careful reading of Article 23 of the Cybercrime Law and Article 98(f) of the Penal Code reveals that these two laws are criminalizing a broadening swath of the blasphemy by applying a double standard. That is, according to Article 23 of the Cybercrime Law, the crime of blasphemy could earn its perpetrator either a life sentence or aggravated imprisonment if committed online. However, the same crime is punished by either a five-year imprisonment or a fine if committed anywhere else.</p>

<p>Another controversial provision is that of Articles 12 and 13 of the draft law, which punish information technology systems managers with a term of imprisonment that could reach three years and a fine up to 200,000 Egyptian pounds ($22,660) if they failed report or to take reasonable precautions regarding a successful cyber attack on the information system or the email they managed. In fact, these two articles are poorly drafted since they render the work of the information technology systems managers at stake by not providing any guidance on what kind of reasonable precautions should be taken. Further, the two articles render the work of the IT managers a crime in certain cases.</p>

<p>All things considered, a careful reading of Egypt's cybercrime law draft reveals the fact that it is no more than an attempt to grant the authorities a reason to crack down on individual rights and freedoms. It is worth noting that the military background of the MP Tamer El-Shahawy, the proposer of the law, provides a valid reason on why the draft law's primary goal is to extend the government grip. It looks like this military background failed Mr. El-Shahawy to acknowledge the fact that freedom of speech and expression is the most cherished value obtained by the Egyptians after two uprisings that toppled two defiant regimes in 2011 and 2013 respectively. That is, this law will target political activists and dissenters who let their views and thoughts out online by restricting their freedom of expression and rendering them vulnerable to criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>Above all, the Cybercrime draft law highlights one of Egypt's most suffered problems when it comes to punitive legislations. Precisely, as mentioned above, laws like the Penal Code of 1937, the Public Protest Law of 2013, and the Anti-terrorism Law of 2015 could serve the same purpose the Cybercrime Law of 2016 intends to serve in criminalizing terrorism, acts that endanger public order and social security, blasphemy, and unauthorized protest. That being said, Egypt Cybercrime Law could be regarded as legislative redundancy.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/contributing/2016/scotus/ross.php">Contributing Editor William G. Ross</a> of the Cumberland School of Law at Samford University discusses Justice Ruth B. Ginsburg's open public opinion concerning Trumps' candidacy for presidency... </p><strong>S</strong>ince justices during recent years have been increasingly uninhibited about making extrajudicial comments about a wide range of subjects, it was perhaps only a matter of time before a justice would deliver a barbed opinion about a presidential candidate. It is somewhat surprising, however, that the Justice who crossed over this line was <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, who has been a model of dignity and decorum throughout her twenty-three years on the Supreme Court, even though she sometimes has not been shy about making public comments about judicial issues that would have been regarded as indiscreet by the standards of a generation ago.</p>

<p>In an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/us/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-no-fan-of-donald-trump-critiques-latest-term.html?_r=0">interview published in The New York Times on July 10</a>, Ginsburg declared that, <blockquote>"I can't imagine what this place would be&#8212;I can't imagine what the country would be&#8212;with Donald Trump as our president. For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be&#8212;I don't even want to contemplate that."</blockquote> Ginsburg also reportedly said that the prospect of a Trump presidency reminded her of what her late husband, Martin D. Ginsburg, might have said: "Now it's time for us to move to New Zealand." On the following day, she told CNN that Trump was a "faker" who had "no consistency about him" and "really has an ego." </p>

<p>Extra-judicial comments by justices about controversial public issues are fraught with danger to the court's institutional integrity insofar as they feed public perceptions that the court's decisions are unduly politicized. Justices therefore should speak out about such issues only when they have a unique contribution to make. Ginsburg's comments were particularly inappropriate because they were so superfluous. Ginsburg said nothing that countless other Americans have not said or thought, and her remarks provided absolutely no insights based upon her perspective as a Justice. The classic example of the manner in which a member of court can provide a useful public service by providing such an insight occurred in <a href="https://historyitm.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/coates.pdf">1937, when Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes publicly demolished President Franklin Roosevelt's contention that he needed to "pack" the Court with six more Justices</a> [PDF] because the mostly geriatric Justices were having trouble staying abreast of their workload. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Hughes explained that the workload of the justices was not burdensome and that an increase in justices could actually decrease the court's efficiency. Hughes needed to speak out because literally no one in the nation was in a better position to blow the whistle on the speciousness of FDR's pretext for packing the court with justices who were more amenable to sustaining the constitutionality of the <a href="http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/new-deal/resources/new-deal-legislation">New Deal legislation</a>.</p>

<p>Ginsburg's comment was also ill-advised because it could provide a predicate for a recusal motion in cases involving the Trump Administration or Trump himself if Trump were elected. Justices often need to rule upon the actions of Presidents&#8212;a notable example occurred only last month when the court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-texas/">adjudicated the constitutionality of Obama's executive order</a> to bar the deportation of millions of persons who are in the United States illegally. It is not clear that Ginsburg's off-hand comments would necessarily mean that her "impartiality might reasonably be questioned," as required by the federal judicial recusal statute, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/455">28 U.S.C. sec. 455</a>. Moreover, Ginsburg would not be compelled against her will to withdraw from a case under any circumstances because Justices are judges of their own cases on recusal motions. Any recusal motion, however, distracts busy justices from important tasks, and Ginsburg's refusal to recuse herself in a case involving a Trump Administration might stoke already widespread smoldering suspicions about the politicization of the court. If she were to recuse herself, the court would lose the assistance of one of its members, which is ironic because Ginsburg seemed to suggest in her interview that the court is disadvantaged at the present time because it lacks nine members. The loss of Ginsburg's participation in any case would be an especially unfortunate loss because Ginsburg is such a particularly wise, able and seasoned justice.   </p>

<p>Even if the public could somehow benefit from knowing Ginsburg's views about a Trump presidency, her remarks were unnecessary because hardly anyone who knows anything about Ginsburg&#8212;and Trump&#8212;could imagine that the chances that Ginsburg would support Trump were more than about one in ten thousand. The voting preferences of most justices always have been easy to discern. Throughout the court's history, most justices have been closely identified with a particular political party before their appointment. Until fifty years ago, many justices were active in partisan politics, often as office-holders, until they ascended the bench. Until the 1970s, some justices were close political advisors and friends of presidents.</p>

<p>It is ironic that justices have increased their public comments at the very time that they have become less actively involved in politics. Since the 1970s, justices have much more often given speeches and interviews, written books and articles, taught law school courses, and participated in seminars. Their increasingly frequent public comments about various public issues have helped to de-mystify the court and have provided it with a more human face that makes its work more comprehensible to non-lawyers. Such knowledge and understanding can help to enhance public respect for the court and also inspire constructive criticism. Comments by justices that seem overtly political or partisan, however, can fuel the public perception that the court is no more than a political institution and that judicial decisions are dictated by&#8212;rather than merely influenced&#8212;the political predilections of the justices and that judicial decisions may, in some instances, even be overtly partisan.</p>

<p>The perils of extra-judicial speech illustrated some of the other comments that Ginsburg made in the same interview in which she deplored the prospect of a Trump presidency. For example, she seemed to suggest that the Senate has a constitutional duty to vote on President Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to serve on the court. Although this comment is much more within the range of propriety than her comment about Trump since it more directly involves the court, there was no apparent need for it because Ginsburg had no fresh or unique insight, but rather merely echoed what numerous constitutional scholars already have said.</p>

<p>Ginsburg also seemed to suggest that the court was short-handed with only eight members, which is a more appropriate remark because it is based upon personal experience, although even this seems superfluous since there is universal understanding that the court functions better with a full complement of nine members. Moreover, this suggestion could be interpreted as a partisan slap at Senate Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination.</p>

<p>Ginsburg's reminder in the interview that presidential elections can have long-term influence on the court was similarly superfluous, albeit more innocuous, since this fact is a truism, and there are plenty of Democrats and Republicans who are already rousing voters with reminders of the election's likely impact on the court. These reminders will only become louder as the election draws closer.</p>

<p>In other comments during the interview, Ginsburg briefly explained some of her thoughts about the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/whole-womans-health-v-cole/">deportation case</a> and the Court's decision striking down two of Texas's restrictions on abortion clinics. Although justices  generally should refrain from explaining their decisions since they have ample opportunity to explain themselves in their official decisions, and because extra-judicial comment can blur the meaning of such decisions, Ginsburg's comments about these decisions were innocuous. Similarly harmless was her expression of hope that the court would overturn its controversial campaign finance decision, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/">Citizens United</a>, and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dc-v-heller/">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>, recognizing an individual right to own firearms. Since she dissented in both cases, her views already were well known. Although her comments were therefore superfluous, they do not seem likely to feed fears that the court is unduly partisan.</p>

<p>Perhaps Ginsburg's most appropriate extra-judicial remark in the interview was her praise for Chief Justice John Roberts during the court's most recent term: "He had a hard job. I think he did it quite well." Here, Ginsburg made a genuine contribution to public discourse by disclosing an opinion based upon close personal observation. A more critical comment would have been more questionable since Justices generally should try to refrain from public discussions of intra-Court discord. Airing dirty judicial linen is likely only to exacerbate such tensions and interfere with the court's work.</p>

<p>A candid and honest person, Ginsburg is a natural educator and she has strived successfully as a justice to make the court more accessible to the mass of Americans. In any extra-judicial comments, however, justices must take care to avoid even the appearance of partisanship. Ginsburg's comments breached that barrier. Although Ginsburg's remarks probably did no serious harm to the Court's prestige, they should serve as a warning to justices to be more discreet in their public pronouncements, particularly in unguarded and unrehearsed interviews.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.wfu.edu/faculty/profile/chavisk/">Kami N. Chavis</a> of <a href="http://law.wfu.edu/">Wake Forest University School of Law</a> discusses the recent proposals to add police officers to hate crime statutes...</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>n May, the state of Louisiana enacted a law that would make it hate crime to target <a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78262">police, EMS personnel, and firefighters</a>. In light of the recent massacre in Dallas, other states may rush to enact similar legislation that adds police as a protected class to existing hate crimes legislation. Policymakers should resist the temptation to enact this similar legislation, as a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2027632">symbolic gesture</a> of solidarity with police officers. Protecting police officers is an important goal. Expanding the class of protected individuals to include police officers, however, subverts <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2016/07/08/killing-a-cop-is-a-horrible-crimebut-its-not-a-hate-crime">the purpose of traditional hate crimes legislation</a> which is to protect historically marginalized groups from being targeted based on characteristics such as race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identify.</p>

<p>On July 7, 2016, Micah Xavier Johnson perpetrated an unspeakable act when he fatally shot five police officers and injured seven others as they protected peaceful demonstrators in Dallas, Texas. Johnson <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/08/us/philando-castile-alton-sterling-protests/">told negotiators</a> he initiated the attack because he "wanted to kill white people," and citing recent police shootings, Johnson also said he wanted to "kill police officers." This tragedy came only days after the nation was reeling from the fatal police shooting of Alton Sterling, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, which were the events that inspired the protestors to demonstrate in downtown Dallas. Had Johnson survived to face prosecution, his statement that he wanted to "kill white people" would likely be enough evidence to prove he was motivated by racial bias and would subject him to a prosecution of a hate crime in <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/texas/2005/cr/001.00.000042.00.html">many states</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/249">under federal law</a>. His targeting of police officers, however, might subject him to enhanced penalties, but would not be prosecuted as a "hate crime" in most jurisdictions because police officers currently are not a protected class under the federal hate crimes statute nor under most state statutes. Prior to the Dallas incident, however, there have been federal and state bills introduced that would make targeted violence against police officers hate crimes.  In the wake of the tragedy, there is likely to be a strong push for such laws, but for the reasons outlined below, adding police officers as a protected class is a misguided way to demonstrate solidarity in the wake of the Dallas tragedy.</p>

<p>These efforts to expand hate crimes statutes should fail for several reasons. First, adding officers as a protected class is unnecessary because <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-57/">many jurisdictions already have enhanced penalties</a> for those committing violent acts against police officers or interfering with their official duties. Second, while protecting police officers against those who would target them is an important goal, the Louisiana law and other recent proposal do not appear to be based on legitimate goals to protect police, but many critics see them as thinly veiled backlashes to recent calls for police reform. Viewed as such, these laws could be far more detrimental to building the trust and strengthening relations between police officers and the communities, which are past the tipping point. Such laws are inextricably linked to the widespread public protests in response to the recent spate of high profile deaths at the hands of police.  The videotaped death of Eric Garner at the hands of police and the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, as well as aggressive police tactics that police used to confront peaceful protestors in the wake of Brown's death, are widely referenced as the catalyst for the current calls for criminal justice reform.  Immediately following these events, several other high-profile police-involved deaths of unarmed black people, including Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and Walter Scott, many criminal justice advocates called for widespread reforms in the criminal justice system, with a particular emphasis on policing reform. Just as the individual officers who committed these acts should not mar the reputation of their profession and officers nationwide, legitimate calls for police reform cannot be seen as an indictment on the entire profession. There are real systemic issues within policing and the criminal justice system that policymakers need to confront, and engaging in dialogue about necessary improvements does not mean that these critics are assailing the motives of every individual police officer. </p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, adding police officers as a protected class to hate crimes statutes whose original purpose was to eliminate violence against traditionally marginalized group actually dilutes the power of the statutes.  Examining the historical context in which hate crimes statutes were created demonstrates why adding police officers as a protected class within those statues does not comport with the underlying rationale of such laws.  The federal government originally enacted hate crimes laws to deter widespread violence and domestic terrorism blacks experienced during Reconstruction.  Between 1877 and 1950, <a href="http://www.eji.org/files/EJI%20Lynching%20in%20America%20SUMMARY.pdf">3,959 blacks were lynched</a> [PDF].  Traditional hate crimes statutes typically protected immutable characteristics such as race or ethnicity and many jurisdictions have expanded them to other traditionally marginalized groups and include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes. These groups stand in stark contrast to someone's chosen occupation, no matter how vital or dangerous that occupation is. </p>

<p>Moreover, there have been far more reported instances of bias-motivated crimes against traditionally protected groups than fatalities of police officers, which calls into question the need to include police officers alongside these other groups.  In 2014, there were <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2014/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses_final">5,462 reported hate crimes against individuals based on traditional protected status</a> (race, gender identity, sexual orientation). In contrast, during 2014, there were <a href="https://www.odmp.org/search/year/2014">145 police fatalities</a>, and it is likely that only a small fraction of these police fatalities were the result of perpetrators specifically targeting police. As the 21st century Task Force noted, police departments and localities should focus on building trust and legitimacy between police and the community. Adding police officers to these protected classes when they clearly are not facing widespread or systemic targeted violence (as other groups have), is not only unnecessary, but prompts questions about the true motivations underlying the current campaign to include officers as a protected class.</p>

<p>In addition to concerns about diluting the import and symbolism of hate crimes legislation, there are several practical reasons to avoid expanding protected classes to include occupations such as police officers. First, as mentioned previously, adding this class of victims to the many state statutes would be redundant.  Second, it is notoriously difficult to meet the burden of proof in hate crimes because the prosecution has to demonstrate.  Not all racial minorities or other people in traditionally protected groups are targeted <em>because</em> of their membership in these groups, so proving that a perpetrator was motivated by bias is extremely difficult.  Although the shooter in the Dallas massacre specifically mentioned his intention, there will be many instances where determining whether a victim's occupation motivated the suspect. Finally, some might argue that providing greater protections to police in this manner is necessary to avoid a chilling effect on officers in the the performance of their duties. However, police officers already enjoy a number of special privileges and immunities designed for this purpose. Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, police officers are protected from liability as long as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights.    In addition to qualified immunity, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2013/article-gps/section-3-103/">several states</a> and police unions have incorporated various aspects of the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, which is set of provisions intended from investigation and prosecution involving performance of their official duties.  These provisions often impede oversight or reform of police practices and make it difficult to discipline officers who may have engaged in misconduct.</p>

<p>When an event such as the Dallas tragedy occurs, it is tempting to respond with symbolic legislation to demonstrate solidarity with those noble men and women who are tasked with keeping the public safe.  However, any such effort must be properly contextualized and should not become a distraction from the larger issue of criminal justice reform.  It is true that police officers and other responders do not often get the recognition and praise they deserve for the difficult and important role they play in keeping our society safe. A few bad apples in police departments have tarnished the image of police officers in general, but it is important to note that these "bad apples" are often products of institutions that have tolerated or encouraged improper practices or procedures. Advocating for reform and increased accountability of police officers and police departments as a whole is a legitimate goal, and cannot be viewed as an indictment against all officers.</p>

<p>It is clear that proponents of adding police officers as a protected class are searching for ways to support police officers at a time when increased scrutiny has tarnished the reputation a noble profession.  Focusing on higher pay, more time off, and increased opportunities for professional development and training would also be effective ways to demonstrate respect for the role of police officers and acknowledge their service. In addition to suggesting recommendations to build community relationships, the Presidents Task Force on 21st Century Policing also made several recommendations for promoting officer wellness such as promoting mental health issues unique to officers and ensuring funding for the distribution of individual tactical first aid kits and asking Congress to expand the Bulletproof Vest Program.  Legislators concerned about officers would be well-advised to advocate for those practical recommendations rather than pressing for the inclusion in legislation intended to deter crimes against traditionally marginalized groups.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Andreas Kuersten, Law Clerk for the <a href="http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/newcaaf/home.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF)</a>, discusses racial bias' impact on black individuals, both in court and on the bench...</p><strong>T</strong>he personification of justice is a blindfolded woman holding a scale and a sword. She cannot see an individual's wealth, social stature, education, or other personal attributes. Rather, in cases before her, she objectively weighs competing sums of evidence and, in line with how the scale tips, rightfully dispenses judgment. <br />
                <br />
                This woman, however, is merely a representation of justice, not its actual incarnation. A torrent of studies over the years have exposed Lady Justice to be peeking out from under her blindfold, as ostensibly irrelevant qualities tip her scales one way or the other. Some of the most damning examinations have revealed the consistent impact of an individual's race in regards to their experience with the American justice system, and the outcomes it dispenses. Black individuals, in particular, experience a different dispensing of justice than white counterparts. For example, on average, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.1086/666006.pdf?_=1468335008022&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">a black male has an increased likelihood that he will be incarcerated</a>, and that he will face a <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-projects-and-surveys/miscellaneous/15-year-study/chap4.pdf">longer prison sentence</a> [report, PDF] than a white male convicted of a similar crime. <br />
                <br />
                Yet, examinations of the interaction of race and the law have tended to focus on when minorities are subject to legal process, not their treatment when administering it. In a <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/msen/files/sen_reversal.pdf">recent study</a> [report, PDF], however, Professor Maya Sen of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University turns attention towards how black judges' rulings are treated when appealed. Sen engages this issue by looking at the rate at which the decisions of black federal district court judges are reversed by the federal appellate courts reviewing them, as compared to the reversal rate for their white colleagues. <br />
                <br />
                Sen's data consists of 1,054 federal district court judges, 945 of whom are white and 109 of whom are black -- a fitting ratio given the substantially larger number of white federal district court judges than black. Each judge's reversal rate was determined for the period from January 2000 to July 2012. <br />
                <br />
                Across the aforementioned time span, Sen found that "[o]pinions written by black [district court] judges are more likely to be reversed on appeal, and the effect is robust." More specifically, "an opinion written by a black judge may have on average an approximately 10-percentage-point greater chance of being reversed than an opinion written by a white judge." Sen presents the difference in reversed cases between black and white judges as 2,800 over the roughly 12-year period examined in the study." That is, if blacks were reversed at whites' comparably lower rates, approximately 2,800 black-authored decisions would have been upheld "instead of having been reversed."  In terms of individual judges, "these results mean that each black judge on average had approximately 20 more cases reversed (out of an average of 196 cases appeals) than if he or she had been white." <br />
                <br />
                Of course, there are numerous potential intervening factors that might help account for this disparity in reversal rates. On average, black judges may: have their decisions appealed more often than white judges; have their decisions on certain reversal-prone issues (e.g. civil rights) appealed more often than white judges; not be as good as their white colleagues in terms of education and experience; be comparatively more liberal than white district court judges and appellate court panels (the latter of which tend to be centrist in political leaning due to the presence of multiple judges); or rule differently than their white counterparts on specific issues (e.g. civil rights), and thereby be more subject to reversal just on these. <br />
                <br />
                Sen, however, controls for each of these possible influences, and none of them are shown to impart a meaningful effect on the frequency of black judge reversals. Ultimately, given that appellate court judges generally know the race of district court judges through personal and professional interactions, Sen points to what she believes to be the likely mechanism behind the disproportionate reversal rate: "appeals panels somehow implicitly rely on the race of the lower-court judge in reaching decisions." In light of the extensive <a href="http://amodiolab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amodio-2014-Nat-Rev-Neuro.pdf">research and findings regarding implicit bias against black individuals</a> [report, PDF], such an explanation for the elevated <correction num=1>reversal rate</correction> of the decisions of black judges would not be surprising. <br />
                <br />
                This research has important implications for movements to diversify the federal and state judiciaries. Since President John F. Kennedy, US Presidents have endeavored to appoint minorities as federal judges, and similar initiatives have been undertaken at the state level. But, how much impact can this increased diversity have on the law if the decisions of minority judges are reversed at such an elevated rate?  <br />
                <br />
                Rather than demonstrating any futility in the advancement of minorities to judgeships, however, Sen's data shows the importance of the complete permeation of the judicial structure, top to bottom, by diverse individuals. Her study presents preliminary data that the presence of black judges on appellate court panels might attenuate the high reversal rate for black district court judge decisions, particularly when black judges constitute the majority on such a panel. But, admittedly, "the low numbers of black judges on appeals courts" makes reliable results difficult to attain. Nevertheless, the elevation of minorities to all levels of the judiciary seems a more expedient way to combat implicit bias among judges rather than waiting for it to be rooted out from the neurological and societal soil from which it grows. <br />
                <br />
                Sen's study also illuminates interesting avenues for further research. Examinations of the reversal rates of other minority judges (Asians, Hispanics, women, etc.) would likely yield fascinating data. In addition, analyses of the qualitative aspects of opinions by black judges, and those of other minority and female judges, looking at whether they utilize different rhetorical styles or methods of legal reasoning than white, male judges would also be illuminating. Finally, studies focusing specifically on the reversed decisions of black judges and the reversing decisions of appellate courts could be useful in parsing out patterns contained therein, both in terms of the former&#8217;s content and the reasoning used by appellate court panels to reverse. <br />
                <br />
                Sen's research is an important step in the broad examination of implicit racial bias throughout the American legal system. She shows that even those in such exalted positions as judges are not free from this pernicious influence. Sen's data, and the studies that are likely to develop from it, have the potential to make meaningful contributions to the ongoing effort to finally pull the blindfold all the way down over Lady Justice's eyes.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/hammond-allen/">Allen Hammond</a> of the <a href="http://law.scu.edu">Santa Clara Law School</a> discusses a recent net neutrality ruling and what it means for the future of the internet...</p><strong>A</strong>fter three tries before the <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a>, the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-net-neutrality-regulations.php">has succeeded</a> in applying net neutrality rules to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). In a <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3F95E49183E6F8AF85257FD200505A3A/$file/15-1063-1619173.pdf">2 to 1 decision</a> [PDF], the circuit court panel upheld the FCC's most recent decision to apply common carrier regulations to broadband internet access networks. On the two prior occasions, the FCC had been rebuffed by the court.  </p>

<p>In the first case, <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-297356A1.pdf">Comcast Corp. v FCC</a> [PDF], the court held that the FCC had failed to cite any statutory authority that would justify its order requiring a broadband provider (Comcast) to comply with open internet practices. </p>

<p>In the second case, <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-330284A1.pdf">Verizon v. FCC</a> [PDF], the court held that the FCC could rely on <a href="http://www.cybertelecom.org/broadband/706.htm">section 706 of the Telecommunications Act</a> for statutory authority to promulgate open internet rules. However, the FCC had earlier determined that broadband providers were information service providers and not predominantly telecommunications service providers. Consequently, the FCC's anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules violated the Telecommunications Act, which prohibits the application of common carrier regulation to services other than telecommunications.   </p>

<p>In the third case, <span class="casename">USTA v. FCC</span>, the court concluded the FCC acted within the scope of its congressionally delegated statutory authority when it interpreted an ambiguity in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to allow reclassification. In addition, based on an extensive record, the FCC's decision to reclassify wireline and wireless broadband internet networks as common carriers was reasonable. As a consequence, the FCC is legally entitled to issue and enforce rules that prohibit ISPs from blocking, degrading or impairing user internet access to lawful sites, content, applications, services and non-harmful devices. After three tries, the FCC finally got it right.</p>

<p><strong>Deja Vu</strong></p>

<p>This is not the first time the country has had to address the economic power that accrues to network service providers whose facilities connect virtually all segments of the market and the democracy and face little or no competition. Nor is it likely to be the last. After all, we've done this three times before. </p>

<p>Both Western Union (in the 1850s) and its technological offspring, the former American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) (in the 1930s), sought to monopolize telecommunications by refusing network interconnection to competitors and engaging in predatory pricing. Congress <a href="http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2992&context=dlj">enacted the Communications Act of 1934</a> with its common carrier provisions in response.</p>

<p>By 1976-1984, the former AT&T was leveraging its network position to unfairly disadvantage its network competitors and threatening to enter some of its customers' markets. Major corporations including Boeing (airlines/aerospace); IBM and EDS (computers and data processing); MCI and Satellite Business Systems (telecommunications), ITT (equipment manufacturers), the Washington Post (electronic publishing), Data Communications (enhanced services) and Exxon (energy) faced the sobering prospect of competing against their network service provider, AT&T, then, the largest corporation in the world, and the one upon which they <a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19810728&id=7R8qAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ByoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4787,3864429&hl=en">were totally dependent</a>. Their political push back in congress along with a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=CXNPVjdxfAEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+fall+of+the+bell+system&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwji2Pvf1OTNAhUIxWMKHcCfC_EQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=the%20fall%20of%20the%20bell%20system&f=false">major political miscalculation by AT&T</a> counterbalanced AT&T's full court press to legislate its way out of the antitrust suit and common carrier status.</p>

<p>This is the third time. Concerns <a href="http://trycompetify.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Adhoc.pdf">expressed</a> to the President and the FCC by <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ford-ups-visa-bank-of-america-favor-net-neutrality-2014-11">Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 companies</a> including Bank of America, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-14/net-neutrality-ford-ups-visa-and-bofa-lobby-fcc-in-secret">Ford, UPS and Visa</a>, as well as nearly 200 major tech companies including Google, Microsoft and Amazon, and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-white-house-thwarted-fcc-chief-on-internet-rules-1423097522">venture capitalists</a>, are reminiscent of those expressed by earlier captains of industry to congress in 1981. They all lobbied for rules that would ensure an open network fairly accessible to all. Otherwise ISPs would have too much power over what content flows over the internet, which could be potentially damaging to all companies that engage in commerce in one form or another online.</p>

<p><strong>But, "It Ain't Over Till It's Over"</strong></p>

<p>The judicial decision has been hailed as a triumph for the FCC, vindication for the public interest, a <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Net-neutrality-ruling-is-a-big-win-for-Silicon-8137682.php"> major win</a> for Silicon Valley and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/06/14/the-fcc-just-won-a-sweeping-victory-on-net-neutrality-in-federal-court/">a major loss</a> for telephone and cable companies. However, it is important not <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/halsinger/2016/06/15/in-open-internet-ruling-the-d-c-circuit-defers-to-an-economics-free-agency/#73cac31b1f7d">to get caught up in the current storyline</a> of the euphoric victory or the rancorous defeat. Neither narrative is accurate as nothing is settled. The circuit court opinion is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/technology/net-neutrality-fcc-appeals-court-ruling.html?_r=0">likely to be appealed</a>, a dysfunctional congress will be <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/14/471286113/u-s-appeals-court-holds-up-net-neutrality-rules-in-full">intensely lobbied</a> to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/06/white-house-warns-congress-not-to-kill-net-neutrality-and-cable-box-rules/">undo</a> the FCC decision, and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-2016-presidential-candidates-views-on-net-neutralit-1760829072">presidential</a>, senate and congressional candidates will be <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/4/15/1515826/-Which-5-House-Democrats-Just-Voted-to-Undermine-Net-Neutrality">asked to take positions</a> even though they may be <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_27671709/gop-politicians-at-odds-most-silicon-valley-net">out of step</a> with <a href="https://www.quora.com/Has-the-GOP-lost-Silicon-Valley-by-opposing-net-neutrality">their constituencies</a>. </p>

<p><strong>The Network is an Essential Facility Regardless of the Technological Form It Takes</strong></p>

<p>If the circuit court's decision stands, however, the court and the FCC will have upheld the return to a central tenet of our relentlessly technologically evolving society: the network is an essential facility regardless of the technological form it takes. It does not matter if the switching is electromechanical, digital or some future technology. It does not matter if the transport is coaxial, fiber optic or spectrum based. If it connects each to all and is essential to the economic, cultural and democratic life of the nation, it is a common carrier and must be treated as such. If we do not remember this truth, we will place the economy and the democracy in jeopardy again. How do we know? Well, because we've done it three times before.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Mahmudul Hasan of <a href=" http://uoda.edu.bd/ "> University of Development Alternative </a> discusses how international environmental law can be influenced by indigenous orders...</p><strong>I</strong>n the realm of international environmental law, we have seen how various conceptions of international law; ideas about sovereignty and human rights come into play and add further dimensions and challenges to the existing structure of law. However, much of international environmental law assumes Eurocentric values with particular assumptions regarding nature and society divides&#8212;in many ways, this causes rifts between the intended effects of environmental law and the way it may be interpreted. In the face of the global legal regime, in particular the international environmental law regime and its associated infrastructures and processes, the discourse surrounding indigeneity and indigenous collective rights present crucial challenges to the manner in which law sees the world in different silos of "economic rights", "human rights" and "environmental rights". Further integration of indigenous worldviews, even outside the purview of indigenous collective rights, may yield solutions to contemporary environmental problems with complex legal implications.</p>

<p>The United Nations General Assembly formally recognized the unique nature of indigenous societies and their relationship to the environment through the <a href=" https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjct6HAm8DNAhXBQI8KHf5dBykQFggpMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.un.org%2Fesa%2Fsocdev%2Funpfii%2Fdocuments%2FDRIPS_en.pdf&usg=AFQjCNFsAoTgiIMEVUHfEXbBn_03AJhJTg&sig2=vHaVNFqJC">Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> (UNDRIP) in September 2007 (United Nations General Assembly 2007). As <a href=" http://www.ubcpress.com/search/title_book.asp?BookID=299173151">Costa explains</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"This declaration of the General Assembly of the United Nations provides a new global paradigm upon which Indigenous peoples can draw to...and assert their autonomy. It is an elaborate and comprehensive statement of the entitlements of Indigenous peoples, one that implicitly acknowledges the histories and global breadth of Indigenous dispossession and the variety of contemporary Indigenous aspirations. It recognizes the following: general principles of self-determination, equality, and freedom from discrimination.... [t]he need for Indigenous people to participate in economic and social decision-making processes within nation-states; rights to lands, waters, and other resources; and self-government arrangements. It notes the obligation of states and the international community to recognize Indigenous rights and to implement them." </blockquote>

<p>While this declaration covers areas that have overarching implications for the governance of and by indigenous peoples by individual states and the international legal order, there is little in terms of <a href="http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199552153.001.0001/law-9780199552153-chapter-36">consistent processes implemented</a> across all countries to enforce indigenous rights. However, having the formal recognition of indigenous rights by the United Nations has had implications in legal paradigms of environmental governance in international and regional levels. </p>

<p>Much of indigenous people's claims in national and international arenas have had to do with the justification based on "their distinctive claims on the uniqueness of their cultures and the gravity of their situation [that requires] a different approach." Firstly, indigenous people, in contrast to many minorities, identify with their special relationship to the land, its ecology and its environmental and cultural histories. According to many, this makes indigenous societies especially suited to be the rightful owners and stewards of their traditional lands. Since much of indigenous rights are based on the idea of the collective and collective governance of society, this makes indigenous legal systems and international recognition of the special status of indigenous peoples an especially potent influence in the development of international environmental law. </p>

<p>However, despite more recent proclamations of the rights of indigenous peoples and their positionality within civil society, state and international legal infrastructures, their potential for creating large-scale and effective changes to legal regimes and local paradigms about human-environment relations is ultimately impeded by their marginalization within larger society. As <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0922156512000118">Khoday and Natarajan explain</a>: </p>

<blockquote>"A central feature of indigenous history is the process of social exclusion they have suffered for centuries, often intimately connected to the process of exploiting the environment. Indigenous peoples have been affected by displacement, toxicity, and land and water degradation. In many instances, their relationship with and understanding of the natural environment meant that environmental degradation was accompanied by profound socio-cultural loss and damage."</blockquote>

<p>This is to say that while indigenous societies, thanks to their traditional knowledge and relationship to the environment, are very well-situated to make decisions about their land governance, the fact that this right has not been historically afforded to them has certainly held them back. When there is resource extraction, there is also a magnified impact on the agency and environmental health of indigenous societies. Historical exclusion from decision-making therefore is still a potent barrier to indigenous participation in sustainable and equitable governance of their lands and their natural resources. </p>

<p>The nature-culture dichotomy ever-present in European Enlightenment thought was part of the colonial project in the global south, and Bangladesh was, and remains, a site ripe with its contradictions.  Even after independence, Eurocentric view of nature and a Eurocentric teleology of development was part and parcel of the discourses of modernization and development throughout the Indian subcontinent. Inherent in these ideals was the notion that development would occur as societies are able to control and harness the powers and resources of nature in more effective ways. An increasing level of control over nature, and accordingly, an increasing separation between the so-called distinct realms of "society" and "nature" was seen to be integral to socioeconomic progress. Working within this paradigm of a stringent separation between nature and society, progress and traditional lifestyles, post-independence in this region reified these norms as a way to catch up to Western developmental regimes. As <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0922156512000118">Khoday and Natarajan elaborate</a>: </p>

<blockquote>"Post-colonial Indian leaders chose to pursue an economic path of industrialization as mapped out by European ideas of development. As being modern, developed, and cultured was tied to efficient exploitation of the natural environment, either legal concepts and systems that allow for this were maintained from colonial times or new laws were instituted. As such, modern Indian law has to some extent been complicit in creating the inequity and ecological decay in which communities find themselves today and against which social movements seek change."</blockquote>

<p>Khoday and Natarajan's observation equally reflects in other regions in Indian subcontinent such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan.  For instance, after modern reforms, Bangladeshi laws have sought to give more power to local governance to make decisions about regional issues. This is originally based on the traditional form of governance that was widespread in Indian subcontinent since the medieval era, for instance, the Village Court Act of 1976 for village areas and Conciliation of Disputes (Municipal Areas) Ordinance of 1979 which empowered localized village councils in making decision about resource use and development in their jurisdictions. This was an attempt on part of the Bangladesh government to address the overwhelming colonial narratives in its legal infrastructure and decentralize social, economic, political and environmental governance by giving more power and agencies to <em>gram shalish</em>, or the village councils. However, the implementation of such systems proved to be difficult, as the enactment of village court or local council requires systemic changes within the overall system of governance and widespread changes in paradigm that empower grassroots decision making. Since this has not been successfully achieved, it shows us the extent to which, localized and indigenous paradigms of governance are held back to this day due to historical exclusion.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, small successes have served as exemplars as the potential for equitable localized and indigenous governance when conditions exist for the rightful empowerment of the village councils. A remarkable personal achievement can be noted down as an example of local governance. Khurshida Begum, a union parishad (local council) member of Teknaf upazila of Cox's Bazar, has been working in the field of afforestation and conservation of environment through forming a female Community Patrol Group (CPG) with 28 women at Kerontali. The <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-249903">Daily Star reports</a> on September 16, 2012 that, "along with the forest guards, she took upon the challenges of sharing the responsibilities of conserving the sanctuary against poaching and illegal logging. She made the local people aware about biodiversity conservation for future generation." As the recognition of her contribution for environment, she was awarded the prestigious <a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/158734/icode/">Wangari Mathai International award</a> in 2012 for protecting forests in Bangladesh.  <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0922156512000118">Khoday and Natarajan</a> once again provide us with an example of success story of localized and indigenous governance:</p>

<blockquote>India's largest foreign direct-investment project, Posco is a planned US $12 billion steel and iron export project in Odisha state on land inhabited by a tribal population that has vigorously disputed the acquisition...with layers of clearance provided in 2007 and 2009, the Posco group began a process for land acquisition in 2010 but tribal social movements succeeded in halting the process, claiming a lack of prior consent for use of land and resources.</blockquote>

<p>While it remains true that processes for this kind of localized governance empowering indigenous peoples have not yet been perfected, it is also true that the indigenous challenge to the Eurocentric development of international environmental law is one whose potential is promising and remains yet to be realized. Traditionally, much of the global environmental discourse has been <a href="http://www.researchonline.mq.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/mq:22857">staged as debates</a> between relatively privileged western environmentalists. The mere acknowledgement at international levels presents a real challenge to the status quo of western environmental thought and the implicit nature-society dichotomies that come with it. Moreover, the western systems of international environmental law are wrought with loopholes, inconsistencies and contradictions, as domains of human rights, environment, economy and politics are seen as distinct silos. Because of the very positionality of indigenous identities as connected to land and culture simultaneously, indigenous legal paradigms can provide a potent antidote to the follies of Eurocentric international environmental law. <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0922156512000118">Khoday and Natarajan</a> additionally claim that:</p>

<blockquote>Greater local engagement and integration of local knowledge into IEL will help address perceptions of unfairness. Implementation of IEL is not just about co-operation between inter-state systems. Implementation largely depends on how environmental principles and legal regimes are negotiated and play out at the local level. </blockquote>

Perhaps with the infusion of indigenous legal paradigms within international legal regimes, international environmental law may finally be able to provide comprehensive social and environmental justice, not based on the western norms of distinct divisions in legal regimes, but through a holistic approach where community development is not divorced from environmental concerns.

<p>As learners of environmental law, we have observed how the ad hoc approach to creating the environmental law regime has created multiple loopholes and conflicts that often can go against the original aims of environmental justice. Sometimes, answers for such complex situation cannot be found in the fragmented realms of western legal paradigms and the answer must be sought from multi-system considerations that are inherent in many aspects of indigenous legal orders. The recognition of the unique collective rights of indigenous people by international bodies, although long overdue, is still in some cases disrupting the status quo of environmental affairs around the world. Further consideration of implementing policies inspired by indigenous laws may prove to further aims of environmental and social justice in the future.</p>

		<title>On Human Rights, California is Better than Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, and Texas!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Stephen Cooper, a former DC public defender, addresses prosecutor Michele Hanisee's remarks concerning the death penalty in California... </p><br />
                <strong>S</strong>peaking in favor of <a href="https://www.jurist.org/hotline/2016/07/stephen-cooper-proposition-66.php">Proposition 66</a>, the ballot initiative that seeks to speed up executions in California to Texas-like levels of lethality, Los Angeles deputy district attorney Michele Hanisee told legislators during testimony before the Public Safety Committee in May:<blockquote> "The suggestion that civilized societies don't support the death penalty is inaccurate. Many countries such as Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, and Singapore have the death penalty."</blockquote></p>

                <p>Ms. Hanisee is President of the Association of Los Angeles Deputy District Attorneys. She is being sued for lying in a declaration she made under oath during a murder prosecution and, just recently, her claims of "absolute immunity" for that egregious conduct were <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/07/05/suit-over-medical-records-subpoena-goof-revived.htm">rejected</a> by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. While this alone clouds Hanisee's credibility on the death penalty debate in California (whether the punishment should end forever or be "speeded up"), the countries whose justice systems Hanisee extols are even more troubling. Perhaps, in addition to remedial ethics courses on an attorney's duty of candor to the court, Ms. Hanisee should also take a closer look at the countries she is suggesting Californians emulate with their vote on the death penalty this fall. </p>

                <p>For example, it has been documented that death sentences in Japan are"implemented with disregard for international law, including denying the right of prisoners to seek appeal."</a> The condemned are subjected to "degrading and inhuman treatment," which includes "prolonged solitary confinement." Japan even <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/04/06/national/crime-legal/excluding-china-2015-executions-worldwide-rose-50-year-highest-since-1989-amnesty-says/">executed an 89-year-old</a> man last year who spent 46 years on death row protesting his innocence&#8212;all the way to his long-awaited, abominable end.</p>

                <p>In Thailand, Taiwan and Singapore, death sentences can be meted out for drug crimes alone. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/12/death-sentence-for-myanmar-men-prompts-anti-thai-protest.php">in Thailand, allegations of the torture of suspects charged with capital offenses have been substantiated</a> by the Thai National Human Rights Commission. <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2016/06/22/2003649201">Taiwan, which is moving toward abolishing the death penalty</a>, has a record of executing "psychologically or mentally impaired prisoners," and failing to have "a clear and complete procedure for appeals for clemency." Last fall, in an <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/roads/2015/11/singapore_s_harsh_death_penalty_inside_the_fight_to_save_one_man_from_the.html">article for Slate</a> titled, "Singapore's harsh death penalty: Inside the fight to save one man from the city-state's death row," Kirsten Han wrote about, "Singapore's mandatory death penalty regime" where, under Singapore law, "anyone convicted of murder must be sentenced to death, with no chance for mitigating factors to be taken into account." (<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-07/local/me-42956_1_corporal-punishment">In Singapore, prisoners convicted of low-level property crimes can even be caned</a>, a punishment Berkeley Law Professor Jerome H. Skolnick called "brutal," describing how a "martial artist strikes the offenders" with "a half-inch rattan cane moistened to break the skin and inflict severe pain" often causing significant "loss of blood" and "shock.")   </p>

                <p>Like Ms. Hanisee, Ms. Bethany Webb, who lost her sister in the 2011 mass shooting at a hair salon in Seal Beach, also got a chance to address the Public Safety Committee this past May. In her courageous testimony, Ms. Webb explained her support for Proposition 62 (which would, among other things, replace the death penalty in California with a sentence of life without the possibility of parole). In voicing her opposition to the countervailing initiative, Proposition 66, Ms. Webb told lawmakers: <blockquote>"We could be more like Texas. We could start mass producing murder. Well, I'm sorry, California is better than Texas . . . We're better than Texas." </blockquote> </p>

                <p>Ms. Webb is right. When it comes to respecting human rights, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/executed-possibly-innocent">California is better than Texas, where the lust for speedy executions has led to the execution of a panoply of potentially innocent men</a>.  And, despite what Ms. Hanisee thinks, we are also better than Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, and Singapore. Or, at least, we will be&#8212;as soon as we vote for Proposition 62 and against Proposition 66&#8212;ending capital punishment forever in California.   </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~ndlaw/lamb/substance-methodology-conference/bios/Vars.pdf">Fredrick Vars</a> [PDF] of the University of Alabama School of Law, proposes a compromise federal approach to the problem of guns and terrorism... </p><strong>J</strong>ust over two months ago we witnessed the worst mass shooting in US history, which, with 49 killed, was also the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. There followed a successful filibuster in the Senate to at least force votes.  A rare, dramatic sit-in on the House floor failed.  </p>

<p>But that was June. Now it seems the country has forgotten.</p>

<p>No one wants terrorists to have guns, but the two parties moved on before building on this common ground. While nothing passed Congress, the seeds of a compromise are buried in the failed Senate bills.</p>

<p>The first step is to authorize the Attorney General to obtain a judicial order barring gun purchase by persons under "reasonable suspicion" of terrorism. This would happen in advance of an attempted gun purchase and be kept secret until such an attempt. The process would be like obtaining a warrant or a gun violence restraining order under California law. A person denied a gun could have her rights restored expeditiously if she shows that the government made a mistake.</p>

<p>The "reasonable suspicion" language comes from Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein's (Calif.) proposal, but does not differ substantially from Republican Senator John Cornyn's (Tex.) "suspected terrorist" trigger. The parties agree that this is the right population to target.</p>

<p>Senator Susan Collins (R-Me.) has proposed barring gun purchases by people on the narrower "No Fly List." That proposal, which stalled, misses the mark. It would allow gun sales to too many dangerous people, and it would prevent sales based solely on executive discretion.</p>

<p>In contrast, the judicial order requirement in my proposal provides adequate due process and a check against overzealous listing by the executive. Even advocates of strict gun control should recognize the potential for abuse. Based on his public statements, President Donald Trump might well label all Muslims "suspected terrorists" or put them on the "No Fly List." Of course, judicial review up front will not be perfect either, so the opportunity to correct mistakes quickly is key.</p>

<p>The next two components of my proposal go together. The second element would be to authorize the Attorney General without a judicial order to flag additional suspects. The FBI would be immediately notified of an attempted gun purchase by any person on this list. Third, institute a national waiting period for all firearm purchases (or at least first firearm purchases). Some states, like Florida and Illinois, already have waiting periods, but most do not.  The delay would give the government time to arrest the suspect, seek a judicial order barring gun purchase, or decide that the risk warrants neither action.</p>

<p>The parties agree on FBI notification. And it is the Senate Republicans, with NRA support, who proposed a waiting period. To be sure, my proposal goes beyond the Cornyn delay period, which was just for terror suspects, but the expansion is critical to reducing the threat of armed terrorist attacks. Limiting the waiting period to terror suspects would alert them to the FBI's suspicions and could lead them to speed up plans, flee, or go into hiding.</p>

<p>Without an across-the-board delay, the government would be forced to choose between keeping guns away from suspected terrorists like the Orlando shooter and compromising ongoing investigations. And the government cannot be expected to make a split-second decision while a transaction is taking place. National security justifies a small delay in exercising our Second Amendment rights.</p>

<p>The final step is to adopt universal or near-universal background checks. The effectiveness of any proposal depends on its scope. If there are easy avenues to avoid background checks, some terrorists will exploit them to purchase guns. Our best chance of preventing terrorists from obtaining firearms is to close existing loopholes at the same time as we tighten restrictions. </p>

<p>On this last element of the proposal, it must be conceded that there is no consensus in the Senate. Senator Christopher Murphy's (D-Conn.) background check expansion bill failed along party lines. The public overwhelmingly favors expanded background checks---around 90% according to post-Orlando polling---so perhaps there will be movement. But even assuming continued gridlock on this issue, adopting the other three elements of the proposal---purchase bans, broad FBI notification and a waiting period---would help make it significantly more difficult for terrorists to get guns.</p>

<p>The political divide on guns appears stark, but gun policy on terror may be headed towards convergence. Let's hope we get there before the next massacre.</p>

		<title>The Freedom of Information Act Was Just Amended. Here&amp;apos;s What Changed—And Didn&amp;apos;t.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/11604/Bruno">Jonathan Bruno</a> of the <a href="http://hls.harvard.edu/">Harvard Law School</a> discusses recent changes to and ongoing limitations of the Freedom of Information Act...</p>
<strong>A</strong> few weeks ago, President Obama signed into law a major amendment of the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/oip/freedom-information-act-5-usc-552">US Freedom of Information Act,</a> or FOIA. Ironically for a measure intended to make government more transparent, the event garnered little publicity. What coverage did appear was buried beneath a mountain of headlines about Brexit, Boris, and Trump. Nevertheless, backers say the new legislation will be hard to ignore. <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/06/obama-signs-foia-reform-bill-225010">According to one prominent cosponsor</a>, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, this latest FOIA reform "ensures that sunshine, not secrecy, is the default setting of our government."

To see just how far that overstates the conceivable impact of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/337">FOIA Improvement Act of 2016</a>—indeed of any such disclosure mandate—it's best to return to FOIA itself. How did "our nation's premier transparency law" (again Senator Leahy) come to be, and what exactly does it require of government agencies? To answer those questions is to develop a more sober view of the recent amendments.

FOIA was enacted in the summer of 1966. For the better part of two decades following World War II, a coalition of newspaper editors, together with a few dedicated lawyers and legislators who took up their cause, had been pushing for better disclosure of documents held by the federal government. They dreamed of a general rule according to which "all records should be open except as otherwise provided by law." What they eventually got, when a skeptical Lyndon Johnson signed FOIA fifty years ago this Fourth of July, was language apparently narrower in scope, but amounting to more or less the same thing. Here is the legislation's punch line: "[E]very agency shall, upon request for identifiable records made in accordance with published rules ... make such records promptly available to any person." (A litany of exceptions follows.)

In plain English, FOIA instructed government bureaucrats to turn over documents when people ask for them. That was a big deal, even if the law contained no explicit presumption of openness ("all records should be open except..."). The prior standard under the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2014/05/01/act-pl79-404.pdf">Administrative Procedure Act [PDF]</a> gave federal agencies wide latitude to shield their records from public view. It said that disclosure was owed only "to persons properly and directly concerned" with the requested documents—whatever that meant. Under FOIA, by contrast, "any person" can demand the release of any "identifiable records" held by a covered agency, without so much as citing her affiliation or occupation or purpose in making the request. What's more, FOIA gives requesters the right to sue in federal court if they believe records have been wrongly withheld.

FOIA certainly warrants two cheers. It has been instrumental in exposing many problems of governance. It gives political and legal standing to people curious about agency conduct, for whatever public or private reasons. (The law's undiscriminating approach has been both a blessing and a curse, serving not only the relatively disempowered but also entrenched corporate interests that have <a href="http://dlj.law.duke.edu/article/foia-inc-kwoka-vol65-iss7/">inundated some agencies</a> with profit-seeking disclosure requests.) Wholly apart from its consequences, FOIA expresses an important principle of democratic politics: that the exercise of power should be publicly knowable.

Though we should give FOIA its due, it's also crucial to recognize its limits. Too often this statute has been portrayed as a silver bullet. But it cannot possibly secure the "freedom of information" it promises, much less a government that is meaningfully "transparent."

For one thing, FOIA governs only records—things written and stored—not information in general. That's a crucial distinction. The law imposes no obligation on agencies to answer the questions we might pose; questions like, "How did you decide to write this new regulation?" or "Why haven't you taken a stronger stance against [this or that industry practice]?" It requires only the release of existing documents that bear on such matters, and typically only upon request. Yet as anyone who's worked within a large organization will understand, agencies don't document every conversation that might shed light on their decision-making process, or on their relationships with regulated industries. For all sorts of reasons, some nefarious and some altogether mundane, much agency work is conducted informally, <em>viva voce</em> and out of view of the wider public.

Moreover, not all existing records are subject to disclosure. FOIA's numerous exemptions frequently relieve agencies of the duty to honor document requests. The exemptions cover information that reasonable people would agree should enjoy confidentiality—personnel records, for example, or the details of active law enforcement investigations. In addition, they sanction the withholding of documents containing even a whiff of commercial data, which business interests have been <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2016.05.002">remarkably successfu</a>l in lobbying to protect.

More worryingly, FOIA's exemptions sweep in many records that are directly relevant to assessments of agency competence and integrity—matters of core public concern. This includes a wide array of material that could shed light on the pathways of agency decision-making. Suppose we’d like to gauge the degree to which a given agency has cozied up to the industries it is responsible for regulating. Under FOIA’s Exemption 5—which effectively asserts the government’s deliberative process privilege—most conceivable evidence of such deference would be shielded as “pre-decisional.”

Finally, even where no exemption applies, compliance can be lacking. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-federal-government-no-longer-cares-about-disclosing-public-information/2016/03/10/7e0bf1bc-e631-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html">Huge backlogs, evidence of strategic avoidance, and chronic underfunding</a> make clear that FOIA’s promise of openness sometimes goes unfulfilled. And while the law’s framers sought to protect against this outcome by providing for <em>de novo</em> judicial review, in practice courts have often <a href="http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/bclr/vol54/iss1/5/">deferred</a> to agency claims of secrecy.

Which of these basic limitations was altered when the recent FOIA amendments took effect? The short answer is: almost none of them.

At first glance, the new legislation achieves what FOIA’s advocates sought those five-plus decades ago: it incorporates a presumption of openness, declaring that records may be withheld only when “the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption” (or is otherwise “prohibited by law”). In practice, though, it’s hard to imagine this provision will make much difference. In the rare cases in which a requester actually litigates an agency’s decision to withhold, the presumption’s only likely effect will be to compel the government’s lawyers to describe some harm that might result from disclosure. That’s hardly an insurmountable hurdle.

This summer's amendments do make three important changes. First, they impose a 25-year limit on what may be withheld under the deliberative process privilege. Second, the new law calls for affirmative disclosure (on a public website) of any document requested three or more times. Though compliance will undoubtedly remain a problem, there are reasons to believe this measure will <a href="http://dlj.law.duke.edu/article/foia-inc-kwoka-vol65-iss7/">reduce the burden</a> of requests by corporations. Finally, the amendments call for the establishment of a consolidated online portal for submitting and tracking document requests under FOIA. In principle that sounds like an attractive proposal, but it remains an unfunded mandate: the legislation authorizes no new expenditures.

Even assuming the government could meet the demands of the FOIA Improvement Act without additional resources, the basic point remains. Post-amendment, FOIA still covers only existing records, still exempts a great deal that would build public understanding of administrative power, and still leaves effective control over agency information with officials themselves.

Does FOIA make transparency the “default setting” of the federal government? I do not see how anyone could maintain that claim with a straight face. The truth is that, valuable as they are, disclosure laws like FOIA leave the opacity of the administrative state largely intact. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. After all, some (time-limited) secrecy in government is essential. Agencies could never hope to enforce their regulations without it. Still, we should be clear-eyed about what laws like FOIA can and cannot accomplish.

Was Trump's <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-russia-clinton-emails-treason-226303">invitation</a> criminal incitement to criminal conduct by a foreign state upon the US government or "merely" an approval of criminal conduct by a foreign state upon the US government?</p>

<p>Trump's invitation went like this: after expressing hope that Russia had hacked Hillary Clinton's e-mail, he said: "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press."<br />
 <br />
What is the significance of such a statement, assuming that someone, possibly a Russian or the Russian government, has hacked Clinton's e-mail. Two <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/state-department-email-rule-hillary-clinton-115804">items</a> of note: (1) it is very unlikely that Clinton's private e-mail server that contained her State Department communications is still running and, if so, still has hack-worthy governmental information; and (2) it has yet to be established that Russians or the Russian government ever hacked Clinton's e-mail though many experts believe that the Russian government is the source of the e-mail hacking of the Democratic National Committee. And most recently, we now have learned that Russia may have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/us/politics/clinton-campaign-hacked-russians.html?_r=0">hacked</a> Clinton campaign e-mails.</p>

<p>Up front it is very unlikely that Trump's <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/07/28/donald-trump-made-some-ill-advised-comments-but-are-they-treasonous/">invitation</a> constituted treason. To prove treason, one must show: the defendant owes allegiance to the government and the defendant intentionally betrays that allegiance by ...giving aid or comfort to the government's enemies. It is well-established that giving aid and comfort to the enemy in peacetime, even assuming Russia qualifies as an enemy, does not constitute <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art3frag60_user.html">treason</a>.</p>

<p>It is only slightly more likely that Trump's invitation constitutes espionage which is <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-115">defined</a> as the- "knowingly and willfully communicates, ... otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, or publishes, or uses in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interest of the United States or for the benefit of any foreign government to the detriment of the United States any classified information..."the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-115">statute</a> then goes on to describe the particular kinds of information banned from disclosure. To prove these elements, it is likely the prosecution would need to establish that Trump knew about the e-mails' contents (the missing e-mails, that is) and that they in some fashion harmed the United States, all at the time he made the invitation. Difficult to so prove based on the current evidence given that the 30,000 e-mails apparently remain missing.</p>

<p>To understand Trump's potential culpability, one must understand Russia's culpability. It is likely that if a Russian or the Russian government hacked Hillary Clinton's e-mail server while she was Secretary of State, that that individual or state actor has violated either the <a href="https://it.ojp.gov/privacyliberty/authorities/statutes/1285">Electronic Privacy Act (ECPA)</a> (including the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-121">Stored Wire Electronic Communications Act</a>) or <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030">The Computer Fraud & Abuse Act (CFAA)</a>. ECPA bans the interception, acquisition and disclosure of electronic communications. It focuses on communications in interstate and foreign commerce by corporations and individuals. For example, those who obtained access for WikiLeaks to protected e-mails and their substance may well have violated ECPA. The Stored Communications Act focuses on surreptitious access to communications "at rest" in electronic storage. If someone, including the Russian government broke into Clinton's e-mail server; obtained her e-mails and, as urged by Trump, disclosed them, it very likely a violation of ECPA.</p>

<p>CFAA focuses less on communications themselves and more on computers, effectively operating in part as an anti-hacking statute. The language states that only "protected computers" are covered. However given the definition of "protected computer," which includes any computer that affects interstate or foreign commerce, most computers are covered. The covered conduct includes computer trespassing, cyber espionage, including using viruses and worms, fraud, password trafficking to damage computers and certain kinds of cyber threats. Again the statutory language suggests pretty strongly that an individual Russian or the Russian government would be criminally liable for computer hacking.</p>

<p>Now having a theoretically provable case is not enough. It is definitely the case that the U.S. government could charge someone with this conduct even though that person had not set foot in the US Case law and the implications of ECPA and CFAA language verify that the US Attorney's office would have extraterritorial jurisdiction. At least three further problems remain: <br />
<ol >	<li>It is very difficult in extraterritorial cybercrime investigations to identify exactly the individual(s) who should be charges; </li><li>Even if possible the US and Russia do not have an extradition treaty (see Snowden, Edward); and</li><li>The US and Russia  do not have a mutual legal assistance treaty or executive agreement facilitating access to witnesses and evidence through agreed upon legal processes.</li></ol></p>

<p>Thus if someone in Russia actually did hack Clinton's e-mail server, they would be chargeable but difficult to engage in the US criminal justice system let alone convict.</p>

<p>What about Trump's culpability? At one level he's an easier target in that he is in the US and he made very public statements. If his statements can be read to encourage someone in Russia to disclose electronic communications whose acquisition is illegal, then the question becomes whether he is engaged in a conspiracy to violate ECPA. Encouragement does not equal a conspiracy. One need also prove an agreement to violate the statute and overt acts, at the least. The publicly available facts do not get us there to date. And prosecutors would still need witnesses and evidence from Russia to prove the underlying crime.</p>

<p>As to CFAA the challenges are the same and a bit greater. Assuming a Russian individual has accessed Clinton's computer, that access had already occurred by the time of Trump's invitation. That conduct is the essence of the CFAA and diminishes any possibility of prosecution.</p>

<p>To be sure Trump's invitation is one that encourages a foreign government to further engage in and aggravate the federal crimes they may well have committed. If the hacking had been upon Trump's email by the Clinton campaign or by the Trump campaign on Clinton's e-mail, imagine...</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/law/faculty/maya-manian">Maya Manian</a> of the University of San Francisco School of Law discusses the history of abortion laws, and how <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span> has impacted women's constitutional right to access abortion care...</p><strong>A</strong>s numerous <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/afternoon-round-up-whole-womans-health-v-hellerstedt/">commentators</a> have noted, the Supreme Court's 5-to-3 decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf">Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt</a> [PDF] was a resounding victory for abortion rights, reaffirming and strengthening women's constitutional right to access abortion care. Justice Breyer's <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/supreme_court_dispatches/2016/06/stephen_breyer_s_wonky_abortion_opinion_was_kind_of_perfect.html">wonky</a> opinion in <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span> not only soundly rejected Texas' attempt to shut down abortion clinics under the guise of protecting women's health, but also laid the groundwork for challenging a wide range of abortion restrictions. </p>

<p><span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span> involved a challenge to a Texas <a href="http://data.rhrealitycheck.org/law/texas-omnibus-abortion-bill-hb-2-2013/">law</a> that required abortion clinics to transform themselves into mini-hospitals pursuant to ambulatory surgical center (ASC) rules and abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital. A number of other states have passed similar legislation, known as "<a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/evidence-you-can-use-targeted-restriction-abortion-providers-trap-laws">TRAP</a>" laws because the goal of this "targeted regulation of abortion providers" is to close clinics. Had the Supreme Court upheld the Texas law, the number of abortion clinics in Texas could have dropped from over 40 to about 10, effectively leaving thousands of women in rural areas <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/shuttered">without access to abortion care</a>.  </p>

<p>More broadly, in determining whether or not admitting privileges and surgical center requirements are constitutional, the court clarified the constitutional test for abortion rights established almost twenty-five years ago in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-744.ZS.html">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>. Although <span class="casename">Casey</span> allowed states more leeway to regulate abortion than <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113">Roe v. Wade</a>, the decision still protected women's constitutional right to choose abortion by prohibiting any abortion restrictions that act as an "undue burden" on a woman's right to access abortion care. <span class="casename">Casey</span> defined an "<a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-744">undue burden</a>" as a law that has the "purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion." </p>

<p>However, federal courts disagreed on how the undue burden test should be applied. The Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C14/14-50928-CV0.pdf">upheld</a> [PDF] the Texas law, weakening the undue burden standard in two ways. First, the Fifth Circuit held that the undue burden test places an extremely heavy burden on challengers to prove that an abortion restriction amounts to a "substantial obstacle." Second, while the challengers bore a heavy evidentiary burden to establish a substantial obstacle, in contrast the government bore <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/opinion/greenhouse/CaseyClinic.pdf">almost no evidentiary burden </a>[PDF] to show that the law <a href="http://harvardlawreview.org/2014/02/in-abortion-litigation-its-the-facts-that-matter/">actually serves the asserted state interest</a> in protecting women's health. Other courts read the undue burden test as providing more meaningful protection for abortion access, recognizing the real burdens TRAP laws created, and demanding that the government offer more than its say so that its legal restrictions actually improved women's health. For example, Judge Richard Posner struck down Wisconsin's admitting privileges law in his Seventh Circuit <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2015/D11-23/C:15-1736:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1661222:S:0">opinion</a>, stating: "Until and unless <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span> is overruled by the Supreme Court, a statute likely to restrict access to abortion with no offsetting medical benefit cannot be held to be within the enacting state's constitutional authority." </p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span>, Justice Breyer's opinion<a href="https://verdict.justia.com/2016/07/05/trap-door-closes"> smacked down</a> the Fifth Circuit's approach to the undue burden test. The opinion clarified that the undue burden test actually requires the government to justify its law and requires courts to balance a law's burdens on abortion access against its benefits. Justice Breyer stated that the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of the undue burden doctrine contradicted <span class="casename">Casey</span>, which "requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer." Justice Breyer's analysis also demonstrated that courts must carefully canvas the empirical evidence on both the benefits and burdens of an abortion regulation. Rather than deferring to a state legislature's unsupported assertion that an abortion restriction protects women's health, the majority opinion stressed that the "Court retains an independent constitutional duty to review factual findings where constitutional rights are at stake." (Interestingly, Justice Breyer took this quote from <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/550/124/">Gonzales v. Carhart</a>, which upheld the federal "partial-birth" abortion ban). Justice Breyer concluded: "[N]either of these [Texas] provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes. Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion, each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access, and each violates the federal Constitution." In a brief concurrence, Justice Ginsburg wrote that it "is beyond rational belief that [the Texas law] could genuinely protect the health of women."</p>

<p>In mere weeks since the decision, <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span> has already had a significant <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/30/planned-parenthood-announces-it-will-fight-abortion-laws-in-eight-states-after-supreme-court-ruling/">impact</a> on abortion access. Shorty after the ruling, Alabama's attorney general declared that he would<a href="http://www.wtok.com/content/news/Alabama-attorney-general-ends-fight-over-abortion-law-384604261.html"> not appeal</a> a 2014 federal court <a href="https://ecf.almd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2013cv0405-238">decision</a> striking down the state's admitting privilege requirement. The Supreme Court <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/06/28/scotus_ruling_in_whole_woman_s_health_is_just_the_beginning.html">declined to review </a>challenges to federal appeals court decisions striking down Wisconsin's and Mississippi's admitting privileges legislation. Recently, a federal district court judge <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/us/federal-judge-blocks-indiana-abortion-law.html">blocked</a> an Indiana law banning abortions based on <a href="http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2016/07/thoughts-on-reason-based-regulation-of-reproductive-decision-making-part-i.html">fetal genetic abnormality.</a> </p>

<p>With many more legal challenges <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/us/abortion-ruling-could-create-waves-of-legal-challenges.html?_r=0">expected</a>, the full impact of <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span> remains to be seen. While the case clearly signals the death knell for admitting privileges requirements (and likely the end of surgical center regulations and other types of TRAP laws), a wide range of burdensome <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2016/01/last-five-years-account-more-one-quarter-all-abortion-restrictions-enacted-roe">abortion restrictions</a> remain in place, though thanks to <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span>, perhaps not for long. <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span>'s clarification of the undue burden balancing test and its emphasis on evidence-based analysis puts at risk many abortion restrictions that purport to protect women's health. </p>

<p>For example, a number of states require<a href="https://rewire.news/article/2012/08/01/perverting-informed-consent-south-dakota/"> biased so-called "informed consent"</a> procedures for abortion patients, in-person consultation with a physician twenty-four hours prior to abortion care (or in a few states forty-eight or seventy-two hour waiting periods), and mandatory descriptions of  <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/spibs/spib_RFU.pdf">ultrasounds</a> [PDF]&#8212;all in the name of "protecting" women. However, given the minimal to non-existent evidence that inaccurate medical information, in-person consultations necessitating two trips to a clinic, more than twenty-four hour <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/counseling-and-waiting-periods-abortion">waiting periods</a>, or <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/12/north_carolina_abortion_ultrasound_decision_quotes_from_judge_wilkinson.html">forced descriptions of ultrasounds</a> actually benefit women's informed decision-making, versus the significant <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2009/most-laws-mandating-counseling-and-waiting-periods-abortion-have-little-impact">evidence</a> that these requirements impose substantial burdens on women seeking abortion care, these laws too should fail under <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span>. </p>

<p>Perhaps courts might even reassess laws requiring that teenage girls seeking abortion care obtain parental consent or a<a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/parentalinvolvementlaws.pdf"> judicial bypass</a> [PDF]. The Alaska Supreme Court recently struck down a <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/07/alaska-supreme-court-rejects-parental-consent-requirement-for-under-18-abortions.php">state parental involvement law</a> based on the state constitution's equal protection jurisprudence. Although the US Supreme Court has upheld parental involvement legislation in the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html">past</a>, more recent evidence suggests that these laws fail to achieve their purported goal of enhancing adolescent abortion decision-making, while imposing <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1493768">heavy burdens</a> especially on the most vulnerable minors. <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span>'s emphasis on the need for the government to present scientific data supporting an abortion restriction's asserted benefits should prompt a rethinking of laws mandating parental or judicial involvement, especially when less restrictive alternatives like involving <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1957402">third-party adults</a> or professional counselors are available. </p>

<p>It is less certain how <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span> will impact anti-abortion legislation that purports to advance the government's interest in protecting the fetus, but these laws too should be subject to the stringent analysis set forth by the Supreme Court. For example, some anti-abortion activists are aiming to focus on <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/07/20/486652584/anti-abortion-groups-take-new-aim-with-diverse-strategies">fetal protection laws</a> post-<span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span>, and in particular on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/us/anti-abortion-group-supreme-court-ruling.html?ref=topics&_r=0">"fetal pain" laws</a> banning abortion at twenty weeks post-fertilization. Fifteen states have adopted laws<a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/evidence-you-can-use-later-abortion#full-article"> barring pre-viability abortions </a>at twenty weeks based on the assertion that a fetus can feel pain at that point. Given that this assertion is <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2016/07/11/whole-womens-health-and-the-future-of-abortion-regulation/">scientifically dubious</a>, and that a complete ban on pre-viability abortion is clearly a substantial obstacle, under the Court's balancing test twenty-week bans should be struck down.  </p>

<p>A more recent effort to regulate abortion purportedly to <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20160706-new-texas-rules-would-require-fetal-tissue-to-be-cremated-or-buried.ece">protect the dignity of the fetus</a> arose out of Texas, where regulators quietly issued a <a href="http://www.sos.state.tx.us/texreg/archive/July12016/Proposed Rules/25.HEALTH SERVICES.html#54">proposed rule</a> requiring fetal tissue to be buried or cremated rather than disposed of similarly to other medical tissue. This new <a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/texas-health-officials-propose-new-rules-on-fetal-/nrtFn/">line of attack</a> appears to be <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2016/07/21/abbott-stakes-claim-rule-bury-or-cremate-fetal-rem/">aimed at increasing costs</a> associated with abortion, which could create significant burdens for some women seeking access to care. Although whether such a law actually serves the government's interest in the fetus is harder to assess empirically, if evidence can establish that the the law imposes a substantial obstacle, such regulations should be struck down under <span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span>'s balancing analysis. </p>

<p><span class="casename">Whole Woman's Health</span> stayed true to the principles <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/opinion/the-facts-win-out-on-abortion.html">expressed</a> in <span class="casename">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</span>. Courts and state legislatures should heed the Supreme Court's command that abortion policy must be evidence-based. Laws that purport to protect women's health must actually accomplish that goal, rather than being a cover for attacking women's health by shutting down access to abortion care. Furthermore, laws purportedly serving the government's interest in protecting the fetus must also be scientifically sound and properly weighed against women's right to access abortion care prior to viability. As <span class="casename">Casey</span> emphasized, "The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives." The constitution requires that the government also respect and protect women's equality and dignity in accessing reproductive health care.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.cwsl.edu/faculty-staff-and-campus-directories/faculty-and-staff-directory/g/glenn-c-smith">Glenn C. Smith</a> of the <a href="https://www.cwsl.edu">California Western School of Law</a> discusses what a four-four Supreme Court split means for the future of President Obama's immigration policy...</p><strong>A</strong>s a professor of complex constitutional and statutory law issues, I'm not used to having people answer my questions in one word!  </p>

<p>But a one-word "No" is the proper response to the question headlining my January 27th JURIST column &#8212; <a href="https://www.jurist.org/forum/2016/01/glenn-smith-immigration-policy.php">"In Deciding DAPA Dispute, Will the Justices Reach Constitutional Questions?"</a> In fact, a one-word "No" answers the broader question I would have asked a couple of weeks later, in the aftermath of Justice Scalia's surprising death &#8212; "Will the Justices Reach ANY Questions about DAPA?"</p>

<p>On June 23, 2016, in a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-674_jhlo.pdf">nine-word order</a> [PDF] with no concurrences or dissents, the justices affirmed "by an equally divided court" a <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C15/15-40238-CV0.pdf">lower-court preliminary injunction</a> [PDF] barring implementation of DAPA's immigration relief. In splitting four-four, the court left a host of complicated, important and deeply troubling questions on the table. Unless the justices take the unusual step of granting the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/uploads/United_States_v_Texas_Rehearing_Petition.pdf">administration's request</a> [PDF] that the case be held for rehearing when the court has nine members, it remains unclear when or if these issues will make a return Supreme Court appearance. In the final analysis, then, the enduring legacy of the DAPA dispute could be its graphic reminder of how the dynamics and timing of federal litigation interact and sometimes clash with the quite different dynamics and timing of American politics.</p>

<p><strong> <span class="casename">US v. Texas</span>: The Road to Non-Decision</strong></p>

<p>To recap matters: The Supreme Court was the administration's only hope for un-stalling the high-profile and highly controversial <a href="https://citizenpath.com/dapa-expanded-daca-status/">DAPA program</a> &#8212; the 2014 <a href="http://www.dhs.gov">Department of Homeland Security</a> "Guidance Memo" offering "deferred legal status" (i.e., three years of freedom from deportation, with potential eligibility to work and eventually receive social-security benefits) to millions of undocumented aliens who are the parents or children of the "dreamers" offered deferred status in the prior <a href="http://www.immigrationequality.org/get-legal-help/our-legal-resources/path-to-status-in-the-u-s/daca-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals/">DACA</a> program (itself not under a legal cloud). A federal district judge located near the Texas border found DAPA invalid on administrative-procedural grounds; the court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against DAPA implementation. On appeal, a divided 5th Circuit panel affirmed the ruling and injunction, adding that DAPA was also illegal on statutory-authority grounds.  </p>

<p>In granting review in January, the Supreme Court upped the ante by adding an <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-674_h3dj.pdf">oral-argument question</a> [PDF] going to the heart of the president's constitutional authority. Also suggesting that the court seemed poised to render a major decision were the numerous amicus briefs filed by high-ranking state and federal officials, the longer-than-usual oral-argument time the court scheduled, and the appearance during the argument of counsel representing the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>Yet, all that ultimately came to naught &#8212; in one of several split decisions in the aftermath of Justice Scalia's death and the Senate's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/politics/obama-supreme-court-merrick-garland.html">failure to act</a> on President Obama's <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/merrick-garland-561802">nominee </a>to replace Scalia.  </p>

<p><strong>Key Questions Left on the Table</strong></p>

<p><em>The Constitutional Dimension:</em> The DAPA Dispute could have contributed deeply and broadly to modern understandings of constitutional, statutory, and administrative law. To start at the top, the dispute raised core constitutional questions about reconciling the president's constitutional authority to prioritize law enforcement with the Congress' power to define legal statuses. These questions didn't predominate in the April 18, 2016 oral argument. But constitutional clouds brooded over the entire enterprise. And they occasionally touched down in multi-question exchanges, such as one between Justice Sotomayor and Texas' legal advocate over whether Congress had acquiesced in previous similar exercises of presidential power to defer deportation of unlawfully present aliens.  </p>

<p>Whether a president is acting with Congress's implicit permission, or is instead making and executing his own policy, matters greatly under pragmatic approaches to separation-of-powers doctrines dating back to the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/343/579/case.html">1950's challenge</a> to President Truman's seizure of steel mills during the Korean War &#8212; and used to decide questions of modern presidential authority, such as those surrounding President Carter's foreign-claims-settlement actions to resolve the late-1970's Iranian hostage crisis. Enlightenment from the DAPA Dispute about how to judge the meaning of Congress' actions and non-actions in the immigration area could have contributed more generally to understandings about how to draw the power lines between the president and Congress.  </p>

<p><em>A Host of Non-Constitutional Issues:</em> So, too, could a ruling on the merits in the DAPA Dispute have resolved some of the important and troubling non-constitutional issues raised by the lower-court decisions. Answering threshold questions about whether the state of Texas and the other 25 states joining in the DAPA litigation had "standing" to sue would have gone a long way toward shutting down or encouraging increasingly litigious states to challenge federal-government policies about which they are out of sympathy. (See my <a href="https://www.jurist.org/forum/2016/01/glenn-smith-immigration-policy.php">previous column</a> for an elaboration of the doctrinal framework surrounding "standing.")</p>

<p>Note that, although, conservative "red states" sought in the DAPA lawsuit to challenge the pro-immigrant policies of a Democratic administration, a Supreme Court green light would have emboldened future challenges by "blue states" out of sympathy with executive actions taken by future Republican administrations. Indeed, at oral argument Justice Breyer echoed concerns of the dissenting Fifth Circuit judge, who warned of a "breathtaking expansion of state standing;" in a line of questioning Breyer suggested that if Texas won "every case of political disagreement" between states and the federal government "would come before the Court."</p>

<p>Granted, a sweeping court ruling on these expansive implications was not inevitable. The oral argument highlighted a variety of narrower grounds for decision. To point to just a representative few: The justices could have ruled that Texas' claim of financial injury from having to expend state resources to give driver's licenses to now-"lawfully present" aliens flowed not from DAPA but from state policies and practices within Texas' control. Or the justices could have limited past precedential expressions of "special solicitude" for states defending their sovereign interests to allegations of direct territorial injury, not the "indirect and speculative" financial injuries Texas asserted here. The oral argument even included a subtle theory, championed by Justice Kagan, that Texas' real gripe was not with the DAPA directive itself, but with administrative regulations about the implications of lawful presence &#8212; regulations that could be challenged in administrative proceedings. As Justice Sotomayor then pointed out, Texas' failure to go that route could violate <a href="http://administrativelaw.uslegal.com/judicial-review-of-administrative-decisions/exhaustion-of-administrative-remedies/">familiar requirements</a> to "exhaust administrative remedies."</p>

<p>Finally, the justices were poised to clarify a range of specific, but potentially important questions about the reach and meaning of federal laws in the areas of immigration and government benefits.  </p>

<p>But, of course, none of this clarifying happened.</p>

<p><strong>What Happens Now? Law Meets Politics</strong></p>

<p>In the normal course of federal litigation, the many interesting and troubling questions raised by the DAPA dispute could return to the Supreme Court at a later date. After all, the lower-court DAPA rulings ordered and affirmed a preliminary injunction based on the challengers' predicted likelihood of ultimate success. In many cases, after district-court trial and final orders and a circuit-level appeal, the parties can again petition for Supreme Court review.</p>

<p>But the political timing and dynamics of the DAPA dispute are anything but "normal." Put to one side the fact that Congress' political stalemate over comprehensive immigration reform led the administration to search for non-legislative options in the first place. Still, there's the reality that we are at the end of the administration championing DAPA as the way to afford relief to millions of undocumented aliens who have lived for decades in the shadows of American law and society.  </p>

<p>A Trump administration would certainly rescind the DAPA Guidance. And although Democratic nominee Clinton has expressed support for the Obama administration's immigration initiatives, legal officials in her new administration might find it advisable to revise the DAPA approach in light of the legal objections surfaced to date.</p>

<p>Such political considerations probably figured prominently in the "<a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/uploads/United_States_v_Texas_Rehearing_Petition.pdf">Petition for Rehearing</a>" [PDF] the administration filed with the court on July 18, 2016. Acknowledging that it is  "exceedingly rare" for the court to grant rehearing, the administration nevertheless urged the justices to hold onto <span class="casename">US v. Texas</span> over its summer recess and undertake a new round of oral argument and decision when there is a full nine-justice bench. The administration's filing notes that "the validity of the [DAPA] Guidance is unlikely to arise in any future case" and argues that only the Supreme Court should resolve through nationally binding precedent "a matter of 'great national importance' involving an 'unprecedented and momentous' injunction."</p>

<p>The blithe reference in my previous paragraph to "when there is a full nine-justice bench" of course highlights a second and stark way in which political dynamics and timing are at work here. The Senate Republican majority's refusal to conduct hearings or a vote on justice nominee Merrick Garland leaves it entirely unclear if there will be a ninth justice in the meaningful near future. Those uncertainties no doubt cloud the current eight justices' deliberations about how to handle the rehearing petition (still pending at this writing.)</p>

<p>Thus, although the DAPA Dispute has immediate and heart-felt implications for millions of individuals and their families, DAPA's enduring legal legacy is likely to be as a prominent example of how political dynamics and timing intersect awkwardly with their legal counterparts.</p>

		<title>American Bar Association Attacks Attorney Speech Rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Brad Abramson discusses the new ABA amendment...</p><strong>A</strong>t its recent annual convention the American Bar Association (ABA) adopted a resolution amending <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_8_4_misconduct/comment_on_rule_8_4.html">Rule 8.4</a> of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, the code of ethics that governs attorney behavior.</p>

                <p>The <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/final_revised_resolution_and_report_109.authcheckdam.pdf">amendment</a> adds a new subsection to the attorney misconduct rule which, if adopted by states, will subject attorneys to professional discipline for engaging in "conduct related to the practice of law "that a "lawyer knows or reasonably should know is harassment or discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status or socioeconomic status."</p>

                <p>The adopted change sweepingly defines "conduct related to the practice of law" as including "representing clients, interacting with witnesses, coworkers, court personnel, lawyers and others while engaged in the practice of law; operating or managing a law firm or law practice; and participating in bar association, business or social activities in connection with the practice of law".</p>

                <p>In adopting the new rule the ABA ignored a deluge of opposition from attorneys and attorney groups. During the comment period, 494 comments were filed with the ABA, most of which opposed the amendments. Much of the opposition was based upon concerns that the new rule would violate the constitutionally-protected freedoms of attorneys, including freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion.</p>

                <p>Indeed the ABA's own <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/committees_commissions/disciplinecommittee.html">Standing Committee on Professional Discipline</a> questioned both the need for and the constitutionality of the rule. The committee stated in a letter sent to the ABA that "The Discipline Committee is concerned that the term "related to the practice of law" is ambiguous and that . . . [t]he terms "harass" and "discriminate" absent further definition, are similarly vague. . . We fear that without resolution of these questions and concerns and more precise definitions, lawyers and regulators will be left to guess what conduct may be covered under the proposed Rule. . . The Discipline Committee remains concerned that the proposed Model Rule 8.4(g) is overbroad . . . and therefore questions whether it would withstand a constitutional challenge."</p>

                <p>Similarly the Professional Responsibility Committee of the ABA <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law.html">Business Law Section</a> stated in a letter to the ABA that "[t]he vagueness of the rule . . . raises serious due process concerns."</p>

                <p>These two committees were far from alone in voicing the concern that the new rule may be unconstitutional. In a Washington Post article published a month before the ABA's adoption of the new rule, preeminent constitutional scholar Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor who teaches free speech and religious freedom law, referred to the rule as an "overtly view-point based . . . speech code." "If you express pro-equality viewpoints," Volokh wrote, "you're fine; if you express the contrary viewpoints, you're risking disciplinary action."</p>

                <p>And Edwin Meese III, a former attorney general of the United States, in a letter to the ABA called the new rule "a clear and extraordinary threat to free speech and religious liberty" and "an unprecedented violation of the First Amendment".</p>

                <p>Two recent law review articles one published in the Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics and the other in the University of Alabama Law School's Journal of the Legal Profession both contend that professional rules like the one the ABA adopted violate attorneys' free speech and association rights.</p>

                <p>And a group of 52 ABA member attorneys (of which I was one) in their comment opposing the change, pointed out that Indiana, a state that has amended its Rule 8.4 in a manner similar to the ABA Model Rule change has been enforcing its rule as a free standing speech code, disciplining attorneys simply for engaging in politically incorrect speech. In one of those cases, the attorney was disciplined merely for asking someone if they were gay. In another, an attorney was suspended from the practice of law for applying a racially derogatory term to himself. In neither case was the offending conduct shown to have had any prejudicial affect on the administration of justice. It was deemed sufficient that the attorneys had simply used offensive language. The 52 attorneys pointed out that, under the new rule, an attorney could actually engage in certain criminal conduct without violating the rules, but could be disciplined for engaging in offensive speech.</p>

                <p>In fact some states have already refused to adopt even the earlier and much tamer version of the ABA's Model Rule 8.4(d), citing constitutional concerns. For example, New Hampshire refused to adopt subsection (d) of the ABA's earlier Model Rule 8.4 on the ground that it would violate attorneys' constitutionally protected freedoms, stating that "A lawyer's individual right of free speech and assembly should not be infringed by the New Hampshire Rules of Professional Conduct when the lawyer is not representing a client".</p>

                <p>Despite these concerns the ABA adopted the new rule after less than 27 minutes of "discussion" during which remarkably absolutely no mention was made of the rule's constitutional infirmities. Despite the widespread opposition to the rule, the ABA's "discussion"of the rule consisted of a small parade of ABA insiders' undoubtedly hand-picked because of their support for the new rule, every one of whom encouraged the rule's adoption.</p>

                <p>The ABA's willingness to violate the constitutionally protected freedoms of those whose interests it purports to represent is nothing less than shocking and must be recognized for what it clearly is, an example of ideology overriding any commitment to legal reasoning or constitutional liberty. This is quite an indictment of an organization of lawyers that purports to be the "voice of the American legal profession".</p>

                <p>The only good thing that can be said about the ABA's adoption of the new rule is that it has dispelled any remaining doubt about the real nature of the ABA and has placed it on display for all to see. The ABA has finally completed its transition "begun about 20 years ago" from a legitimate professional organization representing and protecting the interests of American lawyers to a political organization now willing to blatantly assault the constitutional rights of its own constituency in order to advance its ideological agenda.</p>

                <p>If American lawyers do not rise up and clearly denounce the ABA's adoption of a rule of professional conduct that attacks their and their fellow attorneys'; constitutionally protected freedoms, they do not deserve to call themselves "lawyers". </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Henok G. Gabisa</a> of the Bekele Gerba et al International Legal Defense Project discusses the motivation behind Olympic marathoner Feyisa Lilesa's arm-crossed protest at the finish line at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janiero, Brazil... </p><strong>The Underlying National Question in Ethiopia's Marathoner Feyisa Lilesa's Gesture</strong></p>

                <p>Feyisa Lilesa caught the world's attention at the <a href="https://www.olympic.org/">2016 Summer Olympic Games</a> when the marathoner made the gesture of crossing his arms at the marathon's finish line in Rio de Janiero, Brazil. In subsequent interviews, Lilesa made the same gesture as a means of shedding light on the political suffering of his people, the Oromo, at the hands of the ruling regime in Ethiopia. He spoke that thousands were killed over the course of nine months alone in what has become known as "Oromo Protests." While, international human rights organizations report that more than 500 lives were lost, some activists believe this figure instead might exceed 700. An estimated number of over 20,000 people have been imprisoned, and tens of thousands wounded and disappeared; many more are rendered landless, homeless and jobless. </p>

                <p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/08/26/434975424/just-out-of-jail-ethiopian-leader-brings-a-sharp-message-to-obama">Bekele Gerba</a>, the country's most respected leader and well-known for his encouragement of non-violent resistance ideology, was jailed for a second time for terrorism charges in 2015. In 2010, Gerba highlighted the systematic and institutional corruption underlying land policy and laws, but was later <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2011/08/ethiopian-opposition-leaders-detained-after-meeting-amnesty-international-2/">charged and sentenced to eight years on terrorism for speaking to Amnesty International researchers</a> about the human rights situation in Ethiopia. </p>

                <p><strong>The Politics of Land: One of the Epicenter of Ethnic and Social Conflict in Ethiopia</strong></p>

                <p>Land is owned by the state in Ethiopia. More than anything else, land is the lifeblood of the people. According to <a href="http://johnmarkakis.com/">Professor John Marakis</a>, the ongoing popular protest perfectly indicates that "and remains the most valuable resource and that it is the object of perennial conflict and political controversy."</p>

                <p>The ongoing popular opposition finds a meaningful explanation in the regime's land policy, laws and practices. With a disturbing rate of land deals among local and international business elites and individuals within the government's highest echelons (that mostly take place illegally and unconstitutionally-through nepotism against the wider public interest), one can see an increasing significance of land as the major political and ideological instrument. The ongoing phenomena demonstrates, again, the weight behind Markakis's words: "land remains the most valuable resource and that it is the object of perennial conflict and political controversy."<br />
                    <br />
                    The nation-wide social and political crisis was triggered following the <a href="http://oromostudies.org/images/osa/osa-statement-oromo-protests.pdf">Addis Ababa Master Plan</a> [PDF], perceived by protesters as an attempt to remove the Oromo to areas outside of the capital of Addis Ababa (Finfinnee). The regime, even though it later dropped the plan, claimed that the its intention was to solve the dilemma in capital city's business growth by further expanding into the Oromo territories and neighboring districts. No prior consultation, discussion, or deliberation was conducted with the Oromo people, however, though they remain the ancestral owners of the land. Given the significance of economic, political, social and identity characteristics of land in Ethiopia, it is quite fair to dub the Addis Master Plan as the highest show-case of deep-seated grievances highly rooted in policy and practice of land treatment in contemporary Ethiopia. A country with more than 85 per cent of the population's daily livelihoods and existence are strongly attached to agriculture, in Ethiopia land will continue to be a point of contention between the people and the state, that, on the other hand, seeks to use land as a primary means of political and economic control. </p>

                <p>Recent data from Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development shows that the regime has planned, or has already executed the plan, to lease-out "over 3 million hectares [conversion: approximately 11,580 square miles] of land" to private firms for investment in commercial agriculture. Probably, the most nauseating situation came to light in relation to the fact that the authorities never bothered to introduce or implement any form of protection mechanisms for the affected communities; rather, authorities chose to deploy a hostile land law that enabled them to facilitate dispossession and dislocation goals. </p>

                <p><strong>No Due Process of Law; No Fair, Prompt and Adequate Compensation</strong></p>

                <p>Case in point: the <a href="http://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/eth135247.pdf">Federal Land Laws-Proclamation 455/2005</a> [PDF] and <a href="http://www.ethiopianembassy.org/pdf/new-land-lease-proclamation-no-721-20111.pdf">721/2011</a> [PDF] (urban and rural land laws) enables the regime to arbitrarily decide the relocation of the land holders without constitutional due process, or equitable compensation. For example, Section 31(4) of Proclamation No.721/2011 authorizes the police force "to use force to take over the land." Both pieces of legislation stipulate that the expropriation will be executed, regardless, after 90 days following a decision by the tribunal (a non-judicial <em>ad hoc</em> entity made up of members of the regime's executive branch). There is no sufficient means to appeal against relocation and compensation. Further straying from due process mechanisms, according to these statutes a person can only petition the authorities regarding expropriation order after he/she has handed over or relinquished the land in question to the authorities. Given the importance of the land to the Oromo farmers and households in relation to their ancestral land in and around Addis Ababa, it is clear that these laws not only deprive individuals of fair treatment, but also that these laws are part of a systematic, harmful and violent legal framework that authorizes the government to displace and dislocate the Oromo people.  </p>

                <p>Feyisa Lilesa's Oromo protest at the Olympics is an expression of frustration against a deeply-embedded ethnic inequality, and wealth inequality rooted in the regime's policy and practice. The Oromo people remain the primary target and negatively impacted group of this policy under the successive regimes of the Ethiopian State. The country needs a new beginning in order to save itself from what is beholding; and, such is among the motivations behind Lilesa's Oromo-dedicated cross-armed protest at the Olympics.  </p>

		<title>Brazil&#039;s President Impeached: Could It Happen Here?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Joseph H. Marren discusses the impeachment of Brazil's President...</p><br />
                <strong>O</strong>n August 30 Brazil's Senate <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/31/492064070/brazils-senate-prepares-for-final-vote-on-dilma-rousseffs-impeachment">voted</a> to convict Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff on charges that she used improper accounting to cover-up a growing budget deficit and illegal loans from state-owned banks. A recent <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/rough-month-for-small-business-5-000-year-milestone-for-investors-1472728837">WSJ</a> editorial remarked that millions of Americans are probably wondering why they cannot impeach Washington politicians for similar fiscal offenses. The question is timely in this political season and the correct answer is that federal politicians and certain executive officers can be impeached for publishing financial reports that do not adhere to the requirements of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/overview">United States Constitution</a>. </p>

                <p>The federal government's budget deficits and debt are exponentially higher than what has been reported. None of the headline figures used as the basis of public discourse have any relevance to the true state of the government's finances. The <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/combStmt/current_rpt.htm">Combined Statement of Receipts, Outlays, and Balances</a> which is the "official" Statement and Account, the President's Budget and the Financial Report of the United States Government are the three relevant financial reports published by the federal government. Collectively and individually they make untrue statements about material facts, omit to state numerous material facts and hide material facts in footnotes. </p>

                <p>How could this be true? It is because "Money" is not "Money" when the Executive and Legislative branches are interpreting <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section9">Article I, Section 9, clause 7</a> of our Constitution. </p>

                <p>"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time." </p>

                <p>The first part is called the <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/tocs/a1_9_7.html">Appropriations Clause </a>and the second part is called the <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/tocs/a1_9_7.html">Statement and Account Clause</a>. Different interpretations of "Liability" a key component of Money, in the two clauses are the vehicle used to perpetrate the financial reporting fraud on the American people. It must be noted that since the nation's founding, the Supreme Court has not opined on the meaning of the Statement and Account Clause, including how it interacts with the Appropriations Clause.</p>

                <p>The General Accountability Office's September 2005 "A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process" defines "Liability" as follows:<br />
                <blockquote>Liability - Defined differently for obligation (or budgetary) and proprietary (or financial) accounting purposes. <br />
                    Obligational (or budgetary) accounting, designed to ensure compliance with fiscal laws, is based on the concept of legal liability. A legal liability is a claim that may be legally enforced against the government. It may be created in a variety of ways, such as by signing a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement or by operation of law. <br />
                    Proprietary (or financial) accounting, designed to generate data for financial statement purposes, is based on the concept of accounting liability. For federal financial statement purposes, a liability is a probable future outflow or other sacrifice of resources as a result of past transactions or events.</blockquote></p>

                <p>Thus for Appropriations purposes Liability includes all legal obligations that Congress enacts and funds with appropriations. However for Statement and Account purposes Liability specifically excludes vast amounts of legal obligations that are fully funded with appropriations. The practical result is that expenses and obligations are significantly understated in all of the government's financial reports.   </p>

                <p>The Statement and Account Clause and Appropriations Clause are yoked together for a reason. Legislation that has been legally enacted and fully or partially funded with permanent appropriations must be reflected in the Statement and Account and other financial statements to the full extent of that funded obligation. Accounting principles governing federal financial reporting declare that legally enacted legislation that is fully or partially funded with permanent appropriations is not a legal obligation for accounting purposes that needs to be recorded in the Statement and Account or any of the nation's financial statements.     </p>

                <p>The government's accounting rules regarding permanent appropriations as well as off-balance sheet agencies and corporations cannot be reconciled with the Statement and Account clause's "all public Money" requirement. It has no exceptions for entities or programs that our politicians want to put off-budget, off-balance sheet, describe only in footnotes or eliminate entirely from its financial statements. The three major items that are fraudulently reported include: <br />
                    -- The Federal Reserve System, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with total assets of $4.5 trillion, $3.2 trillion and $2 trillion, respectively, are not consolidated into the government's financial statements.</p>

                <p>-- The federal government's $24.2 trillion net present value obligation for Medicaid was reported for the first time in the 2010 Financial Report and was buried in the back of this and subsequent reports. Omitting the disclosure of material information, as was done from the creation of Medicaid through 2009, violates the laws against fraud, and the Supreme Court's "buried facts"; doctrine which appears in its securities law decisions suggests that even current reporting is unlawful. The amount reported in the 2015 Financial Report was $27.3 trillion.</p>

                <p>-- The total adjusted net present value obligation for Medicare and Social Security that is fully funded with appropriations reported in the 2015 Financial Report's Statement of Social Insurance and related footnotes is $46.3 trillion. But the SOSI does not interrelate with the other financial statements and no current expenses are recorded for required future payments. </p>

                <p>The government's accounting rules mislead voters about the consequences of their votes and they make a mockery of the idea of political accountability. The federal government's financial reporting leaves voters with no idea about the actual total amount of its expenditures. Furthermore voters cannot send the responsible politicians packing because they have retired from Congress. Their current representatives say that their hands are tied on mandatory spending and that they cannot be held accountable. </p>

                <p>Why has this happened? The federal government has controlled financial reporting and thereby public opinion to minimize its accountability for spending. Politicians do not want to be held accountable for the full extent of their spending and, generally, wish to make re-election easier for incumbents. Hence, they collude to underreport appropriations and expenses. Proper reporting would lead to spending cutbacks, tax increases and/or recriminations for overspending, all of which are likely to cause voter dissatisfaction and changes at the polls. </p>

                <p>Why does it matter? The upcoming presidential election continues a lifetime tradition for citizens of casting their votes without the benefit of having access to an accurate and complete published account of the government's total receipts and expenditures. Congress's failure to publish a complete and truthful statement and account of the nation's finances has made our republic dysfunctional, plagued by successive budget-deficit and debt-ceiling crisis. This fraud has brought the government to the brink of financial Armageddon. Furthermore since none of the government's financial reports complies with the Constitution's requirements several private rights have been violated including the right to vote, freedom of speech, due process, equal protection, the right to financial information and political accountability. Finally, it has created a perpetual fraud on the judiciary. </p>

                <p>The federal government has known for a very long time that its accounting standards setting process is unlawful. In 1921 Congress delegated responsibility for determining and defining the accounting principles and policies to be used by the federal government to the Comptroller General, the highest ranking officer of the General Accountability Office, an agency controlled by it. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5404111148263183259">Bowsher v. Synar</a> the Supreme Court made it crystal clear that Congress cannot delegate lawmaking authority to a delegate of the Legislative branch. </p>

                <p>James Madison once remarked: "A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a tragedy; or, perhaps both." We have reached the stage where federal financial reporting is both a farce and a tragedy. Primary responsibility for the fraudulent and unconstitutional financial reporting by the federal government lies with the leadership on both sides of the aisle in the House of Representatives and the Senate. A large number of Senators and Congressmen as well as senior Executive branch officials have violated their oath to uphold the Constitution and, arguably, they have committed "high crimes" providing a basis for their impeachment. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Stephen Cooper discusses Proposition 62...</p><strong>N</strong>o righteous, freedom-loving Californian believes human beings should be executed for possessing or selling pot. Indeed, we rightly cringe at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/05/kill-drug-dealers-medal-philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte">megalomaniac</a> entreaties (such as, kill drug dealers and "I'll give you a medal")of military strongman, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who incites, and has himself been directly <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-philippines-20160914-snap-story.html">linked</a> to mass extrajudicial killings of Filipinos for non-violent drug crimes.</p>

                <p>We tsk-tsk and, secretly or not so secretly, we pat ourselves on the back for being so much more evolved.</p>

                <p>Putting aside for a minute, the distant and distasteful asterisk of Newt Gingrich&#8217;s proposed &#8220;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/house-bill/4170">Drug Importer Death Penalty Act of 1996</a>,&#8221; as conservative and liberal Americans in California, we wonder: How could social mores in the Philippines descend so low it becomes acceptable&#8212;and more than that, praised by the government&#8212;for vigilantes to kill over drug crimes? What became of the rule of law?!</p>

                <p>We forget, as Don Jackson of <em>The Los Angeles Free Press</em> <a href="http://losangelesfreepress.com/city-council-passes-death-sentence-for-selling-pot/">reported</a> on April 10, 1970, that in California, &#8220;[t]he death sentence [was once] voted by the Bakersfield City Council for a second conviction of selling marijuana or illegal drugs. Councilman Robert Whitemore, who introduced the legislation said [at the time], &#8216;Unless severe measures are taken, an entire generation will be destroyed by dope.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

                <p>As <a href="http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DS19700408.2.17">reported</a> that same month by <em>The Desert Sun,</em> even then-Governor Ronald Reagan &#8220;hinted he might favor capital punishment for some hard drug peddlers. Asked what he thought of [the] Bakersfield City Council resolution calling for life imprisonment or the death penalty for persons convicted twice of selling hard drugs [which at that time wrongly included marijuana, just as the federal government continues to wrongly classify it as a "hard drug" today], Reagan said he thought there was &#8216;some justification&#8217; for considering dope pushers as dangerous as murderers.&#8221;</p>

                <p>In California, and across this great land, we long ago came to the realization as a people, through our democratic institutions and ideals&#8212;even ardent admirers of capital punishment, Ronald Reagan (and, yes, even Gingrich)&#8212;that it&#8217;s immoral for the state to execute a person over drugs.</p>

                <p>Another famous, former California Governor, the Honorable Earl Warren, who later became Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, were he still alive, would observe, &#8220;our standards of decency&#8221; have &#8220;evolv[ed],&#8221; thereby &#8220;[m]ark[ing] the progress of a maturing society.&#8221;</p>

                <p>On November 8, by voting for <a href="http://yeson62.com/">Proposition 62</a> and against Proposition 66, Californians can take that next critical step forward towards <a href="http://timesofsandiego.com/opinion/2016/07/23/proposition-62-would-finally-halt-the-machinery-of-death-in-california/">marking</a> our progress as a maturing society.</p>

                <p>We aren&#8217;t married to the death penalty but if we were, given its dastardly, dysfunctional and discriminatory history, it's well-nigh time for a divorce. By guaranteeing life without the possibility of parole for &#8220;the worst of the worst,&#8221; we can, as peaceful, justice-loving citizens, properly and respectfully honor the victims of homicide and their families.</p>

                <p>Without compromising our morality, as the competing ballot initiative, Proposition 66 would require, we can finally reject the antiquated, eye-for-an-eye mentality, at capital punishment&#8217;s ignoble roots&#8212;an ideology steeped in revenge, hatred, even bloodlust.</p>

                <p>As President Lincoln beautifully counseled at the close of his first inaugural address following the United States&#8217; gloomy upheaval of secession, the time is now for us to look to the &#8220;better angels of our nature,&#8221; and end capital punishment. Moreover, also attributable to Lincoln: &#8220;Let&#8217;s have faith that right makes might; and in that faith let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.&#8221;   </p>

                <p><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Nicholas M. Wooldridge of <a href="https://www.lvcriminaldefense.com//">LV Criminal Defense</a> discusses the need for federal expungement legislation...</p> <br />
                This article is currently under review<br />
                <!--<br />
<b>Introduction</b></p>

<p><strong>D</strong>o ex-offenders who successfully complete their sentence deserve a chance to wipe the slate clean? The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recently answered that question in <span class=&#8221;casename&#8221;><a href=&#8221; http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/15-1967/15-1967-2016-08-11.html&#8221;>Jane Doe v. United States</a></span>. In <span class="casename">Doe</span>, the petitioner had filed a motion for expungement and chronicled the deleterious impact of her criminal conviction for a 1997 car accident fraud scheme, which had resulted in her inability to secure a job as a health aide. The district court, Gleeson J., granted the petition in 2015 and noted, &#8220;I sentenced her to five years of probation supervision, not to a lifetime of unemployment.&#8221; The government appealed and the Second Circuit reversed in a published opinion on August 11, 2016. While the Second Circuit opinion did express sympathy for Ms. Doe and suggested that Congress should consider allowing federal judges to have the ability to erase old convictions, it held that courts lacked jurisdiction to expunge records of lawfully obtained criminal convictions. </p>

<p>At present, the correctional system in the United States supervises over <a href=&#8221; http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus13.pdf &#8220;>6,899,000 persons</a> [PDF]. Recent studies reveal that between <a href=&#8221; http:// www.wsj.com/articles/how-many-americans-have-a-police-record-probably-more-than-youthink-1438939802 &#8220;>25 and 35 percent of the adult population</a> of the US has a criminal record. The numbers are staggering. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) adds over <a href=&#8221; http://www.wsj.com/articles/as-arrest-records-rise-americans-find-consequencescan-last-a-lifetime-1408415402 &#8220;>10,000 names to its database each day</a>. Approximately one-third of adults have been arrested by age 23. Together, local, state and federal law enforcement agencies are approaching 250 million arrests, resulting in close to 80 million individuals in the FBI criminal database. The FBI retains this information to <a href=&#8221; http://ir.stthomas.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1090&context=ustlj&#8221;>classify defendants</a> [PDF], despite the fact that many arrests never even lead to convictions due to volume pressures on prosecutors, uncooperative witnesses, or insufficient evidence. And this information is not just in FBI databases. Due largely to digitalization of criminal record information, and an under-regulated criminal background check market that exists on the Internet, the days of chasing a criminal record on paper are over. Consequently, executive branch agencies, courts, administrative offices related to the justice system and commercial databases all contain this information.</p>

<p>With corrections among states&#8217; largest expenditures, many state legislatures, criminologists, as well as some segments of the law enforcement community believe the pendulum has swung so far to the &#8220;law and order&#8221; side that it is placing a serious burden on state prisons, police, courts and judges while costing tax payers billions of unnecessary dollars every year. As numerous commentators have noted elsewhere, while mass incarceration gets the most attention, mass criminalization and life-long collateral consequences that attach are probably a more serious problem given the effect of a criminal record following contact with the criminal justice system, even if only once. Given this reality, expungement at the federal level, which currently does not exist, should be a priority. Indeed, what good is federal sentencing reform if those released back into society have no incentive or means to start over? </p>

<p>If we are to make punishment work to reduce re-offending and mitigate significant societal costs of both crime and punishment, criminal justice reform efforts must prioritize a federal expungement law to mitigate the collateral consequences of a conviction for offenders after their return to society. As made clear by the Second Circuit&#8217;s decision, beyond the conviction, there must be certainty that both the punishment and the societal costs of an offender&#8217;s conviction will come to an end. </p>

<p><b>A Federal Expungement Law Should Be a Priority</b></p>

<p>While criminal justice reform efforts of the past year focused almost singularly on eliminating or reducing a few mandatory minimums for drug offenses and <a href=&#8221; http://jurist.org/hotline/2016/2/nicholas-wooldridge-sentencing-reformphp&#8220;>appear to be dead in the current Congress</a>, after the current election is over, the new president and Congress will have a second chance to revisit criminal justice reform. </p>

<p>At present, most policy makers, as well as judges ignore the collateral consequences of a criminal conviction. Policy makers and judges have swiftly brushed off the consequences of conviction and imprisonment as &#8220;collateral consequences,&#8221; not worthy of consideration or simply blamed the offender, &#8220;he has no one to blame but himself.&#8221;  However, once an offender is labeled &#8220;a convicted felon,&#8221; even without having served a significant term of imprisonment, he will face insurmountable institutional and legal impediments that prevent him from ever even having a real shot at &#8220;rehabilitation.&#8221; There must be a date certain when an offender who has paid his debts to society is allowed to move on with his life. As noted by <a href=&#8221; https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-loretta-e-lynch-delivers-remarks-national-reentry-week-event&#8221;>Attorney General Loretta Lynch</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Too often, Americans who have paid their debt to society leave prison only to find that they continue to be punished for past mistakes. They might discover that they are ineligible for student loans, putting an education out of reach. They might struggle to get a driver&#8217;s license, making employment difficult to find and sustain.  Landlords might deny them housing because of their criminal records&#8212;an unfortunately common practice. They might even find that they are not allowed to vote based on misguided state laws that prevent returning citizens from taking part in civic life. [T]oo often, the way that our society treats Americans who have come into contact with the criminal justice system&#8230;turns too many terms of incarceration into what is effectively a life sentence. </blockquote>


<p>Indeed, an offender convicted of a felony offense who serves his sentence without incident, will not magically turn his life around and become a doctor, a lawyer, a judge or licensed professional. Instead, he will be disenfranchised at almost every turn. In most cases, a felony conviction will result in the loss of the right to vote; preclude future employment in many licensed professions; and even the run-of-the-mill jobs that require a background check. A felony conviction will also exclude many offenders from accessing education, federal and state benefits and even housing. <br />
 <br />
<b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>After the current election, the new president and Congress will have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to potentially reduce re-offending, as well as the significant societal costs of both crime and punishment. Having even a minor criminal history now carries lifelong barriers that can <a href=&#8221; https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/VallasCriminalRecordsReport.pdf &#8220;>block successful reentry and participation in society</a> [PDF]. This is due in large part because of the range of collateral consequences that inhibit full reentry and because regulations and statutes, e.g., <a href=&#8221;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681c&#8221;>the Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> (FCRA), allow consumer reporting agencies to share arrest and conviction information. Having a criminal record, whether it consists of a conviction or an arrest, can affect an individual&#8217;s ability to find employment and housing, obtain public assistance or enroll in educational programs and maintain custody or other domestic rights. </p>

<p>Finally, employment barriers, which resulted in Jane Doe&#8217;s petition, discussed above, are perhaps the most damaging. Most states have statutes barring the hiring of&#8212;and regulations prohibiting licensing of&#8212;those with <a href=&#8221; http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/45/2/Articles/45-2_Jenny_Roberts.pdf&#8221;>criminal convictions for certain positions</a> [PDF]. In sum, if the policy aim of punishment in America is to reduce re-offending, help ex-offenders to live lawful lives and protect communities, then a federal expungement law must be a priority in any criminal justice reform effort. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST 2016 Law of Armed Conflict Contributing Editor <a href="http://law.emory.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/faculty-profiles/blank-profile.html">Laurie R. Blank </a> of the <a href="http://law.emory.edu/">Emory University School of Law </a>discusses recent political comments concerning application of law during times of war...</p><strong>T</strong>he apparent deliberate bombing of a <a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.html">UN</a> relief convoy bringing lifesaving supplies to the beleaguered population of Aleppo, Syria was the epitome of the no-holds-barred approach to <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/09/un-investigators-violence-on-the-rise-in-syria.php">conflict </a> [JURIST] that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime has taken since the conflict began in 2011.  Contrary to Assad's blatant disregard for human life, however, there are clear rules prohibiting such acts precisely to minimize suffering and enable efforts to sustain and preserve human dignity during war -- rules codified in international treaties for over 150 years. Unfortunately, recent discourse here in the US poses an extraordinary danger to this essential framework.</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.gop.com/">Republican </a> Presidential candidate Donald Trump announced that if he has been in charge in 2003 -- and going forward if he were to become Commander-in-Chief -- the US should "take all the oil out of Iraq," and use it for its own purposes, including sale and use of the revenue for any purpose.  His basis for this statement was an anachronistic "to the victor belong the spoils" theory.  In response to questions about this proposition, former New York Mayor Rudolf Giuliani, a regular stand-in for Trump, stated emphatically that, "until the war is over, anything is legal."  </p>

<p>The statement is wrong on two levels: first, taking the oil out of Iraq violates international law and the law of armed conflict; and, second, there is a remarkably robust and comprehensive framework of law that applies specifically in war to regulate the conduct of hostilities and the protection and treatment of persons.  </p>

<p>At a deeper level, however, the claim that "anything is legal" in war presents an existential challenge to the very nature of law as an essential tool to minimize suffering during wartime.  Fifteen years after 9/11 and the many legal issues the attacks and subsequent conflicts have engendered, this argument is incomprehensible -- and highly dangerous.  It goes beyond the now-familiar claims that the law does not work effectively to counter terrorist groups or that the law should be interpreted narrowly (to exclude certain protections and duties), or quite broadly (to encompass certain rights and authorities).  All of those highly problematic claims nonetheless rest on a shared - if quite frayed in the context of those arguments - notion that law exists and plays a role in wartime.  In contrast, to say that "anything is legal" in war is to turn the law solely into a tool of empowerment and to eliminate altogether any conception of law as restraint, as parameters, as guidance.</p>

<p>First, the specifics: the idea that the US  could simply take over Iraq's oil wells - either back in 2003 or now - and pump the oil out for its own benefit utterly disregards sovereignty, the fundamental ordering structure of the international community.  It also flies in the face of established international law for nearly a century and a half.  </p>

<p>Both <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/hague02.asp">The Hague Conventions of 1899</a> and <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague04.asp">1907</a>, and the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/GC_1949-IV.pdf">Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949</a> [PDF, report] affirm that an occupying power does not acquire an unfettered right to use, destroy, exploit, and otherwise take advantage of the territory, property, and natural resources of the occupied country.  Rather, an occupying country is a caretaker that administers the occupied territory and must preserve the status quo as much as possible.  Although an occupying power may use the natural resources and public property of the occupied territory where necessary for its own military purposes, such use does not extend to expropriation for development, financial, or other purposes.</p>

<p>Occupation is not a license to bleed a country dry; the days of war as conquest are long over.  International law protects a nation's sovereignty, even when it has been occupied -- the occupied country does not cease to exist, and it retains its territory, population, and the rights and duties owed to that population.   </p>

<p>But it is the overarching message about law and war that is so troubling and must be rejected.  Historically, it has been <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cicero">Cicero</a>'s famous statement, penned in Ancient Rome, that formed the backdrop to highlight advances in the legal framework applicable during war. <em>Silent enim leges inter arma</em>, (often also rendered as: <em>inter arma enim silent leges</em>), Cicero wrote, popularly translated as, "in times of war, the law falls silent."  Interpreted to mean that the law did nothing to constrain leaders and the government during war, Cicero's powerful critique of conditions at the time has consistently been used in modern times as the contrast to highlight the importance of protecting individual rights in war and times of crisis. </p>

<p>The idea that laws fall silent during war is, of course, highly problematic and raises the specter of the unfettered executive of which the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> has warned in the past, and the horrific attacks on relief convoys and hospitals across Syria and other conflict regions.  But, a claim that in war "anything is legal," poses an entirely different scope of danger.  If anything is legal, that means not only that the law fails to restrain the government and protect citizens in its usual manner, but that the law actually empowers the government to take action directly contrary to individual rights, another nation's sovereign rights, or any of the other concerns that animate modern international law and the law of war.</p>

<p>A German military doctrine from the early 1900s called <em>Kriegsraison </em>theorized that military necessity could trump international law whenever needed; it was roundly rejected at the <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/outreach/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007722">Nuremberg tribunals</a>, and in national courts in the years since.  Even that never-accepted theory began with the idea of law as a restraint, and then sought ways around it. "Anything is legal" turns law into a farce, a simple window-dressing at best, and a tool for great harm at worst.</p>

<p>In direct contrast to the law of war's core purposes of protecting civilians from harm during war, minimizing unnecessary suffering of combatants, and enabling effective and moral military operations, an "anything is legal" construct would simply enforce as legal the government's every whim and desire in the pursuit of power and military conquest.  No less, one can only envision how quickly such a government might transition to that same approach in the domestic arena as well.</p>

<p>When Cicero's words that <em>in times of war, the law fall silent</em> begins to look like a positive trend, it's time to speak up on behalf of the law, and reinforce its essential role in wartime just as in peacetime.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="voting" src="https://www.jurist.org/images/wiki/16/04/voting.jpg" width="613" height="413" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /><p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/law/faculty/torres-spelliscy-ciara/">Ciara Torres-Spelliscy</a> of <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/portal/law/">Stetson University College of Law</a> discusses how Kansas, Georgia and Alabama pushed forward with efforts to require additional proof of citizenship by new registrants, despite the Supreme Court decision on invalidating state's requirements on proof of citizenship beyond the federal requirements... </p><strong>I</strong>n my new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corporate-Citizen-Argument-Separation-Corporation-ebook/dp/B01J2SLAIG/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=">Corporate Citizen?</a> I contend that corporate political rights have expanded too far through Supreme Court cases like <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/08-205">Citizens United</a> and <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/435/765/case.html">Bellotti</a>. I argue that the best antidote to corporate political power is empowering flesh and blood American voters.  </p>

<p>Sadly since <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000/00-949">Bush v. Gore</a> in 2000, many states have done just the opposite: making it harder for voters to exercise the franchise. But fortunately, voting rights advocates have been actively fighting to protect voters' rights in court. In September 2016, there was a significant win for voters in <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/LWV-v.-Newby-DC-Cir.-Order-Sept.-9.pdf">League of Women Voters v. Newby</a> [PDF] in the D.C. Circuit Court.</p>

<p>Here's the background of the <span class="casename">Newby</span> case. Kansas, Georgia and Alabama have been trying to make voting harder for voters through a series of restrictive voter ID laws. Another approach of these states has deployed is forcing voters to produce documentary evidence that they are American citizens when they register to vote.  </p>

<p>Asking for documentary proof of citizenship may sound reasonable enough, at first blush, but this runs afoul of the federal "motor voter" law which bars states from asking for additional information when voters register to vote using a standard federal form. The whole point of the motor voter law (whose formal name is <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-national-voter-registration-act">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</a>), was to make it easier for eligible Americans to register to vote when they were at the local DMV.   </p>

<p>While the legislators who pass these restrictive voting laws may think they are barring non-citizens from voting, instead these laws can disenfranchise regular Americans, especially those who were <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2014-03-28/news/48634147_1_certificate-viviette-applewhite-south-carolina">born at home</a> instead of a hospital. These Americans may find it difficult, or well neigh impossible, to produce documentation of their birth proving that they are who they know they are: American citizens. </p>

<p>Arizona tried a similar tactic of asking for proof of citizenship from new registrants, but the state was rebuffed by the Supreme Court. The court held in <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-71">Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc.</a>, 133 S. Ct. 2247 (2013) that the federal motor voter law preempted conflicting state law, that the state had to follow the federal law, and it could not add an additional requirement of asking for proof of citizenship without the permission of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC). The EAC later ruled that asking for additional proof of citizenship was invalid for the federal form, which already asks individuals to swear they are citizens under penalty of perjury. </p>

<p>Following the Supreme Court decision on Arizona's proof of citizenship requirements, Kansas, Georgia and Alabama pushed forward with efforts to require additional proof of citizenship by new registrants. But they took the extra step of asking the Election Assistance Commission for permission to ask voters for additional proof. In an unusual move, Brian D. Newby, Executive Director of the Election Assistance Commission granted the request for Alabama, Georgia and Kansas. Voting rights advocates sued to overturn Newby's decision.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the new restrictive laws had their intended restrictive effect. For example, in Kansas, according to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-votingrights-kansas-insight-idUSKCN0YN4AQ">Reuters</a>, 14% of new registrants between 2013 and 2015, were placed on a list of ineligible voters for failure to produce the necessary documentation to prove their citizenship. </p>

<p>On September 9, 2016, a federal court ruled in <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/LWV-v.-Newby-DC-Cir.-Order-Sept.-9.pdf">League of Women Voters v. Newby</a> [PDF] in the plaintiffs favor, and ordered "that the [US] Election Assistance Commission ..., and anyone acting on its behalf, be enjoined from giving effect to the January 29, 2016, decisions of its Executive Director, Brian D. Newby, approving requests by Kansas, Alabama and Georgia to add a proof of citizenship requirement to the state-specific instructions that accompany the National Mail Voter Registration Form..."</p>

<p>Perhaps one reason why the plaintiffs won was the Department of Justice (DOJ), which would typically be expected to side with the federal agency, sided with the plaintiffs instead. In the <a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000153-09c8-de04-af73-cfcb7e040001">DOJ's brief</a>, the government encouraged the court to enjoin the actions of EAC's Newby because "in deciding to include the states' documentary proof of citizenship requirements on the federal form, the Executive Director [Newby] did not make the determination that this information was 'necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration and other parts of the election process.' 52 USC. § 20508. Because the National Voter Registration Act permits only information satisfying this 'necessity' requirement to be included on the federal form, the Executive Director's decisions are not consistent with the statute."</p>

<p>The good news is that unless this case is overturned by a Supreme Court which is currently split 4-4, and therefore unlikely to have the five votes necessary to dislodge this case, voters in Alabama, Georgia and Kansas who would have unable to vote in the presidential and other federal elections, can vote. </p>

<p>Despite this victory for voters, Kansas voters may still be negatively impacted by Kansas's restrictive efforts. While the <span class="casename">Newby</span> ruling applies to federal elections, Kansas is still trying to keep voters who can't produce documentary proof of citizenship from <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/yael-t-abouhalkah/article89110057.html">voting in state and local elections</a>. Though in a late breaking ruling, a court has halted this latest effort of Kansas to thwart voters in local and state elections. So the battle continues to allow every American voter to vote without impediments. </p>

<p>American citizens need voting to be easier, so that the American people can make their choice of elected representatives from local races to the presidency. They have to make that choice in an echo chamber of noisy political ads bought by corporate-backed super PACs, thanks to <span class="casename">Citizens United</span>. The way to lessen the impact concentrated wealth in our elections is put as few barriers in the way of real (human) citizens casting ballots. The <span class="casename">Newby</span> decision is an important step in the correct direction of restoring voters to their rightful place at the center of our democracy.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href=&#8221;http://www1.rmit.edu.au/browse/About%20RMIT%2FContact%2FAll%20contacts%2FStaff%2Fby%20name%2FB%2F;ID=st3cwvrc6ovv;STATUS=A;>Greg Barns</a> of <a href="http://www.rmit.edu.au/about/our-education/academic-schools/graduate-school-of-business-and-law">RMIT University Graduate School of Business and Law</a> and <a href+http://www.lawyersalliance.com.au/about/about-us/anna-talbot&#8221;>Anna Talbot</a> of <a href=&#8221;http://www.lawyersalliance.com.au/&#8221;>Australian Lawyers Alliance</a> discuss the need for improved policies regarding refugees in Australia...</p>

                <p><strong>O</strong>n Tuesday Australia&#8217;s Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, stood in front of world leaders and claimed his government&#8217;s refugee policy was the best in the world. But many people in Australia will tell you that Mr. Turnbull&#8217;s boasting was misplaced.  Over the past decade Australia has pursued an expensive, inhumane policy that has inflicted suffering on thousands of desperate people who have been detained in hell holes in Australia and offshore.<br />
                    <br />
                    In fact, our country has spent, and is continuing to spend billions of dollars detaining and further traumatizing refugees and asylum seekers for years once they show up on our doorstep. Asylum seekers don&#8217;t come to Australia anymore. Boats carrying these vulnerable people are turned around in international waters, in direct contravention of international law. Increasing levels of governmental secrecy seek to distance our population from the inhumanity that we inflict.<br />
                    <br />
                    Australia&#8217;s policy is based on deterrence, building on 15 straight years of fear mongering and demonization of the world&#8217;s most vulnerable by Australia&#8217;s political elite. In 2001, the &#8216;children overboard&#8217; affair ushered in a new era of lies, which would come to characterize policy around asylum seekers and refugees. The then-Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, accused asylum seekers of throwing their children off the boat they were on in an effort to manipulate Australian authorities into offering assistance. The asylum seekers were in fact trying to ensure that their children were safe. The boat was sinking beneath them.  A few months prior to this disgraceful episode Mr. Howard had refused entry into Australian waters of a cargo vessel, the Tampa, which had rescued asylum seekers whose boat was sinking.<br />
                    <br />
                    We have spent $A9.6 billion over the past three years on our refugee policy. It consists of an immigration detention system that includes two offshore detention centers on the impoverished Pacific Island nation of Nauru and on Manus Island, off the coast of Papua New Guinea, mandatory onshore immigration detention, and turning back asylum seeker boats (usually to countries where the occupants face persecution, torture and even death). <a href=&#8221;http://www.unicef.org.au/Upload/UNICEF/Media/Documents/At-What-Cost-Report.pdf&#8221;>UNICEF</a> [PDF] estimates that Australia spends at least $A400,000 detaining each individual asylum seeker in offshore detention each year. It costs less than half that to detain a single prisoner. Then there is the disastrous deal with Cambodia, where the Australian government handed over $A40 million in aid to that nation in exchange for four, yes four, asylum seekers being resettled there.<br />
                    <br />
                    What do Australians get for their money? On Nauru and Manus Island, it causes immeasurable damage. A cache of more than 2000 incident reports known as the <a href=&#8221;https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files&#8221;>Nauru Files</a> was recently released by the <em>Guardian</em> newspaper. It details terrifying levels of despair. Threats of self-harm are reported on a near weekly basis. Actual self-harm, including suicide attempts, are reported nearly as regularly. Sexual assault of children is rife, with numerous reports of guards and others touching young girls. One child described how someone had &#8216;cut me from under&#8217;, pointing to the vagina area of a cut out doll to further clarify what had happened to her. Another child reported being handed a sexually-explicit note by a local guard. The note is <a href=&#8221;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/08/nu-files/pdf/sca150284.pdf&#8221;>reproduced</a> [PDF] in the incident report. In child-like lettering, it invites the recipient to &#8216;come and kiss my pins&#8217;; &#8216;come and gigey xxx&#8217;; &#8216;come and kiss my botm&#8217;.<br />
                    <br />
                    Asylum seekers also face threats in their host communities. A number of women on Nauru have been violently raped. Children have been sexually harassed by local children and guards. Men in Papua New Guinea have been brutally beaten. Some fear that if they report a crime against them, they will be targeted by perpetrators in the local community, or that it will affect their asylum application. So there may be many more incidents of abuse that are not recorded.<br />
                    <br />
                    There have also been deaths. One man died in a riot on Manus Island in February 2014. The <a href=&#8221;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1418272553524/Manus-Island-report-.pdf&#8221;>inquiry</a> [PDF] that followed said that the events were eminently foreseeable. Locals entered the center and assaulted detainees. Non-essential staff fled. Asylum seekers and refugees were on their own, and a 23-year-old asylum seeker lost his life, beaten to death.<br />
                    <br />
                    Another man detained on Manus Island <a href=&#8221;http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2016/04/25/4447627.htm&#8221;>died of septicemia</a> in August 2014. A rash on his leg was allowed to fester, in the face of increasingly urgent demands from doctors that he be flown for essential treatment, first to Port Moresby and then to Australia. Resistance and delays on the part of the Department meant that, by the time he finally landed in Brisbane, he was probably already brain dead.<br />
                    <br />
                    This year, Nauru saw two self-immolations. One of these people, a male refugee, died. Again, there were delays in evacuating him to Australia for medical treatment, which his wife <a href=&#8221;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/29/wife-of-man-who-died-after-setting-fire-to-himself-in-nauru-slams-delay-in-care&#8221;>believes</a> caused his death.<br />
                    <br />
                    Accounts of rape are terrifying. An epileptic woman was raped in the midst of a seizure on Nauru, becoming pregnant as a result. Rather than respond to such horror with compassion, the Minister for Immigration sought to fly the woman concerned to Papua New Guinea (where abortion is illegal) for the termination that was medically necessary, due to the woman&#8217;s mental state and epilepsy. Her advocates were required to get a <a href=&#8221;http://www.smh.com.au/national/federal-court-finds-australia-owes-nauru-rape-victim-a-duty-of-care-20160506-goohbm.html&#8221;>court order</a> earlier this year to stop the Minister from forcing her to undergo the procedure in a country completely unequipped to meet her medical needs.<br />
                    <br />
                    The Australian Human Rights Commission last year released a <a href=&#8221;https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/publications/forgotten-children-national-inquiry-children&#8221;>report</a> detailing the physical and psychological impact of this ongoing detention on children. The President of the Commission, Gillian Triggs, was complemented for the quality of the report&#8217;s data when she was at the United Nations. No other country had produced such a compelling document on the impact of detention on children. Of course, no other country could. Australia is unique in the lengths it will go to in its &#8216;world&#8217;s best&#8217; asylum seeker deterrence policy.<br />
                    <br />
                    Some health workers in these facilities have disclosed what they have seen in an attempt to stop the damage and mistreatment. Paul Stevenson specializes in helping people live after experiencing trauma. He has attended all major Australian disasters over the last four decades, including a massacre, a tsunami and a bombing. Confronting trauma every day for nearly half a century, however, Stevenson <a href=&#8221;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/20/the-worst-ive-seen-trauma-expert-lifts-lid-on-atrocity-of-australias-detention-regime&#8221;>describes</a> what he confronted in Nauru and Papua New Guinea as the worst he has seen. He lost his job after he came forward.<br />
                    <br />
                    Dr. Peter Young, a former psychiatrist in detention facilities, has <a href=&#8221;https://www.humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/Dr%20Young.pdf&#8221;>given evidence</a> [PDF] to the Australian Human Rights Commission that detention causes mental illness. He revealed significant levels of mental illness among children in a report he provided to the Department. The Department&#8217;s response, rather than seeking to make children safer, was to ask for the relevant figures to be withdrawn from the report. Dr. Young told the Commission that medical recommendations were being overridden by the Department at a concerning rate. His phone records were later reviewed by the Australian Federal Police due to suspicions he was sharing confidential information.<br />
                    <br />
                    Australia&#8217;s policy of deterrence has focused on stifling these voices, rather than responding to their concerns. Last year, it became illegal under Australian law for any workers in immigration detention facilities to talk about what they had seen. The penalty is now two years in prison. Doctors have said they are concerned about the impact of this law on their ability to care for detainees. While the government has said it is not the intention to interfere with the work of medical staff, the law is clear.<br />
                    <br />
                    This is just a selection of the inhumanity that this &#8216;world&#8217;s best&#8217; policy is inflicting. There is no end to the astonishingly cruel lengths Australia will go to, to deter requests for help.<br />
                    <br />
                    Strong borders are not what is required for public acceptance. It is strong leadership that we need, and it has been sadly lacking on both sides of Australian politics for at least 15 years. Australia now has the dubious reputation of having exported the most inhumane refugee systems in the world. This is not something to boast about, Mr. Turnbull.<br />
                    <br />
                    Australia&#8217;s is not a policy to replicate. It is a policy to condemn. The world&#8217;s asylum crisis will not be solved by inhumanity and cruelty. It requires kindness and generosity. Imagine the good that could be done if Australia&#8217;s budget for cruelty could be redirected to helping people in desperate need.</p>

		<title>The Dakota Access Pipeline:  A Legal Environmental Justice Perspective</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Dayna Jones, a law student at <a href="https://law.lclark.edu/">Lewis and Clark Law School</a>, discusses the intersection of law and environmental justice concerning the the Standing Rock Sioux Nation and the Dakota Access Pipeline...</j:header></p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he largest multi-tribal gathering of indigenous peoples in North America in over a century is happening <em>now</em> at the <a href="http://sacredstonecamp.org/">Sacred Stone Camp</a> in North Dakota. Leading the cause is the <a href="http://standingrock.org/">Standing Rock Sioux Nation</a>. The Standing Rock Sioux and their allies are standing against construction of the "black snake" <a href="http://www.daplpipelinefacts.com/">Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL)</a> slated to run under the Missouri River and through their historically-sacred tribal sites. The tribe states it has not been properly consulted prior to construction of the DAPL, a requirement legally mandated by <a href="http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/nepapub/nepa_documents/RedDont/Req-EO13175tribgovt.pdf">Executive Order 13175</a> [PDF]. Executive Order 13175 stipulates that: "[e]ach agency shall have an accountable process to ensure meaningful and timely input by tribal officials in the development of regulatory policies that have tribal implications."</p>

<p>The Standing Rock Sioux Nation's assertion that the <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil/">Army Corps of Engineers</a>, an executive agency charged with overseeing and granting pipeline permits, has failed to meet the clearly-enunciated requirement of <em>meaningful consultation</em>, makes this case one of the strongest Native American environmental justice legal claims in history. Environmental justice, a paradigm born of a merger between civil rights and environmental movements, is unique in Native American communities. This unique status stems from the legal classification of tribes as domestic dependent nations, sovereign as political (rather than racial) entities, yet still under the plenary authority of <a href="http://www.house.gov/">Congress</a>, as per <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution</a>. The plenary authority of Congress over the tribes derived from the Constitution is a stretch at best, as Native Americans predate the Constitution. Nonetheless, the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> has established a solid judicial body of law giving Congress, and only Congress, the ability to act in good faith as wards over the affairs of Indian Country, such as the 1886 case of <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/375/case.html"><u>US v. Kagama</u></a>.</p>

<p>The murky law governing Native American jurisdiction and right to self-determination has not been consistent, and is reflective of the political leanings of decision-makers in any given era. For example, in 1823 Chief Justice Marshall referred to tribes as "savages" in the landmark case of <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/21/543/case.html"><u>Johnson v. M'Intosh</u></a>, affirming the doctrine of discovery. Despite the overtly-racist language Justice Marshall flaunted in this opinion, it has never been overturned and is still cited today. Conversely, Congress has acquiesced to the need for greater legal protections in Indian country from time to time. One of the greatest examples of this acquiescence is found in the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/nagpra/mandates/25usc3001etseq.htm">Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA)</a>. The NAGPRA requires that excavation or removal of Native American cultural items be done under procedures set out by the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf">Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA)</a> [PDF], and in tandem with careful consultations with the Tribe. One of the intended goals of NAGPRA was to encourage the <em>in situ</em> preservation of tribal archaeological sites, particularly those that contain burials or other cultural items. </p>

<p>The Standing Rock Sioux have made it clear that the proposed route for the Dakota Access Pipeline runs directly through sacred burial sites and artifacts. Together with their allies, they have been demanding their legal rights to consultation be observed. Standing Rock Sioux <a href="http://standingrock.org/tribal-council">Tribal Chairman David Archambault II</a> stated: "I am not asking that you stop this pipeline, I'm asking that you do a full EIS [Environmental Impact Statement]."  Yet, just one day after Standing Rock Sioux nation filed a request for an injunction due to newly found culturally significant artifacts and sites, Dakota Access bulldozed through the land, and hired a private security force armed with attack dogs and mace to deter the Tribe from trying to halt construction. The owners of the Cannonball Ranch, where some of the contested area is located, buckled under the pressure of conflicting interests surrounding the DAPL, and sold the land to Dakota Access in September 2016. This land sale was made both without consultation to the Tribe, and without regard to the full knowledge of the vulnerable sacred sites and artifacts buried beneath the surface there. This purposeful failure to meet the requirements of tribal consultation is a direct breech of law on the part of Dakota Access, and gets to the heart of environmental justice.</p>

<p>Environmental justice looks different in each marginalized community, and there are no one-size-fits-all problems or solutions. As discussed in their 2001 law review article <em>Racializing Environmental Justice</em>, Jen-L Lyman and Eric Yamamoto wrote that for Native Americans, environmental justice often revolves around the effects of land dispossession, culture destruction and loss of sovereignty rather than equality and integration. The effects of these colonial measures have directly caused many Native American communities to suffer under conditions of poverty, economic vulnerability, and limited political capacity. As a ward over the tribes, Congress has the ability and responsibility to enact legislation to their benefit. What good is this guardianship if the meager protections provided are ignored without penalty or recourse (as is in the case of Dakota Access)?  </p>

<p>In addition to the violations of the ARPA and NAGPRA, the Standing Rock Sioux have suffered a legal and environmental justice violation by the failure of the government to adhere to the National Environmental Policy Act. NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate effects of proposed federal agency actions on tribal interests. The Standing Rock Sioux Nation's sole water source, the Missouri River, will be crossed under several times if the Dakota Access Pipeline is completed. As a people with an average annual income of $4,421 who primarily make their living off of cattle ranching and farming, the Tribe's interest in the Missouri cannot be overstated. Still, there has not been a rigorous consultation process among the members of the Federal government and the Tribe regarding the potential environmental hazards of a pipeline affecting their water supply. In 2013 alone, the US suffered <a href="http://www.eenews.net/stories/1059999364">7,662 spills, blowouts, and leaks across 15 states with pipelines</a>. Such a spill in the area at issue could obliterate the only clean water supply to which the Tribe has access, and consequently endanger the lives of those working and living in the vicinity. Yet still, the requirement of meaningful involvement of the peoples has not been recognized. </p>

<p>Dakota Access has made clear its deliberate intention to violate the rights of the Standing Rock Sioux through action; however, the Tribe continues to battle fiercely in opposition to such intentions. Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.co.morton.nd.us/index.asp?SEC=%7BF66ECC52-5D04-437C-B12D-21C09801849E%7D">Morton County Sheriff's Department</a> is providing enforcement power to this intention: just this past week, over 21 water protectors were arrested while holding a prayer ceremony to protect the land and water. Now, the world is watching to see if the federal government will step up to honor its federal-trustee relationship with the Standing Rock Sioux Nation and demand their meaningful involvement in the decision-making process around DAPL or if this will instead turn into another chapter to be written into American history books narrating one more tragic case of indigenous erasure.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://content.law.virginia.edu/faculty/profile/mg5cm/2131153">Michael Gilbert</a> of the University of Virginia School of Law discusses a decision by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on the <span class="casename">Newby</span> case, in reaction to Alabama, Kansas and Georgia's requirement on proof of citizenship before voting...</p>
<strong>F</strong>or years, states have been sounding the alarm about voter fraud and pushing laws to prevent it. One such law would require voters to prove their citizenship, with a birth certificate, passport, or the like, before casting a ballot. This month a federal court slapped down proof-of-citizenship laws, but not for good. The opinion leaves wiggle room, and state lawmakers are not giving up. They are, however, wasting their effort. Anti-fraud measures can make elections safer in some circumstances, but usually they either have no effect (other than creating red tape) or make matters worse. My <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2488645">research</a> proves it. </p>

<p>Let's get up to speed. In 2004, Arizonans approved an <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Taxpayer_and_Citizen_Protection,_Proposition_200_(2004)">initiative</a> requiring voters to prove their citizenship before they could vote. In 2013, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-71_7l48.pdf">held</a> [PDF] that federal law&#8212;specifically, the National Voter Registration Act&#8212;preempted the initiative. That Act requires states to use a form, developed by the federal Election Assistance Commission, to register voters for federal elections. The form requires would-be voters to swear, under penalty of law, that they are US citizens. States can ask the EAC to add state-specific instructions to the federal form, including additional requirements on citizenship, but they cannot demand it. </p>

<p>Other states&#8212;Alabama, Georgia, Kansas&#8212;adopted laws like Arizona's, and they worked many channels to get them enforced. But their efforts failed. <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article92683522.html">States courts</a>, <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/AZ_KS_registration_110714.pdf">federal courts</a> [PDF], and the <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/129-1 Memorandum of Decision.pdf">EAC</a> [PDF] put proof of citizenship on ice. </p>

<p>Until January. That's when Brian Newby, the EAC's executive director, granted permission to Alabama, Georgia and Kansas to require proof of citizenship while using the federal form. <span class="casename">Newby</span>'s decision, which came with little explanation, generated heat. Thomas Hicks, an EAC commissioner, <a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/Statement by Commissioner Hicks NVRA Form (2-2-16)-1.pdf">publicly rebuked</a> [PDF] <span class="casename">Newby</span>, saying he exceeded his authority and contradicted EAC policy. When civil rights groups sued, the Department of Justice refused to support Newby, siding with the plaintiffs instead and urging a federal judge to block the decision. This left Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, to defend the EAC in court. </p>

<p>On September 9, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/14C80589DDE01F4F8525802A00009F33/$file/16-5196CHMJ.pdf">ruled against</a> [PDF] Kobach and company, ordering the EAC to remove proof-of-citizenship requirements from the federal form. On September 26, the court issued an <a href="http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/9-26-16 DC Circuit opinion Newby.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF] explaining its order. With respect to <span class="casename">Newby</span>'s decision, the court wrote, "it is difficult to imagine a more clear violation of the APA's requirement that an agency 'must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action[.]'" The court also rejected the argument that eliminating proof of citizenship would leave states vulnerable to voter fraud. </p>

<p>Fear of voter fraud anchors this entire controversy. According to<a href="http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article77519827.html"> Kobach</a>, "there is a significant problem in Kansas and in the rest of the country of aliens getting on our voting rolls." Fraudulent voting violates law, cancels out lawful votes, and could, in just the right case, swing an election. Proof-of-citizenship requirements should mitigate that risk, or so goes the argument. </p>

<p>But the risk of fraud is infinitesimally small. As the DC Circuit Court wrote, "there is precious little record evidence" of voter fraud. After much digging, Kobach identified 18 non-citizens who tried or successfully registered to vote in Kansas between 2003 and 2015, only one of whom used the federal form. These numbers are consistent with<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/"> other studies</a>, and they are trivial. Kobach has secured only a <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article77519827.html">handful of convictions</a>, and none of his targets showed intent to game the system. </p>

<p>If proof-of-citizenship requirements came with no downside, these small numbers wouldn't matter. All fraudulent voting is bad, and less is better than more. But there is a downside: Many citizens can't prove their citizenship. Lost birth certificates, tattered passports, missing driver's licenses, forms, fees and trips to government offices&#8212;these obstacles would keep lawful voters from the ballot box if proof-of-citizenship laws took effect. Kobach claims to have found 18 fraudulent voters in 12 years. How many people lost their birth certificates during that stretch? </p>

<p>The tug-of-war between stopping fraud and suppressing turnout has dominated headlines and litigation, but it misses another, deeper problem. Anti-fraud efforts might not work. They might make the problem, such as it is, worse.</p>

<p>Consider this example. Candidates Amy and Bob compete in an election, and each unwittingly receives 1,000 fraudulent votes. That's a lot of fraud, but it all cancels out, and lawful votes determine the outcome. In the next election, Kobach rides to the rescue, imposing a proof-of-citizenship requirement. It prevents non-citizens from registering and voting, but it does not stop citizens from voting multiple times or other forms of voter fraud. Thanks to Kobach, the number of fraudulent votes shrinks, but not to zero. Now Amy gets 500 fraudulent votes and Bob gets 50. That's a lot less fraud, but it doesn't cancel out, and it might determine the election. Bob should win, but thanks to her big lead in fraudulent votes, Amy wins instead. The anti-fraud measure caused the problem it's supposed to prevent. </p>

<p>Behind this example lies a simple but important idea. The number of fraudulent votes cast for each candidate doesn't matter. What matters is the gap between them. In the example, the gap went from zero to 450, even as the number of fraudsters fell. The election became less safe. </p>

<p>To see this from another angle, suppose Amy and Bob used to get 500 and 50 fraudulent votes, respectively, when they competed in elections. In recent years, fraud surged, and now they get 1,000 illegal votes apiece. No one welcomes fraud, but that doesn't change the logic: The election has gotten safer. </p>

<p>Let's be clear about what this means. Even if proof-of-citizenship laws do not suppress a single lawful vote, they can backfire, causing exactly the problem they are designed to avoid. To prevent this, lawmakers need information not about the total amount of fraud but about the fraud gap. </p>

<p>One might challenge my example. There is no reason to suppose that proof-of-citizenship laws will systematically cut one candidate's fraudulent vote totals by more than the other's. Rather than going from 1,000 fraudulent votes apiece to 500 and 50, a proof-of-citizenship law might change the fraud totals to, say, 400 apiece. That could happen&#8212;and if it does the law is pointless. The election is just as safe as before, only now poll workers and voters have to deal with a cumbersome rule. </p>

<p>One can keep tinkering with these examples. One can complicate them by adding the realistic assumption that proof-of-citizenship laws not only affect fraudulent votes but also suppress some lawful votes. One can extend the analysis by thinking about proof-of-citizenship's cousin, voter ID laws. In a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2488645">recent paper</a>, I did this work, and I found that in some circumstances, anti-fraud measures make elections safer. But in a much larger set of circumstances, they either have no effect (but still impose regulatory costs) or they make matters worse. </p>

<p>Which circumstance prevails in Kansas? Does Kobach know whether a proof-of-citizenship law would help rather than hurt? Of course the answer is no. Lawmakers champion these laws without having thought through their basic logic. </p>

<p>The DC Circuit's decision stopped proof of citizenship, but only temporarily. The case involved a preliminary injunction, not a decision on the merits, and litigation marches forward. But perhaps courts will catch on. Perhaps they will see that, like many policy issues, making elections safer is tricky, and ham-handed efforts cannot be justified. Perhaps they will see that even if proof of citizenship does not suppress votes&#8212;a heroic assumption&#8212; proponents of these laws are still fumbling in the dark. They have neither the theory nor the information necessary to sustain their position. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.barry.edu/law/future-students/faculty/staff/mmorley.html">Michael T. Morley</a> of Barry University School of Law discusses the recent <u>Newby</u> case in regard to the necessity of proof-of-citizenship required by Alabama, Georgia and Kansas ... </p>

<p><strong>C</strong>itizenship, a time-honored concept that traces back to the world's earliest republics, is generally accepted as a legitimate requirement for membership in a political community. Most people agree that only US citizens should be permitted to participate in federal, state and local elections in the US. Despite broad agreement about this seemingly uncontroversial premise, deep rifts exist over whether states should be permitted to take meaningful action to ensure that non-citizens do not inadvertently or deliberately register to vote or go on to cast ballots.  In its recent ruling in <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/14C80589DDE01F4F8525802A00009F33/$file/16-5196CHMJ.pdf">League of Women Voters of the United States v. Newby</a> [PDF], the DC Circuit continued the trend of invalidating reasonable, narrowly tailored measures aimed at limiting the vote to US citizens on the grounds they were purportedly not "necessary." <br />
	<br />
<strong>A.	The National Voter Registration Act Requires States to Accept the "Federal" Voter Registration Form Created by the US Election Assistance Commission</strong></p>

<p>As I have <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2840497">explained</a> at greater length elsewhere, the Constitution grants Congress power to regulate federal elections, but not to <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2742719">determine</a> voter qualifications for those elections. Rather, states have the constitutional prerogative to determine the requirements a person must satisfy to be eligible to vote, though a person cannot be denied the right to vote based on <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxv">race</a>, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxix">gender</a> or <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxvi">age</a>, for those who are at least 18 years old. Every state in the nation has exercised this power to limit the right to vote in state and federal elections to US citizens.<br />
  <br />
In 1993, Congress enacted the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/subtitle-II/chapter-205">National Voter Registration Act ("NVRA")</a> to increase voter participation. It requires states to "accept and use" the "federal" voter registration form created by the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/">US Election Assistance Commission </a>("EAC") to register people to vote in federal elections. The EAC's <a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/Federal Voter Registration_6-25-14_ENG.pdf">federal registration form</a> [PDF] does not require a person to provide proof of citizenship in order to register. Rather, a person need only check a box confirming his or her <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/20508-">citizenship</a>. </p>

<p>Concerned that this parchment barrier is insufficient to deter or prevent non-citizen voting, the State of Arizona required people who registered using the form to provide documentary proof of citizenship&#8212;such as a copy of a birth certificate, passport, or naturalization papers&#8212;before their registration was deemed complete. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-71_7l48.pdf">Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc.</a> [PDF], the Supreme Court held that the NVRA requires states to accept the EAC's federal registration form as sufficient, on its own, to register people to vote in federal elections. States may not require people to submit documentation in addition to the form to confirm their eligibility to vote.</p>

<p>The Court recognized, however, that "it would raise serious constitutional doubts if a federal statute precluded a State from obtaining the information necessary to enforce its voter qualifications." It noted that the NVRA allows a state to ask the EAC to "alter the Federal Form to include information the State deems necessary to determine eligibility." If the EAC refuses, the state may sue to demonstrate that the EAC is "under a nondiscretionary duty to include [the state's] concrete evidence requirement on the Federal Form" because "a mere oath will not suffice to effectuate its citizenship requirement." The court emphasized that a state could also assert "that it would be arbitrary for the EAC to refuse to include [its] instruction when it has accepted a similar instruction requested by Louisiana." Thus, the court laid out a compromise: states had to accept the federal registration form, but the EAC could be required to amend the form to require proof of citizenship.</p>

<p><strong>B.	Newby Undermines State Citizenship Requirements for Voting </strong></p>

<p>Initially, the EAC did not take the hint. It rejected requests from three states to include state-specific instructions with the federal registration form that directed applicants from those states to provide documentary proof of citizenship with their applications. The EAC held that such a requirement was not necessary&#8212;in the sense of being absolutely, unavoidably essential&#8212;to prevent non-citizens from voting, because states could instead take applicants at their word when they claim to be citizens on the form, or threaten to prosecute non-citizens who vote. The EAC <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/129-1 Memorandum of Decision.pdf">held</a> [PDF] that the "small numbers of...noncitizens" who had successfully registered in those states was insufficient to establish a need for additional safeguards. The Tenth Circuit upheld these determinations, and the Supreme Court denied review. </p>

<p>Shortly after certiorari was denied, Georgia, Kansas and Alabama submitted new requests to the EAC to have the federal registration form's instructions changed. Due to vacancies on the commission, Executive Director Brian Newby considered the requests and, as contemplated by Inter Tribal Council, granted them. The League of Women Voters and several other left-wing groups immediately sued, seeking a temporary restraining order to prohibit the EAC from changing the instructions. Remarkably, the Obama Administration's Justice Department ("DOJ") refused to even attempt to defend Newby's actions. Instead, the DOJ not only joined in the plaintiffs' reques, but went even further and asked the court to enter a preliminary injunction against the revisions. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, as well as the Public Interest Legal Foundation, were permitted to intervene to defend Newby's actions. </p>

<p>The district court refused to issue a preliminary injunction on the grounds that the plaintiffs had failed to show that including the revised instructions on the federal form would cause irreparable injury.  The DC Circuit <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/14C80589DDE01F4F8525802A00009F33/$file/16-5196CHMJ.pdf">reversed</a> [PDF] in a 2-1 decision. Chief Judge Judith W. Rogers and Senior Judge Williams held that the revised instructions, requiring people to provide documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote, inflicted "irreparable injury" on the plaintiff organizations by making it more difficult for them to register people. The court made this ruling in a single conclusory paragraph, without citing any authorities for the dubious proposition that additional administrative or paperwork burdens constitute the sort of irreparable harm for which interim injunctive relief is available. </p>

<p>The heart of the court's opinion was its conclusion that Newby's actions were likely to be held invalid because he did not expressly consider whether changing the instructions was "necessary" to prevent non-citizen voting. Again, the court construed the word "necessary" to mean absolutely, unavoidably required, without considering the legislative history of the term, precedents construing that term in other statutes more liberally, or its use in other, comparable laws. Senior Judge A. Raymond Randolph dissented, recognizing that having "to spend more time and money in their registration drives" does not constitute irreparable injury entitling the plaintiffs to a preliminary injunction. Moreover, he held that the Constitution prohibited the EAC from preventing states from enforcing their voter qualification laws by refusing to direct voters to provide proof of citizenship with their federal registration forms.  </p>

<p><strong>C.	"Necessity," Non-Citizen Voting and the NVRA</strong>	</p>

<p>One major issue at the heart of <span class="casename">Newby</span> and other litigation concerning the EAC's federal voter registration form is what a state must prove in order to have the form's instructions changed. The <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:52%20section:20508%20edition:prelim)">NVRA</a> provides that the form may require only such "information . . . as is necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant." The EAC and the <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/14/14-3062.pdf">courts </a> [PDF] that have sided with it have construed the term "necessary" strictly, to mean absolutely, indispensably required. The alternatives that the EAC and courts have been willing to accept as sufficient to defeat any such claimed necessity&#8212;simply asking applicants to check a box on the registration form to confirm their citizenship, threatening to prosecute non-citizens who can be shown to have willfully broken the law&#8212;are unsatisfactory and ineffective alternatives to a simple, objective, <em>ex ante</em> proof-of-citizenship requirement. </p>

<p>As far back as <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/17/316#writing-USSC_CR_0017_0316_ZO">McCulloch v. Maryland</a>, the Supreme Court has recognized that the term "necessary"&#8212;especially when devoid of modifiers such as "absolutely"&#8212;often does not mean "indispensable" when used in the legal context, but rather "reasonably useful." As the court explained:</p>

<blockquote>If reference be had to its use, in the common affairs of the world...we find that [the word "necessary"] frequently imports no more than that one thing is convenient, or useful, or essential to another. To employ the means necessary to an end, is generally understood as employing any means calculated to produce the end, and not as being confined to those single means, without which the end would be entirely unattainable.... The word "necessary"...admits of all degrees of comparison; and is often connected with other words, which increase or diminish the impression the mind receives of the urgency it imports. A thing may be necessary, very necessary, absolutely or indispensably necessary.</blockquote>

<p>Courts often interpret the word "necessary" in federal statutes such as the Americans with Disabilities Act in this more <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2012/07/20/baughmanopinion.pdf">flexible sense</a> [PDF]. Nothing in the NVRA's legislative history supports the extreme interpretation that the EAC and <span class="casename">Newby</span> have adopted. </p>

<p>Opponents of proof-of-citizenship requirements frequently contend that proof-of-citizenship requirements are unnecessary because non-citizens are too scared to draw attention to themselves by registering to vote, and have little to gain by doing so. Such theoretical arguments ring hollow in light of the fact that hundreds of non-citizens have been found registered to vote in states such as Florida and Arizona. Moreover, non-citizens have repeatedly been willing to publicly identify themselves as undocumented immigrants in political protests or when making highly publicized political speeches at <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/10/us/texas-undocumented-valedictorian-trnd/">graduation ceremonies</a>, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/xxx-undocumented-immigrant-testifies-at-senate-hearing-on-immigration-reform/">before congressional committees</a>, and even at the internationally televised <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/02/12/first-lady-michelle-obamas-state-of-the-union-guest-list/">Democratic National Convention</a>. Indeed, First Lady Michelle Obama <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/02/12/first-lady-michelle-obamas-state-of-the-union-guest-list/">invited an undocumented immigrant</a> to sit in her box at the 2013 State of the Union address. In light of President Barack Obama's general reluctance to enforce federal immigration law&#8212;as exemplified by his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival ("DACA") and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans ("DAPA") programs&#8212;as well as the numerous "sanctuary cities" that refuse to cooperate in the enforcement of immigration laws, at least some undocumented immigrants do not appear concerned with drawing public attention to themselves and may not believe they face a realistic threat of deportation. Particularly if energized by prevailing notions on the left that immigration laws and voting restrictions are unjust, it is quite conceivable that undocumented immigrants or other non-citizens may be inspired to register and vote. </p>

<p>Much greater than the threat of deliberate fraud, however, is the perpetual possibility of ordinary bureaucratic mistakes. Non-citizens may inadvertently be encouraged to vote by overzealous participants in voter registration drives&#8212;particularly if those conducting the drives are required to meet registration quotas or are paid based on the number of completed registration forms they submit. Non-citizens who do not read English well or are simply not paying close attention reasonably may misunderstand the federal registration form's question concerning citizenship or answer it incorrectly. And such errors are highly unlikely to be caught and corrected afterwards. The NVRA imposes <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/20508">strict limits</a> on when states may update their voter registration lists, the circumstances under which they may correct mistakes, and even the process they must use to do so. Thus, as interpreted in cases such as <span class="casename">Newby</span>, the NVRA not only requires states to register people to vote in federal elections without confirming their eligibility, but also makes it difficult for them to remove ineligible non-citizens from their voter rolls.  </p>

<p>In short, requiring applicants to provide proof-of-citizenship is a common-sense backstop to help prevent the types of routine errors that inevitably arise when millions of people are filling out a particular form. In that sense, a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/20508-">proof-of-citizenship requirement</a> is "necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant." Newby (Brian) got it right; <span class="casename">Newby</span> (DC Circuit) got it wrong. </p>

		<title>Referendum in Republika Srpska Held Despite the Decision of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Fahira Brodlija of <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a>, LLM Class of 2017, discusses the recent referendum and court decisions regarding Republic Srpska...</j:header> <strong>T</strong>he specific constitutional framework of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) and the governmental structure which arises out of it has provided for a constant need for a balancing act in day-to-day politics. Considering the fact that each legislative and executive decision at the state and entity level must be in accordance with the interest of all three constituent peoples (Bosniacs, Serbs and Croats), the decision making process can be slow and inefficient. When the element of intentional obstruction is brought into the equation, then the results on the overall socio-political balance in the country can be devastating. </p>

<p>Power struggles and gridlock are not a foreign factor in the politics of BH, and their effects have significantly slowed down the process of the accession and integration of BH into the European Union. The question then becomes whether the mechanisms in place for the protection of each constituent people within the country are permanently preventing the initiation of attempts for the more progressive approach in the mutual interest of the entire country and all its citizens? It seems that fragmented regulation and scrutiny of the same issues at the state and entity levels have lead to the decrease of adherence to the constitutional powers delegated to the state government bodies.</p>

<p>A clear example of this effect is the Referendum held in Republika Srpska (RS) at the entity level. This event has caused uproar both at the domestic and international level. Namely, after the legislature of RS had declared January 9th as the Day of Republika Srpska, this declaration was brought before the constitutional court of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Bosniac member of the tripartite Presidency (the state executive branch) for judicial review. The constitutional court has declared the decision unconstitutional. The reasoning was the lack of consent by representatives of the other two constituent peoples in RS to such a decision. The President of Republika Srpska immediately made it clear that this decision of the Constitutional court is unacceptable and that it will not deter his commitment to proceeding with the initial decision. Following the statements, the referendum of September 25, 2016 was announced. The constitutional court responded by issuing an order to discontinue the implementation of the referendum on this issue.<br />
 <br />
However, the referendum took place regardless of the decision and order of the constitutional court. This was the first referendum held on the territory of BH in its post-Dayton history. According to the results from 71 percent of the counted votes, 99.79 percent of the votes were in favor of the holiday. The turnout was estimated at between 59 and 60 percent of 1,219,399 registered voters. Officials in the RS stated they were satisfied that the voting went peacefully, while RS President Milorad Dodik stated that the referendum would become historic. The State Prosecutorial Office has since summoned Dodik for questioning in relation to his disregard of the decision of the constitutional court of BH. </p>

<p>The reaction of the international community was vocal in its opposition to the referendum itself, declaring it illegal. Most prominently, the US State Department issued a statement calling upon all parties in BH to cease divisive activities and to focus on pressing socio-economic matters. The US also guaranteed support to the local government in holding the RS accountable for undermining the rule of law.</p>

<p>The long-term impact and influence of the referendum are yet to be seen since the question of the interest of one constituent people was sought to be resolved in a way which undermines the authority of the highest court of the country. Such acts can be extremely harmful for the integrity and balance of powers within the country itself. From the perspective of the EU and its authorities, this can be another indicator of the internal instability of the country which could further delay its path to becoming a EU member state.</p>

		<title>Why the Supreme Court is not a Key Issue in the Presidential Election&#8212;and Why it Should Be</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/contributing/2016/scotus/ross.php">William G. Ross</a> of the Cumberland School of Law discusses the implications that the choice to vote for either presidential candidate in this upcoming election will have in the Supreme Court... </p> <strong>S</strong>ince this year's presidential election is likely to tip the ideological balance of the US Supreme Court, judicial appointments ought to have emerged as a leading campaign issue. The candidates and the voters, however, are expressing little interest in the election's consequences for the court. This is not as surprising as it may seem, for judicial issues rarely have figured prominently in presidential elections, even though the appointment of Supreme Court justices and other federal judges often are among a president's most important legacies. </p>

<p>If ever there were a year when judicial issues should be at the front and center of a presidential campaign, 2016 is the year. In contrast with most previous election years, the prospect of Supreme Court appointments is not merely hypothetical. The next president is certain to make at least one appointment to the court because there is already one seat vacant following Antonin Scalia's death in February and the Senate's failure to act on President Obama's nomination of Merrick B. Garland. There has not been such a certainty of an appointment since the election of 1968, when Chief Justice Earl Warren had announced his intention to resign and the Senate had tabled President Johnson's nomination of Abe Fortas as his successor. Hillary Rodham Clinton's election presumably would tip the balance of the Court since she would almost certainly nominate someone much more liberal than Scalia, even if she would need to temper her choice if Republicans retain the Senate. Although Donald J. Trump's selection of a conservative to replace to Scalia would merely restore the close ideological balance of the Court, there is a substantial possibility that Trump could tilt the Court in a firmly conservative direction since the Court's most liberal members are also the oldest and are the most likely to depart the court during the next four years. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court's arch-liberal, is 83, the relatively liberal Stephen J. Breyer is 78, and the court's swing voter, Anthony M. Kennedy, is 80.</p>

<p>The election therefore could have enormous consequences for a multitude of controversial constitutional issues, including voting rights; abortion; criminal procedure; the scope of congressional regulatory powers; affirmative action; government aid to religion; and campaign financing. The next president, like all presidents, will also make important appointments to the lower federal courts. </p>

<p>These issues, however, may be too complex and nuanced for a campaign that is dominated by sound bites, trivia and drivel. Judicial issues were not mentioned, even peripherally, during the first presidential debate, which became so mired in personal recriminations that important policy issues were completely ignored or only superficially addressed. In a world in which the polar ice caps are melting, a debate that delved into a candidate's snarky comments about a beauty queen's girth was hardly the kind of forum in which the candidates would notice the Supreme Court. Judicial issues likewise were ignored even in the more substantive and wide-ranging vice presidential debate, aside from Timothy M. Keane's passing expression of approval for <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span>.</p>

<p>Finally, in the second debate on October 9, the Court literally took center stage when the candidates were questioned about it. </p>

<p>Describing the court as "one of the most important issues in this election," Clinton averred that "the current court has gone in the wrong direction" and vowed to nominate Justices who would "change the balance" of the Court. In particular, she urged the appointment of Justices who would "get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics" by overturning <span class="casename">Citizens United</span>, who would not "always side with corporate interests," and who would "recognize that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country." She also urged the appointment of Justices who uphold <spanclass="casename">Roe v. Wade</span> and marriage rights for same gender couples. She explained that this would require the appointment of Justices "who actually understand what people are up against" and "understand the way the world really works." She therefore suggested that she might nominate persons whose professional backgrounds are broader than the Justices who have served during the past half century, most of whom have worked in large law firms and served as federal judges before becoming Supreme Court Justices. In particular, Clinton said that the appointment of persons who have had more experience as trial lawyers might make the Court more receptive to the needs of the people. </p>

<p>Trump had much less to say about the Court during the second debate. He promised to nominate justices who would resemble Scalia, particularly Justices who would protect Second Amendment rights. He used Clinton's opposition to Citizens United as an occasion to commend his own self-financing and to criticize Clinton from accepting so much corporate funding.  </p>

<p>Although Clinton and Trump both briefly mentioned the court's significance in their acceptance speeches and have continued to occasionally mention the court, both candidates have consigned it to the back burners of their campaign and even there placed it on a low flame. There is little reason to suppose that the court's brief appearance in the second debate signals any change. The court's obscurity in the election campaign has frustrated many activists in both major parties, along with journalists and academics, who have tried to persuade voters that the court is a paramount issue. They hope that this is an issue that might motivate voting among persons who are so disillusioned with the candidates of their respective parties that they might otherwise sit out the election or drift to Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee or Jill Stein, the Green candidate. Indeed, both Republicans and Democrats have often invoked the court's fate as the major argument against "wasting" votes on third party candidates.</p>

<p>The court's most notable and unusual appearances in this year's campaign occurred when Trump published a list of eleven prospective Supreme Court nominees in May, supplemented by an additional ten in September. Although presidential candidates often have described the kind of nominees they would appoint to the court, this was the first time that any candidate has named names.  Since all of Trump's prospective nominees are highly "conservative" jurists, Trump has dramatically announced his intention to nominate justices who could provide a solid majority for the kind of jurisprudence espoused by the late Scalia. Trump's lists presumably are intended to generate support among "conservative" voters, who have questioned Trump's views on social and cultural issues, particularly abortion. The lists, however, may motivate at least some progressives, particularly Bernie Sanders enthusiasts, to swallow the bitter pill of Clinton rather than stay home on Election Day or stray to Johnson or Stein. In the second debate, Clinton pointed out that the lists include judges who oppose <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span> and constitutional protection of same-gender marriage. </p>

<p><br />
Trump's lists could give some comfort to voters of all political persuasions, however, because all prospective justices have highly significant professional credentials, along with personal integrity that appears to be beyond reproach. Ten of the prospects are federal judges (of whom eight are on the US Court of Appeals) and ten are state supreme justices. The only non-jurist, Utah Senator Michael S. Lee, is a former clerk for Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  and chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee. Since Trump has been such an eccentric candidate and has selected at least some advisors who are not part of the political mainstream, it was not inevitable that Trump would have identified potential justices whose backgrounds are similar to those that presidents traditionally nominate to the court. On the other hand, it is far from certain the unpredictable Trump would necessarily nominate anyone on the list, or persons of similar jurisprudential views. Many commentators question whether Trump has much interest in the details of governing, including the selection of judges, and have predicted that advisors would have an unusually large role in judicial selection. The kinds of judicial nominees they would recommend is highly uncertain since Trump, who lacks previous political experience, has no long-term political advisors, and has provided remarkably few clues about the identity and ideology of his advisors if he were elected.  <br />
		   <br />
The court's role in the present election is also more complicated than it has been for the past several elections because Trump, a former Democrat, in some ways is the most progressive Republican nominee in decades. He is the first major party nominee since George McGovern in 1972 to say that the United States should not police the world, he was the only Republican candidate during the primaries to unabashedly champion social service programs, and his views on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights appear to have been liberal until he sought the GOP nomination. Even his hardline views on immigration are quite attractive to countless rank and file progressives, who are far less inclined to favor porous borders than are Democratic leaders and "liberals" in the elite media. Trump's populism in many ways places him to the left of Clinton, and he is receiving support from many Bernie Sanders voters. This makes it more difficult for Democrats to frighten party loyalists and liberals about the danger of Trump nominating Supreme Court justices.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, Trump's selection of Michael R. Pence as his running mate indicates that Trump is much less progressive than he seemed during the primary campaign. Indeed, the presence of Pence on the ticket ought to go far toward raising the court's profile in the campaign since there seems little doubt that Pence would nominate hardline "conservatives" to the court if Trump did not complete his term and Pence became president. In actuality, however, the prospect of Pence picking judges and packing the court is unlikely to generate much excitement among "conservatives" or alarm among "liberals" because, throughout American history, voters have tended to pay little attention to vice presidential nominees. Even though seven presidents have died in office and one has resigned, the very real possibility that any vice president might become president seems to influence very few votes.</p>

<p>Another reason why the Court is not a major campaign issue is that the Senate could easily frustrate the efforts of either Trump or Clinton to transform the court's ideology, particularly if the opposition party controls the next Senate. Even if the Senate did not actually reject a highly "liberal" or "conservative" nominee, the prospect of a confirmation brawl might encourage either Clinton or Trump to nominate a moderate, just as Obama selected the moderate Garland when Scalia died. At the present time, it is not clear whether the Republicans will retain their Senate majority, although polls increasingly suggest that Democrats will wrest control of the Senate. With respect to court appointments, Trump's supporters therefore may have more reason to fear the prospect of a Clinton victory more than Clinton voters may have reason to fear Trump's election. To undecided voters, however, the uncertainty of which party will control the Senate reduces the extent to which judicial appointments might influence their vote.  </p>

<p>Voters also may regard judicial appointments as too hazy for their concern because Supreme Court justices are not at all obliged to conform to the political or ideological preferences of the presidents by whom they are appointed, and many have frustrated the expectations of the presidents who nominated them. The last such justice, however, was David M. Souter, and the intense ideological vetting of justices by both parties during the past quarter of a century has substantially increased the likelihood that a justice will mirror the politics of the president who appointed her.</p>

<p>Apathy about judicial issues in the present election is the norm rather than the exception. The court rarely has figured prominently in presidential campaigns. Judicial issues largely were ignored in 2012, even though there were no powerful issues to distract attention from the court and even though the court had recently outraged liberals by gutting campaign finance laws in <span class="casename">Citizens United</span> and offended conservatives by sustaining the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act in <span class="casename">National Federal of Independent Business v. Sebelius</span>. The absence of such controversial decisions during the past four years and the salience of immigration, trade issues, and foreign policy in the present campaign helps explain why judicial issues have no more traction this year than they did in 2012.  Judicial issues have not made a significant appearance in a presidential campaign since 2000, when there were no other major issues, and even then the court was not an overriding issue. </p>

<p>During the past century or so, the court has emerged as a prominent election issue only in 1912, 1924, 1964, and 1968, at times when the court was alienating a distinct bloc of voters on a wide range of issues. In 1912 and 1924, a "conservative" court's nullification of economic and social regulatory legislation ignited criticism by Progressive candidates Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 and Robert M. LaFollette, Sr. in 1924. Decades later, the Warren Court's "liberal" decisions promoting racial desegregation, expanding the rights of criminal defendants during a time of rising crime, prohibiting state-sponsored public school prayer and requiring equal population in voting districts ("one person, one vote") generated indignation on the other end of the political spectrum. Republican candidates Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Richard Nixon in 1968 tapped this controversy by emphasizing their intention to nominate "strict constructionists" to the courts, while George Wallace in his bid for the Democratic nomination in 1964 and his third party candidacy in 1968 made castigation of the Court a staple of his campaigns. Even in those elections, the complexity of judicial issues frustrated the efforts of candidates to discuss them on the campaign trail, and the candidates found that their audiences became bored and often drifted away when they began discussing constitutional doctrines. </p>

<p>Since the 1970s, judicial issues have been much more difficult to forge into campaign issues because the court's decisions have been much more diffuse. During recent years, for example, the court has dismayed many "conservatives" and gratified many "liberals" by protecting the rights of alleged terrorists, ensuring the constitutional right of same-gender marriages, sustaining affirmative action programs in education; and prohibiting capital punishment and life sentences for juveniles. During the same period, the court has pleased many "conservatives" by expanding Second Amendment rights; approving voter identification laws; reducing federal oversight of election laws, and permitting more extensive state assistance to sectarian schools. </p>

<p>Another reason for voter apathy about judicial issues during recent decades is that many voters&#8212;probably most&#8212;are not as easily classified as "liberals" or "conservatives" as are virtually all of the Justices. For at least the past thirty years, the voting records of all of the justices except Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor have usually mirrored the policy positions of either the Republican or Democratic parties. The views of vast numbers of voters do not fit so neatly into partisan niches. For example, many voters who oppose abortion also oppose capital punishment. Other voters who favor national health insurance may oppose affirmative action, while some voters who favor stricter campaign financing laws may want to constrict the rights of criminal defendants. The countless voters who at various times have at different times cheered the opinions of both Scalia and Ginsburg may not especially care which candidate will nominate Supreme Court justices.  </p>

<p>Judicial issues, however, may help galvanize a candidate's political base and stimulate fund raising. Indeed, conservative and liberal activist organizations tend to emphasize judicial issues far more than do the candidates. Organizations that focus on judicial issues agree that the court should be an important election issue and are attempting to alert voters to the election's likely effects on the court. For example, the <a href="http://www.afj.org">Alliance for Justice</a>, a liberal advocacy organization, is warning voters that the Court is at a "tipping point" and that this is a "make or break" election. </p>

<p>Despite the many difficulties of addressing judicial issues, candidates and political activists in all parties should ramp up their efforts to remind voters that the election is likely to profoundly affect the decisions of the Supreme Court and other federal courts. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST contributing editor <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/contributing/2016/guns/rostron.php">Allen Rostron</a> of the <a href="http://law.umkc.edu/">University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law</a> discusses new gun laws enacted in Missouri and proposed in Pennsylvania and how they reflect an insatiable appetite for enacting pro-gun legislation even when gun rights are well secured under existing laws...</p> <strong>W</strong>hile gun control remains a bitterly divisive issue, there can be little doubt as to which side of the debate has had the upper hand in recent years. The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of gun rights advocates' arguments about the Second Amendment in the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf">Heller</a> [PDF] and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1521.pdf">McDonald</a> [PDF] cases. Attempts to enact even modest new restrictions on guns have repeatedly <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/20/politics/senate-gun-votes-congress/">failed</a> in Congress, even after a seemingly endless series of horrific shooting incidents at places like Virginia Tech, Tucson, Aurora, Newtown, San Bernardino, and Orlando. From a political standpoint, the <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/09/18/conventional-wisdom-and-the-latest-death-of-gun/195954">conventional wisdom </a>has been that supporting gun control is more likely to hurt than help a candidate.</p>

<p>With Congress deadlocked on gun issues, <a href="http://harvardlpr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/10.2_3_Rostron.pdf">attention</a> has turned to the state level [PDF]. While legislatures in a few states such as California, Connecticut, Maryland, and New York have enacted new gun control laws, legislatures in many other states have gone the other way and passed laws making it easier to acquire and carry guns. In some of these states, lawmakers have begun to go to extreme lengths in their efforts to prove their devotion to gun rights and to curry favor with gun enthusiasts and organizations like the National Rifle Association (NRA).</p>

<p>A striking example is Missouri, where lawmakers recently overrode the governor's veto and passed a <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/16info/pdf-bill/tat/SB656.pdf">measure</a> [PDF] further weakening the state's lenient gun laws. Missouri already had laws that permitted people to carry concealed guns. To obtain a permit, a person had to successfully complete an eight-hour <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/missouri/2005/t38/5710000111.html">training</a> course, a measure ensuring that those licensed to carry concealed guns had some minimal degree of knowledge about and experience with safe handling and use of firearms, as well as the laws relating to firearms and justifiable use of force. As of January 1, 2017, permits will no longer be required for carrying concealed guns in Missouri. </p>

<p>In passing this measure, Missouri legislators wiped away the limited amount of discretion that county sheriffs in the state previously had to deny a concealed carry permit when they had particular reasons to think an individual applying for a permit could not be trusted to safely carry a firearm. As <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/new-missouri-gun-law-changes-the-rules-but-some-restrictions/article_52cae4d3-310c-5c89-a55e-007ec99fefbf.html">one sheriff</a> explained, "I could refuse a permit for somebody who has had frequent contact with the law, or who is a suicide threat. Now that person will be able to carry a concealed weapon, and that concerns me."</p>

<p>The Missouri enactment was a solution in search of a problem. The right to carry a handgun was already well protected in Missouri, and a <a href="http://everytown.org/documents/2015/04/missouri-polling-memo-april-2015.pdf">survey</a> [PDF] found that less than twenty percent of the state's residents favored elimination of the permit requirement.  Even in households where people own guns and carry them concealed, the vast majority of survey respondents were satisfied with the state's existing laws and opposed to allowing concealed carry without a permit. The Missouri legislature nevertheless defied that strong consensus in order to deliver a victory to the NRA, which <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20160914/nra-applauds-veto-override-of-senate-bill-656-in-missouri">declared</a> it "a great day for freedom in Missouri."  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, legislators in Pennsylvania are also looking to deliver a generous gift to the NRA. They want to give organizations like the NRA special standing to sue and recover damages and attorneys' fees from local governments in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Like many other states, Pennsylvania has a <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/fact-sheet-preemption-laws/">law</a> that prohibits local regulation of firearms. The NRA began <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/fact-sheet-preemption-laws/">pushing</a> for the enactment of these preemption laws in the 1980s, realizing gun advocates could use their leverage at the state legislative level to block action by local mayors and city council members who might be inclined to support tighter restrictions on guns. These preemption laws stop decisions and policies about guns from being made at the <a href="http://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/firearm-localism">local level</a>, forfeiting any opportunity for officials closest to the interests of a particular city or county to craft approaches best suited for local needs and concerns.</p>

<p>With the preemption law already in place in Pennsylvania, one would think that even the most enthusiastic supporters of gun rights in the Pennsylvania legislature would be satisfied and not feel the need to go further. Pennsylvania lawmakers nevertheless are pushing a bill to ensure that the NRA can bring lawsuits against Pennsylvania cities and counties based on the preemption statute. The <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&sessYr=2015&sessInd=0&billBody=S&billTyp=B&billNbr=1330&pn=1978">bill</a> provides that a "person adversely affected" by a local law concerning guns can sue to have the local law invalidated, with the relief to include damages and an award of legal costs as well as injunctive or declaratory relief. The bill goes on to say that a "person adversely affected" by a local gun regulation would include not just an individual gun owner in Pennsylvania, but also any "membership organization" to which a Pennsylvania gun owner might belong.</p>

<p>The NRA has been <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/09/philadelphia_act_192_gun_lawsu.html">frustrated</a> in past attempts to bring suits under the Pennsylvania preemption law, and the bill to bestow standing on membership organizations is clearly drafted with the NRA in mind.  But opponents of the bill have noted that all sorts of other organizations could take advantage of the special standing created by the bill. As the bill's <a href="http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/cs/Satellite?c=Article_C&childpagename=PA%2FALM_Layout&cid=1202767991416&p=1202615323480&packedargs=cname%3DPLW-092116GunLaws%26ctype%3DArticle_C%26curindex%3D43%26headline%3DPa-Lawmakers-Revive-Bid-to-Let-NRA-Sue-Over-Gun-Laws%26mcode%3D1395262324557%26pname%3Ddefault-article%26ptype%3DPage&pagename=ALM_Wrapper&rendermode=insite&curpage=ALL">critics</a> pointed out in committee debate, the bill would give standing for lawsuits against Pennsylvania cities by domestic hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan or even foreign entities like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), provided those organizations could show they had at least one member who lived in Pennsylvania and legally possessed a firearm.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2013&sessInd=0&billBody=H&billTyp=B&billNbr=0080&pn=4318">similar measure</a>, giving standing to membership organizations in firearm cases, was enacted in Pennsylvania in 2014.  It passed after being inserted into an unrelated and uncontroversial bill creating criminal penalties for theft of metals like copper pipes or wiring. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/pa-supreme-court/1738874.html">unanimously held</a> that enacting the provision about standing for firearm preemption lawsuits in that manner violated the state's constitutional requirement that bills must have a single subject.</p>

<p>That setback has not deterred the Pennsylvania legislators who want to give the NRA standing to sue the state's local governments. Although Pennsylvania's governor opposes the legislation, the bill's proponents are <a href="http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/cs/Satellite?c=Article_C&childpagename=PA%2FALM_Layout&cid=1202767991416&p=1202615323480&packedargs=cname%3DPLW-092116GunLaws%26ctype%3DArticle_C%26curindex%3D43%26headline%3DPa-Lawmakers-Revive-Bid-to-Let-NRA-Sue-Over-Gun-Laws%26mcode%3D1395262324557%26pname%3Ddefault-article%26ptype%3DPage&pagename=ALM_Wrapper&rendermode=insite&curpage=ALL">optimistic</a> about passing the bill with a veto-proof majority.</p>

<p>Many plausible arguments can be made on both sides of the gun debate. If the policy issues surrounding firearms had easy, obvious answers in one direction or the other, they would not be so controversial. </p>

<p>I worry, however, that legislators may be tempted to keep pushing continuously for enactment of additional pro-gun legislation merely to establish and re-affirm their commitment to the issue. Even when current laws put no undue burden of any sort on any gun owner's rights, legislators will still have political incentives to impress the NRA and its most ardent members with their devotion to the cause by coming up with some new measure to pursue in the name of advancing firearm rights. Legislators will essentially entrench themselves in the business of enacting more laws to weaken gun controls and strengthen gun rights, regardless of whether anyone really thinks the changes are needed. As the recent actions of lawmakers in Missouri and Pennsylvania have shown, the results will be unfortunate, with legislatures overreaching to advance an agenda rather than being content with current laws under which gun rights are already quite well protected.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist<a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/sexual_orientation/about_us.html"> Mark Johnson Roberts</a>, Chair of the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/sexual_orientation.html">American Bar Association Commission on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</a>, responds that the new anti-discrimination ABA Model Rule is not an attack on free speech... </p>

                <p><strong>O</strong>n August 17, JURIST published a Professional Commentary from attorney Brad Abramson entitled, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/hotline/2016/08/brad-abramson-speech-rights.php">"American Bar Association Attacks Attorney Speech Rights"</a>  concerning the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/aba.html">ABA</a>'s August adoption of a new model rule for possible use by state courts that regulate lawyer behavior. The new <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/committees_commissions/ethicsandprofessionalresponsibility/modruleprofconduct8_4.html">Rule 8.4(g)</a>, if enacted in a state, would prohibit a lawyer from engaging in conduct, related to the practice of law, that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is bias or discrimination based upon certain categories of persons historically subjected to such treatment in our profession and our society. The terms "related to the practice of law," "knows," "reasonably should know," "bias," and "discrimination" are all defined within Rule 8.4 or elsewhere in the <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/model_rules_of_professional_conduct_table_of_contents.html">ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct</a>. </p>

                <p>ABA members undertook an effort to revise the rules in response to specific concerns about the justice system experiences of underserved citizens who are members of minority groups. The legal profession, notwithstanding 30 years of efforts to diversify itself, stubbornly remains one of the least diverse of American professions. It was also, until this rule was adopted, one of the few without a bias and discrimination provision within its conduct rules. </p>

                <p>Mr. Abramson, as he notes, was one of "52 ABA Members" who submitted a joint written commentary opposing an early draft of the rule. A similar comment came from the <a href="http://www.christianlegalsociety.org/">Christian Legal Society (CLS)</a>. In total, some 70 percent of the comments that were received came from the 52 Members, the CLS, and their allies; 494 comments, by the way, represent about 0.125 percent of the ABA's membership. Many of those comments simply adopted either the 52 Members or the CLS commentary without further discussion. </p>

                <p>The ABA, perhaps unsurprisingly, is not in a position to "ignore" almost 500 comments received about any proposal it considers. On the contrary, that early draft of the rule was modified substantially in response to the comments that were received. For example, the <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/committees_commissions/disciplinecommittee.html">Professional Discipline Committee</a>, and the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law.html">Business Law Section of the ABA</a>, both mentioned as opponents in the Abramson article, withdrew their opposition in response to the subsequent amendments. Professional Discipline supported the revised rule. </p>

                <p>The ABA has built its reputation on the quality of its work. To call the group, histrionically, "a political organization...willing to blatantly assault the constitutional rights of its own constituency in order to advance its ideological agenda" is to mispercieve the organization's internal processes as well as its role in writing model codes. The ABA is a broadly diverse membership organization; it is paralyzed without the support of its constituents. Over 50 constituent entities, each with its own agenda and concerns, must be consulted before a rule like this one is adopted. None opposed the rule in its final form. In other words, people with legitimate constitutional concerns about the rule were consulted in this process, and their concerns were addressed. </p>

                <p>That fact is reflected in the debate that took place at the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/leadership/house_of_delegates.html">ABA House of Delegates</a> when it adopted the rule. Ordinarily, each side lines up their best arguments and their best speakers, just as Mr. Abramson suggests, and the "pro" and "con" sides take turns debating the relative merits of a proposal. Any ABA member may speak. In this case, no one spoke against the proposal. If "widespread opposition" to the rule remained after the extensive revisions that took place in response to the concerns that were expressed, the ABA House was unaware of it. </p>

                <p>Relatedly, it is important to note that the ABA is not a governmental body. The drafting of model rules and statutes is one of its primary functions as a membership service organization, but it does not impose its rules on anyone. That duty falls to the state courts as regulators of lawyer conduct. The ABA would lose its reputation quickly if it started publishing model rules that state courts would view as unconstitutional. It is fair also to note that the ABA, as is often the case, is not leading this charge. No fewer than 25 American jurisdictions had adopted similar rules before the ABA acted. </p>

                <p>It is not clear, and Mr. Abramson does not elaborate, what behavior he wishes to engage in that would be a violation of the rule as it was adopted. Certainly nothing in the rule applies to private religious practice, to being a member of his or any other organization, or to representing its positions whether a lawyer agrees with them or not. It appears instead that he is criticizing the rule as a way of advancing a political agenda -- which the rule, perhaps ironically, protects his right to do. </p>

		<title>UNCITRAL Working Group II Draft Mechanism on Enforcement of Conciliation Settlement Agreements</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://tlp.law.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/tlp/article/view/146">Robert Gyenes</a> discusses the UNCITRAL Working Group II (Dispute Resolution) in Vienna, which aims to negotiate an international mediation treaty or law...</p>

                <p><strong>T</strong>he 65th meeting of the UN Commission on International Trade Law&#8217;s Working Group II recently closed its 12-23 September session in Vienna, Austria. It was the latest in a series of bi-annual meetings to prepare &#8220;an instrument dealing with enforcement of international commercial settlement agreements resulting from <a href="http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/workinggroups/wg_arb/acn9-896_draft_report_as_submitted.pdf">conciliation</a> [PDF].&#8221;</p>

                <p>Conciliation, occasionally referred to as <a href="http://www.mediate.com/articles/sgubiniA2.cfm">mediation</a>, is increasingly becoming the primary method of dispute resolution as the costs and formality of arbitration <a href="http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/files/20160517-international-arbitration-report-issue-6-may-2016-139455.pdf#page=13">rises</a>. This flexible alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process also cuts out many of the burdens of litigation, such as discovery or a need for preparing witnesses. The informal process gives companies an &#8220;ability to craft individualized justice&#8221; otherwise lost in an arbitration or litigation <a href="http://hnlr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/61-96.pdf">forum</a> [PDF]. But once a settlement is reached in conciliation, there is no uniform system of international enforcement. Some states enforce them under statutes, but the majority treats a conciliation settlement as just another contract. </p>

                <p>Working Group II has been trying to draft a uniform international enforcement mechanism since its 45th session in 2012. Part of the delay is caused by disagreement over what form the mechanism should take. There are viable two choices: either the mechanism will be a free-standing convention or it will be incorporated as an addendum to the 2002 Model Law on Conciliation, already in force among a small group of <a href="http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/2002Model_conciliation_status.html">states</a>. In the discussion below, I will address the benefits and disadvantages of both outcomes.</p>

                <p><strong>A New Convention or Extension of the 2002 Model Law on Conciliation?</strong><br />
                    Delegations in favor of a convention often cite the success of the <a href="https://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/arbitration/NY-conv/XXII_1_e.pdf">New York Convention on Arbitration</a> [PDF]. This was format was the original intention of Working Group II and in prior official reports, the 1958 New York Convention was cited as a model both in form and <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/V15/011/54/PDF/V1501154.pdf?OpenElement">function</a> [PDF]. Reverence for the New York Convention is not surprising. It has been a gold standard in enforcement mechanisms and international arbitration has greatly benefited from a clear legal framework across <a href="http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=df7ac1d2-fa0e-48df-a3f6-8455465b73af">jurisdictions</a>. The high adoption rate of the New York Convention adds to its success. With 156 currently contracting parties, a lawyer can be certain of enforcement in nearly any country in the <a href="http://www.newyorkconvention.org/countries">world</a>. For almost 60 years, this convention has accumulated a considerable amount of use and scholarship; naturally conciliation would want to emulate it. </p>

                <p>Conventions tend to promote uniformity better than model laws. Generally states are free either to sign an international convention or not&#8212;their only ability to modify their acceptance limited to declarations or <a href="http://www.slaw.ca/2011/07/27/implementing-international-conventions-and-their-declarations/">reservations</a>. Under this all or nothing structure, a lawyer in the US or Germany is likely to understand what the enforcement regime is like in Tajikistan without any knowledge of the local language simply by looking up the restrictions and declarations a signing state has made. As a practitioner, that is a comforting feeling and is something easily communicated to clients. </p>

                <p>Other highly anticipated conventions, however, have not seen the same high rate of adoption. For instance the 2005 Hague Choice of Court Convention is only in force among the European Union, Mexico, and <a href="https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/status-table/?cid=98">Singapore</a>. The 1971 Hague Convention dealing with foreign judgment recognition has only five <a href="https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/full-text/?cid=78">parties</a>. Therefore, simply on the basis that it takes the form of a convention, there is no certainty that this enforcement mechanism will be widely adopted. </p>

                <p>The truth is, there is no perfect comparison to the New York Convention. As the Working Group II pointed out in its February 2015 Report, arbitration and conciliation are in different stages of evolution. Conciliation is the new kid on the block. In contrast, arbitration could draw on a longer history going back to a 1927 treaty dealing with arbitral award <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/V15/011/54/PDF/V1501154.pdf?OpenElement">enforcement</a> [PDF]. As one delegation noted in dissent, the New York Convention was &#8220;built upon the experience gained through long years of arbitration practice... in contrast there is a lack of experience in international conciliation, particularly across different<a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/V15/011/54/PDF/V1501154.pdf?OpenElement"> legal traditions</a> [PDF].&#8221; In total, we cannot predict with certainty how a conciliation convention would operate. </p>

                <p>The other option for Working Group II is to draft the enforcement mechanism as an extension to the 2002 Model Law on Conciliation. The 2002 Model Law was UNCITRAL&#8217;s earlier attempt to harmonize the laws on international conciliation, providing a basic set of rules and procedure regarding the scope, nature and function of the conciliation process.<br />
                    <br />
                    Adding the enforcement mechanism to the 2002 Model Law as an addendum would offer some distinct advantages. For example, model laws by nature are more flexible in their implementation because they are not limited to treaty declarations or reservations as their only means of dissent. Each domestic legislature passes their own version. Thus, states have the ability to harmonize the text of the model law with an existing preferred practice or any conflicting <a href="https://unov.tind.io/record/41490">legal obligations</a>. A benefit of this approach is that any nation otherwise hesitant to sign a convention would be able to implement a domestic law at its own speed and in its own voice. This approach would also allow for a &#8220;observational period&#8221; in which certain states could observe the enforcement mechanism&#8217;s nuances in practice. With more use of enforcement under a model law would come more familiarity and scholarship, helping to mature the field of conciliation.</p>

                <p>The counter-argument is that model laws tend to have a lower adoption rate. This concern has some weight, particularly in the case of conciliation. The underlying 2002 Model Law on Conciliation has only been adopted by 16 nations (interestingly by 12 US states despite no federal <a href="http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/2002Model_conciliation_status.html">counterpart</a>). Adding an enforcement mechanism to a law in force in so few jurisdictions is likely to have a muted impact. </p>

                <p>The flexibility to modify a model law is also a weakness. The 2002 Model Law, like other laws modified and passed by each individual legislature, is not uniformly implemented. Although the UN published a guide to enactment designed to <a href="http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/arbitration/ml-conc/03-90953_Ebook.pdf">combat this</a> [PDF], states are free to deviate from the <a href="www.transnational-dispute-management.com/article.asp?key=1432">text</a>. The result is that a practitioner must spend more time researching the law before recommending conciliation to their client, and thus creating the likelihood that in some cases conciliation will be avoided where it might have been utilized. </p>

                <p><strong>The Path Forward</strong></p>

                <p>That Working Group II started out debating a convention is significant because it will be difficult to deviate from that path. Nevertheless, there is a contingent against drafting a convention. The situation has threatens to stall progress in other areas of drafting. Lack of clarity on what exactly the Group is drafting affects how other articles are written. However, forcing a convention on unwilling delegations may get the Group to a final text, but it would also have a negative effect on the implementation of this mechanism. The new conciliation convention may end up relatively ignored, similar to the 1971 Hague Convention on Foreign Judgments. Conciliation settlement enforcement could remain a state-by-state process for many years to come. </p>

                <p>Although it may be a difficult thought, perhaps Working Group II should more seriously consider drafting the mechanism as an addendum to the 2002 Model Law. While this choice essentially cedes an immediate worldwide adoption of a common policy because each state must implement it individually, it has other medium term benefits. Unlike a convention, it overcomes the flexibility concern. States are not forced to adopt each and every provision as they would under a convention. It may also spur additional adoption of the 2002 Model Law on Conciliation because it would add a very valuable enforcement mechanism. Most of all, there is no rush. A convention can always be drafted later, once conciliation scholarship and practice matures. </p>

                <p>In the end, whatever the outcome, enforcement of conciliation settlement agreements is likely to remain an uncertain process in the near future. But the future does look bright, as conciliation continues to grow and find its place in the ADR spectrum. It is comforting that even if this first attempt is poorly received, perhaps a future convention can be &#8220;built upon the experience gained through long years of mediation practice&#8221; resulting in part by this Working Group&#8217;s work. </p>

		<title>Hiding Torture Beyond Borders: Australia and Offshore Asylum Processing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists Anna Talbot and Greg Barns discuss the asylum seekers on Manus Island, establishing that there is no doubt under international law that the people being detained there are being tortured, and what legal tactics the government has used to hide its actions... </p><strong>A</strong>mnesty International published a report last week arguing that the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island &#8220;<a href="https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/10/17/AMNESTY_INTERNATIONAL___ISLAND_OF_DESPAIR_FINAL.pdf">amounts to torture under international law</a>&#8221; [PDF]. The Turnbull government, despite the overwhelming evidence to support that proposition, adamantly denies the reality. There is no escaping, however, the fact that Australia is torturing vulnerable people.</p>

                <p>Despite the government&#8217;s dismissal of the Amnesty report, the fact is that the legal concept of &#8216;torture&#8217; is the appropriate term to use when it comes to the mistreatment of asylum seekers and refugees on Manus Island and Nauru. </p>

                <p>Under the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">UN Convention against Torture</a>, to which Australia is a party, torture is defined as the deliberate infliction of severe pain or suffering of a physical or mental nature, for reasons including intimidating or coercing the person or a third party, with the consent or acquiescence of a public official. </p>

                <p>This definition is clearly being met in the context of Australia&#8217;s offshore processing centres. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive">Nauru Files</a>, published by the Guardian in August, are the latest in an ever-growing mountain of evidence of the despair asylum seekers and refugees endure in these benighted places.  Suicide attempts, self-harm, statements made by children and adults that they do not want to live, they would like to kill themselves, they do not see the point in eating, drinking or living: this is the evidence of the depths of mental and physical suffering that the Australia&#8217;s policies inflict on individuals.</p>

                <p>Inflicting this despair is clearly deliberate. We are told that it is essential that claims for asylum are processed in these conditions to stop the boats &#8212; to stop people drowning at sea. This is the stated policy of the government. The purpose element of the definition of torture is also clearly met: this severe pain or suffering is inflicted to show people who are being persecuted in other countries, who might be thinking about asking Australia for help, that we will not help them. Australia will harm them. To make that point, Australia will warehouse them on remote Pacific Islands.</p>

                <p>There are no exceptions to the fundamental prohibition against torture under international law. Not in international armed conflicts, domestic insurgencies or to prevent atrocities. It is definitely not permitted to torture people to discourage others from asking for help.</p>

                <p>It might be argued that Australian ministers and officials are not personally inflicting the torture. That does not excuse them.  As the list of successful prosecutions of defendants at the International Criminal Court has demonstrated, it is enough that policies and instructions are devised and issued by politicians and their advisers.</p>

                <p>Worse still is the fact that, having been caught out breaching international law, the Australian government does not mend its ways. Instead it takes steps to hide its wrongdoing from the world. The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00650">Australian Border Force Act </a> passed last year by both the Coalition and the Australian Labor Party (ALP) provides for prison sentences for workers who reveal what they see at work in immigration detention facilities. In the face of a High Court challenge mounted by Doctors for Refugees, the government has exempted some health care professionals from the more draconian elements of this Act. The fact remains though that secrecy appears to be the priority, over respect for fundamental rights.</p>

                <p>The Department of Immigration has also stopped reporting self-harm and other evidence of despair to the regulator, Comcare. Comcare, the Commonwealth workplace regulator, has jurisdiction over the detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island.<br />
                    <br />
                    Documents released to the Australian Lawyers Alliance (ALA) under freedom of information laws show that reports of incidents made to Comcare have reduced dramatically in the last year. </p>

                <p>In June this year the ALA released a <a href="http://www.lawyersalliance.com.au/ourwork/untold-damage/untold-damage">report </a>outlining the health and safety concerns that exist in immigration detention, both offshore and onshore. This report relied on over 1000 incident reports filed by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection with Comcare between July 2013 and June 2015, which clearly identify the Department as the body with responsibility under the Act on Nauru and Manus Island. There were 209 incidents of self-harm reported by the Department, 49 assaults and three sexual assaults, over the two years under investigation. While the report provided evidence that these types of incidents had been under-reported, it was important that at least some of the incidents were scrutinised by an external agency.</p>

                <p>In the year to June 2016, however, the Department&#8217;s reporting of incidents dramatically reduced. Only 144 incidents were been reported across the immigration detention network. Of the 33 incidents involving Nauru and Manus Island, none related to self-harm or sexual assault. There were just five assaults reported.</p>

                <p>This drop in reporting does not indicate that safety in immigration detention has improved. There is too much evidence to the contrary. The government may be seeking to evade scrutiny by reducing record-keeping. If so, this is simply more evidence that &#8216;torture&#8217; is occurring; that the government is consenting and acquiescing to severe pain or suffering by not even recognising it as a health or safety issue and reporting it to the regulator as required by law.<br />

		<title>For Native Americans, Jim Crow is Alive &amp; Well in the West</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Tom Rodgers, a Washington, DC-based lawyer engaged in Native American economic and social empowerment advocacy, discusses the equal access challenges faced by Native American voters in the West in light of the resurgent voting rights movement in the US ...</p>

                <p><strong>T</strong>here is at this moment a resurgent and essential voting rights movement in the US aimed at enfranchising demographic groups that long were intentionally kept from the process of casting a ballot. While most of these pro-democracy initiatives are focused on establishing early voting efforts and wiping away or preventing a re-emergence of Jim Crow laws in the South, the historic inability of Native Americans to have equal access at the ballot box in the West has sadly gone unnoticed until this year. <br />
                    <br />
                    Native Americans in 2016 experience a disproportionate lack of access to early voting and voter registration services on reservations. None too soon came the ruling earlier this month by <a href="http://www.nvd.uscourts.gov/bio/mirandadu.aspx">US Judge Miranda Du</a> in Nevada that ordered Mineral and Washoe counties to establish early-voting sites and Election Day polling stations on the reservations of two Paiute tribes.<br />
                    <br />
                    At the heart of the problem is proximity to voter registration offices and ballot boxes. Native Americans must travel extreme distances not only in order to cast an early vote but also in order to register to vote. These are people often so extremely poor and geographically isolated that when it comes to equality of opportunity, their lives give true meaning to the words "unequal access."<br />
                    <br />
                    As an example, in <a href="http://www.rosebudmontana.com/">Rosebud County</a>, Montana white voters travel an average of 16.79 miles from their homes to register to vote, while Native Americans travel an average of 44.85 miles from their homes to register at the county courthouse, according to a study commissioned by the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt">Civil Rights Division</a> of the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">US Justice Department</a> in 2012.<br />
                    <br />
                    The Nevada tribes were in a similar situation. In order to register to vote or cast a ballot, members of the <a href="http://plpt.nsn.us/">Pyramid Lake Paiute Indian Reservation</a> had to make a 96-mile round-trip to and from Reno. The <a href="http://www.wrpt.us/">Walker River Paiute Tribe</a> had to make a 70-mile round-trip to and from Hawthorne. In front of Judge Du, we argued that the local government's refusal to make registration and voting more accessible was a blatant attempt to suppress the Native American turnout. Judge Du agreed. Now, about a dozen other tribes in Nevada want those same voting rights made available by the state on their reservations. <br />
                    <br />
                    The struggle to level the playing field has been a long time in the making. At the forefront of this movement a small but dedicated group of lawyers, policy experts, and activists created the legal model in 2012 in Montana. This became the first line of battle in our evolving nationwide legal effort to improve Native American voting rights. Mark Wandering Medicine became the lead plaintiff in our federal lawsuit filed on behalf of four Indian tribes in Montana &#8212; the <a href="http://www.cheyennenation.com/">Northern Cheyenne</a>, <a href="http://www.crow-nsn.gov/government.html">Crow</a>, Gros Ventre, and Assiniboine. The plaintiffs contended they were being denied access to voter registration and in person early voting privileges offered to white Montanans. The Native Americans of Montana are some of the poorest of the poor, yet they simply seek to survive on their islands of poverty surrounded by border towns of injustice oblivious to Native American history and their own power and privilege. Wandering Medicine, a Vietnam War veteran, who lost a leg on a reconnaissance mission with his Marine unit, learned how time-consuming and expensive it was for his tribe and others to vote after he discovered they had to make a 180-mile round trip from their homes to the nearest county seat just to register to vote.</p>

                <p>On behalf of the plaintiffs, we sought help from <a href="http://sos.mt.gov/">Montana Secretary of State</a> Linda McCulloch but were dismissively told to come back "in the spring," with her claiming incorrectly that state law precluded the establishment of satellite offices to register to vote and provide early voting. In addition, there was no chance of a legislative remedy with the Montana state legislature controlled by "Tea Party Republicans" and far too many rank and file citizens simply blind to the local control of access to the ballot box. So we turned to the courts. As we charged in <u>Wandering Medicine v. McCulloch</u>, the delaying tactics by McCulloch ran out the clock for the 2012 elections, and thousands of Native Americans in Montana as a result were denied access to the voting booth four years ago.</p>

                <p>Spiritual Native Americans closely involved in the case will tell you it was more than coincidence that along with McCulloch, among Wandering Medicine's adversaries in the case were a clerk and county recorder named Geraldine Custer; a county commissioner named Robert E. Lee; and one of the county seats involved in the case was named after James W. Forsyth, the United States commanding general of the <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/wounded-knee-massacre">Wounded Knee Massacre</a>. We used the historical background associated to these names to inspire and increase our ranks of supporters, and at times to "psych-out" our opponents within ethical boundaries.<br />
                    <br />
                    As an enrolled <a href="http://blackfeetnation.com/">Blackfeet </a>tribal member originally from Montana and now a Native American advocate in Washington, DC, I intervened <em>pro bono</em> on behalf Wandering Medicine and the Montana tribes. Along with Native American advocacy organization <a href="http://www.fourdirectionsvote.com/">Four Directions</a> and other allies, we continue to provide tribes with an aggressive legal and public relations strategy; run Native Americans voter registration drives and voter turnout operations; recruit allies for our movement; and build reputational capital in the states and Washington.  It has a created a court room and public relations pressure cooker environment in Montana that is slowly leading to better access to voter registration and the ballot box for the tribes there. However, as is the case in Nevada, our work in Montana is far from finished.</p>

                <p>With Montana, and now Nevada, as critical battlefields in the fight for Native American enfranchisement, we (and now others) have used the legal model as a force behind a building nationwide movement. We also have broadened our offensive to include multiple fronts: at the grassroots level locally; in the state and federal courts; in the state and federal legislative bodies; the Justice Department; and in the media.  Our goal is to engage in a very aggressive campaign at all levels of the public square. As the activist statesman <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/frederick-douglass-9278324">Frederick Douglas</a> so truthfully noted, "[...] power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will."</p>

                <p>The movement has recruited powerful allies, including both <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/attorney-general-eric-h-holder-jr">former US Attorney General Eric Holder</a>, and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/meet-attorney-general">current US Attorney General Loretta Lynch</a>, the latter calling for an end to "the significant and unnecessary barriers that for too long have confronted American Indians and Alaska Natives in attempting to cast their ballots."  Attorney General Lynch has given meaning to her words by seeking enactment of voting rights legislation by the Congress; enactment into federal law would be the greatest achievement for the Native American franchise since the <a href="http://recordsofrights.org/records/217/indian-citizenship-act">First Americans obtained the right to vote in 1924</a> (and that was federal action; m<a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/brown/history/1-segregated/jim-crow.html"></a>any states continued to enact "Jim Crow of the West" policies that prevented Native Americans from voting). As our rallying cry goes, "First Americans were the last Americans to receive the right to vote in the US."</p>

                <p>Undoubtedly, the most critical element to the continued success of our movement's voting rights efforts is firmly rooted in our empathy for others, and that of those who have joined our lawsuits and our cause, including the Justice Department, Native American organizations, legal advocates, activists and academics. Research cited by Jason Marsh, of the <a href="http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/">Greater Good Science Center</a> at the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California Berkeley</a>, suggests that empathy is an important ingredient to moral action; and, a significant study by Samuel and Pearl Oliner looked for commonalities among people who had rescued Jews during the Holocaust and found the rescuers were deeply empathetic people who from a young age were encouraged by their parents to take other people's perspectives.<br />
                    <br />
                    For those of us specifically in the legal profession, the importance of empathy in law, public policy and leadership can be found in the contemporary words of a former constitutional law professor and now President of the United States of America. In September 2005, then-Senator <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">Barrack Obama</a> stood on the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/index.htm">US Senate</a> floor, and set forth his litmus test for the chief justice of the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">United States Supreme Court</a>:</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Mohit Gupta, an International Law Masters student at <a href="http://www.sau.int/">South Asian University</a> discusses an October ICJ ruling against the Marshall Islands concerning India's failure to meet customary international law concerning halting developments of nuclear weapons ...</j:header><strong>O</strong>n 5 October, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/court/index.php?p1=1">International Court of Justice (ICJ)</a> ruled in favor of <a href="https://india.gov.in/">India </a>in a <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/158/19134.pdf">case</a> [PDF] brought forward by the <a href="https://rmiparliament.org/cms/">Republic of the Marshall Islands</a> concerning its allegation levied that India had not fulfilled its obligations under customary international law, as it had failed in good faith negotiations to cease its efforts in the nuclear arms race or calls to simply disarm. Yet instead, the Marshall Islands stated that India continued to take actions to improve, expand and maintain its nuclear forces. </p>

<p>Strictly speaking, India won this case neither on merit nor on core jurisdictional basis.  Rather, it won on the basis that there was no "evidence" of a legal dispute in the present case. Basically, under <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/?p1=4&p2=2">Article 38</a> of the statute of the ICJ, the function of the ICJ is to render decisions in accordance with international law disputes to which complying states submit. Under Article 36, paragraph 2 of the statute, the ICJ has jurisdiction in all "legal disputes" that may arise between state parties to the statute, as these member states have made a declaration in accordance with the provision. </p>

<p>Whether a dispute exists is a matter of objective determination for the ICJ. This must turn on an objective examination of the facts. For this purpose, the ICJ may take into account any statement-exchange between the parties. Here, the Marshall Islands sought to demonstrate that it had a dispute with India, referencing two Marshall Islands statements made in two different multinational forums to which India also happened to be present. The ICJ held that, given the circumstances and on the basis of those statements whether taken individually or together, it cannot be said that India was aware or could not have been unaware that the Marshall Islands alleged that India had breached its obligations. The nature of the exchange appears to have been, in other words, too remote.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Marshall Islands failed to show any bilateral diplomatic exchanges or official communications between it and India notifying India about breach of its obligations. Thus, in the present case, the ICJ upheld India's objection regarding absence of legal dispute. It would have cost nothing to the Marshall Islands if it would have informed India about its breach of obligation before bringing this case to the ICJ. Critics will say that the Marshall Islands' execution and process here demonstrate a major mistake which will draw shame at the international level.</p>

<p><strong>What if the judgment would have been decided on merit?</strong></p>

<p>Hypothetically here, the alternative ICJ judgment is considered: what if the Marshall Islands had conferred with India before filing the application concerning breach of India's obligation under customary international law to ensure nuclear disarmament? That scenario would have held that the ICJ would not have denied the jurisdiction, at least not on the basis of absence of legal dispute. The ICJ would have likely proceeded to decide the case on merit, unless some other ground for challenging jurisdiction was sustained. Furthermore, had the judgment been instead decided on merit, a legal question would have arose: whether India could be made bound to ensure nuclear disarmament even if it was not a party to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/conf/npt/2015/pdf/text%20of%20the%20treaty.pdf">Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</a> (NPT) [PDF]. The court would first have considered the nature of customary international law, to which India would be bound if it were a party to the NPT, and second, the ICJ would have considered if India had the obligation to ensure nuclear disarmament and whether it had complied or breached that obligation.</p>

<p>In 1996, the ICJ contributed to the creation of the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/95/7495.pdf">Nuclear Weapon Advisory opinion</a> (NWA). One of the issues considered in the NWA was whether the obligation to ensure prohibition of the threat or use of nuclear weapons has its genesis in customary international law. The ICJ went on to look for joint requirements of practice, and <em><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/opinio_juris_international_law">opinio juris</a></em>. The ICJ had held that a number of states had adhered to non-use of nuclear weaponry for the majority of the Cold War period and intend to continue in their adherence. </p>

<p>Further, the ICJ dealt with the question whether non-recourse of the use of nuclear weapons in last 50 years constitutes the expression of <em>opinio juris</em>. In order to trace <em>opinio juris</em> the ICJ looked into many General Assembly resolutions on the point. The ICJ found that many of them have been adopted with substantial numbers of negative votes and abstentions. </p>

<p>Thus, the ICJ concluded that although those resolutions are a clear sign of deep concern regarding the problem of nuclear weapons, they still fall short of establishing the existence of an <em>opinio juris</em> on the illegality of the use of such weapons. Moreover, it could also be argued that if nuclear weapons have not been used since 1945, this non-use is not on account of an existing or nascent custom but merely because circumstances that might justify their use have fortunately not arisen. </p>

<p>Thus, an obligation to pursue in good faith may have existed, as well as a responsibility to bring nuclear disarmament negotiations to a close under strict international control on the parties who signed the NPT, and who, by virtue of its provision under Article 6, are bound to it. However, the countries who have not signed this treaty could not be subjected to its principles. In that case, the majority of the ICJ said that there is no customary law obligation prohibiting the threat or use of nuclear weapons, hence it could be concluded that if there is no obligation prohibiting use of nuclear weapons, then there also cannot be an obligation to indulge in nuclear disarmament through negotiation. </p>

<p>Further, even if the Marshall Islands would have been able to show evidence depicting the existence of legal dispute, the ICJ would have assumed jurisdiction on that basis. Consequently, it would have been difficult for the Marshall Islands to win the case against India because India, as a non-signatory to the NPT is not bound to comply with Article 6 of this treaty to engage in nuclear disarmament, and as such this obligation could not be imposed for being part of customary international law.  Further, it would have been highly unlikely for the ICJ to have taken such a bold step of ruling in favor of the Marshall Islands, as it is well-known that India would have never complied with any such decision. Arguably from a critical point of view, such a decision would have proved to be yet another instance in which the ICJ made a mockery itself.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=&#8221; http://www.ngo-monitor.org/expert/anne/&#8221;>Anne Herzberg</a> of <a href="http://www.ngo-monitor.org/">NGO Monitor</a> reviews the recent article, "Unsettled: A Global Study of Settlements in Occupied Territory"...</p><strong>A</strong>rticle <a href=&#8221; Article 49(6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention &#8220;>49(6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention</a> is the most cited legal provision invoked by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the UN and quasi-judicial bodies to declare illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The language of the article, which states that an &#8220;occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies&#8221; is also broadly interpreted by these same actors to criminalize Israel&#8217;s building of roads, transportation systems, water infrastructure; carrying out any business activities and restoring cultural and historical sites across the 1949 armistice lines. Numerous provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention, the 1949 Geneva Conventions, and international human rights law contradict these claims. Every domestic court that has looked at this issue has <a href=&#8221; http://ngo-monitor.org/data/images/File/Herzberg%20Kidron%20Valley%20Article.pdf&#8221;>rejected these claims.</a>[PDF]</p>

                <p>NGOs have also used their interpretation of 49(6) to underpin boycott campaigns, sanctions and other punitive measures against Israel, including lobbying the International Criminal Court (ICC). Indeed, Arab states pushed for amendments to the 1998 Rome Statute, ostensibly based on Article 49(6), in order to specifically target Israeli settlements at the ICC. Powerful NGOs such as Human Rights Watch (HRW), Amnesty International, FIDH and many others have issued hundreds of statements and publications, in parallel to media campaigns, invoking 49(6) to declare Israel a prime violator of international law and to advocate for ICC prosecution of Israeli officials. </p>

                <p>In contrast to the dominant legal narrative promoted by NGOs and UN and European officials, the precise meaning and the specific prohibitions of Article 49(6) are far from clear. A new research paper, &#8220;<a href=&#8221; http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=635090098026019008089111104024019113035055008027063057097125084071104119123027114023103053058028021063113099029005120080001118118025036001009120112069065115095075003052071020099126024097065096015125076125108071084086117087109071088080004119105068105&EXT=pdf&#8221;>Unsettled: A Global Study of Settlements in Occupied Territory</a>,&#8221; [PDF] by Northwestern University School of Law Professor Eugene Kontorovich, comprehensively examines settlement activity and uses this information to determine the actual contours of Article 49(6). His paper also provides another example of how international law is often applied uniquely to Israel.</p>

                <p>Kontorovich&#8217;s research details settlement activity in every prolonged occupation outside of the Arab-Israeli conflict since the adoption of the Geneva Conventions (eight conflict situations): Indonesia-East Timor, Morocco-Western Sahara, Turkey-Northern Cyprus, Syria-Lebanon, Vietnam-Cambodia, Russia-Georgia, Russia-Ukraine and Armenia-Azerbaijan. Kontorovich excludes the cases of Tibet, Kashmir and others, as these occupations began prior to the adoption of the Geneva Convention by the relevant parties.</p>

                <p>Kontorovich found that large-scale settlement activity was present in every case of prolonged occupation. Yet, none of those cases were characterized by any international actor or body as a violation of Article 49(6). In these other contexts, there were no cases where, <blockquote>&#8220;a state&#8217;s mere &#8216;encouragement&#8217; of civilian settlers was enough to bring the state within the purview of Article 49(6),&#8221; and &#8220;neither international organizations nor the new governments of previously occupied territories have ever embraced the forcible removal of illegally transferred civilian settlers.&#8221;</blockquote> </p>

                <p>Article 49(6) and forcible removal of settlers was not even raised in cases where the settler population exceeded 50 percent of the population of the occupied territory. Moreover, Kontorovich notes that in each of these eight situations, the occupying power received financial assistance from third-party states and international institutions to carry out settlement activity, and third-party states engaged in development in those territories without hesitation and presented no bar to their own nationals moving to these territories.</p>

                <p>Kontorovich concludes that &#8220;state practice regarding 49(6) directly contradicts broad definitions&#8221; of it, and &#8220;the more broadly one wishes to define the anti-settlement norm, the greater the tension with state practice.&#8221; Moreover he finds that &#8220;<em>the Israeli situation, which dominates the legal literature, is entirely anomalous in terms of the international reaction</em>&#8221; (emphasis added). He notes, however, that &#8220;any international legal discussion or understanding of the meaning and application of Art. 49(6) cannot proceed, as a scientific matter, solely via one anomalous case.&#8221; He admonishes the promoters of this narrative, arguing that &#8220;it cannot be assumed that the Israeli case represents the customary rule or general understanding, rather than a politicized aberration.&#8221;</p>

                <p>The legal double standards pointed out by Kontorovich are also reflected in NGO publications on settlements. A review of HRW&#8217;s and Amnesty&#8217;s publications shows almost no mention of settlements outside of the Arab-Israeli conflict. I was unable to find any in-depth discussion about Article 49(6) or the legality of settlement activity outside of the Arab-Israeli conflict by either HRW or Amnesty. One of the few brief mentions of a situation other than Israel related to Western Sahara, and that passing mention was contained at the end of <a href=&#8221; https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/19/occupation-inc-how-settlement-businesses-contribute-israels-violations-palestinian&#8221;>a document</a> promoting the labeling Israeli settlement goods. And even in this publication, HRW did not discuss settlements in Western Sahara but only described in a couple lines its status as an occupied territory.</p>

                <p>In addition to near silence on the issue outside the Israeli context, I was unable to find any publications or public activity (UN statements, press conferences, media appearances) by HRW or Amnesty calling for ICC prosecutions for settlement activity, even though a full ICC investigation into Ukraine is currently underway and Cyprus falls within the court&#8217;s jurisdiction. Not to mention the settlement activity detailed in Kontorovich&#8217;s paper far exceeds in scale, scope and demographic impact of that in the West Bank. </p>

                <p>The failure of Amnesty and HRW to address settlements in other conflict situations provides another example where campaigning by HRW and Amnesty does not appear to be based on universally applied rules and legal principles and does not appear to be centered where the worst violations are taking place. Rather, the campaigns of these NGOs are driven by other agendas and priorities. Whatever one&#8217;s position on Israeli policy across the Green Line, in what some call the &#8220;disputed territories,&#8221; this paper is an important addition to the current legal discussion. </p>

		<title>Abolition or Reform of Electoral College Unlikely</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=" https://www.samford.edu/cumberlandlaw/directory/Ross-William-G">William G. Ross</a> of Samford University's Cumberland School of Law discusses reform of the electoral college system...</p><strong>H</strong>illary Rodham Clinton's victory over Donald J. Trump in the popular vote this presidential election has revived perennial proposals for the abolition or reform of the Electoral College. Although there are sound reasons for both its retention and abrogation, no change in the method by which Americans elect their president is likely.</p>

<p>With nearly all votes counted, Clinton is approximately 700,000 votes ahead of Trump among the more than 125 million ballots that Americans cast, a margin of one half of one percent. Clinton has received 47.8 percent of the vote compared with 47.3 percent for Trump. This is the fifth time that the winner of the popular vote has lost an election. The most recent was in 2000, when Albert Gore, Jr. won 543,000 more votes than George W. Bush. The other three times were in 1824, 1876 and 1888. </p>

<p>In the wake of the 2000 election, there was little public criticism of the Electoral College and no organized effort to abolish it. This was surprising since the 2000 election was contested in such a bitter and protracted manner, culminating in the US Supreme Court's decision in <span class="casename"><a href=" https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2298973060085224552">Bush v. Gore</a></span>, which had the practical effect of handing the election to Bush. The dearth of such efforts was even more surprising since there were serious and bipartisan efforts to abolish the Electoral College after the elections of 1968 and 1976, when a shift of a small number of votes in a few states could have elected a president (Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968 and Gerald R. Ford in 1976) who had not received a plurality of the popular vote. Congress examined the Electoral College in extensive hearings after both elections. In 1969, the House of Representatives voted to abolish the Electoral College by a vote of 338 to 70. In 1979, the Senate voted, 51 to 48, in favor of abolition.  </p>

<p>The absence of any movement to abolish the Electoral College after the 2000 election may have reflected political realities that are grounded in simple arithmetic. Its abolition would necessitate a constitutional amendment, which would require the assent of two-thirds of both Houses of Congress and three-quarters of the state legislatures. This difficult gauntlet helps to explain why only seventeen amendments have been added to the Constitution since the first ten amendments in 1791. An amendment to abolish the Electoral College would be particularly difficult to enact since approximately one-third of the states benefit from its retention insofar as their percentage of the nation's population is less than their share of Electoral College votes. Since each state's electoral vote equals its representation in the Senate and the House of Representatives and each state has two senators regardless of population, the Electoral College automatically provides less populous states with disproportionate clout in electing a president. In the seven states that have three electoral votes, one voter's impact on the Electoral College is approximately four times greater than one voter's impact in California, which has 55 electoral votes.  </p>

<p>Recognizing the difficulty and perhaps the futility of trying to abolish the Electoral College, many of its critics since 2000 have embraced a new expedient, the so-called <a href="http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/sites/default/files/eve-4th-ed-ch6-web-v1.pdf">National Popular Interstate Compact</a> (NPVIC) [PDF]. This proposal would permit states to enter into an agreement with other states in advance of an election to award their electoral votes to the candidate who received a plurality of the national popular vote. The compact would not take effect until states subscribing to it had a majority of electoral votes, and states could not withdraw from it during the six months between July 20 of a presidential election year and January 20 of the following year, the constitutionally mandated date of the president's inauguration. <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2007/03/maryland-senate-votes-to-bypass.php">Ten states</a> with 165 electoral votes have voted to join the compact.<br />
	<br />
As I explained in greater detail in a 2012 JURIST <a href="/forum/2012/02/william-ross-vote-compact.php">commentary</a>, NPVIC is fraught with practical and constitutional perils. Although Article II, Section I of the Constitution provides that states shall appoint electors "in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct," this section must be read in context and in conjunction with other provisions of the Constitution. </p>

<p>The principal constitutional impediment may be the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section10">"Compact Clause"</a> in Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution, which provides that, <blockquote>"No State shall, without the Consent of Congress...enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State."</blockquote> Although advocates of NPVIC contend that it would not require congressional approval because it would not encroach upon national supremacy, the compact could affect the federal government by changing the result of a presidential election. NPVIC also is vulnerable under the Compact Clause insofar as it would interfere with the rights of states that did not subscribe to it. Although Congress could provide its consent by majority vote rather than by the two-thirds vote that is required for a constitutional amendment, congressional support would be far from inevitable. </p>

<p>Perhaps the principal practical problem with NPVIC is the apparent lack of means to ensure that states would actually abide by its provisions if this meant awarding their electoral votes to a candidate opposed by a majority of the state's legislators. The many constitutional and practical objections to NPVIC suggest that a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College is a better means of assuring that the winner of the popular vote always is elected president.</p>

<p>One way to reform the Electoral College to make it more sensitive to the popular will is to ameliorate its "winner-take-all" aspects without interfering with its federalist structure. States could provide for the division of their electoral votes by allocating a separate electoral vote to each congressional district, while having the state-winner receive the two electoral votes that are based upon their representation in the Senate. Two states, Nebraska and Maine, have adopted this procedure. This option, however, is unlikely to spread to other states because state legislatures in states that are dominated by one party are unlikely to approve a measure that could permit the other party to siphon off votes. Democrats have particular reason to oppose the procedure since Democratic candidates tend to carry the states that have large blocs of electoral votes.   </p>

<p>Public opinion polls have consistently indicated strong bipartisan support for abolition of the Electoral College. A <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/interactives/independents/post-kaiser-harvard-topline.pdf">Washington Post poll</a> [PDF] in 2007, for example, found that 78 percent of Democrats, 60 percent of Republicans and 73 percent of independents favored its abolition. Democrats may tend to favor the retention of the Electoral College because African American and Latino voters are heavily concentrated in states that have large numbers of electoral votes. Republicans may have more incentives to retain the Electoral College because only three of the small states (Rhode Island, Delaware, and Hawaii) are heavily Democratic, while six of the least populous states (Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, North Dakota, and South Dakota) are heavily Republican. The disproportionate concentration of Democrats in many of the most populous states, particularly California, New York, and Illinois, also may discourage Republicans from supporting changes in the presidential election system. Moreover, the fact that the Electoral College has defeated Democrats who have won the popular vote in two recent elections also might chill support among Republicans for both NPVIC and the abolition of the Electoral College even though a candidate of either party could win the popular vote and lose the electoral vote. Abolition of the Electoral College also would run afoul of the strong Republican emphasis on states' rights and federalism. Although NPVIC has received bipartisan support, it has received legislative approval mostly in heavily Democratic states.</p>

<p>Republican incentives for retaining the Electoral College in its present form means that its reform or abolition is particularly unlikely now that Republicans dominate the federal and state governments. Following the recent election, Republicans will have 51 or 52 seats in the U.S. Senate and at least 238 of the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and will control at least 66 of the 99 state legislative chambers. Thirty-three of the governors will be Republican. This means that it is unlikely that the Senate or House even will convene committees to study the Electoral College, as they did after the 1968 and 1976 elections.</p>

<p>The idea of abolishing or circumventing the Electoral College has strong popular appeal because in many ways it is a relic of a time when voting was mostly limited to propertied white males. Its elimination would be consistent with the expansion of popular democracy, which has included the enfranchisement of men without property in the early 19th Century; the prohibition against racial discrimination in voting in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxv">Fifteenth Amendment</a> (1870); selection of U.S. senators by direct popular vote rather than election by state legislatures in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxvii">Seventeenth Amendment</a> (1913); women's suffrage in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxix">Nineteenth Amendment</a> (1920); the enfranchisement of residents of the District of Columbia in presidential elections in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxiii">Twenty-Third Amendment</a> (1961); the abolition of poll taxes in federal elections in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxiv">Twenty-Fourth Amendment</a> (1964) and in state elections by the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="casename"><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10289081725638058283">Harper v. Board of Elections</a></span> (1966); the Supreme Court's invalidation of disparity in the population of voting districts in its "one person, one vote" decisions during the 1960s; federal intervention to prevent racial discrimination in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/10301">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a>; and the lowering of the voting age to eighteen in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxvi">Twenty-Sixth Amendment</a> in 1971.</p>

<p>Political and constitutional developments during the past few years, however, have tended to discourage the extension of the franchise. The Supreme Court's 2013 decision in <span class="casename"><a href=" https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5108914727330958790">Shelby County v. Holder</a></span> invalidated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and raised questions about the authority of Congress to enact legislation to discourage racial discrimination in voting. The enactment of voter identification laws in many states also may have had the effect of discouraging the exercise of the franchise by qualified voters. Although the U.S. Supreme Court responded favorably to ID laws in <span class="casename"><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9378098557660608267">Crawford v. Marion County</a></span> in 2008, several lower federal courts recently have invalidated other laws in cases that may go before the Court. </p>

<p>Perhaps the best practical argument against abolition of the Electoral College or adoption of NPVIC is the apparent difficulty of a national recount of votes in a close and contested election. This problem is more than hypothetical because the popular vote disparity between the candidates has been quite thin in six of the past fifteen presidential elections (1960, 1968, 1976, 2000, 2004, and 2016). Such a recount might likely replicate on a national scale the nightmarish controversies of 2000 about how to count votes in Florida, generating a blizzard of acrimonious and protracted lawsuits about the technicalities of election laws in perhaps all fifty states and the District of Columbia. Differences among the states in their recount procedures could also raise troubling questions about equal protection under the reasoning of <span class="casename">Bush v. Gore</span>, which would likely place the Supreme Court in the awkward position of deciding yet another presidential election and further diminish public confidence in its impartiality.</p>

<p>Federalism probably is the best constitutional argument against abolition of the Electoral College by constitutional amendment or the adoption of NPVIC. Such measures arguably would interfere with the federalist character of the nation as envisioned by the Framers. Preservation of the states as states within the structure of the federal system is so central to the Constitution that its only unamendable provision is its guaranty that each state shall have equal representation in the Senate. Continuation of the linkage between electoral votes and representation in the Senate would help to preserve the separate identity of the states within the federal system. </p>

<p>The election of a president who has failed to receive more votes than his opponent naturally seems unfair to supporters of the defeated candidate and provides a source of some embarrassment to a nation that prides itself on its democracy. Although abolition of the Electoral College would be consistent with the extension of democracy through expansion of the franchise throughout most of American history, its retention finds support in federalism and the practical and constitutional difficulties of achieving an accurate nationwide vote in a contested election. At the present time, however, all of these considerations may be irrelevant since there seems to be insufficient political motivation for reform.  </p>

These developments seem to indicate that Americans (at least in three states) strongly support capital punishment. But&#8212when the obituary of the American death penalty is finally written&#8212the November 8th ballot initiatives will almost certainly be seen as a minor bump near the end of the road to abolition.</p>

<p>For more than a decade, support for capital punishment has steadily declined using all relevant criteria including the number of: states that retain the death penalty; executions, new death sentences imposed, as well as the results of public opinion polls. Despite the initiatives in California, Oklahoma and Nebraska, that did not change in 2016, and it is not going to change significantly in the short or long run. The death penalty in America is dying; it might be a (relatively) slow death, but the numbers don't lie.</p>

<p>This year, Delaware joined the growing number of states without a death penalty statute in place when its <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+Benjamin+Rauf+v.+State+of+Delaware&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=3049409100319525353&scilh=0">highest court ruled</a> that the state statutory complex was unconstitutional. While there are still <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-death-penalty">thirty-one states</a> that retain capital punishment, in four of those, there are official gubernatorial moratoriums in place. In most of the remaining states, the death penalty ranges from moribund to non-existent as reflected by persons sentenced to death and executed. For example, there will be <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FactSheet.pdf">less than 20 executions</a> nationwide this year, a 75% reduction from the 98 executions carried out in 1999, which was the "high water mark" for state sanctioned killing in the United States in the "modern" (post-1976) era of capital punishment. And the execution drop in 2016 follows declines in each of the last three years with 35 executions in 2015 and 39 executions in 2013. Public opinion polls show that <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FactSheet.pdf">less than half of Americans</a> support the death penalty when given the option of life without parole, down from 80% who said they did so fifteen years ago. Perhaps most importantly, this deep ambivalence about and skepticism of the death penalty can be seen in the fact that prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in fewer cases and&#8212when they do&#8212jurors are reluctant to impose it. <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FactSheet.pdf">There were 49 new death sentences imposed nationwide in 2015</a>, down from 315 that were imposed twenty years ago. There will be even fewer in 2016. This is true even in deep south conservative bastion states like South Carolina and Georgia, which have historically been high volume death penalty jurisdictions. Not a single person was sentenced to death in 2016 in either state.    </p>

<p>So, where the death penalty rubber hits the road, support for capital punishment continues to decline. And, given that death penalty politics is so localized, nothing in the recent ballot initiatives is going to affect the slow death of capital punishment. The reality is that even in California, Oklahoma and Nebraska, the number of new death sentences imposed will be negligible. California's death sentences come out of a few jurisdictions; the reality is most of the state is a "death free" zone.  Nebraska will remain, as it always has been, a state where the death penalty is rarely imposed and executions range from infrequent to non-existent, and Oklahoma's referendum saying that a currently legal punishment is still legal will have no effect on sentencing and execution practices in the Sooner state.    </p>

<p>The perceived pro-capital punishment legislative successes also need to be viewed against other voter decisions that tell a more nuanced story. In Hillsborough County (Florida), Harris County (Texas) and Jefferson County (Alabama), three very pro-death penalty prosecutors were upset by reform candidates who ran on criminal justice reform platforms that included seeking the death penalty less frequently (if at all). Governors in Washington and Oregon who supported and vowed to keep in place moratoriums on capital punishment were easily re-elected. And in Kansas, four members of the state supreme court were retained by voters despite a well-funded attempt by conservative groups to unseat them based on their decisions to invalidate the death sentence in several high profile capital cases.     </p>

<p>Taking the long view, the death penalty is dying for three primary reasons. First, it is unreliable. We know that innocent people are sentenced to death and innocent people are executed. As of today, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-and-death-penalty">156 death row inmates</a> have been exonerated and released from prison. Countless others have been released from death row (and in many cases from prison) due to their likely innocence but have not, because of the lack of irrefutable proof of innocence, technically been exonerated. And some former death row inmates, persons such as Cameron Todd Willingham, <a href="http://thewrongcarlos.net/">Carlos DeLuna</a> and Richard Charles Johnson were tragically executed despite very strong evidence of their actual innocence. Nothing in any of November 8th's ballot measures does anything to fix the death penalty's wrongful conviction problem. Another reason for the death penalty's demise is <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty">its cost</a>. All studies in all states have shown that it costs millions of dollars, and in some states tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars, to execute someone. This exceeds by factors of 10 to 100 what it costs to incarcerate someone for the remainder of their life. Thus, retaining the death penalty diverts a disproportionate share of scarce criminal justice resources to the execution of a small (and dwindling) number of persons at a time when the widespread need for broad criminal justice reform is recognized across party lines. In theory, the death penalty might be worth retaining&#8212despite its staggering cost&#8212if it were a deterrent, but all reliable studies have revealed that the existence of the death penalty in a particular state has no deterrent effect. Again, nothing that happened on election day does anything to minimize capital punishment's runaway costs. Third, what fuels the death penalty is race. <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/race-and-death-penalty">Over 80% of death row inmates</a> are there for killing someone who is white. And the chances of being sentenced to death when the defendant is black and the victim is white are greatest, even when factors such as the heinousness of the crime and the defendant's prior record are taken into account. When the victim is a white female, the odds go up even more that a death sentence will be imposed and that the person will eventually be executed. This basic pattern has not changed since the Civil War, nor has the fact that the states where the death penalty still (primarily) thrives are the former states of the Confederacy. Again, there is nothing that voters approved on election day that will, or can, rectify the death penalty's pre-occupation with race.      </p>

<p>Due to these intractable problems with capital punishment, which a growing number of Americans find unacceptable, the death penalty is on the way out the door. Abolition will not, however, be a straight line. Inevitability does not mean immediacy and working towards the correct answer to many important social issues rarely is anything but messy in a democracy. Will more people be executed before the American death penalty is officially assigned to the history books?   Yes, of course. Might there might even be an uptick in executions in some states, e.g., California, before capital punishment breathes it last gasp? Yes, that is also possible. Nevertheless, American's experiment with the death penalty is on its last legs. We may, to quote Justice Blackmun, continue to "tinker with death" for the foreseeable future, but nothing that happened on November 8th changes the inexorable march towards the end of the death penalty in this country.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.seattleu.edu/faculty/profiles/sara-rankin">Sara Rankin</a> of Seattle University School of Law discusses the effects of criminalizing homelessness in the US...</p>As a lawyer, I am particularly interested in how we take our impulses and fears and codify them into our laws and policies &#8212 laws and policies that serve to make some feel more comfortable, more protected.  But these same laws can, even in unintended ways, make others more vulnerable, less protected and  further marginalized.  This <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=830124008111089069084069104108094005109047051009003091111067023111125112081118103081097117023125108116113093086109104106026116057059040078014075102127071111095127100008052000105095080080026114024073067124109079019002076107006005109115012073092112115022&EXT=pdf">process</a> is often referred to as the <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/report-more-cities-passing-laws-criminalizing-homelesness.php">criminalization of homelessness</a> [JURIST report].</p>

<p>Criminalization refers to laws that prohibit or severely restrict one's ability to engage in necessary life-sustaining activities in public, even when that person has no reasonable alternative.  Examples are laws that prohibit sitting, standing, <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/federal-government-challenges-idaho-law-for-criminalizing-homeless.php">sleeping</a> [JURIST report], receiving food, going to the bathroom, asking for help and protecting one's self from the elements.</p>

<p>These are actions that none of us could forgo for long and continue to survive.  Yet the act of surviving in public is so tightly regulated that people experiencing homelessness cannot avoid somehow tripping a wire and incurring significant potentially life-altering consequences.</p>

<p>Criminalization laws don't have to start as a criminal charge.  Many do.  But many start as civil infractions &#8212 a ticket with conditions and requirements, like show up to court, avoid an area for significant period, or pay a fee.  These conditions are extremely difficult for poor and homeless individuals to meet; when they fail to do so (because of sickness, lack of money, lack of transportation, mental illness, and physical disability, etc.), their civil infraction can mutate into a misdemeanor. Once an individual is saddled with a misdemeanor, they may be ineligible to access shelter, food, services and other benefits that might help them emerge from homelessness.  </p>

<p>By criminalizing their efforts to survive in public, we have made these human beings more resistant to recovery.  More likely to remain on the streets. More likely to become sick, to self-medicate, to be incarcerated and even more likely to die.</p>

<p><a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=809117069101031090082098123087031074000085037059021024124065100030009030090089012110060097037059060026020097004123027112122100025086030014047009026121076011001124004005033009092106123069119030114092122102068124024119126076068031085065108030099069001088&EXT=pdf">Criminalization comes at a significant cost</a>, not just to the lives and liberties of poor men, women and children, but also to society generally: it is far more expensive to criminalize poverty and homelessness than it is to pursue non-punitive alternatives such as permanent supportive housing or mental health and substance abuse treatment.</p>

<p>So if it is such a bad idea, why do we criminalize visible poverty?  There are many reasons, but a primary contributor is the power of our instinctive response to visible poverty.  We are stained by what I call the influence of exile:  deeply ingrained class and status distinctions that can inconspicuously, even unconsciously, guide us to create and enforce laws and policies that restrict the visibility of poor people in public space.</p>

<p><a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=269126002097095112101109076103083068122032049015054052117086113094066067121118118101033022034012040098112081065104127118118116111029057079021093030071067069115091127095033045004068020076021082024114065027104088119090001112080011122112112099119099019005&EXT=pdf">Studies show</a> that evidence of human struggle or desperation commonly provokes fear, annoyance, disgust or anger from those who witness it.   Even neurological tests show that when we are confronted with evidence of visible poverty, it elicits higher rates of negative reactions than exposure to any other marginalized trait, including traits historically associated with discrimination, such as race or gender. The fear and disgust we've specially reserved for poverty is frequently codified in our laws and policies &#8212 this is what I mean by the criminalization of homelessness.  </p>

<p>Criminalization is growing nationwide. <a href="https://www.nlchp.org/">The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty</a> [official website] has been tracking these laws in 187 cities throughout the country for well over a decade. Their 2016 report examined changes in criminalization laws over the last ten years, and they reported some distressing findings. For example, city-wide bans on camping in public increased by 69 percent; begging by 43 percent; standing around by 88 percent; and sitting or lying down by 52 percent.  And <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-los-angeles-ban-on-living-in-motor-vehicles.php">bans </a> [JURIST report] on <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=2776423 ">sleeping in vehicles</a> &#8212 the thin tin line between you and the street &#8212 <a href="https://www.nlchp.org/documents/Housing-Not-Handcuffs"> increased by a staggering 143 percent</a> [official report].</p>

<p><a href="https://law.seattleu.edu/centers-and-institutes/korematsu-center/initiatives/homeless-rights-advocacy-project">Homeless Rights Advocacy Project</a> (HRAP) [official website] at the Seattle University School of Law surveyed <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=119069021086104126017089069004096009051005086011033030075065111086110110018120123027031035006052015046051002090091126093112103114073094012045091099026101105113103028038045022122107118102008003073080105080066031111079097014119030069096088025084093001101&EXT=pdf">criminalization laws in Washington state</a> [official report]  in 2015, which showed similar results. <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=630093101127024070124127080066003068031053050050057049071105016072103095077100095094028058042052005023061081019004015112012068014012043035035122107111126067031106066075080007070011004086105088112065023070093127071100113107125094081076103087124093119&EXT=pdf">California</a> [official report] and <a href="http://www.law.du.edu/documents/homeless-advocacy-policy-project/2-16-16-Final-Report.pdf">Colorado</a> [official report] recently completed similar studies. </p>

<p><a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=2602318 or">HRAP observed</a> many other troubling trends, such as the fact that a significant number of people spend more than 90 days in jail for violating these laws. And as rates of income disparity rise in a city, so does the rate at which that city enforces criminalization laws.  In other words the greater the gap between the rich and the poor in a city, the more punitive that space becomes for the poor and homeless people within its boundaries.</p>

<p>These are contemporary snapshots of criminalization, but we've been good at it for some time.  Jim Crow, Anti-Okie and Sundown Town laws are just a few notorious examples of how <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=876127020083071018118019115084026098032032005076035071068099121022104024109098077123038034063030056048039113094093108000087125019016043042041099008002024079097120093093037091117003102001065011125010086121089116115075086025125004126103086121103097002116&EXT=pdf">discrimination can fuel the expulsion </a> of "undesirable people" from public space; today we reflect on these legal artifacts with some sense of collective shame.</p>

<p>But many of these same historically marginalized groups are <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=488007067005080126090102086064087110058022049054058085108021088027104002025090125018122027044107111060037067103091075090109116006036025010060122126077031071065107071034005024008126102123114125112067007031065116018103118118070001031099076069116101075073&EXT=pdf">disproportionately impacted by criminalization today</a>:  people of color, single female-headed families, people with mental illness or addition, LGBTQ youth, immigrants are all disproportionately represented in poor and homeless populations compared to the general population.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=2754254"> disproportionate representation </a>of marginalized groups suffering poverty and homelessness is not a coincidence; it is a symptom of structural inequities that we all create and maintain. Common stereotypes quietly influence our judgments regarding someone else's worthiness, and, in turn, these judgments influence how we restrict the rights and resources of poor people generally, but of visibly poor people in particular. </p>

<p>It is the sustained visibility of poverty that prompts us to react. We firmly want poverty and human desperation to remain private.</p>

<p>We perpetuate this marginalization through lenses of blame. <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2754254">Studies show</a> that public support or tolerance for certain groups may turn on the degree to which society believes those group members are responsible for a particular trait. Compared to other countries, the US is particularly enamored with the "bootstrap" work ethic:  the belief that, if you just work hard enough, you should avoid poverty. Many Americans believe the most significant cause of income inequality is the failure of the poor to work as hard as the more affluent.</p>

<p>We also commonly embrace the fiction that homelessness is simply a bad choice and that people experiencing homelessness do not want something better.  We tend to assume that if someone declines an offer of service, that person deserves their fate &#8212 that person deserves society's divestment.  They deserve not to be cared about.</p>

<p>Societally, we rest on the assumption that emergency shelter is a solution, but it isn't.  It is a stop-gap measure that very few of us would be willing to choose for ourselves.</p>

<p>We must reconsider what we define as <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=497104031021107089083099017123099004003044057035002028109092101094001126081103109007024026006007024061114114066123023069023016049061090039081012100117081067113096071007018054110086085098115100094119004097088124001095025068030067121000083122112077125020&EXT=pdf">meaningful offers of shelter</a>. Is it a reasonable offer of shelter if we require people to people to give up their family members, their beloved pets, or their only community? What about their personal belongings?  Are there conditions they need to satisfy &#8212 or put another way &#8212 are there measures of privacy, autonomy or human dignity they will be required to give up?</p>

<p>Is it a reasonable offer of shelter if we ask another human being to give up all these things for one night of uneasy sleep next to a bunch of strangers only to be ejected back on to the street the next morning without any of these things?</p>

<p>The bottom line is we have taught many people to distrust services and shelter. Through experience, many people have learned that emergency shelters do not promote their sense of safety, stability, and dignity. This experience is so deeply embedded that even if a real offer of meaningful service comes along, reasonable people have already learned not to accept it. They have learned emergency responses do not create the experience of a home or even a real, human place to belong.  So the next time we feel incredulous that someone would pass on an offer of "service" or shelter, we might instead consider the possibility that we often present people with a false choice and then blame them for not taking it.</p>

<p>So, what are solutions? If the problem is visible poverty, the solution is not to eject poor people from view (although is the primary achievement of the criminalization of homelessness). Actually we should strive for just the opposite.</p>

<p>The crisis of poverty &#8212 as long as it exists &#8212 must be visible in public space. Proximity is necessary to create social change.  <a href="http://eji.org/bryan-stevenson">Professor Bryan Stevenson</a> [official profile] argues that the first thing we must do to fight injustice is to get proximate to it. We must show up and see things with our own eyes. Then we will have no choice but to act.  Just as importantly we can only develop viable solutions when we have an up-close view of a problem. </p>

<p>Proximity is one modest suggestion to make real change within ourselves. Create meaningful and sustained opportunities to get to know someone who is poor or struggling with housing instability. Volunteer at a shelter.  Get to know some of the intelligent and inspiring people struggling with these challenges. In all likelihood, that proximity will convert you.  It will make you feel compelled to seek the change we so desperately need.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://instituteofcannabis.com/about/faculty/jody-lehrer/">Jody H. Lehrer</a>, of <a href="https://instituteofcannabis.com/"> Northeastern Institute of Cannabis </a>, discusses the national movement towards the legalization of cannabis...</p><strong>W</strong>ith increasing frequency states are enacting laws, either through legislators or through voter initiatives, that are chipping away at long standing prohibitionary policies against cannabis possession that still exist undisturbed at the federal level. While the most significant change is flat out legalization - as opposed to decriminalization - there is much more at stake than that a 21 year-old adult be able to choose to use marijuana, just as he or she chooses to drink alcohol. There are significant beneficial socio-economic consequences of legalization to be discussed. </p>

                <p>In many states, simple possession of cannabis, for personal use, is no longer a crime as possession is demoted to a mere civil offense carrying a fine much like what one would face for running a red light. <a href="http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR800/RR864/RAND_RR864.pdf">Decriminalization</a> [pdf] by some states dates back to the 1970s.  </p>

                <p>Still other states have adopted laws that allow either for limited use of low THC strains of cannabis for just a few types of conditions (e.g., epilepsy) or for more expansive use of a many strains of cannabis, not just those containing low THC, for a wide array of debilitating medical conditions. Other states are going even further and adopting laws (through ballot initiatives) that reject prohibition outright, legalizing cannabis for adults through a system of regulation and taxation, similar to the one that exists relative to alcohol.</p>

                <p>All of these laws - decriminalization, medical use, and adult use - serve jointly (no pun intended) to weaken prohibition at the state level but have left unscathed prohibition at the federal level.</p>

                <p>Federal cannabis prohibition is often <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/paradox/htele">traced back</a> to Harry Anslinger who headed the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, established in the Treasury Department, in 1930. Under Anslinger's reign, which lasted until 1962, drugs were "increasingly criminalized."</p>

                <p>Many cite the seemingly relentless "War on Drugs" (in)famously waged by President Nixon who, in 1971, called drugs like marijuana "America's public enemy number one." Nixon spurred a massive effort to thwart entry into the United States of marijuana from Mexico through "Operation Intercept" which, while successful in curtailing Mexican-grown marijuana, is thought to have simply <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/paradox/htele">rerouted marijuana</a> into the United States from Columbia.</p>

                <p>The fact that federal prohibition against cannabis is alive and well is perhaps best highlighted by the fact that cannabis is considered a Schedule 1 substance, alongside heroin, LSD, peyote, and ecstasy, under the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/812">Controlled Substances Act</a> (CSA), <a href="https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml">enforced by</a> the federal <a href="https://www.dea.gov/index.shtml">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> [official site]. Scheduling is based upon factors including the drug's "acceptable medical use" and its "abuse or dependency potential." Note that opiates are classified under Schedule 2,  as substance recognized to have medical value unlike substances in Schedule 1.</p>

                <p>States have largely eschewed federal prohibition against the use of cannabis, even for medical purpose. Instead, states have, as discussed, used numerous approaches to make inroads against prohibition (e.g., legalization). The arguments in favor of legalization are also numerous.</p>

                <p>In 2016, voters in four states (Massachusetts, Maine, California, and Nevada) legalized marijuana use by persons 21 or older, joining Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia, which had previously legalized cannabis for adult use. </p>

                <p>Arguments supporting legalization (and attendant regulation and taxation) have included:<br />
                    •That one should be able to choose what to put in one's body and be responsible for one's own choices and the consequences of them (the <a href="https://alibertarianfuture.com/define-libertarian/the-libertarian-argument-for-legalizing-marijuana/">Libertarian argument</a>);<br />
                    •That cannabis has medicinal characteristics (this is already recognized in the many states that have legalized cannabis for medical purposes, which at the time of this writing total 28, with recent) medical cannabis legalization in North Dakota, Florida, and <a href="http://norml.org/legal/item/arkansas-medical-marijuana">Arkansas</a>);<br />
                    •That the illicit market can be <a href="https://www.safeandsmartpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BRCPathwaysReport.pdf">reduced</a>;<br />
                    •That <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/marijuana-legalization-and-regulation">public revenues</a> can be increased though taxation; <br />
                    •That <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/marijuana-legalization-and-regulation">jobs</a> will be created;<br />
                    •That limited law enforcement <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/marijuana-legalization-and-regulation">resources</a> can be saved and used for other purposes such as for <a href="https://www.regulatemassachusetts.org/yeson4">public health and safety</a>;<br />
                    •That marijuana arrests <a href="https://www.regulatemassachusetts.org/yeson4/">ruin lives</a>.</p>

                <p>While all such arguments are compelling, one of the most significant arguments is a socio-economic one; elimination of unfair singling out by law enforcement of the poor and people of color when it comes to enforcement of laws regarding the simple possession of cannabis. </p>

                <p>The need to address the disparate impact on minorities and the poor has been demonstrated through numerous studies on this topic. Regardless of one's stance on legalization, inequitable enforcement of drug laws is not an acceptable trade off. </p>

                <p>According to a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/feature/war-marijuana-black-and-white">study</a> by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [official site], "enforcement of marijuana laws generates some of the justice system's starkest racial disparities." Blacks are four times more likely to be arrested for simple possession than are Whites. In some states, Blacks are up to 15 times more likely to be arrested for possession than are Whites.</p>

                <p>In a 2015 <a href="https://www.safeandsmartpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BRCPathwaysReport.pdf">report</a> [pdf] issued by California's "<a href="https://www.safeandsmartpolicy.org">Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana Policy</a>," [official site] established in anticipation of legalization, the Commission states that one goal that should be met when legalizing is to meet California's diverse populations "and address racial and economic disparities, replacing criminalization with public health and economic development." </p>

                <p>In another study of marijuana related arrests in Virginia, developed by the <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/virginia">Drug Policy Alliance</a> [official site], it was found that from 2011 to 2013 arrests for simple possession rose by almost percent 110% to nearly 22,000, with 82% of the increase representing arrests of "<a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Racial_Disparities_in_Marijuana_Arrests_in_Virginia_2003-2013.pdf">black Virginians</a>" [pdf].</p>

                <p>The report went on to say that the "enforcement of marijuana possession laws in the state, while having no<br />
                    impact on overall use or availability, has had a disproportionate impact on Virginia's black communities."  </p>

                <p>Legalization eliminates criminal sanctions for everyone: no more targeting of minorities or the poor.</p>

                <p>A concise statement of the fact that legalization is not just about marijuana comes from Boston City Counsel member Tito Jackson speaking in favor of <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Marijuana_Legalization,_Question_4_(2016)">Question 4</a>, legalizing cannabis for adults age 21 and above, in Massachusetts. He said "It's not only about marijuana, it's about fixing <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/10/06/report-finds-sharp-racial-disparities-marijuana-arrests/VKB2BB3Oqn1Rd0MHiXhFRN/amp.html">injustices</a>."</p>

                <p>So, the next time you weigh the advantages of cannabis legalization, stick this in your pipe and smoke it!</p>

		<title>ATM Operators Need Early Injunction Against Unfair Rules</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://donresnikofflaw.com/">Don Resnikoff</a> of <a href="http://www.rubinpllc.com/">Counsel to Rubin PLLC</a> discusses the need for injunctive relief in the ATM anti-trust case ... </p><br />
                <strong>J</strong>URIST previously <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/supreme-court-lets-antitrust-suit-over-atm-fees-continue.php">reported</a> that the US Supreme Court published an <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/111716zr_f2bh.pdf">order</a> stating that it would no longer hear the appeal in two antitrust suits by ATM operators and consumers against Visa, MasterCard and several banks concerning ATM fees. The suit alleges that the defendants, credit card companies and banks have agreed to keep the ATM charges high. They have implemented rules preventing independent ATM operators from setting lower ATM fees for customers that use networks that charge the ATM operators less than Visa or MasterCard.</p>

                <p>The lawsuit was originally dismissed by the district court. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/E51DF33EC0A5417085257E97004F6527/$file/14-7004-1566017.pdf">reversed</a> the decision and ordered the case to continue in the district court. The defendants appealed the decision to the US Supreme Court, which <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-grants-cert-for-anti-trust-brankruptcy-discrimination-federal-jurisdiction-and-citizen.php">granted</a> certiorari and was set to hear the case in December. However, without leave from the Court, petitioners abandoned the original argument upon which the grant of certiorari was based and advanced a different argument on the merits, so the basis for the certiorari grant was no longer present. The Supreme Court in its recent order decided that its earlier grant of certiorari was improvident, so that the appeal is dismissed and the case can go forward in the district court.</p>

                <p>With the petition for certiorari dismissed, the plaintiff ATM operators have the opportunity to proceed to a trial on their allegations of price fixing behavior by banks that make use of the Visa and MasterCard networks and competitive networks. The ATM operators seek to end the rules that impose access fees favorable to MasterCard and Visa but harmful to the operators. These rules threaten the viability of their businesses. The fees on top of high and increasing wholesale network fees from Visa and MasterCard, along with burdensome costs such as those caused by the compelled transition to EMV chip cards. (EMV stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa and is a global standard for cards equipped with computer chips and the technology used to authenticate chip-card transactions).</p>

                <p>The operator&#8217;s litigation challenges Visa and MasterCard Rules that allow ATM operators to charge consumers a fee &#8212 known as an &#8220;access fee&#8221; &#8212 to withdraw money. The access fee rules of Visa and MasterCard forbid ATM operators from charging a lower access fee when the debit card transaction is routed over a less-expensive network. For example, a competitor network might cost the ATM operator $ 0.15 less than Visa or MasterCard. But because the challenged rules forbid it, the operator of the particular ATM cannot pass that savings on to the customer unless it charges the same reduced fee to the users of the more-expensive Visa and MasterCard networks. Thus, the rule prevents the operator from increasing the attractiveness and potential profitability of the ATM machine by offering the customer lower access fees for using a less expensive debit card. The Visa/MasterCard access fee rules fix prices and seriously injures ATM operators and customers.</p>

                <p>The Visa and MasterCard rules sets a price floor that eliminates any incentive for customers to use a less-expensive debit card and thus to switch away from Visa and MasterCard. In a competitive environment &#8212 an environment the ATM operators want to encourage through their litigation &#8212 the rational response of ATM owners to Visa and MasterCard&#8217;s higher prices would be to create a price differential to encourage consumers to use cards that access less-expensive networks. Because ATM services are freely substitutable &#8212 the terminal dispenses money or it doesn&#8217;t &#8212 cost is the principle differentiator between operators; that is, a customer will choose a machine that charges her $2 over one that charges $2.50.</p>

                <p>ATM operators have been litigating for years for the right to attract customers with lower access fees if the customers use cards that access less-expensive networks. The US Supreme Court decision to dismiss the certiorari petition as improvidently granted means that at last the operators will have an opportunity to present proofs to the district court in support of their complaint allegations. The complaint alleges that defendant banks are horizontal competitors that entered into a naked price-fixing agreement with respect to the fees they charge their customers for ATM services. That agreement reduced competition between the banks with respect to both bank customers and users of ATMs of independent ATM operators like the plaintiffs. The fixed price reduced the number of ATMs and consumer choice, while increasing consumer costs. The banks&#8217; access fee rules also facilitate competition-blocking activity by Visa and MasterCard in the upstream market for ATM network services by charging consumers supra-competitive prices.</p>

                <p>Plaintiffs want the case to proceed as a class action and for members of the operator class to obtain treble damages. Most importantly, the operator plaintiffs ought to get prompt declaratory and injunctive relief that will redress the unlawful conduct of the banks, Visa and MasterCard and allow ATM operators to earn a fair livelihood and stay in business. That means that the courts should, as soon as possible, require Visa and MasterCard to set aside their restrictive rules so that operators are allowed to attract customers with lower access fees if the customers use cards that access less-expensive networks.</p>

                <p>The price-fixing rules add severe costs to ATM operators and their customers on top of high and increasing wholesale network fees from Visa and MasterCard, along with burdensome costs such as those caused by the compelled transition to EMV chip cards. The operators pointed out, in a memo supporting a motion for a preliminary injunction filed with the district court some months ago, that Visa and MasterCard ATM access fee rules reduce operator revenue. The problem is further compounded by cost pressure on ATM operators coming from high and increasing wholesale network fees (thereby lowering the operators&#8217; interchange revenue). In addition to the &#8220;fixed and flat&#8221; retail prices maintained by defendants&#8217; anticompetitive rule and high network fees, ATM operators must deal with costs of the MasterCard deadline of October 2016 and Visa deadline of October 2017 to transition terminal equipment to accept the EMV chip cards. The EMV transition is very expensive for operators. </p>

                <p>These burdens on ATM operators result in many independent ATM operators being pressured entirely out of existence. In addition, for ATM operators that remain in business, the Visa and MasterCard access fee rules reduce the number of ATM locations that can be cost-and risk-justified. ATM operators will find that some terminals lack sufficient volume to remain in service. Decommissioning existing ATM machines is costly and takes machines from neighborhoods that need them badly. But removal is compelled if a location fails to pay for itself. Some operators have needed to decommission a high percentage of their installed machines.</p>

                <p>For many ATM operators, this litigation is a matter of survival. Without the ability to charge competitive access fees and attract customers it will be difficult for some operators to stay in business and offer service in locations where banks often will not go. The ATM operators need an early injunction against operation of the Visa and MasterCard access fee rules.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://harrisbricken.com/our-team/hilary-bricken/">Hilary Bricken</a>, of <a href="http://cannalawgroup.com">Canna Law Group</a>, discusses the Trump administration and how it could impact the status of cannabis at the state level...</p><strong>W</strong>ith a recent <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2016/10/19/two-major-surveys-find-record-support-fo">Gallup poll</a> showing 60 percent of Americans favor cannabis legalization, it should come as no surprise that eight out of nine states voted for marijuana legal reform through ballot initiatives in this past election. In California, Nevada, Maine, and Massachusetts, voters approved the legalization, taxation and regulation of marijuana for adults 21 and older. And in Florida, North Dakota, Arkansas, and Montana, voters approved various medical marijuana legal regimes. Arizona, which already has medical marijuana, was the only the state that failed to pass its marijuana ballot initiative.</p>

                <p>Of all of the states that recently legalized, California and Florida will undoubtedly be the ones to most impact progress for national marijuana law reform. California has a pre-existing, vast medical marijuana industry that will finally come under significant state regulation and Florida will become the first state in the conservative Southeast to have a comprehensive medical marijuana licensing system. Both of these states are large in size with massive populations to match and, perhaps most importantly, both states have substantial influence on federal policies and lawmaking. Marijuana law reform in California and Florida should bolster the momentum of state-by-state legalization and "medicalization" of marijuana, in spite of the current federal law that renders marijuana illegal. </p>

                <p>Though state legal marijuana netted large gains this November, national marijuana legalization (or even the re-scheduling of marijuana) remains uncertain given the new presidential administration. </p>

                <p>When it comes to President-elect Donald Trump, it is anyone's best guess as to what will happen with marijuana. Trump made various statements throughout his campaign on every side of the marijuana legalization issue. During the campaign he jumped  between positions ranging from full-on legalization to saying that it cannabis is a states' rights issue, to saying that legal marijuana has caused "a lot of problems in Colorado." Regardless of Trump's marijuana vacillations, the most important appointment President Trump can make for the marijuana industry is for attorney general, who heads up the Department of Justice, the agency that enforces and prosecutes federal crimes, including federal drug laws. Federal enforcement against state-legal marijuana enterprises is generally handled under the<a href="http://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/the-feds-are-blunting-legal-marijuana-in-america/"> 2013 Cole Memo</a>, which outlines the federal marijuana enforcement policy of enforcing the federal Controlled Substances Act only under egregious circumstances in those states with a comprehensive state legal medical marijuana regime. </p>

                <p>It is important to realize that the Cole Memo is not law, but rather a mere statement of policy by the Department of Justice. This means it can be withdrawn by the Department of Justice pretty much any time by the new Attorney General. In other words, the newly legalized cannabis industry is to a certain extent beholden to the whims of Jeff Sessions, the new attorney general.</p>

                <p>To put it bluntly and to state what should already be obvious to most of you, the appointment of Jeff Sessions as attorney general does not bode well for marijuana users or state-legal marijuana businesses. Sessions is a known drug war proponent who testified at an April Senate hearing that, "good people do not smoke marijuana," and who believes that marijuana is more harmful than alcohol because "Lady Gaga says she's addicted to it." Fortunately, just because Sessions dislikes marijuana does not automatically mean we should expect to see increased federal law enforcement action against marijuana users or marijuana businesses in states that permit them. Any federal attempt to undo state-legal marijuana legalization would be incredibly unpopular politically, and it seems Sessions wants to focus on national security, terrorism, and immigration as his primary areas of attention. To put this in political perspective, 70 percent of Florida voters voted to legalize medical marijuana in that state and many of those who voted for legalization had to have voted for Trump. I just do not see the Trump administration launching a new war against cannabis when this does not appear to be a big issue for him and when doing so would anger so many.</p>

                <p>Importantly, Sessions is restricted when it comes to medical marijuana. So long as the <a href="http://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/icymi-ninth-circuit-rules-doj-cant-stub-out-medical-marijuana-businesses/">federal spending bill</a> continues to say that the federal government cannot spend money to interfere with state medical marijuana laws, Sessions should be hamstrung in his ability to take anti-cannabis actions at least in those states with medical cannabis regimes.</p>

                <p>But beyond the political calculations, there is little stopping Sessions from going after state-legal marijuana businesses that "touch the plant" as part of their recreational marijuana operations. There is nothing legally preventing federal agents from raiding recreational marijuana businesses, as possessing, distributing, processing and manufacturing marijuana remain illegal under federal law and the federal spending bills only apply to medical marijuana. The Cole Memo is not going to stop the Department of Justice, and anyway, as mentioned above, Sessions can withdraw or nullify that memo with the stroke of his pen. Logistically, however, there simply are not enough federal agents or resources to enforce federal marijuana laws everywhere, but that will not necessarily stop them from targeting big players to set an example. President Trump has already essentially conceded the logistical folly of deporting around twelve million illegal immigrants and we are optimistic he (and even Sessions) will eventually need to implicitly or explicitly concede that using federal law enforcement to shut down state-legal recreational cannabis operations is equally unwise. </p>

                <p>Lastly, Sessions still has to go through the confirmation process. The last time he went through this process in trying to secure a federal judgeship, in 1986, he was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/jeff-sessions-racism-allegations/index.html">rejected</a> for having made a slew of racist comments. There is no reason to believe he is any less racist now (as this is a man who <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/11/21/1602586/-Sessions-Confederate-flag-critics-seek-to-delegitimize-fabulous-accomplishments-of-our-country">accuses confederate flag critics </a>of "...seeking to delegitimize our country's accomplishments"), but it is still unlikely he will be rejected this time. Nonetheless, there will no doubt be political pressure on Sessions from both parties to maintain his focus on real law enforcement and leave marijuana policy to the states. The hope of all of us in the marijuana industry is that he and the Department of Justice will have far bigger fish to fry than state-legal marijuana. But only time will tell. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/faculty/profiles/faculty.html?facultynum=757">Markus Rauschecker</a> of University of Maryland, Francis King Carey School of Law discusses the effects of a new Chinese cybersecurity law and the need for response by the US Congress...</p>China's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress recently <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/2016-11/07/content_2001605.htm?lang=en">adopted</a> [Chinese] a new comprehensive cybersecurity law. Throughout its drafting the law has been <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/china-approves-controversial-cybersecurity-law.php">heavily criticized</a> by businesses as well as human rights groups. Businesses have expressed their dismay that the law is overly broad and vague, making compliance difficult. Moreover some of the law's requirements would establish real barriers to <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/china-implements-new-internet-regulations-for-search-companies.php">conducting business</a>. Human rights groups are also concerned about the law's breadth and vagueness. Some of the law's provisions may be used to suppress activities deemed contrary to Chinese state interests. Even more troubling is that the law explicitly establishes censorship of certain online expression.</p>

<p>The Chinese government has continually argued that it needs to do more to secure against the barrage of cyber threats and also <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/china-adopts-new-national-security-law.php">protect national security</a>. As expressed in Article One of the cybersecurity law, the law's intent is to "ensure network security, to safeguard cyberspace sovereignty, national security and the societal public interest, to protect the lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal persons and other organizations, and to promote the healthy development of economic and social informatization." To understand business and human rights groups' concerns about the law, it is helpful to look at some of the more significant provisions of this extensive cybersecurity law.</p>

<p>From a business interest perspective, one of the most troubling provisions of the cybersecurity law is the requirement that data generated within China by critical information infrastructure operators, <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/2016-11/07/content_2001605.htm">must be stored in China</a> [Chinese]. The current lack of a clear definition of, "critical information infrastructure operators" means it is uncertain which businesses would have to store data in China and which businesses would be exempt from this obligation. The law does provide that, upon review, the state may grant exemptions to this data provision if there is a business need to store information outside of mainland China. Nonetheless, this legal requirement will be a significant burden to companies that operate internationally and rely on the ability to transfer data across borders.</p>

<p>The new law also establishes an even greater basis for government involvement in business practices.  With the justification of protecting national security, the<a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/2016-11/07/content_2001605.htm"> Chinese state is requiring businesses</a> [Chinese] that purchase network products and services that might impact national security to go through "a national security review organized by the State network information departments and relevant departments of the State Council". Additionally, the law requires businesses to<a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/2016-11/07/content_2001605.htm"> provide technical assistance to law enforcement </a> [Chinese] in matters of national security and in criminal investigations.  </p>

<p>These provisions all raise questions and uncertainty for businesses about their legal obligations. Will businesses be required to provide Chinese authorities with source code, or propriety information, or backdoor access into encrypted data? The answers to these questions are unknown at this time, but, based on the broad language of the law, it is likely that businesses would have to comply with such governmental requests. </p>

<p>Businesses who<a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/2016-11/07/content_2001605.htm"> violate the law</a> [Chinese] may face penalties in the form of fines or even the "temporary suspension of operations, a suspension of business for corrections, closing down of websites, cancellation of relevant operations permits or cancellation of business licenses" or the freezing of assets.</p>

<p>Foreign technology companies have been very outspoken in their <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-cyber-idUSKBN132049">opposition to the new law</a>. <a href="http://www.sheppardmullin.com/jzimmerman">James Zimmerman</a>, the chairman of the<a href="http://www.amchamchina.org/"> American Chamber of Commerce in China</a>, said the controversial provisions are "vague, ambiguous and subject to broad interpretation by regulatory authorities."  </p>

<p>This past August over 40 business groups from the US, Europe and Asia <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/documents/files/aug_2016_letter_on_prcg_cybersecurity_regulations_-final-en.pdf">sent a letter</a> [PDF] to <a href="http://english.gov.cn/premier/">Chinese Premier Li Keqiang</a> to voice their concerns about the cybersecurity law. In their letter, the business groups asserted that the new law would not create any additional security benefits and would actually create a barrier to entry and trade for companies. Moreover the businesses are concerned that the law's data retention and law enforcement assistance requirements could actually expose system and personal information to malicious actors.  </p>

<p>Of course the business requirements described above immediately raise human rights concerns as well. Leading human rights organizations have<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/06/china-abusive-cybersecurity-law-set-be-passed"> criticized</a> the law. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch </a> [official website] has called the new law "a regressive measure that strengthens censorship, surveillance, and other controls over the Internet." Moreover, "while many of the law's measures are not new, most were previously only informally applied or defined in lower-level regulation. Elevating these powers in the cybersecurity law sends a signal that the government may enforce the requirements more strictly, leaving less leeway for tech companies to avoid implementation."  </p>

<p>Most troubling is that the law explicitly provides for censorship of activities and speech that the Chinese state finds objectionable. Article Twelve provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"any person and organization using networks shall abide by the Constitution and laws, observe public order and respect social morality; they must not endanger network security, and must not use the network to engage in activities endangering national security, national honor and interests, inciting subversion of national sovereignty, the overturn of the socialist system, inciting separatism, undermining national unity...creating or disseminating false information to disrupt the economic or social order."</blockquote>

<p>Remarkably the law also <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/2016-11/07/content_2001605.htm">requires</a> [Chinese] that users of Internet services must provide their real names and identities when signing up for services. This requirement will likely effectuate censorship in that individuals will be extremely cautious in expressing their views if they lack anonymity. </p>

<p>During a public comment period, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> [official website] issued a <a href="file:///C:/Users/Krista/Downloads/ASA1722062015ENGLISH.pdf">report on the draft legislation</a> [PDF] in which it argued that the cybersecurity law "would legalize censorship and surveillance in the name of national security beyond the requirements set out in international law, including strict tests of necessity and proportionality."  </p>

<p>The Chinese cybersecurity law is set to go into effect in June 2017. Until then, and beyond that time, the business community, human rights organizations and other stakeholders should continue to speak out against the law's distressing provisions. </p>

<p>However the Chinese law should also be seen as a call to action for the US Congress. <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/pakistan-lawmakers-approve-cybersecurity-law.php">Countries around the world</a> are grappling with <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/uk-parliament-passes-controversial-surveillance-law.php">cyber threats</a>. Yet <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2012/04/us-house-approves-controversial-cybersecurity-bill.php">different countries</a> have very different views on how to best address these threats. Technological abilities, legal structures, and fundamental values all affect the varying approaches to cybersecurity. As countries are evolving in their ways of advancing cybersecurity, it is imperative that the US proposes an alternative to the Chinese model. </p>

<p>A law passed by Congress will not only help to address some of the cybersecurity challenges that exist within the US, but it would also serve as a powerful counterexample to the Chinese law. Congress must pass a law that demonstrates how to address cybersecurity, while appropriately balancing the interests of security, business, civil liberties and privacy. Certainly this is no easy task. Yet the adoption of China's cybersecurity law makes it more important than ever that Congress makes comprehensive cybersecurity legislation a priority.</p>

		<title>The Iran Sanctions Extension Act: Enforcement Overkill</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Professor <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/professor/john-b-quigley/">John B. Quigley</a> </a> of <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/">the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law</a> argues that international changes to approaching and monitoring Iran's nuclear program have made recent congressional action unnecessary... </p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/6297">Iran Sanctions Extension Act</a> was adopted by the US House of Representatives on November 15, and it may be passed by the US Senate shortly. The Act would extend a statute originally enacted in 1996 that provided for a regime of sanctions that can be implemented by the President, related primarily to the possibility that Iran might build nuclear weapons. The current Act includes a sunset provision that makes it expire on December 31, 2016.</p>

<p>Congressional supporters of the Extension Act are numerous. It passed the House on a vote of 419 to one. A Senate vote could be just as lopsided. So even if President Barack Obama were to veto, the two chambers could likely override.</p>

<p>The question is whether an extension is warranted or advisable. The nuclear arrangement, reached with Iran in July 2015 and entitled the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, seems to be working, despite minor hiccups.  In <a href="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/16/09/gov2016-46.pdf">a report</a> [PDF] released in September, the <a href="https://www.iaea.org/">International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) </a> indicated that it had access to Iran to carry out verification by installing equipment that allows it to monitor uranium enrichment remotely on a 24-hour basis. </p>

<p>The arrangement was reached<a href="/paperchase/2015/07/un-security-council-approves-iran-nuclear-deal.php"> in July 2015</a> between Iran on one side and the five UN Security Council member states plus Germany on the other. The deal is structured in a way that favors the outside powers over Iran. It is not a treaty, a point made clear by Secretary of State John Kerry while the parties were negotiating. If Iran does not comply with the Plan, sanctions the Security Council had previously imposed on Iran over uranium enrichment can be instituted. Secretary Kerry described the deal as self-enforcing.</p>

<p>By a side understanding between Iran and the IAEA in July 2015, Iran agreed to inspections that are more intrusive than what is otherwise required of Iran as a signatory to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/conf/npt/2005/npttreaty.html">Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1968</a>.</p>

<p>The UN Security Council maintains oversight of the deal. Shortly after the parties came to terms on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Security Council adopted <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2231(2015)">Resolution 2231</a>, which provisionally lifted sanctions previously imposed by the Council subject to compliance by Iran with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. </p>

<p>In Resolution 2231, the Security Council did not cancel its call on states to impose sanctions on Iran. Had it done so, a re-imposition of sanctions would require a new Security Council resolution, and such a resolution would be subject to veto by any one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. As the deal reads, however, a vote to be taken in the Security Council would be a vote to lift sanctions, hence a vote that the United States could veto.</p>

<p>Resolution 2231 also provided for a multi-layer system of oversight involving the Security Council and the IAEA. In a one-year anniversary review of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in July 2016, the Security Council heard extensive <a href="http://www.un.org/undpa/en/speeches-statements/18072016/Nonproliferation">reports</a>. While there were no allegations of Iranian violations on the central issues, there was concern expressed <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-missiles-idUSKCN0WV2HE">that Iran tested ballistic missiles in March 2016</a>, but these were apparently of a type that cannot deliver nuclear weapons. There is still no proof that Iran is on its way towards nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.aipac.org/">American-Israel Public Affairs Committee</a> (AIPAC) has been lobbying Congress to extend the Sanctions Act, but the chance that Iran might fire a potential nuclear weapon at Israel seems remote. Iran is <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/iran-saudi-arabia-conflict-cold-war-tensions-rise-iranians-warn-saudi-navy-stay-out-2426759">more seriously at odds</a> with Saudi Arabia than it is with Israel.</p>

<p>Another consideration is that the Sanctions Act is written so broadly as to be open to abuse. It was invoked against Mahmoud Reza Banki, an Iranian-American who worked for a management consulting firm in New York. Banki transferred funds from his own family's assets in Iran. He was prosecuted by the US Attorney in New York in 2010 and spent 22 months in federal custody before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15480277678836572804">ruled</a> that family remittances are not covered by the regulations adopted under the Sanctions Act.</p>

<p>The outside powers, the United States included, would be in a stronger posture to pressure Iran if they were complying with their own phase-out obligation under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Of the six outside powers who signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, all but Germany possess nuclear weapons. None of the five shows any sign of scrapping them, even though they are parties to the 1968 treaty. Article 6 requires contracting states "to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament." </p>

<p>The Marshall Islands, a party to the 1968 treaty, tried to raise the Article 6 issue in 2014 in the International Court of Justice by suing the UK, plus Pakistan and India, for failing to negotiate with the other nuclear powers to get rid of their nuclear weapons. The Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands remains uninhabitable because of hydrogen bomb tests conducted there in 1954. The Court never reached the issue, however. It found jurisdictional reasons to <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-court-refuses-to-hear-marshall-islands-case-against-india-over-nuclear-arms.php">dismiss the case</a> and did so a few weeks ago. </p>

<p>Russia has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2016/06/14/russian-hypersonic-glider-weapons-would-easily-penetrate-u-s-defenses-says-expert/#207460c51add">just test-launched</a> a supersonic missile that can deliver nuclear weapons more rapidly than prior delivery systems. The United States <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/us/us-ramping-up-major-renewal-in-nuclear-arms.html">anticipates spending $1 trillion</a> over the next thirty years to upgrade nuclear weapons and delivery systems. With these moves, one should not be surprised if Iran views itself as being singled out for special treatment since it has no nuclear weapons and denies an intent to acquire them. Making the difference in treatment even starker, Israel possesses nuclear weapons but is not party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and does not acknowledge the existence of its nuclear arsenal. Israel has submarines capable of firing its nuclear weapons. No international measures have been taken against Israel like those against Iran. </p>

<p>From Iran's standpoint, the tough stance of the US Congress is seen against the background of interference by the United States, dating from 1953 when the Central Intelligence Agency engineered an overthrow of a democratically elected government in Iran. After the 1979 revolution in Iran, we backed Iraq in waging war against Iran in a decade-long conflict that took the lives of a million Iranians.</p>

<p>The Iran Sanctions Extension Act, to be sure, does not require any sanctions to be imposed presently against Iran. It keeps in place a framework within which the Executive could re-impose sanctions that have been lifted. So it brings no present change in the current posture of the United States. It is not a repudiation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. At the same time, the Iran Sanctions Extension Act is a statute for which there is no present need. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.siena.edu/faculty-and-staff/profile/cutler1">Dr. Leonard Cutler</a> and Shelby Davis</a> of Siena College discuss the failed attempts by President Obama to close the Guantanamo prison</p>

<p>As Barack Obama's presidency comes to a close, the fate of Guantanamo prison remains unclear. Despite achieving measurable success in reducing the number of detainees held there, he has struggled to achieve his goal to permanently shut down the facility because of missed opportunities, faulty decision making, internal administration opposition and ultimately partisan political division that has resulted in an unnecessary presidential legacy.</p>

<p><strong>Obama's First Term Attempt to Close Guantanamo</strong><br />
 <br />
After nearly seven years Guantanamo had become a legal black hole of minimal protections, minimal law, questionable legitimacy, and a negative symbol for the United States reflecting the abandonment of the rule of law and what we stand for as a democratic nation. The images of torture and the orange jumpsuits were the basis for propaganda for terrorist jihadists around the globe.</p>

<p>On his second day in office, President Obama issued <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ClosureOfGuantanamoDetentionFacilities">Executive Order 13492</a> directing that the Guantanamo Bay military prison "shall be closed as soon as practicable, and no later than 1 year from the date of the order." The new administration had to determine the appropriate disposition of the 240 remaining detainees who were held there. The president stressed that the closure would be consistent with national security and foreign policy interests as well as international concerns.</p>

<p>At a major <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-national-security-5-21-09">national security speech</a> given at the National Archives in May 2009, President Obama focused on closing the Guantanamo Bay facility and what to do about the detainees still held there. Relying on his Executive Order, the president stated that some would be tried in federal courts for violations of federal law; a second category would be tried by reconstituted military commissions for violations of the laws of war; a third category had been ordered released by the courts; a fourth category included those who could be safely transferred to other nations; and the fifth category were those who could not be tried in the federal courts or by military commission but were believed too dangerous for release or transfer. This small group would be subject to what the president called prolonged detention accompanied by procedural safeguards and oversight by both the judicial and legislative branches of government.</p>

<p><strong>The Thompson Correctional Center Defeat</strong><br />
 <br />
About five weeks prior to the originally anticipated closing date, President Obama ordered the federal government to acquire an Illinois prison to house certain detainees held at Guantanamo. The <a href="http://doc.wi.gov/families-visitors/find-facility/thompson-correctional-center">Thomson Correctional Center</a>, a near-vacant, super-maximum-security prison was selected by the president and the Department of Defense to house a limited number of prisoners for prolonged detention. The president worked closely with the Governor and Democratic Senators from Illinois, Majority Whip Dick Durbin and Roland Burris, who strongly supported this proposal.</p>

<p>The administration mistakenly expected Congress to approve the requested funding as part of its military spending bill for the 2010 fiscal year, but Democratic leaders who controlled both houses of Congress refused to do so. There was considerable volatility concerning moving detainees to American soil and marginal Democrats, as well as the Republicans &#8212; who were hopeful of picking up congressional seats "&#8212; resisted the administration's request for funding and the transfer of the remaining detainees. </p>

<p>The administration miscalculated the opposition which coalesced among Democrats and Republicans alike in both houses, and from the president's strongest allies in the human rights community. It is also important to remember that 2012 would be the next national election cycle for the president, all members of the House and one-third of the Senate. </p>

<p><strong>Trial by Military Commission and NDAA</strong><br />
 <br />
Since President Obama's second term, and after Republicans seized control of both the Senate and the House, Congress has used its appropriations authority in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which controls all spending and programs for the Department of Defense to: (1) prevent the use of any civil courts to prosecute and try alleged terrorists. The only avenue available to detainees were military commissions; (2) refuse to permit any detainee held at Guantanamo to be transferred to any jurisdiction within the borders of the United States; (3) and to deny President Obama the opportunity to close the Guantanamo Bay prison facility (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/12/31/statement-president-hr-1540">NDAA, section 1027</a>).</p>

<p>Why didn't President Obama veto the NDAA if he was so adamantly opposed to the restrictive language in this Act? In fact, the president did use his veto authority on one occasion. He miscalculated and it backfired on him. He faced heavy attacks that he was holding brave US troops hostage to his pledge to close Guantanamo.</p>

<p>After the election, there developed internal division between the White House and the new Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, and the Pentagon's joint military staff to release and transfer detainees cleared by the military parole board to foreign host nations willing to take them. Hagel jeopardized Obama's goal to shut down Guantanamo, which eventually resulted in Hagel's firing in 2014, but valuable time had been lost in reducing Guantanamo's population.</p>

<p>Under current Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, the process has been expedited and by the fall of 2016 the administration had 60 detainees left from the original 242 prisoners when Barack Obama took office in January 2009. Secretary Carter, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have insisted that current language in the NDAA does not permit the remaining prisoners to be transferred to the United States, and that it's against the law to establish another detention facility on United States soil. The NDAA markup for 2017 retained these restrictions and also prohibited DOD from using any funds to transfer the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay back to Cuba.</p>

<p>President Obama proposed working with Congress to find a secure location in the United States to hold all remaining detainees. Although no specific facility was identified, 13 potential sites on US soil were being considered, including existing facilities in Colorado, South Carolina and Kansas.</p>

<p>Vulnerable Republican incumbents in 2016 weighed in on Guantanamo, including Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin who declared that every remaining detainee was the worst of the worst and should be locked up forever, and Pennsylvania's Patrick Toomey and Ohio's Rob Portman, the other targeted Senators in purple states who vowed to keep Guantanamo open indefinitely. They were all reelected.</p>

<p>President Obama could have, and should have, worked directly with Senator John McCain, Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, to develop a workable plan for permanently closing the prison. McCain was on public record advocating for "seeing the place closed," provided an acceptable approach was agreed to.</p>

<p><strong>2016 Presidential Candidate Donald Trump on Guantanamo</strong> </p>

<p>In the presidential campaign of 2016, Candidate Donald Trump expressed his views on the future of Guantanamo Bay:</p>

<blockquote>This morning I watched President Obama talking about Gitmo, right? Guantanamo Bay which by the way we are keeping open. And we're going to load it up with some bad dudes. Believe me; we're going to load it up. But here's the thing I didn't understand. I heard this but I didn't understand it. We spend 40 million dollars a month on maintaining this place. Now think of it; 40 million dollars a month. What do we have left in there a hundred people or something? So we're spending 40 million dollars. I would guarantee you that I could do it for a tiny fraction, I don't mean like 39 I mean like maybe 5, maybe 3, maybe like peanuts. Maybe in our deal with Cuba we'll get them to take it over and reimburse us because we're probably paying rent.</blockquote>

<p>Trump wished to keep Guantanamo Bay open, and he was explicit regarding resumption of enhanced interrogation techniques, including waterboarding. At a presidential rally, he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/23/donald-trump-on-waterboarding-if-it-doesnt-work-they-deserve-it-anyway/">claimed</a>, "Would I approve waterboarding? You bet your ass I would in a heartbeat....And I would approve more than that. Don't kid yourself, folks. It works, okay? It works. Only a stupid person would say it doesn't work...believe me, it works. And you know what? If it doesn't work, they deserve it anyway, for what they're doing. It works."</p>

<p><strong>A Wasted Opportunity</strong><br />
 <br />
To further exacerbate matters for President Obama was opposition from his Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, on a White House-sponsored proposal to allow Guantanamo prisoners to plead guilty to terrorism charges in federal court by videoconference. Lynch maintained that criminal procedure laws entitle defendants to plead guilty or face a trial by jury. In the case of the Guantanamo detainees, their only option is to plead guilty or remain in indefinite detention. Even if Congress were to support such a law, the federal courts might rule that such plans were in reality "involuntary," and detainees would not have the option of standing trial in a US courtroom. </p>

<p>The Obama proposal would permit the terrorism suspects to serve their sentences in a third country prison, without ever setting foot on US soil, which would circumvent the existing congressional ban on transferring detainees to the United States and would reduce the remaining number to 10 to 20 maximum. There appeared to be broad based backing from the Departments of Defense and State for this approach.</p>

<p>Despite objections from the Attorney General, administration officials spent two months in the spring of 2016 drafting the new law. It was sent to all involved agencies for final review before it was formally submitted to Congress. Lynch intervened directly with the president to oppose the bill and despite his support for the approach, Obama decided not to overrule his Attorney General. The bill was scrapped.</p>

<p>One final option surfaced for President Obama when a supportive member of Congress inserted language in the 2017 NDAA markup that allows detainees to plead guilty to criminal charges in Article III courts via teleconference and authorizes the government to transfer such detainees to third countries to serve out their sentences.</p>

<p>The White House prepared a Statement of Administrative Policy (SAP) supporting the proposal, which is then considered by House/Senate Conference members and the congressional leadership as the administration's public position on the bill. Lynch intervened again and Obama once again capitulated to his Attorney General and declined to approve the issuance of the SAP despite his support for this initiative.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>

<p>For the past eight years of his presidency, Barack Obama has struggled to come up with a cohesive and acceptable plan that addresses the concerns of Congress, and the American people in permanently shutting down Guantanamo Prison. The politics of Guantanamo are tough because the American public is worried about terrorism and having terrorists held in the United States rather than somewhere outside of our country can be scary. Granted, the president's options were limited, but the fact remains he failed to act decisively even when they were available to him. Early in his first term, he could have issued a military order as commander-in-chief to close the facility, but it appears that he was more concerned about an inevitable court challenge from his opponents that may have labored on for most of his presidency.</p>

<p>He could have worked more effectively with congressional allies from both parties as well as human rights groups to forge a viable coalition in developing a workable acceptable closure plan. President Obama could have, and should have exercised his executive leadership in overruling dissenting cabinet officials who effectively disrupted his detainee policies, but he failed to do so.</p>

<p>Finally, President Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/23/remarks-president-plan-close-prison-guantanamo-bay">mistakenly believed</a> that he had the political capital to shut down Guantanamo in the last year of his presidency because Guantanamo could rise above politics. As he said ... "I don't want to pass this problem on to the next president, whoever it is." The sad reality is that is exactly what he has accomplished.</p>

<p>It will be up to our next president, Donald Trump, and Congress to repair our reputation as a nation committed to the rule of law, and to reestablish the moral authority necessary to restore the United States as a world leader in upholding human rights. That will require bold action &#8212; including finally closing Guantanamo permanently and demonstrating in deed, that we practice what we preach. It is highly improbable that a Trump administration will move in this direction.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.syr.edu/profile/david-crane1">David M. Crane</a> of Syracuse University College of Law discusses the need for the <correction num=1>International Criminal Court</correction> to utilize politics to ensure its future...</p><strong>S</strong>everal years ago, I gave a speech where I stated that prosecutor who does not consider politics and diplomacy in their prosecutorial decision-making is naive. I still stand by those remarks. The basis for the statement was to shift the focus not on the process of prosecution at the international level, but on the victims themselves. I repeatedly told my staff in the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/otp">Office of the Prosecutor</a> at the <a href="http://www.rscsl.org/">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> that all that we are doing is for and about the victims of the ten-year horror that was the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14094419">civil war in West Africa</a>.</p>

<p>When one shifts this focus to the victims it becomes clear that there are several factors that come into play for an international prosecutor as they consider a prosecution plan to account for an atrocity and to do whatever they can to seek that justice. These factors include the law to be sure, but also politics, diplomacy, custom and practical implications of a possible series of indictments. Within ethical bound of the law, an international prosecutor seeks a just result, free of bias and favor.  </p>

<p>International tribunals are creatures of politics. Created from a geopolitical event and products of political compromise, tribunals have political DNA baked into their systems. The bright red thread of international criminal law is politics. Leave out the political dimension in a prosecution strategy and a tribunal may have challenges that could harm the process of accountability for the victims of an atrocity.</p>

<p>Throughout my time in West Africa I took in all of the above factors and focused on politics. Now it is important to understand that this is politics with a small "p." Most creative statutes for international courts and tribunals have a provision which clearly says that the <a href="http://www.rscsl.org/Documents/scsl-statute.pdf">prosecutor cannot seek favor</a> [PDF] or be influenced by outside entities in their decisions on who to investigate and prosecute. That is not what we are talking about here. We are talking about engaging politicians and diplomats in an ongoing dialog on what is best for a country, a region and even internationally. Listening to a politician or diplomat's views on the political situation in the region, seeking their perspectives on what happened to that region shows to the politicians and diplomats that any prosecution plan is deliberative, careful, balanced taking in the political, diplomatic, cultural, practical and legal ramifications of a prosecution plan. Showing local, regional, and international politicians and diplomats a little respect goes a long way in seeking justice for victims of atrocity.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC), the world's permanent court set up to prosecute the most egregious, must always take into consideration the factors discussed above&#8212particularly politics. This important court exists in a political world driven by political considerations. Nation-states always consider the political ramifications of their international and national security decisions. When an outside entity threatens that security, a nation-state will react to protect its interests using whatever means necessary, hopefully within the law.</p>

<p><a href="/paperchase/2016/11/russia-announces-intentions-to-leave-icc.php">Recent decisions by state-party</a>  to the<a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf"> Rome Statute</a> [PDF] to <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/south-africa-announces-intent-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">withdraw from the treaty</a> and the paradigm of accountability for victims of atrocity reflects some earlier decisions made by the ICC that have festered into open defiance. This is not healthy for the evolution of the rule of law internationally and justice for victims specifically.</p>

<p>The ICC is an institution worth saving.  Its supporters must do all that they can to ensure its viability to including its political viability.  The current and former Chief Prosecutors are talented and capable colleagues and friends. They are certainly not naïve. The recent initiative by the current Chief Prosecutor, <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/otp/who-s-who/pages/fatou-bensouda.aspx">Fatou Bensouda</a> in issuing her <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/20160915_OTP-Policy_Case-Selection_Eng.pdf">Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization</a> [PDF] this autumn is a step in the right direction. </p>

<p>However, as a long-term supporter of the ICC and for justice for victims, it must be pointed out that the court has not done a good job in factoring the political ramifications of its prosecutorial decisions. The <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/icc-should-drop-cases-against-al-bashir-ruto-african-leaders.php">Sudan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icc-drops-charges-against-kenyan-president.php">Kenya</a> indictments are outstanding examples as well as a decision to investigate alleged <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/international-criminal-court-says-us-may-have-committed-war-crimes-in-afghanistan.php">war crimes violations in Afghanistan</a> perpetrated by US armed forces just as a new, and more likely less supportive, administration comes into power. One cannot imagine the new <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/">Trump administration</a> will take this lightly or lying down. The ICC should not get into a situation where the new president takes this Afghanistan inquiry personally.</p>

<p>It is apparent that the Office of the Prosecutor is aware of these points. I believe that there is a renewed understanding of the important role politics plays in seeking justice for victims. As a friend of the court I want them to succeed. I urge the court to factor in politics in their policies and plans. If not, then we may see a further deterioration of the ICC's stature in the world and further withdrawals, possibly a fatal blow to mankind's only permanent ability to seek justice for the victims of atrocity. I am hopeful.</p>

City of Bloomfield</span> illustrates inherent flaws in the <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman</em> Establishment Clause test ... </p>

                <p><strong>T</strong>he late Justice Antonin Scalia once described the infamous <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6993086659963510613"><span class="casename">Lemon v. Kurtzman</span></a> test for analyzing Establishment Clause matters as a &#8220;ghoul&#8221; from a &#8220;late-night horror movie&#8221; that simply will not die. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7370759114492488618"><span class="casename">Felix v. City of Bloomfield</span></a>, the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit&#8217;s most recent <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/11/10th.php">application</a> of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">Establishment Clause,</a> shows that the monster is alive and well. <span class="casename">Felix</span> is, moreover, a study in the arbitrary and subjective analysis mandated by <span class="casename">Lemon</span> that has haunted Establishment Clause jurisprudence for decades.   </p>

                <p>The matter began during an April 2007 Bloomfield, New Mexico, city council meeting. City councilman Kevin Mauzy proposed the City allow him to erect privately funded monuments on the city hall lawn. He described a display comprised of a &#8220;series&#8221; of monuments such as the Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution, the Code of Hammurabi, and the Magna Carta. It was Mauzy&#8217;s understanding that the &#8220;nation was founded on the principles&#8221; outlined in the Ten Commandments, and he sought and was granted approval to erect a monument honoring the Decalogue. He considered it the &#8220;start of a series.&#8221;</p>

                <p>Shortly thereafter, the City passed a resolution that formalized its policy for permanent monuments on the city hall lawn, requiring that they be granite or marble and &#8220;relate to the history and heritage of the City&#8217;s law and government.&#8221; The resolution also opened a &#8220;limited public forum&#8221; for display of permanent monuments on the city hall lawn but required any monument displayed to include a disclaimer that its message was not that of the City.  </p>

                <p>The initial fundraising efforts fell short. When Mauzy left office in 2008 he had abandoned the project. Two years later, however, Mauzy revived the effort. This time, his fundraising efforts were successful. Mauzy met with the city manager in June 2011 to decide on a location for the Ten Commandments monument. A front corner of the city hall lawn was chosen, which Mauzy believed would &#8220;allow room for the construction of additional monuments&#8221; on the lawn.  </p>

                <p>The monument was erected that July &#8212; along with a free-standing sign that described the public forum and disclaimed city endorsement of the monument&#8217;s message, in addition to the disclaimer inscribed on the monument itself &#8212; and then dedicated in a privately sponsored event on the Fourth of July. The dedication included an invocation, the singing of the national anthem, recital of the pledge of allegiance, and a traditional patriotic flag folding ceremony performed by the local VFW. That ceremony contained some traditional religious references, and Mauzy provided comments on limited government and the role of &#8220;God and his Ten Commandments&#8221; in the nation&#8217;s history and heritage. The monument &#8212; 60 inches tall, 30 inches wide, weighing over 3,400 pounds, and inscribed with Ten Commandments text from the King James Bible &#8212; was the second display on the city hall lawn, the first being a tree memorializing a past mayor of the City.</p>

                <p>That same year the City approved and Mauzy erected the next in the series of monuments &#8212; a three part monument to the Declaration of Independence, which was dedicated on Veterans Day.  Shortly afterward plaintiffs-appellees, two Wiccans represented by the ACLU, filed suit against the City, alleging the Ten Commandments monument violated the Establishment Clause. But the erection of monuments continued. In 2012 or 2013, the City approved and Mauzy erected a monument depicting the Gettysburg Address, which was dedicated on the Fourth of July. Similarly, in 2014, the City approved and Mauzy erected a monument to the Bill of Rights, which was also dedicated on the Fourth of July. The Ten Commandments monument was &#8220;neither the most nor least prominent monument on the lawn.&#8221;</p>

                <p>The district court, with analysis substantially similar to that of the Tenth Circuit, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14892390736088209371">found</a> the Ten Commandments monument unlawfully endorsed religion. The City appealed.  </p>

                <p>Applying <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17552801861738108362"><span class="casename">Pleasant Grove City v. Summum</span></a>, the Tenth Circuit rightly concluded that the monuments on the city hall lawn were government speech, not private speech as the City intended. Thereafter, applying <span class="casename">Lemon</span>, as modified by Justice O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s &#8220;endorsement test&#8221; from <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13271488269297440249"><span class="casename">Lynch v. Donnelly</span></a>, the Tenth Circuit found the Ten Commandments monument &#8220;impermissibly gave the impression to reasonable observers that the City was endorsing religion.&#8221; The primary justifications provided for this conclusion were unconvincing.  Those highlighted below illustrate the damage Lemon has inflicted on the Establishment Clause and its unsustainability as a vehicle for the objective rule of law.</p>

                <p>With no supporting precedent, the Tenth Circuit first concluded that the religious &#8220;language&#8221; of the Ten Commandments inscribed on the monument &#8220;unquestionably&#8221; excluded the beliefs of &#8220;nonadherents&#8221; and thereby unlawfully endorsed religion. This contradicted US Supreme Court precedent directly on point. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9237822200321146840"><span class="casename">Van Orden v. Perry</span></a>, the Supreme Court upheld the display of a similar Ten Commandments monument on the Texas state Capitol grounds.  Citing decades of Establishment Clause jurisprudence, the court found that &#8220;[s]imply having religious content or promoting a message consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of the Establishment Clause.&#8221; The court observed &#8220;[s]uch acknowledgments of the role played by the Ten Commandments in our Nation's heritage are common throughout America&#8221; and that the &#8220;historical role&#8221; of the Decalogue in the nation&#8217;s history has been recognized by the executive, legislative and judicial branches of our government. Notwithstanding <span class="casename">Van Orden</span>, the Tenth Circuit, applying <span class="casename">Lemon</span>, effectively created a <em>per se</em> rule that the very text of the Ten Commandments is an Establishment Clause violation.  </p>

                <p>With this rule as a springboard, the Tenth Circuit next found the monument&#8217;s location resulted in unlawful endorsement. Specifically, the monument was &#8220;not hidden or obscured&#8221; but &#8220;clearly visible to any onlooker&#8221; standing at the right place in front of city hall. According to the Tenth Circuit, this unobscured presence of the monument would cause the endorsement test&#8217;s &#8220;objective observer&#8221; to &#8220;associate the Monument with the government,&#8221; which association was, according to the Tenth Circuit, unlawful religious endorsement. Such reasoning is difficult to square with <span class="casename">Van Orden</span> and other Supreme Court guidance to the contrary, such as the court&#8217;s acknowledgment in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2708202356121821143"><span class="casename">School Dist. Of Abington Township v. Schempp</span></a> that &#8220;religion has been closely identified with our history and government,&#8221; and its recognition in <span class="casename">Lynch</span> of the &#8220;unbroken history of official acknowledgment by all three branches of government of the role of religion in American life.&#8221; If opening sessions of governmental bodies with sectarian religious prayer comports with the Establishment Clause, as the Supreme Court recently held in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3753205298956949348"><span class="casename">Town of Greece v. Galloway</span></a>, it is hard to imagine that same Clause excludes the Ten Commandments from a history of law and government display. </p>

                <p>The Tenth Circuit also took issue with the monument&#8217;s Fourth of July dedication ceremony, specifically the invocation, the VFW&#8217;s flag folding ceremony, and Mauzy&#8217;s comments. By the Tenth Circuit&#8217;s reasoning, the private statements and actions of private actors and donors during a private dedication ceremony for what was intended as a private display, all devoid of City involvement or ratification, helped &#8220;dispel any remaining doubt&#8221; of the City&#8217;s unlawful religious endorsement. Unsurprisingly, Supreme Court precedent holds otherwise. In <span class="casename">Summum</span>, which involved a similar Ten Commandments monument, the Supreme Court <em>unanimously</em> held that by accepting a donated monument &#8220;a government entity does not necessarily endorse the specific meaning that any particular donor sees in the monument.&#8221; As the Supreme Court explained, &#8220;it frequently is not possible to identify a single &#8216;message&#8217; that is conveyed by an object or structure, and consequently, the thoughts or sentiments expressed by a government entity that accepts and displays such an object may be quite different from those of either its creator or its donor.&#8221; Under <span class="casename">Lemon</span>, however, the Tenth Circuit reached a contrary conclusion.</p>

                <p>Finally, the Tenth Circuit found that the short time-frame between the monument&#8217;s erection and the lawsuit further demonstrated the monument&#8217;s religious endorsement. It relied on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16464699282179742753"><span class="casename">Green v. Haskell County</span></a>, in which the Tenth Circuit, applying <span class="casename">Lemon</span>, ruled against another Ten Commandments monument in part due to the &#8220;prompt litigation response&#8221; to that display. It also relied on Justice Breyer&#8217;s concurrence in <span class="casename">Van Orden</span>, specifically Justice Breyer&#8217;s partial reliance on the &#8220;years of tranquility&#8221; enjoyed by the Van Orden monument to demonstrate a lack of perceived religious endorsement. Justice Breyer did not, however, establish or even mention the converse, i.e., that a presence of litigation soon after a monument&#8217;s erection implicates endorsement.</p>

                <p>This was nothing more than the Tenth Circuit applying a heckler&#8217;s veto, another <em>per se</em> rule empowered by <span class="casename">Lemon</span> specially designed for Ten Commandments monuments: a new Ten Commandments monument is unlawful, or is at least highly suspect, if it is subject to a lawsuit soon after its erection. Again the Supreme Court has provided guidance to the contrary, explaining in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12316340622851975330"><span class="casename">Good News Club v. Milford Central School</span></a> that a heckler&#8217;s veto has no place in an Establishment Clause context.</p>

                <p>In sum, by applying <span class="casename">Lemon</span>, the Tenth Circuit implemented a <em>per se</em> rule against the language of the Ten Commandments and against the clear, unobscured display of the Ten Commandments in front of a government building; attributed to the government the unsponsored, unratified statements and actions of private parties; and applied a heckler&#8217;s veto against Ten Commandments monuments targeted by litigation soon after erection. By any measure this falls short of the objective rule of law.  	 </p>

                <p><span class="casename">Lemon</span> is unsustainable. Each application of <span class="casename">Lemon&#8217;s</span> framework is a cry to the Supreme Court to replace it with a bright line rule for Establishment Clause matters. <span class="casename">Felix</span> adds another voice to the chorus.   </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Fuad Rafidi of <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University School of Law</a>, Class of 2018, discusses safe spaces on college campuses...</j:header><br />
<strong>D</strong>o safe places belong on college campuses? On November 22, 2016, Yue Zhang wrote a critical piece about colleges not having safe spaces. Yue personally believes safe spaces only spoils kids and makes them more <a href="http://college.usatoday.com/2016/11/22/viewpoint-point-counterpoint-do-safe-spaces-belong-on-college-campuses/">fragile</a>. Although there might be some basis on Yue's conclusion, that is not the purpose of safe spaces. The purpose of safe spaces is to protect college students and listeners from sensitive topics like sexual assault. Colleges should have an area where students can get away if they need to. The best example is when a college brings a speaker about <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/3/26/staff-better-safe-spaces/">sexual assault</a>. In March 2015, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/opinion/sunday/judith-shulevitz-hiding-from-scary-ideas.html?_r=1">Brown University</a> in Rhode Island brought speakers to speak about sexual assault. The safe spaces initial purpose was to protect students or listeners from being traumatized of past memories. This is a laudable purpose and an important reason to force universities to have safe spaces. These types of topics affect the students and leaves them at a disadvantage because past memories impact on how well these students perform in school. Also, topics like sexual assault place students at risk of mental disorders like depression. It is important to protect the universities' free speech, but it is also important to protect the students' health and safety. </p>

<p>In August 2016, Rae Pickett wrote an article about how all universities should protect the students' right to feel safe. That article was based on the University of Chicago and the decision to <a href="http://time.com/4471806/trigger-warnings-safe-spaces/">eliminate safe spaces</a> from the college campus. This decision was based on the theory that <a href="http://time.com/4466021/uchicago-trigger-warnings/">students can leave</a> on their own freedom. However, maybe there are students who want to listen to a topic, but the topic takes a mental toll on the students. If safe spaces are eliminated from the college campus, that mental toll on the students would discourage the students from attending similar topics in the future. According to Clemson University's 2013 "<a href="http://womensenews.org/2015/10/multiracial-girls-open-up-about-getting-bullied/">Status of Bullying in School</a>" report, 160,000 children are bullied every day and 31 percent are multiracial. When an African American compares themselves to white peers, self-esteem levels drop. Thus, safe spaces would help empower students or any listener to speak up on the topic in the future. Self-esteem is important when attending university held speakers because confidence helps build arguments and knowledge on a particular topic. Safe spaces would help build that self-esteem.</p>

<p>According to Clifford Maloney Jr., colleges are attacked by a plethora of free speech restrictions. For example, men at the University of Delaware were halted by campus police for their activities of rolling an <a href="http://time.com/4530197/college-free-speech-zone/">inflated free speech ball</a> around campus. Furthermore, a Young Americans for Liberty leader at Fairmont State University in West Virginia was confronted by security when he attempted to speak with other students about the ideas he believes in. </p>

<p>Yes, freedom of speech is a right that is protected by our Constitution. The freedom of speech clause states that Congress shall not abridge the freedom of speech. The freedom of speech is a fundamental right that is critical to our society. It is critical because it is our society's way of giving different viewpoints in our political, social, educational and community status. According to Maloney, debates are discussions between people which they express different viewpoints. Yes, this is the very fundamental right our Constitution is designed to protect. College campuses should be more open to allow speakers to speak their minds. The Supreme Court has already limited what types of speech is not protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution. This type of speech involves: fighting words, obscene or criminal solicitation. As long as the speech used in the event is protected speech, Maloney argues that students should be allowed to participate in an open free market of ideas. </p>

<p>We must be open to topics, but not all topics are meant to be heard in a public setting. Freedom of speech is limited to a reasonable time, place and manner. The manner must not promote threats amongst each other to encourage violence. Also, the manner is not to discourage another person from giving a different perspective on a particular topic. Even in class discussions about a particular topic, these topics may take a mental toll on students. Universities should help promote the health and safety of the students because a healthy and safe student helps promote confidence and encourages that student to give different perspective to topics. College campuses are not forums meant to incite war amongst its students, it is a forum meant to educate. Rolling an inflated free speech ball around college would be something that students should be allowed to do. In fact, it is a new, creative way to promoting free speech no one else would have thought about. However, that does not mean a college should not provide safe spaces because these safe spaces would help empower students to speak up by providing them space and time until these students are ready to give their opinion and educate themselves on a topic. </p>

<p>The truth is, freedom of speech has two sides and whichever side you fall on, you may need a place to get away. Colleges should not ban students from expressing themselves, but colleges should have an area where students can get away if they need to. The best example is when a college brings a speaker about sexual assault or bullying. Now, invoking safety as an excuse to ban opposing perspectives is counterproductive. However, sexual assault is an offense that women are sensitive to. Students on college campuses all have different backgrounds and experiences. Just because one student has a right to hear and learn from a view, such as sexual assault, does not mean no student needs to seek a place of safety. This is the whole purpose of safe places. Safe spaces are supposed to be places where students seek care.</p>

<p>Safe places are useful, but not all students are entitled to have safe spaces. Students may be taking advantage of safe spaces, but as the University of Chicago had mentioned, students have the right to get away from the topic and be free from uninvited ideas. However, this does not mean campuses should not provide safe spaces. Instead, campuses should be encouraged to have them because safe spaces help vulnerable students and empowers them to speak up on particular topics and protects their health and safety from any mental tolls. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/faculty/directory/kirchmeier.html">Jeffrey L. Kirchmeier</a> of CUNY School of Law discusses the death penalty and the 2016 election...</p><strong>C</strong>ommentators will be debating the causes and impact of the outcome of the November 8, 2016 US presidential election for a long time. But other ballot issues also revealed, to some extent, the mood of the country.</p>

<p><a href="/paperchase/2016/11/voters-in-three-states-reaffirm-death-penalty.php">Several state elections</a> featured issues related to criminal justice reform. While there were <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/election-night-saw-victories-in-local-criminal-justice-reform-this-should-be-the-beginning/">some successes</a> for advocates of reform, including more states legalizing marijuana, one area where voters seemingly rejected progressive reform was on capital punishment. In three states, a majority of voters embraced the death penalty.</p>

<p>One may wonder whether these death penalty votes constituted a watershed moment for the US death penalty. In recent years, the death penalty has been in decline across the country for various reasons, with several states abolishing the death penalty and the number of executions decreasing. In determining whether or not this election marked a turning point for the decline of the death penalty, it is important to consider our most recent election in historical context.</p>

<p><strong>The Death Penalty on the Ballot</strong></p>

<p>In the 2016 election, California voters rejected <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_62,_Repeal_of_the_Death_Penalty_(2016)">Proposition 62</a>, which would have replaced the state's death penalty with life without the possibility of parole as the maximum punishment for murder. Voters chose to retain the death penalty by a vote of <a href="http://elections.kqed.org/results/Propositions">53.6% to 46.4%</a>. In 2012, a <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_34,_the_End_the_Death_Penalty_Initiative_(2012)">similar measure</a> failed by a narrower margin of 52-48%.  </p>

<p>In the 2016, election, though, California voters not only rejected the proposition to eliminate the death penalty, they also voted for another proposition promoted as streamlining and speeding up the death penalty process, Proposition 66.  This proposition passed by an even narrower margin with only 51.3% of the vote.</p>

<p>Proposition 66 will set a time frame for review of death penalty cases and also require appointed attorneys to work on death penalty cases. The proposition's <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/09/501469561/california-voters-decide-to-uphold-death-penalty-streamline-the-process">critics</a>, however, argue that a law that limits review and the ability to present new evidence likely will result in more errors, more wrongful convictions and more <a href="http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/lnews/2016-11-12/death-penalty-battle-wont-die-fight-over-proposition-66-likely-to-continue-after-election/1776425171274.html">legal challenges</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike the California voters, voters in Nebraska not only chose to keep the death penalty, they rejected a vote by the Nebraska Legislature to abolish the death penalty. In 2015, legislators voted to abolish the state's death penalty.  Following a veto by Republican Governor Pete Ricketts, Nebraska's unicameral legislature voted 30-19 to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/05/27/410074600/nebraska-legislators-overturn-governors-veto-of-death-penalty-repeal">override the veto</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, Nebraska was on the cusp of joining several states that have abolished the death penalty since 2004. But Governor Ricketts did not give up, <a href="http://theconversation.com/fearmongering-in-nebraska-how-the-death-penalty-lobby-fights-progress-43021">helping launch a campaign</a> for a statewide referendum on the death penalty. It was the resulting referendum that won on November 9, 2016, as Nebraskans voted by a 66-34% margin to keep capital punishment in the state. </p>

<p>The vote appeared to be a strong embrace of the death penalty, perhaps partly symbolic. Nebraska has <a href="http://theconversation.com/fearmongering-in-nebraska-how-the-death-penalty-lobby-fights-progress-43021">only executed three people</a> since the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/2015--vol--41-/vol--41--no--1---lurking-in-the-shadows--the-supreme-court-s-qui/the-supreme-courts-legacy-on-race-and-capital-punishment-in-mccl.html">upheld new death penalty laws</a> in 1976 and only <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/nebraska-death-row-who-are-10-inmates-affected-repeal-n365681">ten men</a> sit on Nebraska's death row. The last execution in the state was nearly two decades ago in 1997.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Oklahoma, voters in the November 2016 election overwhelmingly chose to add language to the state's constitution stating, among other things, that "[a] sentence of death shall not be reduced on the basis that a method of execution is invalid." One of the concerns that prompted advocates of Oklahoma State Question 776 was a number of problems that the state has encountered with lethal injection. </p>

<p>For example, in 2014 a <a href="http://time.com/82787/oklahoma-botched-execution-clayton-lockett-lethal-injection-problems/?iid=sr-link1">botched execution</a> led to a temporary moratorium on executions in the state. <a href="http://time.com/4067071/oklahoma-lethal-injection-wrong-drug-charles-warner/">Lethal injection errors </a>during scheduled executions in 2015 led the state to plan to use nitrogen gas for future executions. The new language in the state constitution will not solve the <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/04/12/how-the-drug-shortage-has-slowed-the-death-penalty-treadmill#.Ybd0sE6Z4">problems</a> that Oklahoma and many other states have faced with execution methods. And the new proposition may lead to other legal challenges. But the vote did show that a majority of the state's citizens wanted to keep trying.</p>

<p><strong>Impact and Meaning</strong></p>

<p>Although the November 2016 election may eventually lead to more executions, the immediate impact will not be a significant rise in the use of capital punishment. Oklahoma was not considering abolishing the death penalty and Nebraska and California rarely use capital punishment, with <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/01/17/ten-years-after-last-execution-californias-death-row-continues-to-grow/">California's last execution</a> in 2006. Donald Trump's election may affect the death penalty in a number of ways, including the likelihood that he will appoint US attorneys who will more actively seek the federal death penalty than the attorneys did under President Obama.</p>

<p>Yet, considering the death penalty in its historical context, the 2016 election does not appear to be a turning point for capital punishment in the United States. As I explained in my book on the history of the death penalty, <em><a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199967933.001.0001/acprof-9780199967933">Imprisoned by the Past</a></em>, there have been several <a href="http://blog.oup.com/2015/07/history-capital-punishment-abolition/">periods of death penalty abolition</a> in US history, including 1846-1853, 1907-1917, 1957-1965 and the current period starting around 2004. By contrast, there also have been periods where states reinstated capital punishment, including roughly around 1916-1920 and 1972-1979.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the fact that death penalty reinstatement periods often follow abolition periods, one might surmise that the 2016 election marks such a turning point or a "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/opinions/comeback-for-death-penalty-opinion-sarat/">comeback for the death penalty</a>." Yet, although the results in the three states &#8212; and the election of death penalty advocate Donald Trump as president &#8212; may lead one to conclude that the death penalty is on the rise in the United States, the truth is more complicated when considered in context. For example, the governor of Washington and the governor of Oregon, who both have enforced moratoriums on executions, each won reelection. </p>

<p>Similarly, voters seemed less eager about the death penalty in some significant district attorney races. For example, Andrew Warren won against the incumbent district attorney in Hillsborough County, Florida as he <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/election-jail-sentences-district-attorneys-2016-11">promised to curtail the use of the death penalty</a>. Voters in Jefferson County, Alabama <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21710267-death-penalty-going-not-quite-gone-yet-death-has-less-dominion">voted against an incumbent</a> who often sought the death penalty, instead opting for Charles Todd Henderson, who is personally opposed to capital punishment.</p>

<p>More significantly, in the November 2016 election, only one state, Nebraska, voted to overturn a legislative decision to abolish the death penalty. Yet, the fact that Nebraska and California were even considering abolishing capital punishment is more likely a part of the current abolition trend rather than a new trend. Historical abolition trends do not occur when every state abolishes the death penalty. The abolition of the death penalty is a slow process taking place one state at a time. </p>

<p>Nebraska is generally considered to be a conservative state that one might not expect to be a leader in abolishing the death penalty. Yet, <a href="http://conservativesconcerned.org/">conservatives are increasingly becoming concerned</a> with the problems with capital punishment and Nebraska's legislature voted overwhelmingly to abolish the death penalty. A number of Nebraska voters did too. California is often seen as progressive, but it is a large state with a diverse pool of voters. Yet, it still came within four percentage points in recent years of abolishing the death penalty.</p>

<p>So, while the three votes in favor of capital punishment could be seen by some as part of a turning point regarding the death penalty, the election itself is not a strong enough indicator of a change in attitudes about the death penalty. The current abolition period is significantly different from past abolition periods. Because of the difference, the current period may be more lasting than past periods. </p>

<p>There are a number of reasons the current period is different from past short-lived periods. For example, there are <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-death-penalty">more states</a> today without the death penalty than in any other time in US history. Considering that the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3049409100319525353">Delaware Supreme Court recently held that state's death penalty unconstitutional</a>, there are nineteen states and the District of Columbia without the death penalty. Four other states have moratoria on executions. Since 2004, seven states have stopped using the death penalty by either legislative or judicial action. The areas of the country that do use the death penalty are mostly <a href="http://nyti.ms/2bAtAsC">limited to a relatively small number of counties</a> in the US, while the <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions-year">number of executions</a> in 2016 will be the lowest since 1992.</p>

<p>One difference between the current abolition period and the periods of the past is that through resources like the Internet, citizens today have much more access to information about capital punishment's failings, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/05/01/considering-the-death-penalty-your-tax-dollars-at-work/#57696e4317f0">financial costs</a>, unfairness and other problems. DNA evidence and studies continue to reveal <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/causes-wrongful-convictions">wrongful convictions</a> and <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/death-penalty/us-death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-and-race">racial disparities</a> in capital sentencing. Although a majority of voters in Nebraska, California and Oklahoma did not believe the death penalty should be abolished, nationwide <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/09/30/states-arent-using-the-death-penalty-as-much-now-americans-are-abandoning-it-too/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.ea340aa4376d">support for the death penalty continues to drop</a>.</p>

<p>Education contributed to the abolition of the death penalty in the last decade in states such as New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Illinois, Connecticut, and Maryland. Those states show a more significant trend than the November 2016 election does. Progressive causes do not advance in a straight line, and the November 2016 death penalty ballot issues most likely will be seen by historians as a digression on the road toward abolition of the death penalty instead of a historical crossroads. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Virginia Brown Keyder, the State University of New York at Binghamton, discusses IP laws in the US and EU... </p><strong>I</strong>f any legal concepts may be said to characterize our age, intellectual property (IP) and secrecy would be likely candidates.  In theory, these are polar opposites&#8212;representing disclosure (for the benefit of the public) and non-disclosure (primarily for the benefit of private interests, but often labeled 'national security'), respectively. Secrecy peppers the legal and political universe with state secrets, secret jurisdictions (see Panama papers or consider Guantanamo), <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/publication/new-era-secret-law">secret laws </a>and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/opinion/the-governments-addiction-to-secret-law.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region">secret interpretations</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/28/eu-secret-ultimatum-afghanistan-accept-80000-deportees-lose-aid-brussels-summit-migration-sensitive">secret ultimatums</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/uk-security-agencies-unlawfully-collected-data-for-decade">secret surveillance</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/opinion/the-governments-addiction-to-secret-law.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region">secret trade agreements</a>, secret negotiating strategies and even a significant upswing in secret <a href="https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2016/10/invention-secrecy-2016/">patents</a>. IP has always been predicated on full disclosure of inventions and creations in exchange for limited-time legally enforceable monopolies, with the view that once the monopolies expire, the content will fall into the public domain to enrich society. </p>

<p>In 2016 IP and secrecy in both the US and the EU moved considerably closer through new trade secret legislation. From its pre-life, which in the public mind centered around the formula for Coca Cola, trade secrets have burgeoned into a less costly and potentially longer term form of protection of inventions than patents, to include employee non-compete clauses, scientific data (both valuable and damaging to its owners), and the stuff that whistleblowers everywhere thrive on. </p>

<p>As discussed elsewhere in this volume, the new US legislation in the form of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1836">Defend Trade Secrets Act</a> (DTSA) amends the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-90">1996 Industrial Espionage Act</a>, which made theft of trade secrets a felony, by creating a Federal civil cause of action reflecting what has heretofore been state law embodied in the <em>Uniform Trade Secrets Act</em> (UTSA)adopted by 48 states. Although in effect for only a few months, the DTSA has unsurprisingly already given rise to <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/candce/5:2016cv03260/299750">litigation</a>. Although trade secrets have constituted the poor relative of the US IP legal family until now, the DTSA brings welcome relief to US corporate players reeling under the weight of patent thickets, the threat of patent trolls and the rising costs of prosecuting and protecting a wide array of inventions, information and other miscellany yet to be determined. <br />
 <br />
The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L0943&from=EN">EU Directive</a> on the other hand sets out basic harmonizing legislative goals and gives EU Member States until June 9, 2018 to implement those goals in domestic legislation. For readers unfamiliar with the structure of EU law, this basically means that the core provisions of the Directive will be inserted into national law in keeping with the Member States' existing legal structures. Once enacted these provisions will then become subject to general principles of EU law, including fundamental rights as set out in the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights, proportionality, protection against abuse of process, free movement of goods, services, capital and people and legal certainty. Provisions of national law enacted pursuant to the Directive are also subject to the interpretation of the European Court of Justice. </p>

<p>At present, laws of the EU member states vary widely on the subject of trade secrets, with only <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=129537">Sweden</a> having a specific Act on the Protection of Trade Secrets. Other Member States situate and define trade secrets in a variety of categories from Common Law confidentiality in the UK, to unfair competition and provisions of Civil and Commercial Codes in other <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/docs/trade-secrets/130711_final-study_en.pdf">Member States</a> [PDF].</p>

<p>While this Directive harmonizes trade secret law across the Member States (one is at a loss to figure out why this didn't come up before, ostensibly such a barrier to e.g. free movement people as various and sundry non-compete clauses are), it also responds to significant lobbying efforts by <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/power-lobbies/2015/04/towards-legalised-corporate-secrecy-eu">US entities</a> looking to give globalization a last push, and to prepare the ground for the TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), dead in the water as it might be. </p>

<p>First and foremost, the Directive creates for the first time a common definition of <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L0943&from=EN">'trade secret'</a>.  As exceptions to its application, it expressly provides: freedom of expression and information as well as respect for the freedom and pluralism of the media; rules regarding the public interest in disclosure for administrative or judicial authorities in the performance of their duties; disclosure of information submitted by businesses where necessary; and collective agreements. Article 1(3) provides that the Directive may not be use to hinder the mobility of workers (death to non-compete clauses? We'll soon find out.). </p>

<p><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L0943&from=EN">Article 3</a> sets a broad scope for the legal acquisition of trade secrets to include independent discovery, reverse engineering of products made available to the public lawfully in the possession of the party acquiring the product or object, information acquired pursuant to the exercise workers' rights and other means of acquisition in conformity with honest commercial practice. Article 4(2)(a) and (b) sets out unlawful means of acquisition of trade secrets to include "unauthorized access to, appropriation of, or copying of any documents, objects, materials, substances or electronic files, lawfully under the control of the trade secret holder, containing the trade secret or from which the trade secret can be deduced", in other words, hacking; or other conduct considered contrary to honest commercial practices, a category left open to future interpretation, ultimately by the European Court of Justice.</p>

<p>Use of a trade secret is deemed unlawful if carried out by anyone who acquired the trade secret unlawfully, is in breach of a confidentiality agreement (or other duty not to disclose) or is in breach of a contractual duty to limit its use (Art. 4[3]). Any action for disclosure of a trade secret will, however, be dismissed where the disclosure involves the exercise of freedom of expression, as mentioned above, revealing of misconduct or illegal activity (all whistleblowers?), disclosure by workers to their representatives, or protecting a legitimate interest recognized by EU or national law (Art. 5). </p>

<p>The Directive provides extensive measures for protection of trade secrets during legal proceedings and for protection of personal data (Art. 9). Provisional and precautionary measures mandated by the Directive include cessation or prohibition of the use of the trade secret; prohibition of the production, marketing etc. or importation, export or storage of infringing goods and seizure of suspected infringing goods, including imported goods (Art. 10). Factors to be considered by the judicial authority and the nature of specific circumstances to be evaluated are also set out in detail (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L0943&from=EN">Art. 11</a>). </p>

<p>Remedies set out in Article 12 include injunctions and corrective measures which include the "destruction of all or part of any document, object, material, substance or electronic file containing or embodying the trade secret or, where appropriate, the delivery up to the applicant of all or part of those documents, objects, materials, substances or electronic files." This falls far short of the execution provision in the new <a href="http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&context=wlulr-online">US law</a>, which by one account constitutes a full 42% of the word count of the Act and provides for <em>ex parte </em>seizure of "property necessary to prevent the propagation or dissemination of the trade secret that is the subject of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1890/text">action</a>."</p>

<p>Pecuniary compensation may also be awarded in place of injunctions and corrective measures where certain conditions are met. Damages may be awarded where the infringer "knew or ought to have known that he, she or it was engaging in unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of a trade secret", but Member States may "limit the liability for damages of employees towards their employers for the unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of a trade secret of the employer where they act without intent.</p>

<p>The Directive is marked not only by what it includes but what it omits in the eyes of US lobbyists. It provides no criminal sanctions (in sharp contrast to the 1996 US law that DTSA amends) and expressly refrains from creating a new form of intellectual property, which leaves it outside the scope of application of the EU Enforcement <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2004:157:TOC">Directive.</a> </p>

<p>Arguably, the full extent of what may come to be regarded as a 'trade secret' has not yet been realized. One author hinted at what is to come, saying "A large proportion of that dark matter is an amorphous "know-how": the culture, incentives and tacit knowledge that make a modern company tick. Successful companies, be they Goldman Sachs or BuzzFeed, evolve a way of gathering, processing and acting on information that is critical to their success and which cannot easily be replicated. The value generated by a firm's culture, just like the value generated by networks of people within cities, or by a country's economic institutions, is social rather than<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/technological-revolution-sparks-social-unrest"> individual</a>." </p>

<p>A narrow view of the new Directive is that it harmonizes a diverse collection of national legal provisions for the sake of free movement upon which the EU is based. In a broader perspective, it sharply raises the question of whether as a society we are shareholders, in which case privatization and secrecy are acceptable if they contribute by way of stronger more competitive corporations to our collective material wealth or citizens, in which case our public domain stands to be diminished considerably by any replacement of patents (faulty as they may be) with trade secrets for the sake of corporate economy.</p>

<p>Legislation strengthening secrecy, be it state or corporate, by definition limits the transparency basic to democracy and, many would argue, progress and prosperity, particularly in an era where corporate power is being supplemented by new 'trade agreements'. While it is interesting that the EU has not seen fit to harmonize trade secret law over its sixty years of existence, regardless of the fact that, e.g. variation in areas like the validity and operation of non-compete clauses must have caused considerable disruption in the plans of employers wishing to take advantage of the single market labor pool. </p>

<p>It is far from conspiratorial to think that it is no coincidence that the EU has chosen to harmonize this far-reaching body of law in the same year as the US, where corporations and start-ups alike are drowning in innovation-killing patent thickets, plagued by patent trolls and facing rising costs of prosecution and protection of patents. This Directive may be a good thing in that it creates no new IP and brings to bear general principles of EU law, including those in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, proportionality and free movement of people, on what was more often than not straight national contract law. But here's the thing: in their characteristic short-sightedness, both the US and the EU (i.e. the IP-worshipping 'West') are undermining their deeply entrenched justification for the existence of intellectual property law in the first place: first, that the disclosure demanded in return for monopoly fosters healthy, stable and prosperous societies; and secondly, that individuals, regardless of the fact that most are employees of some corporate entity, should be the beneficiaries of their own creative and inventive ideas which they alone are free to exploit for a limited time. 2016 is making goose that laid the golden egg very uncomfortable. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.cascadianow.org/end-of-life-liberty-project/">Kathryn L. Tucker</a> Executive Director of End of Life Liberty Project (ELLP) discusses the Death with Dignity Act adopted by DC... </p>

                <p>The Death with Dignity Act adopted by the DC City Council in November 2016, establishes statutory permission for <a href="https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/07/29/13/28/patients-rights-to-self-determination-at-the-end-of-life">aid in dying (AID)</a>, the practice whereby a physician provides a mentally competent terminally ill patient with a prescription for medication that the patient can ingest to achieve a peaceful death. DC is the sixth jurisdiction to adopt such a law, following <a href="https://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Pages/ors.aspx">Oregon</a>, <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=70.245">Washington</a>, <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/fullchapter/18/113">Vermont</a>, <a href="http://coalitionccc.org/tools-resources/end-of-life-option-act/">California</a>, and <a href="https://www.deathwithdignity.org/states/colorado/">Colorado</a>. Montana permits the practice by decision of the Montana Supreme Court, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1689304237166933790">Baxter v. Montana</a>. Thus, with the DC enactment, a total of 7 US jurisdictions openly permit the practice of AID.</p>

                <p>Because bills proposing permitting AID routinely face arguments of insufficient "safeguards," proponents of these measure embrace a 'throw in the kitchen sink' approach: drafting measures thick with "safeguards." The many burdens and restrictions imposed by these statutes include, among others:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Patients electing AID must make at least three requests, two oral and one written.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>The requests must be witnessed.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>A second opinion confirming diagnosis and prognosis is required.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>A mental health specialist must be consulted if the attending or consulting physician has concerns regarding the patient's ability to make an informed decision.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>A minimum fifteen-day waiting period must elapse between the two oral requests.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Physicians must collect and report a vast amount of demographic data on who chooses AID and why.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>While in some ways these enactments are a step toward expanding end of life liberty, they impose heavy governmental intrusion into the practice of medicine, which is concerning because it creates barriers to patient access and to physician participation. Oregon's experience as the first state with an AID statute has been closely watched and studied. The State collects and publishes data in an annual report about aid in dying, and a <a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/whitlr33&div=8&id=&page=">plethora of articles</a> examining and discussing the data have been published in journals of law, medicine, and health policy. In light of nearly 20 years of practice in Oregon demonstrating that no harm arises when AID is openly available, it would be appropriate for the practice to evolve to a more normalized status within the practice of medicine. This was contemplated in the Vermont Statute enacted in 2013, the third state to adopt an AID statute&#8212;and the first to do so via the traditional legislative process. As initially adopted, Vermont's law would have modeled Oregon's for a period of three years, after which nearly all regulation would sunset, leaving a <a href="http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/05-TuckerG.pdf">clear safe harbor</a> for physicians to practice aid in dying in conformity with standard of care. This reflected a positive step in the direction of normalizing AID within the practice of medicine. Medicine is not routinely governed by statute but, rather, by the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369212604085">type of care that a competent health care professional would render in similar circumstances</a>&#8212;referred to as <a href="http://www.suffolk.edu/documents/Law%20Journal%20of%20H%20and%20B/Tucker-2-19.pdf">standard of care or best practice</a>. This progressive aspect of Vermont's law was short-lived: it was <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2016/S.108">repealed</a> in 2015. Accordingly, Vermont's statute remains nearly identical to those in other states and, most recently, DC. In Montana, where AID is practiced not subject to statute but, in the wake of the &#8220; <span class="casename">Baxter</span> decision, has been practiced subject to standard of care, no untoward result has occurred.</p>

                <p>It is unfortunate that modern enactments, including the DC Death with Dignity Act, are not moving in the direction of normalizing AID within the practice of medicine, and allowing best practices to determine what makes sense for waiting periods and other aspects relating to patient access.</p>

                <p>Take for example the fifteen-day waiting period in the statutory permissions. This is unreasonably long. A shorter period could ensure that a patient's choice is reflective, carefully considered and enduring. For example, consider the plight of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/great-reads/la-me-c1-assisted-death-20150519-story.html">Angie Bloomquist</a>, dying of ALS. Her illness had progressed to the point where she had lost the ability to move any part of her body other than her eyeballs. She communicated by eye gaze computer, and expressed her desire for a more peaceful death through aid in dying. Patients choosing AID do so because they find themselves in an unbearable dying process, concluding that the cumulative burden of suffering imposed by their end stage terminal illness is overwhelming. Forcing them to suffer longer seems unjustifiable. Moreover, some of these patients will be forever denied the right to choose aid in dying due to a rigid statutorily imposed fifteen-day waiting period, as they will die or become incapable of self-administration of the medication during that long period. If the practice of AID were to evolve subject to best practices, it is likely that a much shorter period for reflection would become standard of care.</p>

                <p>Other elements of the statutory permissions for AID are problematic. For instance, they require patients seeking AID to make a written request in addition to two oral requests separated by a fifteen-day waiting period before the prescription can be provided. Patients must also see a consulting physician who must confirm a patient's diagnosis, prognosis, and mental competence. These provisions delay when a patient can access AID. Delays operate to either deter some patients from seeking AID or prevent them from using it given the terminal and progressive nature of their illnesses. Fewer requests in order to access AID, as well as allowing the assessment of an attending physician to be sufficient in determining the diagnosis, prognosis, and mental competence of a patient,  might well be appropriate and should be considered in future enactments. Ideally, future enactments ought leave such to evolving standard of care and best practices.</p>

                <p>Those who believe it is the individual who ought be vested with the autonomy to make their own informed decisions about profoundly personal matters involving their own body, life course and medical treatment will applaud such evolution.</p>

Napoleon Community Schools</a></u>  argued before the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a>  on October 31, 2016, the question is whether parents must exhaust administrative remedies under the <a href="https://www.disability.gov/individuals-disabilities-education-act-idea/">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</a> (IDEA) before suing a school district for damages suffered as the result of discrimination against their child under the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/2010_regs.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA). The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8326079484204683753&q=Fry+v.+Napoleon+Community+Schools&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&as_vis=1">ruled</a>  for the school district. The result likely would have been the same in other circuits<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13914052363873750398&q=Payne+v.+Peninsula+Sch.+District&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&as_vis=1"> except for the Ninth.</a> </p>

<p>The Frys' daughter EF was born with cerebral palsy that limits her motor skills and mobility. A Goldendoodle named Wonder was trained to help EF, but the Napoleon Community Schools refused to allow Wonder to accompany EF to school. EF's <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/parents/needs/speced/iepguide/index.html">Individualized Education Program</a> (IEP) provided for a human aide to support EF during school hours. After meeting with a lawyer representing the Frys, the school district allowed Wonder to be with EF on a limited basis for about two months. The school district refused to allow Wonder thereafter. The Frys filed a complaint with the <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/index.html">US Department of Education Office of Civil Rights</a>. During the two years until the department ruled in favor of EF, the parents educated EF at home. Then EF's father and the school principal met to discuss EF's return to school. EF's father concluded that the principal remained unwilling to cooperate fully about Wonder, and the Frys enrolled EF in a different school system.    </p>

<p><a href="/paperchase/2016/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-service-dogs-copyright.php">In the Supreme Court</a>,  the Frys, the school district and the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/osg">Solicitor General</a>  all agreed on a predicate point:  where parents seek remedies available under IDEA, exhaustion is required except in rare circumstances. That means, as several Justices and the lawyers before them discussed during the argument, a child's parents must engage in a cooperative process with the school to devise an individualized plan for the child's education. Only after that cooperative and individualized process is completed must a court consider a suit against the school system for discriminating against the child on the basis of disability.  Some students, however, like EF, are not asking for an IEP or otherwise seeking relief available under IDEA, so her case seems to be one where exhaustion should not be necessary. The Justices posed numerous questions, however, on the limits of a ruling for EF, particularly on whether a decision for EF would open the floodgates for parents who want to avoid the administrative process.</p>

<p>The question nobody asked was why parents might want to avoid the IDEA administrative process, a process touted as cooperative and focused on the needs of their child. Nor did anyone ask whether schools might agree that the administrative process no longer works in many cases.  It's past time, in my view, for that conversation to be joined.</p>

<p>Based on their experiences with school systems, many parents have concluded that the administrative process is neither individualized nor cooperative. At the same time, schools are not irrational in concluding that the individualized and cooperative system is not always the best way to deliver a suitable education to children with special needs. Frankly, continuing to pretend that special education is always individualized and cooperative belies how often the process is generalized, litigious, aggravating, unnecessary and discriminatory.</p>

<p>For my article <u><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2728001">Kids and Rules: Challenging Individualization in Special Education</a></u>, I examined 32 special education cases involving children on the autism spectrum. The cases were heard by courts in the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11932293818160293037&q=Bryant+v.+New+York+State+Education+Department,+692+F.3d+202+(2012)&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Southern District of New York</a> from 2010 to 2014. In each case, the plan proposed by the school in the IEP meeting was nearly identical to the plans offered in the other meetings. Even where parents objected and suggested alternatives, the plan adopted after the IEP meeting rarely differed much from the school's original plan. In nearly every case federal courts accepted the school system's conclusion that its plan satisfied the substantive requirements of the IDEA. Exceptions were cases with procedural flaws.</p>

<p>I see no "cooperative" or "individualized" process here. Instead, plainly, the school system adopted a routine plan of services for children who share certain characteristics. The school system invested resources in an organization through which the routine plan is followed by trained teachers and aides. Uniformity and, perhaps, accountability, are the hallmarks of the system, not "individualization," "cooperation" or even negotiation.  </p>

<p>In special education jargon the New York cases could be illegitimate because IEPs are "predetermined" rather than individualized for each child. The predetermination label overlooks, however, what school systems have learned over the 40 years since the original version of today's IDEA:  some children share similar issues and can benefit from similar services. When that's true why not create and stick to a routine?  </p>

<p>The Frys faced exactly what the New York parents faced:  a school system that had a routine, and Wonder didn't fit. While a blind child with a service dog can have the dog at school, a child using a service dog for a different purpose cannot. As the Frys saw no amount of "cooperative" conversation would produce a different outcome.  </p>

<p>What the Frys faced that the New York parents did not face was an illegal rule. The routine IEPs in New York survived the scrutiny of multiple federal courts which found the plans to be substantively adequate. The routine IEP excluding Wonder could not survive scrutiny.  In both cases, however, it would have been better for all concerned to be transparent. Where the school system believes that children in similar circumstances should receive similar services, the school should let the public know.</p>

<p>Like the New York parents, the Fry family was subjected to a privaterule or policy. The Frys (and the friends and neighbors who helped them buy Wonder) could not know in advance that the school system would exclude Wonder. If the rule or policy had been considered in public, the school board could have learned from the community about their experience and concerns. After public consultation, a rule or policy could have been adopted that protected children with service dogs against discrimination without, at the same time, causing undue worry about service dogs distracting children, scaring people, causing allergic reactions or requiring substantial staff attention. Transparency lets parents like the Frys predict whether Wonder will be welcomed, given Wonder's characteristics, functions and training.  Parents in New York could know whether fighting the proposed plan is worth time and resources. Keeping the rule or policy secret precludes public input, problem-solving and predictability. The Frys like many other parents, get blindsided. The school loses the trust of parents and children while wasting time seeking parental agreement to a predetermined IEP which may, in fact, be educationally sound. </p>

<p>No wonder the Frys withdrew their child from school, home-schooled the child for 2 years, and rejected conditions for welcoming their child and Wonder back to school. No wonder they changed schools and sued for discrimination rather than seeking a new IEP.  They already knew that the cooperation and individualization values of the IDEA are suspect.  </p>

<p>Transparent rules and policies can guide people to behave legally and predictably. School personnel want to obey the law and to deliver sound education to all children. Devising individualized education programs is not a hallmark of general education, where we want all children to achieve proficiency at certain levels by predictable times. Individualized special education is plainly a necessity for children whose issues or combination of issues are not shared by many other children. For children with more common issues, however, individualization and cooperation do not always result in sound or legal educational programs.  </p>

<p>Parents have an unusual role under the IDEA because of concerns that children with disabilities face discrimination. The system works best when parents trust the school system to do what it can for the child, so a cooperative process makes sense. But process&#8212;whether cooperative or adversarial&#8212;takes time, and parents with special needs children are often short in that department, particularly where parents are also short of money. Another route to trust may be found in publicly adopted rules and policies which tell the school system and the parents what to expect when a child has issues that are shared by other children.</p>

<p><u>Fry v. Napoleon School District</u> will not resolve these problems. If the Court rejects the highly restrictive rule of the Sixth Circuit, however, some parents will have a shorter route to a conclusion. What will help more parents and more schools is a reconsideration of individualization and cooperation as the keys to special education. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.onu.edu/faculty_staff/faculty_staff_profiles/jean_marie_kamatali">Jean-Marie Kamatali</a> of <a href="http://law.onu.edu">Ohio Northern University Pettit College of Law</a> discusses the benefits of investigating French officials' role in the Rwanda Genocide...</p><strong>O</strong>n November 29th the Prosecutor General of Rwanda <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/rwanda-probes-possible-role-of-french-military-members-in-rwandan-genocide.php">released a statement</a> announcing the start of a formal criminal investigation of 20 French government agents/officials in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. Although this statement did not give the names of the officials under investigation, the fact that it came following <a href="http://www.cnlg.gov.rw/fileadmin/user_upload/French_Military.pdf">the release by the Rwanda National Commission for the Fight against the Genocide (CNLG)</a> [PDF] of a list of 22 French military and diplomatic officials for their involvement "as direct perpetrators or as accomplices" in the genocide indicates the link between these two announcements.</p>

<p>The list established by the CNLG is very elaborate. It contains names and titles of each person as well as their detailed contribution in genocide. Among the high profile officials on this list include General Jacques Lanxade, France's Army Chief of Staff from April 1991 to September 1995, General Christian Quesnot, Special Chief of staff of President Mitterrand from 1991 to 1995, and General Jean-Claude Lafourcade, the top commander of the French forces engaged in Turquoise, France's intervention in Rwanda from June 22 to August 22, 1994. The involvement of these officials ranges from supporting the pre-1994 Rwandan army through military training and supplying them with weapons, to training, arming and shielding the Interahamwe militias, the forces behind the 1994 Genocide. </p>

<p>The release of this list by the CNLG and the announcement of the General Prosecutor of Rwanda have been viewed by some as a retaliation by the Rwandan government against <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3827761/France-reopens-probe-1994-assassination-Rwandan-president.html">France's recent announcement</a> to reopen its investigation on the April 1994 shooting down of the plane that killed everyone on board including the then Rwandan President Habyarimana, the Burundian President Ntalyamira as well as its French pilots. This shooting marked the beginning of the Genocide. In early October 2016 two French investigating magistrates, Nathalie Poux and Jean-Marc Herbaut, announced the reopening of this investigation although in July 2014 judge Marc Trévidic had <a href="http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/Habyarimana-plane-crash--witness--disappears-/2558-2539598-uv87qy/index.html">closed it by reversing the conclusions</a> of his predecessor, judge Jean-Louis Bruguière. The latter had concluded that Paul Kagame, the current president of Rwanda ordered the shooting of this airplane. </p>

<p>No matter the political reasons behind the Rwanda General Prosecutor's announcement, two observations are clear: First, the details and documentation included in the CNLG list proves that Rwanda has been, for a long time, working on gathering evidences against its targeted 20 French citizens and officials, and therefore the General Prosecutor's announcement should not be dismissed as just a retaliatory act; Second, if the judiciary of both these two countries can cooperate in this investigation&#8212both sides have committed to this&#8212they are both likely to benefit from its outcome.</p>

<p>The French military's involvement in Rwanda has been well recorded both in France and Rwanda. In its 1998 <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dossiers/rwanda/r1271.asp">fact-finding report</a> the French Parliamentary Commission admitted that the 1990 French military intervention in Rwanda which was initially aimed at protecting French citizens was redirected to "help the governmental forces indirectly by giving them technical assistance and weapons so as to prevent the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front from winning." The 2008 Government of Rwanda report known as "<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1392372/footnote-94-mucyo-commission-report.pdf">Mucyo Report</a>" illustrated with much specifics, however, that France's role was more than indirect in its help to governmental forces. The report details France's direct participation in the fighting and involvement in the training of the Interahamwe militias, who are the notorious ring leaders in genocide; and France's sustained support to the regime it knew was involved in genocide. This report was followed in 2010 by another Government of Rwanda's report known as "<a href="http://mutsinzireport.com/?page_id=47">Mutsinzi Report,</a>" which had concluded that the hardliners in the Genocide regime are responsible for shooting down the presidential airplane. </p>

<p>Obviously no one should expect the French government to easily accept Rwanda's accusations. Genocide is a very serious crime, a crime of crimes, with several legal and political consequences. That's why no country or individual can freely admit to it. The establishment of such an extreme crime is better left to courts. It should, therefore, surprise no one if Rwanda, after numerous unsuccessful political and diplomatic attempts to bring the attention to France on its role in Genocide, is taking the only path remaining: The court option. In pursuing this option Rwanda had two alternatives: Bring France before the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/court/index.php?p1=1">International Court of Justice (ICJ)</a> to determine its responsibility in Genocide or indict French officials/agents based on the available evidence of involvement in Genocide. </p>

<p>Although the first path could be more direct and effective, it is also likely to be the most difficult. The reluctance of the ICJ to be persuaded in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&case=91&p3=4">Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro</a> case, in which the Bosnia and Herzegovina knew about Serbia's involvement in Genocide and had much clearer facts in the case, proves the challenges Rwanda was likely to confront should it have privileged the ICJ path. In this case, although the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?pr=1897&code=bhy&p1=3&p2=3&p3=6">ICJ found</a> that Serbia violated its obligation to prevent genocide, it ruled that Serbia has neither committed genocide nor incited or acted as an accomplice in the Bosnia and Herzegovina's genocide.</p>

<p>Bringing domestic courts to determine the individual criminal responsibilities of French officials/agents in the Genocide is therefore the best alternative. Rwanda is currently seeking to investigate these officials/agents for their role as "perpetrators or accomplices" in the Genocide. Rwanda should, however, consider broadening the net to include their role in "aiding and abetting" in Genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. As the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has stated in the <a href="http://unictr.unmict.org/en/cases/ictr-96-4">Akayesu case</a>, "[C]omplicity requires a positive act, i.e. an act of commission, whereas aiding and abetting may consist in failing to act or refraining from action." Both the ICTR and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) have plenty of jurisprudence on this crime. For example In <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/blagojevic_jokic/4#tdec">the Blagojevic and Jokic case</a> the ICTY Trial Chamber held that aiding and abetting genocide is defined by the following element (s) "the accused carried out an act which consisted of practical assistance, encouragement or moral support to the principal that had a 'substantial effect' on the commission of the crime." The ICTR in <a href="http://unictr.unmict.org/en/cases/ictr-95-1a">the Bagilishema case</a> has held that this support may be deducted from the high regard the perpetrator of genocide put on the person accused of aiding and abetting. Furthermore, in the <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/blaskic/4">Blaskic case</a>, the ICTY Appeals Chamber agreed with the the Trial Chamber statement that "the actus reus of aiding and abetting may be perpetrated through an omission, 'provided this failure to act had a decisive effect on the commission of the crime and that it was coupled with the requisite mens rea." The facts included in the "Mucyo Report" and numerous pictures of French soldiers being cheered by  the Interahamwe militias are sufficient to build an indictable case for French soldiers/officials in aiding and abetting genocide. </p>

<p>Obviously Rwanda should not expect France to extradite its citizens to Rwanda. Although no law specifically forbids France from extraditing its citizens, France has consistently responded to foreign extradition calls that "France never extradites its citizens."  This is not, however, a serious handicap because under the principle of <em>aut dedere aut prosequi</em>, if France is not willing to extradite its suspects, it has the duty to prosecute them. Already, one person on the list established by Rwanda, is being investigated by the French justice:  Captain Paul Barril who has been described as military advisor of Rwanda in 1994 and was involved in an arms deal with the regime responsible for genocide. Since 2013 Captain Paul Barril has been the subject of investigation by the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris for Complicity in Genocide. With the recent French offer to cooperate with the Rwanda National Public Prosecution Authority in its investigation, the list of people under investigation by this tribunal is likely to increase.</p>

<p>Now that the judiciary machinery has been ignited, it is hoped that diplomacy and politics will let it take its course in determining the individual responsibility of each French officer under investigation and how high this responsibility ascends in the French chain of command. The results of this investigation and possible prosecution by either Rwanda or France may not bring these two countries to a perfect relationship but at least it will set a forum in which those on this list could clear their names and for the victims and survivors to have justice. Furthermore, France's responsibility in the Genocide against the Tutsi could be established or cleared and therefore allow both countries to move forward with a shared legal narrative on what really happened during the pre-April 1994 French military cooperation in Rwanda. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist Amy St. John, manager at <a href="https://www.earthshealing.org">Earth's Healing</a>, shares some professional experiences and personal opinions from her time spent working inside the marijuana industry...</p><strong>I</strong> have worked in the medical marijuana industry since 2013 in both Arizona and New Mexico. I have been involved in all aspects of this industry including: licensing, dispensary, cultivation, compliance, and patient and community education. I have also been a patient myself. I have seen the medical marijuana industry grow and evolve over the last four years by leaps and bounds&#8212from the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/3052013829132756857467.pdf">memo</a> [PDF] issued August 29, 2013, to many <a href="http://jurist.org/hotline/2016/11/the-most-significant-gain-from-cannabis-legalization-one-lawyers-perspective.php">states passing medical and adult-use laws</a>&#8212but there is still a long way to go until all people in this country can have access to this wonderful plant.   </p>

                <p>It is well-known that cannabis has many healing properties. Cannabis can shrink tumors, relieve chronic pain, reduce seizures, alleviate anxiety, and help with migraines, PTSD, cancer, AIDS, hepatitis C, Crohn's Disease and many more illnesses. The magic of this plant is in both the cannabinoids and the terpenes. The most common cannabinoids are THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol). Several other cannabinoids have equally as much benefit as THC and CBD, such as CBN (Cannabinol) and CBG (Cannabigerol). Terpenes (the essential oils) are just as important and beneficial to patients as well. The smell of each strain is a little different and each terpene has a different profile and healing benefit. Cannabidiol (CBD) has received a lot of attention lately. Although CBD is very therapeutic and non-psychoactive, it should always be recommended that whole plant therapy is much more effective. You must have THC and CBD together to get the most benefit; this is called the entourage effect. CBD-only products are also made from hemp, not marijuana.   </p>

                <p>All humans (and everything that has a spinal cord) have an endocannabinoid system with CB1 and CB2 receptors. These receptors are primarily located in the brain and the gut. When ingested, the cannabinoids present in marijuana will attach themselves to these receptors and begin to do what they were meant to do. Several researchers and doctors believe that several illnesses, specifically auto-immune diseases, have surfaced because of a lack of these cannabinoids for the last 50 years. This is referred to as Endocannabinoid Deficiency Syndrome. Since cannabis and hemp was eradicated from not only our diet, but also from animal diets and feeds, there may be a correlation in the increase of such diseases. </p>

                <p>Medical marijuana states have seen<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/04/26/is-marijuana-a-gateway-drug/overdoses-fell-with-medical-marijuana-legalization"> lower opiate overdose rates</a> and more and more people are choosing cannabis strictly from a harm reduction approach. Cannabis has the least amount of side effects and will do the least harm to a person. No one has EVER died from a marijuana overdose! It is definitely safer than alcohol, tobacco, and many prescription drugs. I believe that the marijuana industry is about healing people, whereas the pharmaceutical industry makes its profits from keeping people sick and they are lobbying hard against legalization of marijuana (either adult-use or medical). Prescription drugs, particularly opiates, are the true gateway drugs. The DARE program has even removed marijuana as being the gateway drug from their platform this past year.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest challenges facing this industry is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/05/marijuana-money_n_6416678.html">the banking system</a>. Although medical marijuana dispensaries are a legal business in the state of Arizona, dispensaries still rely primarily on a &#8220;cash-only&#8221; system. Credit cards and debit cards are rarely accepted because of ties to the banking system. Since banks are federally insured, they are usually unwilling to work with us. I have worked with several dispensaries and all of them at one time or another have had their bank accounts closed. Another challenge is the lack of recognition of this industry by the federal government. Although a doctor certifies a patient in Arizona to use medical cannabis, that patient can't legally cross state lines with their medicine. That patient could then be arrested in another state for using their medicine that is legal in their home state. In Southern Arizona (Tucson and south), patients have the additional worry about US Border Patrol checkpoints. Since the US Border Patrol is a federal entity, medications are confiscated and patients could face prosecution, even though they are following state law.</p>

                <p>Although Arizona passed the <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/ars/36/02801.htm">Arizona Medical Marijuana Act</a> (AMMA) in 2010, patients did not have access to dispensaries until almost two years later. The first patient cards, however, were issued in April 201&#8212this basically just protected the person if they were caught with marijuana. After a few months and pending lawsuits, the Department of Health Services issued new cards to all existing patients to allow them to cultivate their own medicine. There were many legislators who did not support the AMMA law and tried to get it <a href="http://azdhs.gov/licensing/medical-marijuana/index.php#lawsuits">overturned</a>. After much litigation, the AMMA law was upheld and dispensaries were finally allowed to open. The first dispensary in the state did not open until December 1, 2012.  </p>

                <p>Arizona currently has over 108,000 people who have their MMJ (medical marijuana) patient card. This allows them to possess 2.5 ounces of cannabis every 14 calendar days. Medical cannabis is available in all forms for patients to include edibles, flower (to smoke), concentrates, oils, ointments, patches, sublingual tinctures and sprays.<br />
                    <br />
                    I personally experience the benefits of cannabis every day, have dedicated my life to its advocacy, and can only hope that the future of medical marijuana continues to gain acceptance with further research, precision dosing, innovative cultivation techniques, and appropriate legislation.</p>

                <p>Education is the key. Ignorance can no longer be accepted.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://pennstatelaw.psu.edu/faculty/backer">Larry Catá Backer</a>,  of Pennsylvania State University discusses consequences of President elect Trump's rejection of the TTP ... </p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and its European twin, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), mean to provide a basis for the organization and management of global trade that to some extent <a href="http://e15initiative.org/blogs/trans-pacific-partnership-as-a-set-of-international-economic-rules/">supplements (and perhaps) supplants</a> the old WTO order. Together they were to preserve the importance of private economic activities grounded in markets and to expand the role of the non-state and supra state sectors in the governance of trade and transnational economic activity.<br />
 <br />
But they have also been their own worst enemies. Born or nurtured abroad, their negotiation has been shrouded in <a href="https://insidetrade.com/daily-news/ustr-defends-tpp-transparency-against-charges-civil-society-critics">secrecy</a>.  Both appeared to keep civil society at arm's length while embracing the transnational businesses most directly affected by their provisions. Both appeared to move away from a model grounded in state-based regulation through law that is enforced by national courts in favor of new structures of remedies based on transnational standards that appear more impervious to <a href="https://itsourfuture.org.nz/tpp-agreement-bad-for-democracy/">democratic accountability</a>. These common characteristics transformed both into the bête noir of a motley group of civil society, of old fashioned internationalists, of state-privileging constitutionalists and of those who are generally suspicious of governance in societal hybrid (public-private) transnational space. These actors <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/what-tpp-trade-deal-342449">worried</a>, quite loudly, about the way that both TTP and TTIP de-centered individual states from the governance and management of macro-economic policies, set substantive standards in key areas that appeared to some extent beyond the reach of national legislatures and established remedial regimes beyond the reach of national judiciaries and their legal orders.  They also <a href="http://www.e-ir.info/2016/04/13/the-trans-pacific-partnership-for-against-and-prospects/">decried</a> the way that TPP might weaken labor policy, threaten national environmental and consumer protection ideals and produce a race to the bottom for national health care systems, banking systems and national regimes for individual privacy. <br />
 <br />
The <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/05/16/why-president-obama-having-so-much-trouble-selling-tpp">phlegmatic efforts</a> of the Obama administration, <a href="http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/obama-state-of-union-tpp-1201678526/">buried among other objectives</a>, and the excruciatingly slow progress toward finalization of both TPP and TTIP, only exacerbated a situation whose threats to adoption were compounded by the unwillingness of a less than loyal opposition (and eventually also the losing Democratic Party nominee for the US Presidency) to put national interest (and their own political ideologies) above what appeared to be cynically driven political strategies of short term partisan advantage. The TPP/TTIP negotiations did have one positive effect&#8212;they have served as the nexus points for national conversations, long deferred, about the nature and direction of globalization, of the role of the state, and of the obligation of states and enterprises to "feed" local labor markets, contribute to the domestication of wealth from production derived from multinational production chains and to contribute to the economic, social, cultural, civil and political life of <a href="http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_globalstudies/vol13/iss1/6/">states within a global order</a> which they meant to construct.<br />
 <br />
The centering of transnational orders, of marginalization of transparency and engagement by states founded on a governing ideology of engagement and transparency, and the construction of governance orders beyond states and their democratic sovereign masses in which states and enterprises would become the major stakeholders enraged many&#8212;on both left and right in the United States. Yet both TPP and TTIP were natural extensions, natural deepening of the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/tpp-is-surprising-vote-of-confidence-in-globalization-1445446966">implications of globalization</a>, which required elaboration around the principles of markets and market integrity, of the differentiation between public and private spheres (relating to activity if not to actors) and of the harmonization of regulatory governance that promised to continue increasing aggregate growth (though in what appeared in certain states to be in an increasingly lopsided way).<br />
 <br />
It is in this context that one can read and seek to understand the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/11/trump-to-withdraw-from-trans-pacific-partnership-on-first-day-in-office.php">announcement made by the President Elect</a> "that he would issue a notification of <a href="https://youtu.be/7xX_KaStFT8">intent to withdraw</a> [video URL] from the <a href="https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific-partnership/tpp-full-text">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) [text] on his first day in office." But Mr. Trump announced more than that. He also signaled his intention to withdraw from multilateral efforts to which several prior Democratic and Republican administrations had expended much effort, in favor of 'negotiating' fair bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back on American 'shores.' Trump also stated that his decision to withdraw from the TPP and all the other announcements made in the video shared Monday are in furtherance of his ambition to facilitate production and innovation within American borders."<br />
 <br />
About the same time, Mr. Trump announced his choice for Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross. A <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/02/news/economy/kfile-wilbur-ross-tpp/">CNN Report</a> of December 2, 2016 noted that Mr. Ross had been part of an influential group of business leaders seeking the finalization of TPP, including a well circulated 2015 letter to New York's Congressional delegation. Now as Commerce Secretary designate, and apparently without skipping a beat, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/02/news/economy/kfile-wilbur-ross-tpp/">CNN Reported</a> that Mr. Ross "has emerged as a vocal critic of trade deals, saying as recently as Wednesday that the TPP was a 'horrible deal.'" Mr. Ross might well be forgiven his sudden change of heart in light of his potential appointment to national office. But the embrace of a Let's Make a Deal approach, an odd mix of economic nationalism expressed through aggregating bilateralism as the basis for multilateral trade policy, threatens to destabilize the complex and delicately balanced structures of global trade. One can see the outlines of the consequences of Mr. Trump's threat even months before he can make good on the threat.<br />
 <br />
1. From Systems to Serendipity. Since the 1940s, the US has sought to construct systems, systems that have framed the structures, normative principles and operations of global trade and investment that also internationalize US normative and legal principles in global interactions. In the process, the US has been among the vanguard in fostering interconnected economic, social and cultural activities now difficult for any state&#8212;including the United States&#8212;to manage entirely (<a href="http://www.demdigest.org/china-ngo-law-recognition-power/">even within its own territory</a>). Mr. Trump does not appear to want to foster systems. Mr. Trump wants to do "deals." That is, effectively all he knows. That, perhaps, is all he thinks he needs to know. In the process, though, he will create or at least upend systems he cannot avoid&#8212;substituting a system that is an aggregation of those "deals" he can make for the older project of public policy that builds systems around markets managed through law and regulatory structures and sustained with the objective of ensuring the legitimacy of the "deals" that can be undertaken within its structures. TTP made an easy target for the businessman hawking "deals" to sell the American people on a new "Let's Make a Deal" international economic policy.<br />
 <br />
2. Enter China. Mr. Trump's tilt toward "Let's Make a Deal" <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/aborting-tpp-erodes-us-global-leadership">may well drive leadership of global trade policy</a> from the US and Europe to Asian states (and principally China). There is irony here. President Obama's "<a href="http://www.foreignpolicyi.org/content/obama-administrations-pivot-asia">pivot to Asia</a>" has now, under President Elect Trump's leadership, pivoted not just focus but policy and power to China and its vision for a new global order through layered regional agreements cemented together through its <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2016/11/chinas-one-belt-one-road-inititative">one belt one road</a> (OBOR) framework. Even as the United States moves toward game show economics, the Chinese are paying us the most extraordinary complement of mimicking our methods in the service of its own mission. The <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2050741/chinas-one-belt-one-road-plan-pushing-through-global?utm_source&utm_medium&utm_campaign=SCMPSocialNewsfeed">South China Morning Post</a> reports: "At a time when established world powers are struggling with domestic problems, Xi sees a chance to push ahead with his oddly worded brainchild, a geopolitical push to extend Beijing's influence to remote corners of the globe. The belt and road initiative encompasses 65 countries including China, stretching through Southeast, South, Central and West Asia to the Middle East, Africa and East and Central Europe."<br />
 <br />
3. The US Congress as Wild Card. It is always a mistake to assume that the President is free to assert his will unimpeded. Congress may serve either to block or to mitigate the "Let's Make a Deal" policy initiative of the President Elect. Already states most affected by global trade have begun to make moves to protect the existing multilateral frameworks, starting with NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Area. It was <a href="http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/12/01/179216/congress-moves-to-strengthen-trade-ties-with-mexico-in-teeth-of-trump-threats-to-kill-nafta/">recently reported</a>, for example, that the "Senate has unanimously passed a bill to improve trade flows along the Texas-Mexico border, sponsored by Sen. <a href="https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/">John Cornyn</a>." Much may happen between December 2016 and the middle of January 2017.<br />
 <br />
4. The US Trade Partners Will Make Facts Around "Let's Make a Deal." Asian states have been quick to act in the face of an anticipated American repudiation of the TTP. They have sought to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/abe-trump-japan-meeting/">lobby the incoming administration</a>, sending who they believed to be their most persuasive advocate, with little apparent public effect. They might also consider <a href="http://www.voanews.com/a/australia-considers-tpp-without-us/3608204.html">TTP without the United States</a>&#8212;returning to where TTP was at its inception. On the heels of Mr. Trump's declaration, "Peru is <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201611231047733164-peru-tpp-us/">proposing</a> to create an analogue of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP) free trade agreement between the countries of Asia-Pacific without participation of the United States." In addition, the other TPP states have also sought to look up to China as the next best actor. It has been <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/rcep-free-trade-deal-is-no-substitute-for-the-tpp/a-36621736">reported</a> that in response to the potential rejection of TPP "Asian nations are pinning their hopes on the China-endorsed RCEP (<a href="https://aric.adb.org/fta/regional-comprehensive-economic-partnership">Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership</a>) agreement." Asian states might well shift in this direction, even if the result is less advantageous to global trade than TPP on the theory, <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2016/12/rcep-is-not-the-anti-tpp/">recently suggested</a>, that the transaction costs of modifying a bad deal is smaller than of negotiating a deal from scratch. <br />
 <br />
5. Strategic considerations and "Let's Make a Deal."  There is a certain aura of pragmatism in the President Elect's "Let's Make a Deal" strategy. But it is a false pragmatism that belies the implied criticism of the misdirected ambitions of TPP. Let's Make a Deal presumes that multilateral structures are inherently disadvantageous for the US, and that the cost of modification post adoption is greater than the value of participation or of renegotiation before adoption.  Rejection and renegotiation threats will scatter the TPP partners to the next best available center of ordering power. The pragmatic consequences of such abandonment will be significantly adverse to those business interests Mr. Trump's Let's Make a Deal purports to defend. Without TPP US enterprises may again face the spectre of unequal competition with state owned enterprises that almost invariably will be a disaster for the US, one with respect to which there is already <a href="http://en.yibada.com/articles/174523/20161120/unfair-china-decries-us-panel-report-barring-chinese-soes-acquiring-american-firms.htm">friction</a> with China and of which <a href="http://www.chinausfocus.com/2022/wp-content/uploads/Part+02-Chapter+16.pdf">China is acutely aware</a>. Moreover, in <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/4/without-trans-pacific-partnership-us-hands-over-po/">August 2016</a> "Mr. Obama and visiting Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned . . . China would step in, Mr. Obama said, and Beijing is 'not worried about labor standards or environmental standards or human trafficking or anti-corruption measures' incorporated into the agreement."<br />
 <br />
6. The Other Shoe Dropping; Protectionism in the guise of Bilateralism. There is a worry that Let's Make a Deal is a clever way of bootstrapping nationalist protectionism back into mainstream policy in the US. Discredited since its last disastrous reign as the crown jewel of global economic policies in the 1930s, nationalist protectionism may now be insinuated into the heart of the principal winning campaign promise of Mr. Trump&#8212;the rebuilding of walls in every place and for every circumstance, abstract and concrete&#8212;by an odd combination of nationalists, civil society statists, corporate crony capitalists and others now allied with the President Elect. That will permit us to hide from our problems. But we will not be able to avoid them for long. TPP, in this sense, is an extension of the conversation that produced walls against migration and cultural protection walls as well. That the US mimics the worst elements of global misbehaviors elsewhere does not make this any less disastrous for a nation that has ridden to glory on open borders and global system building.     </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Hugh D. Spitzer of the University of Washington School of Law discusses US Supreme Court decisions which could derail the anticipated efforts by president-elect Trump to punish so-called "sanctuary cities" ...</p>

<p>During the recent election campaign, candidate Donald Trump <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/us/politics/donald-trump-far-from-softening-lays-out-tough-immigration-plans.html?_r=0">threatened to curtail </a>federal funding for "sanctuary cities" that refuse to cooperate with federal efforts to deport undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>Trump did not detail how he would go about doing this, but his ability to punish so-called "sanctuary cities" is likely to be hamstrung by the same Rehnquist and Roberts Supreme Court decisions on state and local powers that red states have relied on to block Obama administration initiatives.</p>

<p>The term "sanctuary cities" is something of a moving target. But at least <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/02/us/sanctuary-cities.html?_r=0">39 cities, 364 counties and four states</a> have enacted laws or policies that limit the scope of local police and sheriff cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. In the same November balloting that elected Trump, urban areas with large undocumented populations &#8212; including Austin and Houston &#8212; chose law enforcement officials who promised they would not act with or on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Mayors, led by Chicago's Rahm Emmanuel, <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/us-mayors-warn-trump-against-repealing-immigration-policy.php">have warned</a> [JURIST Report] of the adverse economic impacts of increased immigration enforcement against law-abiding but undocumented foreign workers. </p>

<p>If cities and counties decline to cooperate with the incoming administration on immigration policy, there are distinct limits on what the federal government will be able to do about it. That fact is rooted in the fundamental legal relationship between the national government and the states and between the states and local governments.</p>

<p>America's <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/governments/cb12-161.html">89,000 municipalities</a> are entirely creatures of the states. There is tremendous variation across the country in what kinds of local governments exist, how they are created, and how much power they have. But they all have one thing in common: they are created according to state constitutions and statutes, and their powers are entirely subject to state control. This municipal law principle, known as "Dillon's Rule," was established in an 1868 Iowa Supreme Court decision written by the conservative jurist <a href="http://uipress.lib.uiowa.edu/bdi/DetailsPage.aspx?id=95">John Forrest Dillon</a>, whom President Ulysses S. Grant appointed to the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in 1869 and then resigned to teach at Columbia and Yale and to represent the Union Pacific Railroad. Dillon's Rule states that municipal corporations have only the powers expressly granted by law, or those incidental to powers expressly granted.    </p>

<p>Because local governments are creatures of the states which retain oversight authority over them (with notable exceptions such as the enforcement of protective legislation upheld under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8">Commerce Clause</a> in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14324093602590092926">Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority</a>), the federal government has no more ability to order cities around than it can tell state governments what to do. </p>

<p>In the context of sanctuary cities, this means that only the state governments have authority to tell cities and counties that they must collaborate with federal immigration enforcement. When one looks at a <a href="http://cis.org/Sanctuary-Cities-Map">map of "sanctuary cities," </a>most of them turn up in blue states &#8212; Texas and Louisiana being notable exceptions &#8212; and liberal state governments are unlikely to require their municipalities to actively aid ICE enforcement. </p>

<p>So the question becomes, what can the federal government do? Recent cases underscore that the national government cannot leapfrog the states to grant powers or responsibilities to municipal corporations that those localities lack under state law. For example, last August the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16572779089396750870">Tennessee v. FCC</a> held that the Federal Communications Commission could not preempt state laws restricting city broadband service powers. The FCC tried to grant cities powers that state laws did not. The Sixth Circuit opinion stated: <blockquote>The political subdivisions of a state are nothing more than that state's 'convenient agencies' and the state generally retains the power to make discretionary decisions for its subdivisions ... Any attempt by the federal government to interpose itself into this state-subdivision relationship therefore must come about by a clear directive from Congress. </blockquote> The <span class="casename">Tennessee v. FCC</span> decision relied on a 2004 decision by the US Supreme Court, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6351988991132214280">Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League</a>, which held that while the FCC might have power to unshackle entrepreneurial private players in the telecommunications market from state restrictions, it had no power to grant local governments the authority to enter into that market in the first place.</p>

<p>Nor can the federal government conscript local governments into carrying out its programs. We know this from a number of important "anti-commandeering" cases decided by the Rehnquist and Roberts courts. In the 1997 case <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10894716839911389166">Printz v. United States</a>, Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court rejected a federal requirement that local law enforcement officials carry out handgun purchase background checks. Citing multiple sections of The Federalist, Scalia emphasized that the Constitution does not allow Congress to impose responsibilities on local governments without the consent of the states. Five years earlier, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9243582117703452379">New York v. United States</a>, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution did not give Congress the ability to compel states to participate in a radioactive waste handling program. These cases were among many emanating from the Rehnquist court that underscored the vitality of the "dual sovereignty" division of responsibilities between the national and the state governments.</p>

<p>If the Trump administration is unable to command cities and counties to participate in ICE activities, could it use the tried and true approach of "bribing" them through the "power of the purse," the Constitution's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8">Spending Power</a>? Here, too, federal tools are heavily restricted by important decisions from the Rehnquist and Roberts courts. In the well-known 1987 case <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3920177871531443576">South Dakota v. Dole</a>, Chief Justice Rehnquist authored the court's opinion which approved (but implicitly limited) the size of federal government transportation funding cut-back to punish states that declined to increase the drinking age to 21. Rehnquist wrote that conditions on federal grants must be related to the subject matter of the particular national projects or programs, and suggested that the level of grant reductions must be modest. He pointed out that "financial inducements offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which 'pressure turns into compulsion.'" Justice O'Connor agreed with the principles but dissented, writing that in that specific case the minimum drinking age was not sufficiently related to interstate highway construction to condition funds appropriated for that purpose.</p>

<p>But most important is Chief Justice Robert's lead opinion in the 2012 case <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11973730494168859869">NFIB v. Sebelius</a>, which, among other things, responded to entreaties from "red state" attorneys general and blocked a key portion of President Obama's Affordable Care Act. The provision in question would have withheld all of a state's Medicaid grants if that state refused to accept increased federal funding and expand medical coverage to low-income people. Chief Justice Roberts cited <span class="casename">New York v. United States</span>, <span class="casename">South Dakota v. Dole</span> and <span class="casename">Printz v. United States</span>, holding that the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid provision passed the line from "relatively mild encouragement" to "a gun to the head." Roberts noted that, in <span class="casename">South Dakota v. Dole</span>, only five percent of a state's highway funds were at stake, suggesting that mild encouragement of that kind was an appropriate level.</p>

<p>If the Trump Administration and Congress opt to reduce federal funding for states that do not order their cities and counties to cooperate with ICE, under Rehnquist and Roberts decisions the reductions will have to be related to the subject matter of the particular national project or program (perhaps limited to federal immigration enforcement assistance). And the reductions cannot be more than "relatively mild encouragement" &#8212; perhaps the five percent level permitted in <span class="casename">South Dakota v. Dole</span> or a bit more. So long as the cities avoid affirmative interference with federal enforcement activities, the national government will be quite limited in the amount of punishment it can dole out.</p>

<p>And big city mayors seem <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/11/15/despite-trumps-threat-to-cut-federal-funding-mayors-across-the-u-s-pledge-to-protect-undocumented-immigrants/?utm_term=.6aa28d54c515">quite determined</a> to stick with their non-collaboration policy even if the federal government attempts more draconian funding cutbacks. This is a moral issue for the mayors and their voters. We have seen from recent red state resistance to President Obama's initiatives that public officials can be remarkably stubborn when resisting what they see as an attack on their communities' fundamental values. When northern states and cities actively resisted federal fugitive slave laws prior to the Civil War, the national government was ultimately able to bludgeon them into cooperation only because <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiv">Article IV, Section 2</a> of the Constitution provided the basis for doing so. But that provision is not relevant to free undocumented persons, and in any event it was rendered inoperative by the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiii">Thirteenth Amendment's</a> abolition of slavery.</p>

<p>The supreme irony is, of course, that predominantly Democratic states and cities will be relying on the constitutionally-imbedded states rights that Republicans have fought so hard to sustain. Sanctuary cities will have to rely on Chief Justice Roberts and his colleagues who have strongly advocated the Madisonian principles so important to lawyers and judges with roots in the Federalist Society. Cynics might suggest that conservatives on the Supreme Court will change their tune based on the change in federal administrations. But that would ignore their historical commitment to limited federal powers. As one libertarian commentator <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2016/12/08/donald-trump-sanctuary-cities-legal">observed in a recent piece</a> on sanctuary cities, President Trump will be forced to "follow the Constitution, or the courts will enjoin him as they have his predecessor."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST contributing editor <a href="http://law.umkc.edu/directory/faculty-directory/name/allen-rostron/">Allen Rostron</a> of the <a href="http://law.umkc.edu/">University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law</a> discusses recent developments in lawsuits seeking to impose tort liability for negligent sale of firearms. While gun dealers continue to face a substantial risk of liability for negligence, gun manufacturers enjoy a higher degree of immunity...</p>

<p><strong>F</strong>ifteen years ago, the gun industry faced a nation-wide wave of lawsuits. Today, gun companies are no longer under the same degree of legal pressure, thanks in large part to a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/109/plaws/publ92/PLAW-109publ92.pdf">federal law</a> [PDF] that gives the industry a special immunity from liability in many instances. The recent <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article116462698.html">settlement </a>of a case against a Missouri gun store for $2.2 million shows that tort litigation remains an important way to hold firearm dealers responsible for practices that are unreasonably and unnecessarily dangerous. However, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/15/nyregion/judge-dismisses-suit-against-gun-maker-by-newtown-victims-families.html?_r=1">dismissal </a>of a case brought against a gun manufacturer by families of the Newtown shooting victims illustrates that it remains more difficult to hold manufacturers accountable.  </p>

<p>The Missouri case arose out of a tragic set of circumstances that led a troubled young woman to kill her father. According to the  <a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/sites/default/files/Delana-Complaint-FOR-FILING.pdf">allegations </a> [PDF] in the case, Colby Sue Weathers had a long history of mental illness and substance abuse. In May 2012, she was suicidal and suffering from intense hallucinations, but managed to purchase a pistol from a gun store in <a href="http://www.cityofodessamo.com/">Odessa, Missouri</a>.  She planned to kill herself with it, but her parents found out and disposed of the gun.</p>

<p>A month later, as Weathers' mental condition continued to deteriorate, her mother called to warn the gun store about Weathers' mental illness, her suicidal tendencies, and the fact that Weathers would soon be receiving a Social Security check, and was likely to come back to the store to purchase another gun with those funds.  Weathers' mother begged the gun store not to sell Weathers another gun, even giving the store her daughter's name, date of birth and social security number and asking that the information be posted near the cash register so that all of the store's employees would know about the situation.</p>

<p>According to the allegations in the case, the gun store refused to take any special precautions. Two days later, Weathers walked into the store and purchased a pistol. She then drove home, loaded the weapon, and used it to kill her father.</p>

<p>Weathers is now confined and receiving care at a state psychiatric hospital.  With the help of Missouri lawyers aided by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, her mother filed a lawsuit against the gun store.</p>

<p>To succeed on tort claims about the sale of a firearm, lawyers must find a way to navigate around the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/109/plaws/publ92/PLAW-109publ92.pdf">Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act</a> [PDF], a federal statute that generally preempts claims for harm caused by criminal misuse of firearms. The Act contains a few exceptions. In the Missouri case, the plaintiff's attorneys focused on the exception for negligent entrustment claims.  Negligent entrustment is a longstanding and widely recognized type of tort claim, covering situations where the defendant provides a dangerous instrument to a person despite knowing or having reason to know the person cannot be trusted with the instrument and is likely to cause harm to others.  For example, the owner of an automobile could be negligent for allowing it to be used by a terribly dangerous driver. </p>

<p>The Missouri case seemed like a good fit for the negligent entrustment exception, for the store allegedly provided a gun to Weathers despite knowing or having reason to know she should not be trusted with it. Precedent in Missouri was not favorable for the plaintiff's side, however, for some past court decisions in Missouri had suggested that liability for negligent entrustment does not exist if one sells or otherwise transfers ownership of an item, rather than merely allowing the dangerous person to temporarily use it. In other words, liability could exist if one lends a car to a horribly dangerous driver, but not if one sells the car to that person.</p>

<p>Based on those precedents, the trial court dismissed the case. The <a href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=99377">Supreme Court of Missouri</a> reversed, overruling the past cases and recognizing that negligent entrustment can apply where an item is purchased by a dangerous person rather than just temporarily borrowed.</p>

<p>With the claim revived by that legal victory, the case moved forward until the gun store recently agreed to pay $2.2 million to settle it. The settlement demonstrates how even after the enactment of the federal preemption statute, tort litigation remains a potent tool for ensuring that gun dealers conduct business with reasonable care.</p>

<p>But, while the case shows how those who sell guns at the retail level face a substantial risk of liability for careless practices, the federal law continues to give gun manufacturers a broad and unwarranted exemption from legal responsibility for their actions.  Since manufacturers sell through distributors and dealers, rather than directly through the public, they have had a hard time convincing courts that any of the federal preemption statute's exceptions should apply.</p>

<p>A lawsuit brought by families of the Newtown shooting victims provides a striking example. Four years ago, a disturbed young man used an AR-15 style rifle when he murdered twenty children and six staff members at <a href="http://sandyhook.newtown.schooldesk.net/">Sandy Hook Elementary School</a> in <a href="http://www.newtown-ct.gov/Public_Documents/index">Newtown, Connecticut</a>.  Families of the victims <a href="http://www.koskoff.com/In-the-News/Sandy-Hook-Families-Complaint.pdf">sued </a> [PDF] the manufacturer of that rifle, as well as the wholesale distributor and retail dealer who sold it. This fall, a Connecticut judge <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/15/nyregion/judge-dismisses-suit-against-gun-maker-by-newtown-victims-families.html?_r=0">dismissed </a>the case against the manufacturer, concluding that the case could not fit within the negligent entrustment exception or any of the other exceptions provided under the federal immunity statute.</p>

<p><a href="https://jud.ct.gov/supremecourt/">The Connecticut Supreme Court</a> will hear an <a href="http://www.koskoff.com/Sandy-Hook-Gun-Case-News/Conn-Supreme-Court-to-Hear-Sandy-Hook-Lawsuit-Against-Gun-Makers.shtml">appeal </a>of that ruling. If they do not reverse it, the case will serve as another example of how the federal immunity statute remains an unfortunate obstacle for those seeking to hold gun-makers accountable under normal principles of tort law. If the manufacturer of the rifle acted negligently, it should be responsible for the harm caused by that negligence. If it did not act negligently, it should prevail in the case on that basis, not because of a special immunity from tort law bestowed on one industry by Congress.</p>
