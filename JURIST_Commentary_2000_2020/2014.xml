		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Abbey Marr, <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/">Harvard Law School</a>, Class of 2014, discusses how Texas has placed undue burdens on women seeking abortions...<hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Marr.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Marr.jpg" width="180" height="146" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n April 12, 2011, I was working as a case manager at the DC Abortion Fund when we received an urgent call from a clinic. Congress had reinstated its ban on Washington, DC using its funds to cover abortion as a part of its Medicaid program. Twenty-eight women scheduled for procedures the next day were in danger of being turned away. Now, women across Texas could face the same fate.</p>

<p>On November 1, about one-third of Texas abortion clinics &#8212; the majority of them in rural areas &#8212; were forced to start turning women away. Most of these clinics will likely have to close, ending their provision of other necessary health services. Some women are now risking their health by crossing the Mexican border or buying abortifacient drugs at flea markets. This is a result of <a href="http://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/id/870667">HB2</a>, the extreme state statute that passed in a second special session called by Governor Rick Perry, after the first special session ended in a 13 hour filibuster by Texas Senator Wendy Davis. Among other restrictions, HB2 requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles &#8212; a costly, unnecessary and unrealistic requirement.</p>

<p>Originally, District Court Judge Lee Yeakel <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Cases/13cv862_Opinion.pdf">enjoined</a> [PDF] this law, finding that the requirement placed a substantial obstacle in the way of access to abortion for women with nonviable fetuses and had no "rational basis" in a state interest. But the US District Court for the Fifth Circuit disagreed, in a decision upheld by the US Supreme Court. The circuit court and the US Supreme Court's conservative majorities focused on the first two prongs of the emergency stay standard: whether the state was likely to prevail on the merits of the underlying case and whether the state would be irreparably harmed. Justice Scalia, for the majority, seemed to care deeply about the supposed "irreparable injury" of an injunction of HB2 to the state of Texas. On the other hand, he disdained having to discuss at all the third prong, concerning harm to "third parties," i.e. the women of Texas, which would result from the allowing the law to go into effect. For those of us who believe people should have access to the full range of health care that they need, this is heartbreaking. But the legal fight over HB2 also has broader implications &#8212; everyone who wants the judiciary to consider and understand the effects of its decisions on actual people should be angry.<br />
	<br />
Abortion jurisprudence is a politically messy example of the failure of courts to consider the effect of the law on people's lives. This stems in large part from the evolution of the "undue burden standard" developed by the Supreme Court in 1992's <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&q=planned+parenthood+v+casey&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>. Rejecting <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673&q=roe+v+wade&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Roe v. Wade</a>'s framework, the court stated that restrictions on abortion were unconstitutional if they posed an "undue burden"; that is, they had the "purpose or effect [of placing] a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability." That text could be read as protective of abortion access, but the court dismissed that reading quickly by approving requirements that force doctors to read specific scripts to patients, women to wait 24 hours before obtaining abortions and minors to get parental permission. The <span class="casename">Casey</span> court was unwilling to examine either the District Court's factual record or the extensive social science documenting the burdens caused by the parental consent requirement. </p>

<p>In the years since, the Supreme Court has rarely revisited this standard. Meanwhile, state legislatures have been busy. In 2011 alone, states passed 135 <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2014/01/02/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Guttmacher+(New+from+the+Guttmacher+Institute)">provisions</a> restricting abortion access. In analyzing these new restrictions, lower courts have echoed the Supreme Court's callousness on this issue. Applying the undue burden standard, courts often look only to the law in a vacuum, ignoring how the law interacts with the myriad of other restrictions in place. Many courts have interpreted the standard to require near-certainty that restrictions not necessarily yet in effect will impose a burden on women, while also refusing to acknowledge testimony about how the new restrictions would burden women or how these restrictions would affect poor or rural women drastically. For example, the Eighth Circuit has <a href="http://media.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/08/06/053093P.pdf">interpreted</a> [PDF] the undue burden standard to require that doctors lie to their patients by reading scripts which contain the false information that abortion is linked to breast cancer and increased risk of suicide.</p>

<p>The courts' treatments of abortion restrictions is a symptom of a legal regime that allows judges to ignore the real-life consequences of the law, mirroring the courts' refusals to consider the real world effects of regulation in other areas, like the Supreme Court's treatment of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act</a> in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4053797526279899410&q=shelby+county+v+holder&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Shelby County v. Holder</a>, eliminating the key parts of the Voting Rights Act due to changed circumstances, but ignoring the fact that many of those "changed circumstances" depended at least partially on the continued efficacy of the Voting Rights Act's success. Undeniably, the courts' application of the undue burden standard is a function of ideology: the federal bench has trended more and more conservative in recent years. This makes judges less likely to favor abortion rights substantively. But, conveniently in line with these substantive beliefs, it also means that judges are more likely to follow Justice Scalia's strong textualist, originalist bent. They are less willing to analyze a law in its larger context, to adjust their thinking based on the reality of the law's effects. Outside of law schools and courtrooms, it's rare that one believes that judges should ignore the real consequences of their decisions in this way. It creates bad law and walks back the benefits of good law. The abortion rights context shows this clearly.</p>

<p>The conservative Fifth Circuit heard arguments on the merits of the Texas case this past Monday, January 13. Following the Circuit's previous application of the undue burden standard, I am not optimistic about the outcome. The appeals court already indicated that they believe the state is likely to succeed on the merits in their emergency stay decision. If they decide HB2 passes constitutional muster, they will be saying that a law that shutters one-third of Texas abortion clinics and sends women to the black market or across the border does not place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability. That's preposterous. However, this could be a time where the Fifth Circuit, and perhaps eventually the Supreme Court, chooses to draw a line in the sand. This time, the courts could look to reality and recognize HB2 for what it is: a law that creates an unconstitutional, undue burden to a woman's right to access abortion. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://epic.org/epic/staff_and_board.html">Khaliah Barnes</a> of the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> argues that federal agencies' data collection and disclosure activities are marred by a deficiency of meaningful oversight and accountability...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/khaliahbarnes.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n 2013, the world became privy to unparalleled, covert US government digital surveillance. A 2013 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/nsa/Section-215-Order-to-Verizon.pdf">order</a> (PDF) shows that the National Security Agency (NSA) <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/us-releases-documents-on-nsa-surveillance-origins.php">obtained</a> sensitive call record information of millions of Americans. Previously unreleased government PowerPoint <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/">slides</a> expose a maze of government information collection and disclosure. There have been <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/nsa/in-re-epic/">numerous</a> legal <a href="https://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-v-clapper-challenge-nsa-mass-phone-call-tracking">challenges</a> to the NSA's clandestine data collection.</p>

                <p>While the NSA revelations have spurned <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=0c23b88fc3b21bc51f6445cd14baddfe">public</a> <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=0d93f03188977d0d41065d3fa041decd">debate</a> on the importance of government surveillance transparency, oversight and accountability, government agencies routinely publish their surveillance procedures and practices as required by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552a">Privacy Act of 1974</a>. The Privacy Act is a cornerstone of American privacy law. The Privacy Act grants individuals certain rights&#8212;like access to and amendment of their records held by government agencies. It also details how federal agencies and government contractors entrusted with personal records must protect that information from unauthorized disclosure. Privacy Act protections extend to "records" held within a database or "system of records." The statute broadly defines "record" as "any item, collection or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency" and that contains personally identifiable information (PII). A "system of records" is a group of records over which an agency has control and can retrieve information by individual name or other PII. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1/subpart-C/appendix-B">Federal tax returns</a> held by the IRS, <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-09-27/pdf/2010-24162.pdf">student loan information</a> [PDF] processed by the Education Department and <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/foia/bluebook/60-0044.htm">medical information</a> collected by the Social Security Administration are each examples of personal records within systems of records that the Privacy Act protects. </p>

                <p>The Privacy Act requires federal agencies to obtain consent before releasing personal records from government databases. The statute does, however, provide various exceptions under which agencies may disclose records without first obtaining consent. For example, agencies may disclose records pursuant to a "routine use"&#8212;a disclosure "compatible with the purpose" for which the information was collected. Agencies may also disclose PII to agency employees and contractors who need the PII to perform their jobs, pursuant to a court order or in response to a "showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual."</p>

                <p>The Privacy Act imposes civil and criminal liability on agencies, agency employees and contractors for Privacy Act violations, including unauthorized disclosures. Nevertheless, agencies may promulgate rules exempting themselves from Privacy Act requirements, like requirements that agencies permit individuals to correct inaccurate information, or the requirement that agencies collect information directly from an individual when the information could adversely affect the individual's "rights, benefits and privileges under Federal programs."</p>

                <p>Over the last several years, government agencies have increasingly contravened the intent, purpose and plain language of the Privacy Act by collecting excessive information for nebulous purposes, widely disclosing this information to public and private entities and claiming broad Privacy Act exemptions.</p>

                <p>For example, in 2012 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced a new sweeping database, aptly entitled the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-07-10/pdf/2012-16823.pdf">FBI Data Warehouse System</a> [PDF]. The FBI Data Warehouse collects sensitive information, including but not limited to name, sex, race, Social Security Number, biometric information, bank account number, employment information and known associates and affiliations. The FBI gathers this information from a variety of sources including other FBI systems, the Internet and other government agencies like the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security. The FBI Data Warehouse applies to an extensive swath of individuals, from suspects, victims and witnesses to "individuals who are identified in open source information or commercial databases" and individuals "who may be relevant" to an investigation or operation. </p>

                <p>The FBI states that any of the sensitive information may be disclosed to a variety of public and private individuals and entities, ranging from law enforcement (local, state, federal, territorial, tribal, foreign and international law enforcement), to members of Congress, to commercial entities that are "joint participants" with the FBI and to any other person or entity DOJ deems "necessary" in assisting DOJ perform "law enforcement, national security or intelligence function[s]."</p>

                <p>Even though the FBI stores troves of information in its Data Warehouse System, the FBI <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-10-09/pdf/2012-24753.pdf">denies</a> [PDF]. individuals various Privacy Act protections. The Attorney General has exempted the FBI Data Warehouse from fundamental Privacy Act requirements, including the requirement that the FBI only maintain relevant, necessary, accurate, timely and complete records. Practically speaking, the FBI can maintain inaccurate, outdated and incomplete records in its Data Warehouse and disclose those records to various private and public entities, including all levels of law enforcement. And because the FBI has exempted this database from the Privacy Act's civil remedies provision, the FBI is not accountable to individuals on which it maintains erroneous and flawed records. </p>

                <p>Similar in scope to the FBI Data Warehouse is the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-22/pdf/2012-12396.pdf">Automated Targeting System</a> (ATS) (PDF). Initially designed to screen international cargo, DHS has expanded ATS to <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_pia_cbp_ats006b.pdf">screen and assign risk assessments to individuals</a> (PDF). The ATS database "ingests" personally identifiable information from at least thirty federal databases and the Department of Motor Vehicles. DHS then matches this information against "patterns of suspicious activity" and uses these matches to monitor individuals, even if the individuals have no criminal record. ATS amasses PII ranging from names, addresses and Social Security Numbers, to "information that could directly indicate the racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health or sex life" of individuals. The database applies broadly to individuals that "seek to, or do in fact, enter, exit or transit through the US," and those who "may pose a threat to the US," among others.</p>

                <p>As with the FBI Data Warehouse, DHS discloses PII within ATS to a host of public and private entities and individuals, including to local, tribal, state, federal and foreign organizations and to "the news media and the public, with the approval of the Chief Privacy Officer in consultation with counsel ... when disclosure is necessary to preserve confidence in the integrity of DHS ..." DHS has <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-23/pdf/2012-12395.pdf">proposed</a> [PDF] to exempt this database from Privacy Act provisions that would permit individuals to access and correct inaccurate information. DHS has also proposed to exempt ATS from the Privacy Act's civil remedies provisions. My organization, the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC), has repeatedly <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/travel/ats/EPIC-ATS-Comments-2012.pdf">urged</a> (PDF) DHS to <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/travel/ats/epic_090507.pdf">suspend</a> (PDF) ATS data collection and <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/pdf/ats_comments.pdf">restore</a> (PDF) Privacy Act protections for PII within the database. </p>

                <p>The Department of Defense (DOD) maintains a large database on a particularly vulnerable subsection of the population&#8212;high school and college students. DOD uses its <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-12-22/pdf/2011-32783.pdf">Joint Advertising Market Research and Studies Recruiting Database</a> (JAMRS) (PDF) to market to and recruit teens between the ages of 16 and 18 and college students, among others. JAMRS contains information including name, gender, address, birth date, telephone number, ethnicity, grade point average, high school name and graduation date, college name and rank and fields of study. Unlike the FBI Data Warehouse and DHS's ATS, DOD does not exempt this system from the Privacy Act. However, the system still poses substantial risk to student privacy because Epsilon Marketing, a firm that <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704587004576245131531712342">experienced a security breach in 2011</a>, houses the system. Moreover, DOD has compiled this information without express student consent. DOD explains that if students want to be removed from the system, they must opt-out of having their information disclosed to Epsilon Marketing. </p>

                <p>The FBI, DHS, and DOD each state that pursuant to litigation proceedings, they will disclose records held in their databases to the DOJ. The Privacy Act, however, sets a higher bar and requires these agencies to obtain a court order to disclose records during litigation proceedings. Therefore, these agencies violate the Privacy Act by disclosing personal records to the DOJ (or any other entity or individual) during court proceedings without first obtaining a court order. Additionally, the Privacy Act permits federal agencies to disclose records to other US agencies or instrumentalities for civil and criminal law enforcement activities, but only pursuant to a written request from the head of the requesting agency, and that request must specify "the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought." Again, the Privacy Act explicitly constrains government information disclosures. And again, DOD and DHS have adopted lower standards. Both DHS and DOD will disclose PII to agencies investigating, prosecuting, and enforcing civil and criminal laws without a written request from the leader of the agency seeking the record.</p>

                <p>The aforementioned databases are just three examples out of many where government agencies collect sensitive personal information without adequately safeguarding privacy. Unlike the NSA, these agencies have been somewhat transparent in their data collection and disclosure, but they too suffer the same deficiency of meaningful oversight and accountability. These agencies publish and consider public comment on their databases, which is a good  first &#8212; and in fact, legally required&#8212;step in protecting privacy. However, more must be done. The Senate and House committees in charge of these agencies must investigate these practices and work to restore Privacy Act protections. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a federal government watchdog agency, must closely review federal databases and make recommendations on how they can safeguard privacy. And finally, agency chief privacy officers (CPOs) must take a more active role in reviewing and approving information collection. In many ways, agency CPOs are one of the last resorts the public has in stopping invasive government surveillance. Accordingly, CPOs should not simply rubberstamp proposed database collections, but rather should closely evaluate the legality and public policy behind agency proposals. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Noeli Serna, <a href="http://www.kentlaw.iit.edu">Chicago-Kent College of Law</a> Class of 2016, discusses the city of Chicago's new driver's license policy and the extent to which states can implement their own immigration laws in accordance with federal immigration laws...<hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Serna.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Serna.jpg" width="129" height="213" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he influence and power of local and state government control regarding federal immigration issues has been at the forefront of American policy in recent years. Immigration has been a central federal political issue, and many policy decisions have spurred national news coverage and discussion. In the city of Chicago, a new driver's license <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/illinois-governor-signs-bill-allowing-illegal-immigrant-drivers-licenses.php">policy</a> has created such attention. On January 27, 2013, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn signed into law <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/97/SB/PDF/09700SB0957lv.pdf">SB 0957</a> [PDF], which allows undocumented (non-visa status) individuals to obtain an Illinois Temporary Visitor Driver's License (TDVL) in one of 25 Illinois Secretary of State facilities. </p>

<p>In order <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-10-29/news/chi-illinois-illegal-immigrants-can-apply-for-drivers-licenses-in-december-20131029_1_temporary-visitor-driver-standard-licenses-issuing-driver">to obtain a TVDL</a>, "applicants must prove they have lived in Illinois for at least a year and show they are ineligible for a Social Security card. Documents that will be accepted include a copy of a lease, utility bills and a valid passport or consular identification card." Applicants must also pass a vision and road test. The licenses expire in three years and are renewable upon expiration. The TVDLs cannot be used as proof of identification. </p>

<p>The TVDLs are distinguishable from a state issued driver's license in a multitude of ways. Instead of a red band across the top of the license, the TVDLs have a <a href="http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/drivers/TVDL/home.html">purple band</a>. Holders of the TVDL will be unable to use the license as a form of identification necessary to board a plane, vote or purchase a gun. Proponents of the TVDL, such as Illinois Senate President John Cullerton, have <a href="http://www.kljb.com/story/23824784/illinois-prepares-to-issue-drivers-licenses-to-illegal-immigrants">emphasized</a> that illegal immigrants are driving without a license every day in order to go to work. TVDLs will help make the roads safer because now more drivers will carry insurance and will have passed driving tests. As a result, drivers will know the rules of the road, and drivers will likely not flee after an accident due to a lack of insurance.</p>

<p>TVDLs offer undocumented immigrants the opportunity to receive a driver's license and avoid a charge for driving without a license. Even so, undocumented immigrants also question whether the TVDLs make them a <a href="http://icirr.org/content/what-new-driver%E2%80%99s-license-law-means-sb-957">target</a> for immigrant status questioning and possible deportation. Most websites that explain the application process to obtain a TVDL emphasize, in their FAQ sections, that no one will know that a TVDL holder is an undocumented individual because the TVDLs are also issued to visa holders (students, workers, etc.) who are unable to receive social security numbers. As a result, state law enforcement officials <a href="http://mikebakerlaw.com/blog/2013/10/26/update-new-illinois-temporary-visitor-drivers-license-tvdl/">cannot assume</a> that an individual with a TVDL is undocumented. </p>

<p>Undocumented individuals are nonetheless concerned about potential deportation with the introduction of the TVDLs. US Supreme Court cases, such as <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15661608482215594777">Hines v. Davidowitz</a>, have held that the power to regulate immigration is exclusively a federal power. The federal government, as a result, establishes the conditions regarding who can or cannot enter the country and the conditions under which these individuals can remain in the country. States nonetheless have recently spurred political and legal discussions regarding the extent to which states can implement their own immigration laws in accordance with federal immigration laws. </p>

<p>The US has recently seen a trend of anti-immigrant state laws and provisions. The <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">most famous</a> of these state regulations is Arizona's <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">SB 1070</a> [PDF]. In June 2012, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-partially-strikes-down-arizona-immigration-law-but-upholds-controversial-section.php">upheld</a> SB 1070's provision section 2(B), allowing Arizona law enforcement officials to conduct immigrant status checks during law enforcement stops, commonly known as the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-rules-on-arizona-immigration-law/2012/06/25/gJQA0Nrm1V_story.html?hpid=z1">"show me your papers"</a> provision. However, the Supreme Court rejected three additional provisions of SB 1070 as unconstitutional. The three provisions included misdemeanor charges against immigrants not carrying registration documents, criminalizing any illegal immigrant's act of seeking employment or authorizing state enforcement personnel to arrest an individual for a suspected offense that made him or her deportable. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/us/28legal.html?_r=2&">central constitutional question</a> that surrounds state regulations and laws such as Arizona's SB 1070 revolve around the issue of concurrent enforcement. According to Kris Kobach, a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, concurrent enforcement is "whether the state law parallels federal law without conflict."</p>

<p>According to Melissa Keaney and Alvaro Huerta's <a href="http://lawpolicyjournal.law.wfu.edu/files/2013/06/Vol.3-2-Article-Keaney-Huerta.pdf">legal article</a> [PDF], states such as Arizona argued that "requiring their officers to verify the immigration status of individuals who had been lawfully stopped was also permissible under the state's authority to concurrently enforce federal law and fell under the meaning of "cooperation" encouraged by the INA [<a href="http://www.uscis.gov/laws/act">Immigration and Nationality Act</a>]." </p>

<p>In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17891750818453472454">Arizona v. United States</a>, Supreme Court built three limitations into the provision: (1) a presumption that the individual is lawfully present if he or she presents a valid Arizona driver's license or similar identification; (2) a prohibition on the use of "race, color, or national origin ... except to the extent permitted by the United States [and] Arizona Constitution[s]"; and (3) a requirement that Section 2(B) be "implemented in a manner consistent with federal law regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting the privileges and immunities of United States citizens."</p>

<p>When undocumented immigrants, in states such as Illinois, read and learned about state provisions such as 2(B) of SB 1070, their suspicion toward new laws such as Illinois' TVDL initiative are warranted. When news spread that a section of Arizona's SB 1070 was upheld by the US Supreme Court, especially the section dealing with a law enforcement official's permission to verify a driver's legal status, the news was a resounding blow to an undocumented individual's security behind the wheel. Furthermore, with the implementation of the TVDLs and the distinguishable purple band across the top of the license, undocumented individuals have reason to suspect that the TVDLs are only a new method for Illinois law officials to investigate an individual's immigrant status during a pull over. </p>

<p>Limitation 1 of Arizona's section 2(B) of SB 1070, though, is a persuasive tool for proponents of Illionis' TVDL initiative. Since Illinois TVDLs do not specify whether or not the possessor is a valid visa-holder, the law enforcement official will likely presume the driver's visa-holding status and refrain from asking further questions. Furthermore, there are public policy arguments against requiring police to question individuals about their immigration status. For example, one argument is that "reporting immigrant status to federal authorities damages the trust between immigrant communities and the police, trust which law enforcement agencies rely on for effective policing." Moreover, anti-immigrant <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/report/2011/07/05/9952/your-state-cant-afford-it/">policies</a> can create great financial costs to state and local budgets. States can spend <a href="http://coloradoimmigrant.org/downloads/CO%20FISCAL%20INSTITUTE%20SB%2090%20REPORT%20DECEMBER%202012.pdf">millions</a> [PDF] of dollars in reporting individuals suspected of being undocumented to federal authorities. </p>

<p>As a result, it is likely that trends in state-implemented anti-immigration laws such as Arizona's SB 1070 pose little threat to proponents of Illinois' TVDL initiative. Additionally, undocumented Illinois drivers should freely and confidently make an appointment to apply for an Illinois Temporary Visitor Driver's License.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Laura Gallagher, <a href="http://www.law.ucdavis.edu">University of California, Davis School of Law</a> Class of 2014, discusses the complexity resulting from the American Airlines-US Airways merger and argues that the nature of the airline industry makes it desirable for large airlines to merge without raising serious monopoly concerns...<hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Gallagher.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Gallagher.jpg" width="129" height="213" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>N</strong></font>early ten months after American Airlines and US Airways first announced their plans to merge and form the world's largest airline, AMR Corporation (the holding company for American and other airlines) announced the completion of the merger. In a <a href="http://newamericanarriving.com/news-and-updates/amr-corporation-and-us-airways-group-come-together-to-build-the-new-america">press release</a>, AMR stated that it officially combined with US Airways Group, Inc. to form American Airlines Group Inc. ("New American"). While investors, employees, and customers of the airlines hope that New American will have the "scale, breadth and capabilities to compete more effectively and profitably in the global marketplace," it is this anticipated competitive advantage which has subjected the companies to two <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-antitrust-officials-challenge-airline-merger.php">lawsuits</a> since last February, one by the Department of Justice and another by private parties. </p>

<p>The complications resulting from the proposed merger expose the complexity and opaqueness of federal antitrust regulations, particularly as applied to a deregulated industry such as air travel. During the 1950s and 1960s, as airline travel boomed, the federal government <a href="http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/1998/4/airline2-98.pdf">attempted to regulate the industry</a> [PDF] as it had regulated similar high-investment, monopolistic industries such as railroads and public utilities. Economists' concerns about inefficient government regulation and higher costs, however, resulted in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/41713">Airline Deregulation Act of 1978</a>. Legislators hoped that deregulating the airline industry would increase competition, lower prices, improve customer service and allow more Americans access to air travel. While the act debatably accomplished these goals, it also led to a period of extreme financial instability, volatility and inefficiency for airlines and their customers, employees and investors. Over the past decade, nine major airlines have consolidated via acquisitions and mergers into four airlines out of business necessity, recreating <em>de facto</em> the big multiplayer system of the regulated period. While the Department of Justice (DOJ) made a number of persuasive <a href="http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2013/299960.pdf">antitrust arguments</a> [PDF] in its case against the American Airlines merger, I argue that the nature of the airline industry, including the high entry costs, economies of scale, and elasticity of demand, makes it possible and even desirable for large airlines to merge and compete with other large airlines without raising serious monopoly concerns. </p>

<p>AMR filed for bankruptcy reorganization in November 2011 in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York when the <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/american-and-us-airways-said-to-vote-for-merger/?_r=0">merger was announced</a>. Since filing for bankruptcy, AMR successfully implemented a number of programs to revitalize the company and regain competitiveness in the air travel market. By 2013, both American Airlines and US Airways recognized AMR's progress and conceded that while the merger would be good for business, it was not a step necessary for the survival of either company. The proposed merger would combine the two airlines under US Airways leadership but assume the American Airlines brand name. </p>

<p>On August 13, 2013, the DOJ and several state attorneys general <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/airlinescomplaint0813.pdf">filed a complaint</a> [PDF] in the US District Court for the District of Columbia to block the proposed merger. The government determined that consolidation of the two airlines would reduce competition and force consumers to pay higher fares and settle for fewer options in air travel. Without the competition between American Airlines and US Airways, the market would be dominated by only three large carriers (United, Delta and the New American), which the DOJ complaint argued would "cooperate, rather than compete, on price and service." The monopoly would be especially apparent at Washington Reagan National Airport, where New American would control 69 percent of take-off and landing slots and 63 percent of the nonstop routes.</p>

<p>The major issue of law and fact in this controversy, the merger's potential to create a monopoly and lessen competition, stems from the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/18">Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914</a>.  Section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits, in certain cases, a corporation's acquisition of stock in another corporation where "the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly." Because Section 7 is preventative and not remedial, the government need only establish a "reasonable probability" that the anticipated harm to competition will occur should the merger take place. Courts have interpreted the statutory term "lessen," not as a diminution of existing competition, but as preventative of <em>increasing</em> competition. Thus, the government shouldered the burden of establishing a reasonable probability that the proposed merger would substantially prevent the increase of competition in the air travel industry. In their amended complaint, the government argued that the increased market concentration due to the reduction in the number of major airlines would cause <a href="<http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2684&context=wmlr>">Section 7 harm</a>, as "the more concentrated a market, and the more a transaction would increase concentration in a market, the more likely it is that a transaction would result in in a meaningful reduction in competition." The government requested an injunction against the two airlines. </p>

<p>AMR, represented by Jones Day, and US Airways, represented by O'Melveny & Myers, defended the merger as necessary to allow the airlines to remain competitive in the rapidly changing air travel industry. Citing $14 billion in losses over the last 12 years by the two airlines, two bankruptcies by US Airways and the current bankruptcy of American Airlines, the defendants asserted that the merger was crucial to their future viability as a business. The volatility, economies of scale and enormous asset investments of the airline industry necessitate consolidation to prevent wasteful and inefficient business practices, which lead to bankruptcies and hurt investors, employees and consumers. The airlines also claimed that the merger would benefit consumers by providing expanded flight options and benefit airline employees with improved pay and job stability. </p>

<p>The government submitted a <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/american-airlines-us-airways-settle-doj-antitrust-suit.php">proposed final judgment</a> on November 12, 2013, which would allow the merger with certain conditions to "remedy the harm to competition that was likely to result from the proposed merger." The settlement requires New American to sell 104 carrier slots at Reagan National, 34 slots at New York's LaGuardia Airport and rights to some other slots at various other airports. The parties agreed that the transfer of those slots would strengthen other airlines' capacity and incentive to compete with New American. New American is prohibited from reacquiring ownership in the slots during the term of the final judgment and must notify the DOJ if they intend to acquire any slots at Reagan National in the future. <br />
	<br />
After the settlement of the DOJ lawsuit, the US Bankruptcy Court judge approved the merger. Another challenge to the merger by private airline passenger plaintiffs <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/supreme-court-justice-denies-application-staying-airline-merger.php">failed to halt</a> the integration of the two corporations. The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303560204579247953849152692">future looks bright</a> for New American: shares of the combined company rose 2.7 percent on their first day of trading on the NASDAQ and the two-year integration plan promises to repay AMR's creditors and provide stability for consumers, employees and investors. </p>

<p>However, there are several lessons that attorneys can draw from the short-lived American airlines litigation. Anti-competition concerns with regard to airline conglomerates may be inappropriate so long as there remain at least three major competitors in the field (United, Delta, and New American). While concerns about collusion between the major airlines may be valid, the success of smaller alternative airlines, such as Southwest, show that newer and more streamlined companies can still enter and compete in the market. Competitors such as Southwest keep the big three major airline conglomerates from hurting consumers by unreasonably raising ticket prices or reducing services provided. Finally, opponents of the merger should keep in mind that all US-owned airlines (Delta, United, New American, and others) not only compete with one another for domestic flights, but also with international airline companies for transnational flights. Denying homegrown airlines the ability to act in the best interests of their business and expand cripples their competitiveness with foreign airlines and hurts long-term US world market participation. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Linda Schlueter of <a href="http://www.http://trinitylegalcenter.org/.com/en/">Trinity Legal Center</a> discusses the recent dismissal of <em>certiorari</em> in <span class="casename">Cline v. Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice</span>...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/lindaschlueter.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>B</strong></font>efore surgery, would a patient want to know what to expect and what the risks of the procedure are? Of course. Would a patient want a medication that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and prescribed within its guidelines? Of course. Women considering a medical abortion such as RU-486 should be entitled to accurate and truthful information concerning this procedure.</p>

                <p>Medical abortions are on the rise and abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood state they will make greater use of it. However, abortion providers are not following <a href="http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/postmarketdrugsafetyinformationforpatientsandproviders/ucm111323.htm">FDA guidelines</a> and are prescribing an off-label use of RU-486. Off-label use means the FDA guidelines are not followed which require: (1) use of RU-486 for only up to seven weeks of pregnancy; (2) physicians must personally administer each of the two doses at the facility; and, (3) physicians must provide backup medical care for complications. In addition, abortion providers are minimizing what a woman will experience after taking the drug.  </p>

                <p>After examining the scientific evidence, the Oklahoma legislature enacted <a href="http://openstates.org/ok/bills/2011-2012/HB1970/">House Bill 1970</a> and banned the off-label use of RU-486 to protect women. The <a href="http://ocrj.org/">Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice</a> filed suit to stop the implementation of the law. The district court held the law was unconstitutional and issued a permanent injunction. The Oklahoma Supreme Court summarily <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Cline+v.+Oklahoma+Coalition+for+Reproductive+Justice&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=16308119139216652403&scilh=0">stated</a> that the law was unconstitutional based on <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16751435511744054509">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>; however, it did not provide any explanation or analysis.  </p>

                <p>A petition for <em>certiorari</em> was filed at the US Supreme Court, and several <em>amicus</em> briefs were also filed including one representing women and families hurt by RU-486. In June, the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Cline+v.+Oklahoma+Coalition+for+Reproductive+Justice&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=16308119139216652403&scilh=0">petition for certiorari</a> was granted and two questions were certified to Oklahoma Supreme Court. The questions were whether the bill prohibits: (1) the use of misoprostol to induce abortions, including the its use as approved by the Food and Drug Administration and (2) the use of methotrexate to treat ectopic pregnancies. The Oklahoma Supreme Court answered both questions in the affirmative using the plain language of the statute and rejecting the restrictions on medical discretion of physicians.</p>

                <p>On October 29th, the US Supreme Court dismissed the writ of <em>certiorari</em> as improvidently granted. But, this may not be the end of the story as the Oklahoma Legislature will probably take up the issue in February 2014 and any subsequent legislation will likely be challenged.</p>

                <p>The term "medical" abortion sounds safe and harmless, but can have serious negative physical and psychological consequences. This commentary will discuss two issues. First, the state has the right to provide reasonable regulations for the health and safety of women. Second, medical abortions expose women to increased risks of physical and psychological harm.  </p>

                <p><strong>Reasonable Regulations</strong></p>

                <p>The US Supreme Court recognized in <span class="casename">Casey</span> that because the state has a substantial interest in the life of the unborn child, the state may promulgate regulations that do not create an undue burden on the woman's right to decide, particularly regulations that are "designed to foster the health of a woman seeking an abortion." The court noted that this was true as with any medical procedure. </p>

                <p>Furthermore, the Supreme Court upheld abortion regulations that "are not efforts to sway or direct a woman's choice, but rather are efforts to enhance the deliberative quality of that decision or are neutral regulations on the health aspects of her decision In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18188115444576506403">Planned Parenthood v. DeWine</a>, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that there was no evidence that an Ohio statute that paralleled Oklahoma's law would impose an undue burden on a woman's ability to decide, and therefore, was constitutional. Unlike the Sixth Circuit's detailed analysis, the Oklahoma Supreme Court summarily concluded that the Oklahoma provision was unconstitutional without analysis or explanation. </p>

                <p>As long as there is a "commonly used and generally accepted method" of abortion, there is not a "substantial obstacle to the abortion right." The US Supreme Court stated in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7079370668659431881">Gonzales v. Carhart</a>: that "mere convenience" is not sufficient to overcome the regulation and the State can ban some procedures that have different risks than other procedures.</p>

                <p>The RU-486 regimen poses a substantial risk to the physical health of women, including the risk of death. Both the <a href="http://old.usccb.org/prolife/issues/ru486/SouderStaffReportonRU-486.pdf">FDA</a> (PDF) and <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2000/20687lbl.htm">Danco</a>, the drug manufacturer, have acknowledged that RU-486 poses health risks for women. The Congressional Staff Report on RU-486 cited FDA findings concerning the physical risks to women taking the RU-486 regimen. The FDA's Medical Officer's review indicated that, "[m]ore than one adverse event was reported for most patients ... Approximately [twenty-three percent] of the adverse events in each gestational age group were judged to be severe." The report calls these "startling adverse effects," which the FDA knew during the RU-486 NDA review process.</p>

                <p>Also of concern was "the incredibly high failure rate of the drug." The report concluded: "By any objective standard, a failure rate approaching eight percent and requiring subsequent surgical intervention as the 'best' outcome is a dismal result." </p>

                <p>In 2011, the FDA issued a <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/UCM263353.pdf">report</a> (PDF) on the post-marketing events of RU-486. The FDA reported that there were 2,207 adverse complications in the United States related to the use of RU-486, including hemorrhaging, blood loss requiring transfusions, serious infections, and death. Among the 2,207 adverse events were fourteen deaths, 612 hospitalizations, 339 blood transfusions, and 256 infections (including 48 "severe infections").</p>

                <p>In accordance with the US Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="casename">Casey</span> and <span class="casename">Gonzales</span>, providing for the safety of drugs and medical procedures are within the legitimate function of the state. Women deserve to know the risks of a medical abortion. </p>

                <p><strong>Increased Risks of Physical and Psychological Harm</strong></p>

                <p>In <span class="casename">Casey</span>, the Supreme Court emphasized the need for a woman to have full, accurate, and truthful information so that she could make an informed decision. Off-label use of RU-486 regimen misleads women into thinking that it is safe and approved by the FDA.  </p>

                <p>In 2006, the Oklahoma State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision produced the <a href="http://www.awomansright.org/pdf/AWRTK_Booklet-English-sm.pdf">Woman's Right to Know Booklet</a> (PDF) to provide women accurate and truthful information. The booklet discusses the RU-486 procedure and side effects. More scientific information is available on the risks and side effects of the RU-486 regimen and that those risks are greater than with surgical abortion. </p>

                <p>Researchers have <a href="http://rachelnetwork.org/images/Medical_Abortion_with_Mifepristone.pdf">concluded</a> (PDF) that there are increased risks of physical problems with the RU-486 regimen including: more pain, more nausea or vomiting, higher failure rate, greater risks of acute bleeding requiring surgery, post-procedure bleeding continues for a longer period of time, more women require surgery for persistent bleeding, more total blood loss, and greater risk of massive, life-threatening hemorrhage. They also report that "mifepristone abortion has 10 times more risk of death from infection than surgical abortion and 50 times more risk of death from infection compared to childbirth."</p>

                <p>The risks of RU-486 may also be trans-generational. Dr. Bernard Nathanson, co-founder of the <a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/index-splash.html">National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws</a> (NARAL) and who presided over 60,000 abortions, Dr. Nathanson <a href="http://www.silentscream.org/ru486-drnat.htm">warned</a> there may be the possibility that disorders could be passed down to surviving offspring of women who have taken the drug. "RU-486 is the drug which acts on the female reproductive system, and anything that does that we have to be keenly aware of what are called trans-generational effects." In addition, he warned that if a woman starts taking the regimen but then changes her mind and wants to carry the baby to term, the newborn may have serious deformities.  </p>

                <p>The RU-486 regimen also has increased risks for psychological problems. In <a href=http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RU-486-Amicus-Brief-FINAL.pdf">scientific studies</a> (PDF), women rated medical abortions as more stressful and experienced more disruptions in their lives. They also experienced a significant decline in self-esteem and higher PTSD intrusion scores.</p>

                <p>There are at least five major reasons why women are at greater risk of more severe psychological trauma with the RU-486 regimen than with a surgical abortion. First, the woman has a participatory role with a medical abortion which may cause greater psychological trauma; because the woman is directly responsible for the abortion which may exacerbate guilt and other negative feelings. She cannot close her eyes to the process and tell herself that someone else is doing this to her. Simply looking in the mirror can become a triggering event. Second, medical abortion requires the woman to be more alert and involved during the process. Therefore, it is impossible for her to distance herself psychologically from the abortion. Third, there is a greater potential for the woman to see her expelled unborn child. There is no doubt in her mind that she has taken the life of her unborn child. Fourth, although women usually say that they choose a medical abortion because it is in the privacy of their home, that privacy that can lead to greater trauma. This is because the woman is more likely at home alone. Thus, it is likely that she is without emotional support at the time of the abortion. Fifth, the woman's home becomes a trigger point for negative emotions instead of being a place of refuge. This is because she is at home and more specifically in the bathroom. Therefore, her home and the bathroom are associated with the abortion that she participated in a major and very visual way. The home becomes a daily trigger of the abortion experience.  </p>

                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

                <p>The RU-486 medical abortion regimen creates greater risks of both physical and psychological harm to women than surgical abortion. The Oklahoma Legislature was correct in providing for the protection of women considering the RU-486 regimen and requiring the FDA guidelines be followed instead of the off-label use that abortionists are prescribing. The Supreme Court has allowed these reasonable medical regulations. Scientific studies demonstrate the increased physical and psychological risks to women, and therefore, the Oklahoma Legislature was acting within its legitimate interests and authority. So, we will wait and see what the Legislature does in 2014.</p>

EME Homer City Generation</span> and <span class="casename">American Lung Association v. EME Homer City Generation</span>. The cases present three questions&#8212;one procedural and two substantive&#8212;that encircle EPA's efforts to address cross-state air pollution through its recently-promulgated <a href="http://www.epa.gov/crossstaterule/">Transport Rule</a>. </p>

<p>The Transport Rule arises under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-85">Clean Air Act's</a> (CAA) <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7410">"good neighbor" provision</a>, which Congress originally implemented in 1977 after its previous efforts to address cross-state air pollution proved inadequate. However, the original good neighbor provision didn't get the job done either. Congress addressed the issue again in its 1990 CAA amendments, requiring each state's CAA implementation plan to prohibit emissions that "contribute significantly" to another state's air quality problems. Essentially, the idea is that upwind states should still bear responsibility for their pollution after it blows across state lines.</p>

<p>But Congress didn't bother to specify what exactly it meant by "significant contribution" and one can imagine how EPA sees that lack of specificity as a grant of broad discretion. One can also imagine how some states might not see it that way. At the core, these cases are about that gap filling. </p>

<p>One question asks whether the CAA requires a strictly proportional approach to determine emission reductions in upwind states (the DC Circuit's position), or if EPA's cost-benefit balancing approach is statutorily acceptable. This one is about statutory construction and judicial imposition of methodology on an agency. The other question is about timing. That is, must EPA define what it means to "contribute significantly" <em>before</em> states need to include good neighbor provisions in their implementation plans, or do states add the provisions in the first instance and then EPA determines if they sufficiently protect downwind states? </p>

<p>EPA takes the position that states must write good neighbor provisions first and, if they don't, EPA must promulgate federal provisions using the methodology that it deems best. And that's what EPA did here. It reviewed a number of state implementation plans and found them wanting. Some states hadn't implemented sufficiently robust good neighbor provisions and others hadn't implemented anything at all. The Transport Rule cures those deficiencies by imposing federal provisions on the offending states. EPA's rule uses a formula that includes cost-benefit analysis and some of the affected states think that method makes them carry more than their fair share. The DC Circuit didn't like that balancing method either and held that a state's good neighbor emission reduction should be strictly proportional to its downwind effect, which renders cost-benefit analysis improper.</p>

<p>As one expects, these cases turn on a fine line and you might as well flip a coin as decide on the merits&#8212;that bright and reasonable minds may arrive at different conclusions is an understatement. Indeed, <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/19346B280C78405C85257A61004DC0E5/$file/11-1302-1390314.pdf">three already did</a> [PDF]. But, assuming they reach the merits (which a procedural decision would avoid), eight justices (Justice Alito recused himself) will need to find their side of the line; the court's decision will go to the heart of administrative law, cooperative federalism and management of the national commons. Both arguments are compelling and there is <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/12/argument-preview-ill-winds-and-good-neighbors/">plenty of commentary</a> out there about the nuances of each. So, let's step back and view these issues from a wider perspective.</p>

<p>These cases, once you distill the statutory construction, federalism and judicial deference, really go to this country's vision of itself and the importance of common resources. Essentially, what does it mean to be a "good neighbor" and member of a larger community (i.e., a state in the nation)?</p>

<p>The DC Circuit invalidated EPA's good neighbor methodology and imposed a formula of its own. The circuit's strict-apportionment method places primacy on the upwind state and thereby implicitly concerns itself with the cost of emissions reduction. It would be unfair, according to the court, to make an upwind state bear even a slightly disproportionate burden. Indeed, part of the circuit's problem with EPA is that the Transport Rule might require some upwind states to over control their emissions (oh, the horror! of over control). That is, EPA's methodology opens the door to a possibility that some upwind state might remove more pollution tonnage from the air than strictly proportional in a binary understanding of the state's downwind effects. </p>

<p>In so concerning itself, the circuit relegates the benefit of cleaner air to a tertiary position, which is exactly backwards. It further assumes that, in the name of fairness, upwind emission controls should be set at the lowest possible level. Indeed, the circuit thinks that EPA must ensure that no state reduce emissions more than the absolute minimum. Said another way, the circuit's reasoning basically requires a state to externalize as many its industrial pollution costs as possible. But, externalized costs are the essence of the tragedy of the commons and, perversely, exactly what Congress's good neighbor provision was supposed to correct in the first place.</p>

<p>The circuit's thinking is fundamentally flawed and, even if legally correct, badly misunderstands management of an invaluable national commons&#8212;the air we all breathe. The correct way of addressing this problem is to place primacy on the downwind benefits. It's not the unfairness to an upwind state's regulatory regime at issue, but the unfairness of downwind pollution filtering through human lungs. Picture that unfairness this way: PM<small>2.5</small> and ozone pollution <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-08-08/pdf/2011-17600.pdf">cause</a> [PDF] five percent of deaths in the US. Let me say that again. One out of twenty deaths is attributable to these two types of air pollution. </p>

<p>On those terms, requiring absolute minimum compliance sort of misses the point. Arguing about the possibility of over control instead of actually implementing controls is literally killing us. And that's precisely the problem with the circuit's other ruling on who gets the first go at writing sufficiently protective good neighbor provisions. The court's opinion sets up the strong possibility of a years-long ping pong game between EPA and the individual states. Meanwhile, the downwind states remain in non-attainment until after match point.</p>

<p>EPA's methodology may not be perfect, but it has the distinct advantage of actually addressing the non-binary relationship between pollution and geography. Pollution doesn't just move from point A to B. It swirls, mixes, and changes with onion-skin layers of complexity. By building a cost-benefit function into the equation, EPA has both recognized that complexity and broadened the issue of fairness. EPA's rule essentially takes a more regional approach as opposed to the circuit's strictly point-to-point comparative one. </p>

<p>Under the EPA's cost balancing, a state <em>might</em> shoulder somewhat more than its proportional responsibility, but only if it is comparatively cheaper for that state to do so. That is, cost-efficient&#8212;albeit imposed&#8212;regional cooperation. And, <em>overcontrol</em> is a meaninglessly relative term anyway. For instance, state A is an upwind polluter of states X and Y. State A reduces emissions until state X reaches compliance, but the reduction proves greater than necessary to achieve compliance in state Y. I suppose one could then say that X has <em>over controlled</em> its emissions. But of course that means that state Y doesn't deserve cleaner-than-the-dirtiest-possible air. </p>

<p>In the end, it is a mistake to let wildly complicated statutory construction obfuscate the simple concept of nuisance. We've known for over a century that it's not okay for one state to dirty the air of another. Indeed, Justice Holmes <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11855388078438833310">wrote in 1907</a> that it is "<em>fair and reasonable</em>" for a state to demand its territory not be polluted by forces "beyond its control" (emphasis mine). </p>

<p>This is precisely why protecting the commons requires a strong federal component&#8212;one that properly restrains a state's incentive to externalize as many of its air-pollution costs as possible. The Transport Rule's cost-benefit approach is a reasonable one, and properly emphasizes the benefit of having clean air, not the cost of achieving it. Even if legally correct, the DC Circuit's opinion removes the cooperation from cooperative federalism and sets up a situation where states are adverse to their neighbors based on a static view of proportionality. Even if overturned, such reasoning should signal a fundamental rethinking of how good neighbors behave towards one another, particularly in the context of shared resources and the national commons.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Thiago Santos Limas discusses the recent controversy surrounding an elected official with a criminal conviction in Brazil...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/thiagosantoslima.JPG" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>R</strong></font>ecently, Brazil's <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/principal/principal.asp">Supreme Federal Court</a> condemned representative Natan Donadon for crimes against Public Administration. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-23107455">Sentence</a>: thirteen years, four months and ten days.</p>

                <p>The episode was as historic for Brazilians as landing on the moon was for Americans. After all, Donadon was the first congressman judged and convicted under the <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/repositorio/cms/portalStfInternacional/portalStfSobreCorte_en_us/anexo/constituicao_ingles_3ed2010.pdf">1988 Brazilian Constitution</a> [PDF]. It seemed like a dream. And, yes, it was just a dream, for we have woken up and realized that Donadon will not be eliminated from office as swiftly and decisively as he was convicted.</p>

                <p>Following the sentence, a question presented itself to representatives and judges involved in the case: were the Supreme Justices' signatures of condemnation enough to remove Donadon from congress? The population hoped so and Supreme Justices did too, but the House of Representatives felt otherwise.</p>

                <p>Title IV, Section IV, Article 55 of the constitution permits this situation. In the case of final condemnation of a lawmaker, his respective House will ultimately determine the political destiny of the lawmaker. So, even riding around in a police car, possibly wearing colorful prisoner clothes, it is possible for Donadon to continue presenting himself as a congressman.</p>

                <p>As feared, this situation came to pass. On August 28, 2013, tenure was preserved by acquaintances of his Excellency Donadon and the Federal Republic of Brazil now shoulders the embarrassment of having one of its sitting federal congressman housed in a jail.<br />
                    <br />
                    In Brazilian politics, seemingly nothing is impossible. Actually, this decision by the National Congress is par for the course. Impunity enjoyed by government criminals in the country is the main dish of our political menu. The attitude which which congressmen carried out this action speaks volumes. On top of disregarding public opinion, they wanted to make a mockery of the justice system with one single legislative action.</p>

                <p>Preserving Donadon's tenure is direct vengeance for the judiciary's frequent disturbance of the executive and legislature's recent political objectives. By preserving the representative title for a prisoner after he was afforded correct due process of law in the Constitutional Court and judged under an unsystematic interpretation of the 55th article, lawmakers disregarded legal principles and other constitutional dispositions. In doing so, they only weakened the judiciary's legitimacy with an eye on mocking that political branch of the republic and maintaining the present state of disorder in Brazil.</p>

                <p>Interestingly, Article 55 affirms that a representative or senator will lose his tenure in the case of a final criminal condemnation, yet it goes on to state that this action still requires a secret vote of approval by the appropriate House legislators. Here, these legislators voted against the will of the nation. They held the 55th item of our Constitution in their breast, diminishing, for example, another constitutional provision&#8212; Article II &#8212;which orders harmony among the governmental branches.</p>

                <p>As Carlos Maximiliano, the former Brazilian Supreme Court minister who taught once stated, "[l]aw must be interpreted intelligently, not leading to absurdity, prescribing inconveniences, achieving inconsistent or impossible conclusions".</p>

                <p>The August protests through Brazil were necessary for citizens, as many perceive their prerogative lives as not matching their dreams and desires. Traditionally, they have deferred addressing their government's licentiousness to a later date, but this is changing. Brazilians will continue to be alert for misdeeds like this vote of the legislature on Donadon's tenure.</p>

                <p>Maurice Hauriou was right: we really do have one last Bastille to demolish&#8212;the belief in the sovereignty of Parliament.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist John Beggan, <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/law/">Stetson University College of Law</a> Class of 2015, analyzes the implications of liability claims surrounding the September 11th attacks...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Beggan.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Beggan.jpg" width="180" height="270" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n an opinion published on December 4, 2013, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled by a 2 to 1 vote that the developers for the 7 World Trade Center (7WTC) building were <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12965637717174670539">not liable</a> for its collapse hours after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. The collapse of the North Tower sent debris that crashed into 7WTC at different levels of the building leading firefighters to evacuate the area and establish a collapse zone to let the building come down. Consolidated Edison Co. of New York (Con Ed) owned the electrical substation located directly underneath the building. Con Ed sued the designers and builders of 7WTC alleging that their negligence caused the building to collapse. While the appellate court affirmed the district court's granting of summary judgment to defendant developers, it did so for a different reason. The district court found that the duty owed to Con Ed is not extended to the type of events that occurred on September 11th. The appellate court, however, found that the duty owed should extend to the events of September 11th because "[t]he risk of massive fire at a high-rise building such as 7WTC is a foreseeable risk" but any negligence on the part of the developers was not a cause in fact of the collapse.</p>

<p><strong>The "How" and the "What"</strong></p>

<p>The opinion handed down by the appellate court provides more questions than answers. The court finds that a duty was owed to Con Ed by distinguishing the "how" and the "what" on September 11th. As the court astutely points out, "[h]ow that fire started plays no part in the foreseeability analysis for the purposes of determining whether 7WTC owed Con Ed a duty." All that matters, according to the court, is that a massive fire was burning in a high-rise building and the building eventually collapsed. This is the "what." Therefore, 7WTC owed a duty to Con Ed to construct a building that could withstand such a fire and not collapse.</p>

<p>Fair enough. But is it that easy to separate the "how" and the "what" on September 11th? The court seems to disregard significant factors that had a large effect on the capabilities of firefighters to fight the fire in 7WTC. Firstly, the loss of hundreds of firefighters that day weighed heavily on their decision to go into the building and fight the fire, as would be normal procedure. Second, a broken water main in the area significantly decreased the water available to fight the fire effectively. Lastly, the debris projected from the collapsed of the North Tower crashed into different levels of 7WTC setting massive fires in multiple floors of the building, far from a usual fire that starts on one level and rises up. The latter fire would be easier to maintain and control. These factors played a major role in deciding to let the building collapse.</p>

<p>These factors also cannot be separated from the overall terrorist attack itself. I understand the court's reasoning and the importance of distinguishing the manner in which an event occurred (terrorists hijacking a plane) and the ultimate end result (a massive fire in a high-rise building). But I believe the "how" and the "what" on September 11th cannot be separated. The lack of manpower and water supply coupled with the complexity of fighting fires on multiple levels of the building cannot be explained without mention of the terrorist attack itself. The culmination of the events on September 11th were unforeseeable and to extend a duty of care from 7WTC to Con Ed to develop a building that can withstand the type of harm that occurred that day and by calling it a massive fire in a high-rise would be ignoring the evidence that made such a fire unmanageable. </p>

<p><strong>Question of Law or Question of Fact?</strong> </p>

<p>By extending a duty of care to Con Ed the court then found that the conduct of 7WTC was not the cause-in-fact of Con Ed's losses. The court heard expert testimony from Con Ed articulating that the structural integrity of 7WTC was not up to the standard of care set out and that it was this structural integrity, or lack thereof, that caused Con Ed's losses. The dissent points out, "[i]t may well be that causation . . . can be decided as a matter of law in the district court after a careful review of all expert submissions or that a trial will result in a defendants' verdict, but that is not the path the majority has chosen for this case." The majority finds that a duty existed but also finds that Con Ed did not offer sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact regarding causation. The record seemed to show ample evidence regarding the negligence of 7WTC's developers yet it was deemed by the court to be "too speculative." To me, the court goes beyond its bounds to award summary judgment. In finding no causation, the court points to the "unprecedented constellation of events" that occurred on that day. I believe Con Ed provided evidence that certainly raises a genuine issue of fact and the court usurps the role of the jury when it grants summary judgment in this case. The reasoning used for the issue of causation is better left to analyze whether a duty existed in the first place. Finding a duty requires the examining of law while finding causation requires the examining of fact, a task that is left to the fact finder. </p>

<p>I believe the district court was correct by not extending a duty from the developers of 7WTC to Con Ed given the severity of the events that occurred on September 11th. The appellate court extends the duty of care too far and takes a question of fact and turns it into a question of law. The dissent was correct in stating that Con Ed provided evidence to pass a motion for summary judgment and causation should be left for the fact finder to determine or that the majority was premature in awarding summary judgment without hearing from defendant developers' experts. The court effectively takes the foreseeability analysis out of the realm of duty of care. The type of fire that ultimately led to the collapse of 7WTC was deemed to be foreseeable by the court but it could not be understood without the events that preceded the fire, which the court holds to be unforeseeable for the issue of causation. The appellate court would have been well within its limits to limit the duty of care as the district court did. Instead, the court ventured outside the realm of law and chose to decide questions of fact, usually left to a jury. This decision also sets a dangerous precedent in extending a duty of care to almost all events where there is a contractual relationship between the two parties. By taking foreseeability out of the equation for a duty of care analysis, the court effectively states that regardless of the events leading up to a harm or loss, a duty is owed.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.edu/fac-staff/williamsv/">Victor Williams</a> of The Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law argues that the recent legal challenge to President Obama's recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board is a political question that should not be determined by the court but instead reversed on justiciability grounds ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/victorwilliams1.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>C</strong></font>alendared as the Supreme Court's first argument of the new year, the <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-recess-appointments.php">challenge</a> to President Barack Obama's <a href="/feature/featured/recess-appointments/">recess appointments</a> to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is set for January 13, 2014. Beyond its direct importance to Obama's ability to timely staff the government in an age of unprecedented confirmation obstruction, the case presents the Roberts Court with a historic opportunity to exercise genuine judicial restraint.  <br />
 	<br />
<a href="a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15209310674352766004">NLRB v. Noel Canning</a> is an obvious continuation of the partisan and ideological efforts to defeat Obama's governance by blocking his appointments. High level vacancies have plagued the administration during its five-year tenure; Obama signed the 2012 NLRB commissions when they were required to restore the venerable labor board's quorum and legal authority. The court recently <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/09/us-usa-employment-mcconnell-idUSBRE9B810S20131209">granted</a> "extraordinary" permission to amici Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his 44 Republican caucus members to participate by extending argument time to a full ninety minutes. Of the many "friends" of the court, only the Senate Republicans will be allowed to argue. The Senate Republicans defend both their past obstruction and the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2423466848603742363">DC Circuit's ruling</a> which invalidated the temporary commissions. Perhaps the court judged the Senate GOP's active role in the oral arguments to be not only appropriate, but necessary.  </p>

<p>A better view&#8212;honoring the conservative principle of judicial restraint&#8212;is that the court should not even reach the merits of the partisan conflict. The judiciary finds itself in the densest of modern political thickets. The DC Circuit's ruling improperly interferes with both the president's temporary appointment authority and his removal timing discretion. Although the Solicitor General's very strong merits <a href="http://www.justice.gov/osg/briefs/2013/3mer/2mer/2012-1281.mer.aa.pdf">brief</a> [PDF] fully exposes the lower court's many errors, the Supreme Court should reverse on justiciability grounds and exit the partisan fight. As I argued in amicus briefs to the DC Circuit and the <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/victorwilliamsamicusrasingpoliticalquestionandfilibusters.pdf">Supreme Court</a> [PDF], this case presents a non-reviewable political question.  </p>

<p>Throughout our Republic's history, the court has recognized that some questions are committed by the Constitution's text to the exclusive discretion of the elected political branches. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9834052745083343188>Marbury v. Madison</a>, Chief Justice John Marshall offered an early political-question description: "Questions in their nature political, or which are, by the constitution and laws, submitted to the executive, can never be made in this court." Marshall explained that the president has certain discretionary powers for which he is "accountable only to his country his political character, and to his own conscience."  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section2">Clause 3 of Article II, Section 2</a> of the Constitution exclusively grants the executive both the responsibility to determine Senate unavailability and the discretion to sign temporary commissions. Alexander Hamilton explained in <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed67.asp">Federalist No. 67</a> that Clause 3 is "intended to authorize the President singly to make temporary appointments." Only the executive has the institutional competence to know when such appointment action is required for his Article II, Section 3 mandate: "[H]e shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States." <br />
  <br />
The political-question criteria of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6066081450900314197">Baker v. Carr</a> require the justices to find "manageable standards" to resolve the case. A judicial examination of the House Majority-Senate Minority scheduling collusion resulting in sham pro forma sessions (meant to further appointment obstruction) is particularly problematic. The court also risks disturbing "adherence" to the legitimacy of over a thousand temporary departmental, regulatory, and judicial appointments made throughout the nation's history.    </p>

<p>The doctrine was directly applied in <a href="https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/444/444.US.996.79-856.html">Goldwater v. Carter</a>. The court rejected review of a congressional delegation's challenge to President Jimmy Carter's decision to terminate a defense treaty with Taiwan&#8212;without acquiescence of the House and/or the Senate. Then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist wrote: "Here, while the Constitution is express as to the manner in which the Senate shall participate in the ratification of a treaty, it is silent as to that body's participation in the abrogation of a treaty." Similarly, with <span class="casename">Noel Canning</span>, while Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 "is express as to the manner" in which the Senate participates in the confirmation of an ordinary appointment, its next clause negates "that body's participation" in the president's decision to sign a temporary commission.   </p>

<p>Judicial review of the "textually committed" alternative appointment method is both disrespectful and conflicting. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17675318889659087739">Nixon v. United States</a>, the court refused to review the Senate's shortcut impeachment trial process used to remove a federal judge from the bench. Exercising prudence and restraint, the nation's highest court would not even define the simple word "try" in the Impeachment Trial Clause. Neither should the court now define "the recess" or "vacancies that may happen." <br />
 <br />
Ruling that the Senate trial authority was an "important constitutional check" on the judiciary, Chief Justice Rehnquist refused to answer the political question presented by Nixon. Adjudication of <span class="casename">Noel Canning</span> would similarly place the "final reviewing authority with respect to [recess appointments] in the hands of the same body that the [recess appointment] process is meant to regulate." The executive's exclusive power to timely fill court vacancies is certainly an "important constitutional check" on individual courts and the judiciary as a whole.   </p>

<p>Since George Washington filled the first court benches, presidents have used recess appointments to timely bench over 300 judges. Recess commissions have been effectively used to diversify our federal courts. Four of the first five African-American federal appellate judges were recess appointees, as were many of the first female and Jewish federal judges. President John F. Kennedy overcame the appointment obstruction of reactionary factions of his own party by recess commissioning over twenty percent of his judicial picks. Each Kennedy judge, including Thurgood Marshall, who was placed on the Second Circuit, won subsequent confirmation tenure. Just as with the Senate impeachment removal process, judges should not have final review of executive recess appointment authority.  </p>

<p>If the court is not persuaded by its own precedent and history to avoid the partisan appointment fight, my amicus brief also raises the less "domesticated" abstention perspective promoted by the late Alexander Bickel in <em>The Least Dangerous Branch: The Supreme Court at the Bar of Politics</em>. Professor Bickel advised courts to consider the strangeness, intractability, and/or momentous nature of an issue which might tend to "unbalance judicial judgment."  He referenced "the inner vulnerability, the self-doubt of an institution which is electorally irresponsible and has no earth to draw strength from." Our unelected judiciary, which has "no earth to draw strength from," should stay out of the partisan mud-fight of appointment obstruction.   </p>

<p>Without jurisdictional abstention doctrines, Virginia Congressman John Marshall warned his House colleagues in 1800, the political branches might be "swallowed-up by the judiciary." In a more recent law school lecture, Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/04/anthony-kennedy-court_n_4041276.html">stated</a> it best: "Any society that relies on nine unelected judges to resolve the most serious issues of the day is not a functioning democracy." </p>

Even district courts have publicly denounced the mandatory minimum sentences&#8212;<a href= https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/content/judge-john-gleeson>Judge Gleeson</a> in New York is a prime example&#8212;and Congress has established the <a href= http://judiciary.house.gov/news/2013/05082013.html> Over-Criminalization Task Force</a> to study the issue. </p>

                <p>Meanwhile, federal circuit courts have been whittling away age-old protections for drug defendants, making it easier for prosecutors to ensnare a drug defendant with the most severe mandatory minimum sentences available under federal law when the end user dies. The courts have lessened the quantum of proof necessary for these twenty year or life mandatory minimum sentences by eliminating any <em>mens rea</em> requirements for the conduct that triggers the enhanced offense, and by lowering the causation standard below what is even allowed in civil cases.  </p>

                <p>We challenged these two separate, but related, erosions of the level of necessary proof in <a href= "http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-aiding-and-abetting-liability-drugs-causing-death.php">Burrage v. US</a>: (1) the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit creation of a  "contributing cause" standard employed only in section 841 cases, and (2) the circuit-wide elimination of any form of <em>mens rea</em> from the "resulting in death" element of the crime by refusing to give an instruction on foreseeability or reasonableness. Both the lesser causation standard and the elimination of <em>mens rea</em> independently dilute the protections needed for a just criminal system and together create seemingly unending criminal liability for what is essentially a homicide conviction.</p>

                <p>Foreseeability, the most common element of proximate cause, is often depicted as either an objective or subjective reasonableness standard and is employed in both reckless and negligent forms of culpability. It is the lowest form of <em>mens rea</em>&#8212;falling behind the more culpable intentional conduct. The US Supreme Court has been clear that <em>mens rea</em> is the default rule of criminal jurisprudence. Even when a statute does not include express terms of <em>mens rea</em>, the Supreme Court instructs lower courts to look for some indication of congressional intent before <em>mens rea</em> may be dispensed as an element of a crime. This is because society desires to punish increased mental culpability with increased penalties&#8212;the concept of marginal deterrence. Eliminating all <em>mens rea</em> as the rationale for such a drastic increase in penalties&#8212;no minimum to mandatory twenty years or life under section 841(b)(1)(C)&#8212;is a seismic shift in how to approach criminal liability. Such a system penalizes one defendant with life without parole for identical conduct which is no more morally culpable than another defendant's conduct who is serving less than a year in prison.  </p>

                <p>Similarly, the "contributing cause" standard adopted by the Eighth Circuit drastically broadens the application of the "resulting in death" penalty to those individuals whose conduct merely "played a part" in a death, rather than actually caused a death. Its use in the criminal context is both novel, and seemingly limitless, should the Supreme Court determine it is an acceptable form of causation in a criminal case absent express congressional language triggering its application.  </p>

                <p>The combination of both the foreseeability and causation issues generates hypotheticals which should trigger flashbacks to law school exams for even the most seasoned lawyer. The esoteric nature of both factual and proximate cause harkens us back to the days of studying hornbooks and their source for extrapolations law school professors thrive upon. Yet, unlike law school exams, the real-life scenarios section 841 has generated within the criminal legal community do not end in the difference between an A and a C, they end in the difference between dying in prison or serving a modest term of months.</p>

                <p>Marcus Burrage was sentenced to the twenty year mandatory minimum sentence under section 841(b)(1)(C) for selling one gram of heroin to an individual who died several hours later after using a smorgasbord of different drugs, none of which the experts would say was the sole cause of the user's death. His penalty exceeded the maximum sentence for a federal defendant convicted of either involuntary manslaughter (eight years maximum) or voluntary manslaughter (fifteen years maximum). The district court, pursuant to Eighth Circuit precedent, eliminated all forms of <em>mens rea</em> from the jury instructions by refusing to instruct on foreseeability. The lack of the foreseeability element created a form of strict liability crime and the use of the contributing cause standard eliminated any chance Burrage had of avoiding the harsh penalty. Without the "resulting in death" element, Burrage's suggested sentence under the guidelines would have been a fraction of the 240 months the court was required to give him.  <br />
                    <br />
                    The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had expressed reservations about this type of "strict liability" application of the "death resulting" element in <a href= http://www.scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4785673371803516523&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr>US v. Hatfield</a>. In the Seventh Circuit's opinion, Judge Richard Posner stated that application of the strict liability interpretation "could lead to some strange results." For instance, as Posner hypothesized, if a defendant sells an illegal drug to a person who ingests it in a bathroom, and while in the bathroom, the ceiling collapses and kills him, strict liability could support a conviction&#8212;had the person not ingested the drug, he would not have been in the bathroom and would not have been crushed under the falling ceiling. Another "strange result" identified by Posner could occur when, unbeknownst to the seller of an illegal drug, the buyer was intending to commit suicide by taking an overdose of drugs, some of which were bought from the seller, none of which were abnormally strong and the seller had informed the buyer of the strength of the drugs so that there was no reasonable likelihood of an accidental overdose.  </p>

                <p>These hypotheticals, upon further research, proved to be not just hypothetical. Posner's suicide hypothetical eerily matches the facts in <a href=http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Unpublished/991738.U.pdf >US v. Patterson</a> [PDF], where the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit refused an "intervening and superseding cause" defense in the case even though the defendant had proffered evidence that the victim may have committed suicide. Meanwhile, Posner's seemingly absurd fact pattern of the drug user dying in the bathroom when the ceiling collapses pales in comparison to the facts in the actual case of <a href=http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=990530473803929268&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr>US v. Roman</a> out of the Central District of California where the defendant was charged under section 841 when the user of the mushrooms he had sold ran naked onto a freeway and was hit by a motorist. </p>

                <p>Unfortunately for these defendants, and for hundreds like them, they have been convicted for contributing to an accidental death that may not have been foreseeable. Also, unfortunately for these defendants, their facts are not law school hypotheticals, but real life demonstrations of the impact ever-expanding criminal standards have on society&#8212;to a point now where we have the Supreme Court debating whether a person can spend their whole life in prison for selling an amount of drugs that weighs less than a grape.  </p>

(7WTCo.) and others for the negligent design, construction, operation and maintenance of building 7 of the World Trade Center complex. This case, as the parties' names might indicate, addressed a series of tort claims &#8212; though not the only claims &#8212; that stem from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. </p>

<p>Consolidated Edison owned a substation at the base of building 7. This substation was responsible for the flow of energy to the various buildings and was ultimately destroyed upon the building's collapse. Although building 7 was not directly struck during the attacks, debris from the other buildings during their direct attacks and subsequent collapses caused building 7 to catch fire on various, nonconsecutive floors. For assorted reasons including, but not limited to, lack of available water with which to fight a fire and the New York Fire Department's belief that the building was properly evacuated, building 7 was designated as a collapse zone and was left to its own devices. </p>

<p>The claims brought by Consolidated Edison as against the defendants alleged that had the building been constructed properly it would have withstood the fires despite New York Fire Department's inability to fight such fires. In support of such contentions, plaintiffs presented expert reports, which found that the building lacked certain structural integrities and it was such deficiency that ultimately caused the building to collapse, destroying the substation. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14347867093848793233">lower court</a> granted 7WTCo.'s motion for summary judgment based on the rationale that no duty existed to the plaintiffs that would encompass the injury they suffered; essentially no duty was owed other than a "general duty to protect the substation from risk of harm." However, as the Court of Appeals opined, the defendant, 7WTCo., did in fact owe the plaintiffs a duty. </p>

<p>Although not on the forefront of the discussion, the lower court likely took this opportunity, the analysis of whether a duty was owed, to prevent this set of plaintiffs from recovering. Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that Consolidated Edison received sufficient payment for the claims submitted to their insurer for the lost substation (which is more likely so than just arguendo or else the insurer would probably not be a party to the suit), then the lower court, and to a lesser extent, the Court of Appeals, may have been more concerned with overcompensation than they let on. After all, if Consolidated Edison's loss was recovered via their insurance policy, then the court would be recompensing said insurance company for taking the well-calculated risk of insuring in the first place. </p>

<p>Whether or not such considerations played a role in either courts' decision does not factor in largely to the present analysis because for the Court of Appeals, the linchpin of the case became causation. It was the very fact that 7WTCo. could not be deemed the cause-in-fact of the loss suffered which ultimately led the Court of Appeals to find in favor of the lower court's granting of defendant's motion. </p>

<p>As an established principle of negligence lawsuits, and in accordance with the Second Circuit in cases like <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5886374331783005436">Otal</a>, in order for a plaintiff to jump the causation hurdle in a negligence action, they must establish that the defendant's negligence was the legal cause of the injury suffered&#8212;termed cause-in-fact&#8212;and that the negligence was a proximate cause of the harm. Cause-in-fact is simply a but-for test. As the court in <span class ="casename">Aegis</span> notes, it "refers to those antecedent events, acts or omissions which have so far contributed to the result that without them it would not have occurred." But-for the defendant's act the plaintiff would not have suffered the injury. </p>

<p>The more limiting doctrine for causation, as the Second Circuit noted in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5130634675304989288">Rothstein</a>, is the proximate cause analysis. Its purpose is to confine a person's liability to injuries, which are reasonably foreseeable, and to only those "whom his acts were a substantial factor in the sequence of responsible causation." Essentially, the negligent act should lead to the plaintiff's injury (a seemingly common sense analysis, which is admittedly muddled, confused, and often unclearly applied). <br />
 <br />
It would seem that much of the confusion arises when these two doctrines are interpreted separately instead of as elements of each other. Although these interrelated concepts are now a team of sorts, they were not born of the same time. Unlike cause-in-fact, proximate cause seems to spring from a wrinkle in time <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1883&context=lawreview&sei-redir=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar_url%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fdigitalcommons.law.wustl.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1883%26context%3Dlawreview%26sa%3DX%26scisig%3DAAGBfm0ecAbfN3fbMX0yz3UDOIU9wLPInw%26oi%3Dscholarr#search=%22http%3A%2F%2Fdigitalcommons.law.wustl.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1883%26context%3Dlawreview%22">during the nineteenth century</a> [PDF]. Such a creation, I imagine, was likely the product of unsatisfying results yielded from the cause-in-fact analysis alone. If taken together, the proximate cause analysis is aided (though nominally) by the cause-in-fact analysis. Applying this standard of causation to the present case, the plaintiffs' analysis would likely progress along the following lines: the defendant's negligent construction of building 7 was a substantial factor in its collapse and the destruction of the contents within the building. Without this negligence, the collapse of the building and consequently the ruin of the substation would not have occurred. </p>

<p>As the court acknowledges, the trend in New York case law is to leave the brunt of the analysis to the proximate cause discussion. This is likely because almost any negligent act can be swept under the rug by the abuse of the cause-in-fact doctrine. Furthermore, cause-in-fact can become notoriously difficult to apply in factual scenarios involving more than one defendant, more than one injury, or a set of events that are not clear-cut.</p>

<p>The Second Circuit decided that there is no way to impute cause-in-fact to the defendant because the events of September 11th were so unexpected and created such a chain of events that affected buildings likely would have collapsed regardless of alleged issues of negligence with regard to their construction. However, unless the facts are such that there can rationally be no other conclusions drawn, causation is generally recognized as a question for the jury. As Judge Pooler admits, the reports presented by the plaintiffs are speculative and conjectural in nature. But the very fact that they require more substantive proof could mean that defendant might produce experts at trial who can more positively rebut such theories. </p>

<p>Given what was presented to the court, it should not have been within the ambit of their authority to conclusively determine the presence of the causation element of a <em>prima facie</em> negligence claim. Although, it is very probable that testimony by experts and lay witnesses about the building and its collapse, if presented to a jury, would likely have rendered the same result. </p>

<p>The major concern as I see it, is not necessarily the precedent that will be set for future negligence suits brought for negligent design and/or construction. It seems hard to believe that absent facts as tragic and unexpected as those, which took place on September 11th, that the court would be willing to dismiss a defendant's liability. The precedent set by this case will likely be for a more limited set of events. But certain questions remain to be addressed: Would such a limit have been more appropriate via a proximate cause analysis? Would a jury have found defendants' negligence to be the cause of the plaintiffs' injury? How will future September 11th claims be resolved with this case as precedent? </p>

		<title>NSA Metadata Collection: Fourth Amendment Violation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/directory/marjorie-cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of the Thomas Jefferson School of Law discusses two recent decisions on the constitutionality of the National Security Agency's (NSA) metadata collection program ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/marjoriecohn.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>E</strong></font>dward Snowden, who worked for the National Security Agency (NSA), revealed a secret order of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), that requires Verizon to produce on an "ongoing daily basis ... all call detail records or 'telephony metadata' created by Verizon for communications (i) between the United States and abroad; or (ii) wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls." </p>

<p>The government has admitted it collects metadata for all of our telephone communications, but says the data collected does not include the content of the calls.</p>

<p>In response to lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the program, two federal judges issued dueling opinions about whether it violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment's</a> prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>

<p>Judge Richard J. Leon, of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-against-nsa-phone-surveillance-program.php">held</a> that the metadata program probably constitutes an unconstitutional search and seizure. Judge William H. Pauley III, of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-nsa-data-collection-legal-and-useful.php">determined</a> that it does not violate the Fourth Amendment. </p>

<p><strong>Leon's opinion</strong></p>

<p>Leon wrote, "Because the Government can use daily metadata collection to engage in 'repetitive surreptitious surveillance of a citizen's private goings on,' the 'program implicates the Fourth Amendment each time a government official monitors it.'" The issue is "whether plaintiffs have a reasonable expectation of privacy that is violated when the Government indiscriminately collects their telephony metadata along with the metadata of hundreds of millions of other citizens without any particularized suspicion of wrongdoing, retains all of that metadata for five years, and then queries, analyzes, and investigates that data without prior judicial approval of the investigative targets. If they do&#8212;and a Fourth Amendment search has thus occurred&#8212;then the next step of the analysis will be to determine whether such a search is 'reasonable.'" The first determination is whether a Fourth Amendment "search" has occurred. If so, the second question is whether that search was "reasonable."</p>

<p>The judicial analyses of both Leon and Pauley turn on their differing interpretations of the 1979 U.S. Supreme Court decision, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3033726127475530815">Smith v. Maryland</a>. In <span class="casename">Smith</span>, a robbery victim reported she had received threatening and obscene phone calls from someone who claimed to be the robber. Without obtaining a warrant, the police installed a pen register, which revealed a telephone in the defendant's home had been used to call the victim. The Supreme Court held that a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in the numbers dialed from his telephone because he voluntarily transmits them to his phone company.</p>

<p>Leon distinguished <span class="casename">Smith</span> from the NSA program, saying that whether a pen register constitutes a "search" is "a far cry from the issue in [the NSA] case." Leon wrote, "When do present-day circumstances&#8212;the evolution of the Government's surveillance capabilities, citizens' phone habits, and the relationship between the NSA and telecom companies&#8212;become so thoroughly unlike those considered by the Supreme Court thirty-four years ago that a precedent like <span class="casename">Smith</span> simply does not apply? The answer, unfortunately for the Government, is now."</p>

<p>Then Leon cited the 2012 Supreme Court case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6122276400056758151">United States v. Jones</a>, in which five justices found that law enforcement's use of a GPS device to track the movements of a vehicle for nearly a month violated a reasonable expectation of privacy. "Significantly," Leon wrote, "the justices did so without questioning the validity of the Court's 1983 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2281447873975736215">United States v. Knotts</a>, that the use of a tracking beeper does not constitute a search because '[a] person travelling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another.'" Leon contrasted the short-range, short-term tracking device used in <span class="casename">Knotts</span> with the constant month-long surveillance achieved with the GPS device attached to Jones's car.</p>

<p>Unlike the "highly-limited data collection" in <span class="casename">Smith</span>, Leon noted, "[t]he NSA telephony metadata program, on the other hand, involves the creation and maintenance of a historical database containing five years' worth of data. And I might add, there is the very real prospect that the program will go on for as long as America is combating terrorism, which realistically could be forever!" He called the NSA program "effectively a joint intelligence-gathering operation [between telecom companies and] the Government."</p>

<p>"[T]he almost-Orwellian technology that enables the Government to store and analyze the phone metadata of every telephone user in the United States is unlike anything that could have been conceived in 1979," Leon exclaimed, calling it  "the stuff of science fiction." He cited Justice Scalia's opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15840045591115721227">Kyllo v. United States</a>, which held the use of a thermal imaging device, that measures heat waste emanating from a house, constitutes a "search." Justice Scalia was concerned about increasing invasions of privacy occasioned by developing technology. </p>

<p>Leon wrote, "I cannot imagine a more 'indiscriminate' and 'arbitrary invasion' than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval."</p>

<p>Quoting Justice Sotomayor's concurrence in <span class="casename">Jones</span>, Leon noted the breadth of information our cell phone records reveal, including "familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations."</p>

<p>Having determined that people have a subjective expectation of privacy in their historical record of telephony metadata, Leon turned to whether that subjective expectation is one that society considers "reasonable." A "search" must ordinarily be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing in order to be "reasonable." One exception is when there are "special needs," beyond the need for ordinary law enforcement (such as the need to protect children from drugs).</p>

<p>"To my knowledge, however, no court has ever recognized a special need sufficient to justify continuous, daily searches of virtually every American citizen without any particularized suspicion," Leon wrote. "In effect," he continued, "the Government urges me to be the first non-FISC judge to sanction such a dragnet."</p>

<p>Leon stated that fifteen different FISC judges have issued 35 orders authorizing the metadata collection program. But, Leon wrote, FISC Judge Reggie Walton determined the NSA has engaged in "systematic noncompliance" and repeatedly made misrepresentations and inaccurate statements about the program to the FISC judges. And Presiding FISC Judge John Bates noted "a substantial misrepresentation [by the government] regarding the scope of a major collection program." </p>

<p>Significantly, Leon noted that "the Government does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the Government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature."</p>

<p><strong>Pauley's opinion</strong></p>

<p>Pauley's analysis of the Fourth Amendment issue was brief. He explained that prior to the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">September 11th terrorist attacks</a>, the NSA intercepted seven calls made by hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar to an al-Qaeda safe house in Yemen. But the overseas signal intelligence capabilities the NSA used could not capture al-Mihdhar's telephone number identifier; thus, the NSA mistakenly concluded that al-Mihdhar was not in the United States. Pauley wrote: "Telephony metadata would have furnished the missing information and might have permitted the NSA to notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the fact that al-Mihdhar was calling the Yemeni safe house from inside the United States." </p>

<p>"If plumbed," Pauley noted, the telephony metadata program "can reveal a rich profile of every individual as well as a comprehensive record of people's association with one another." He noted, "the Government acknowledged that since May 2006, it has collected [telephony metadata] for substantially every telephone call in the United States, including calls between the United States and a foreign country and calls entirely within the United States."</p>

<p>But, unlike Leon, Pauley found <span class="casename">Smith v. Maryland</span> controls the NSA case. He quoted <span class="casename">Smith</span>: "Telephone users ... typically know that they must convey numerical information to the telephone company; that the telephone company has facilities for recording this information; and that the telephone company does in fact record this information for a variety of legitimate business purposes." Thus, Pauley wrote, when a person voluntarily gives information to a third party, "he forfeits his right to privacy in the information." </p>

<p>While Leon's distinction between Smith and the NSA program turned on the breadth of information collected by the NSA, Pauley opined, "The collection of breathtaking amounts of information unprotected by the Fourth Amendment does not transform that sweep into a Fourth Amendment search." And whereas Leon's detailed analysis demonstrated how <span class="casename">Jones</span> leads to the result that the NSA program probably violates the Fourth Amendment, Pauley failed to meaningfully distinguish <span class="casename">Jones</span> from the NSA case, merely noting that the <span class="casename">Jones</span> court did not overrule <span class="casename">Smith</span>. </p>

<p>Leon's decision is the better-reasoned opinion.</p>

<p><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p>

<p>This issue is headed to the Court of Appeals. From there, it will likely go the Supreme Court. The high court checked and balanced President George W. Bush when he overstepped his legal authority by establishing military commissions that violated due process, and attempted to deny constitutional habeas corpus to Guantanamo detainees. It remains to be seen whether the court will likewise refuse to cower before President Barack Obama's claim of unfettered executive authority to conduct dragnet surveillance. If the court allows the NSA to continue its metadata collection, we will reside in what can only be characterized as a police state.</p>

		<title>NSA Surveillance Program Still Unconstitutional Despite Proposed Changes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.ispu.org/people/Samar%20Warsi">Samar Warsi</a>, a legal fellow at the <a href="http://www.ispu.org/default.aspx">Institute for Social Policy and Understanding</a>, says that, even after implementing the changes proposed by President Barack Obama, the NSA's surveillance program is still constitutionally problematic...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>F</strong></font>reedom is the great deity of the west, the goddess central to American identity; the idea being that individuals have autonomy&#8212;good or bad, wise or foolish, controversial or conventional&#8212;to live their lives with minimal government interference.</p>

                <p><a href="/feature/featured/911/">Post-9/11</a>, that narrative has devolved into something less than ideal: the government can encroach on your civil liberties as long as they can provide a scintilla of justification that it might somehow be linked to a national security threat. </p>

                <p>In a <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/obama-pledges-an-end-to-nsas-mass-collection-practices.php">press conference</a> this past week, President Barack Obama announced changes that would be made to the National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance program. The proposed changes, although a step in the right direction, fail to bring the program into constitutionally permissible limits.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Mass Data Collection is Constitutionally Impermissible </strong></p>

                <p>One proposed change is that NSA analysts will need permission from the Foreign Intelligence Secret Court (FISA) when querying a database.</p>

                <p>Obama stated that in order to curb the risk of NSA agents arbitrarily collecting information, analysts will now have to get permission from the secret court to query the database. This way, NSA agents will have the information "when [they] need" but will no longer be able to hold massive amounts of information.</p>

                <p>In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon's <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/the911decade/declineofdemocracy">warrantless wiretapping</a> shocked the nation. The administration tried to sweep its actions under the guise of "national security" claiming the illegal acts were for the nation's greater good. At the very core of the outrage in response to the scandal was the notion that warrantless surveillance was unconstitutional. Both Congress and the US Supreme Court "insisted that the law had to govern all intelligence and counterintelligence gathering by the government, even when it was undertaken to protect against terrorism." </p>

                <p>Even when balancing security and liberty, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> does not simply allow <a href="/hotline/2013/04/samar-warsi-drone-policy.php">unfettered access</a> to the lives of the American people. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> safeguards the "right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures" by the government. Obama's proposed reform does not change the fact that warrantless and often baseless surveillance will persist; the government will still access, keep and search metadata until it decides what to do with the information. </p>

                <p><strong>2. Nothing in the proposed changes eliminates bulk surveillance</strong></p>

                <p>Another proposed change would limit the NSA's ability to use the "three hops" to a "two hop" approach when querying a database. A three-hop query means the NSA can examine numbers that are within three degrees of separation from the original number. For example, if the NSA examines data of a suspected criminal, they can also examine data from anyone the suspected criminal communicated with, and anyone those people communicated with.  </p>

                <p>While the two-hop approach naturally limits the NSA's reach as compared to the three-hop method, it still does not address the problem of bulk surveillance. Simply violating an individual's privacy rights less does not make it constitutionally permissible.</p>

                <p><strong>3. FISA is potentially powerless to remedy NSA wrongdoing</strong></p>

                <p>While in theory, it seems beneficial to have the court act as an impartial third party&#8212;in reality, there is no way to know if the court's existence is even effective. In fact, there is evidence to the contrary. The Washington Post previously <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-broke-privacy-rules-thousands-of-times-per-year-audit-finds/2013/08/15/3310e554-05ca-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_print.html">reported</a> that an independent audit of the NSA found that the agency broke privacy rules thousands of times a year, including orders by FISA. </p>

                <p>The Director of National Intelligence, however, casually dismissed these instances of illegality as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/nsa-surveillance-program-has-had-compliance-problems-official-says/2013/07/26/f64c9820-f63d-11e2-a2f1-a7acf9bd5d3a_story.html">"compliance problems."</a> To ensure that the NSA will not continue to have "compliance problems," there needs to be a completely new approach when it comes to NSA oversight. To simply give the relatively powerless court more responsibility serves no legitimate purpose&#8212;it is simply a farce to subordinate public concern. </p>

                <p>The way to reconcile the freedom we so deeply value with the need to be proactive about our national security is to create and abide by narrowly tailored policies that prevent the unjustifiable stockpiling of information. There must be a conscientious effort to move in the direction written policies and clear methods of accountability to ensure that productive changes will be implemented to the NSA's operating procedures. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/ali-dayan-hasan">Ali Dayan Hasan</a> of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> says that the judicial template adhered to by Iftikhar Chaudhry, the former chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, should not be followed by future jurists...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/alihasan.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>F</strong></font>ormer Parkistan Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, who retired on December 11, 2013, has earned a place in Pakistan's history as the first chief justice to successfully defy a military ruler's attempt to dismiss him. His defiance set off the "lawyers' movement," whose members took to the streets to defend judicial independence. </p>

                <p>In March 2007, when the then-military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, arbitrarily removed Chaudhry from office, the lawyers' movement stood up for both the chief justice and the institution he represented. Upholding the fundamental principle of judicial independence meant supporting Chaudhry's claim to regain his position, which he did in March 2009. <br />
                    <br />
                    So, why is it such a relief to see Chaudhry go? </p>

                <p>Pakistan's tenaciously independent chief justice also turned out to be political, arbitrary and irresponsible. Upon returning to office, he <a href="http://pakistanconstitutionlaw.com/c-m-a-120-121-of-2009/">presided over the firing of judges</a> without giving them the same due process he had demanded of Musharraf. He refused to accept parliamentary oversight of judicial appointments, <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/566488/sc-reserves-verdict-in-18th-amendment-case">threatening to overturn</a> a unanimously passed constitutional amendment to that effect unless it was revised. Parliament <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/92737/19th-amendment-report-presented-in-na/">complied</a> to avoid a confrontation. </p>

                <p>Chaudhry also made unprecedented use of <em>suo motu</em> proceedings&#8212;the court acting on its own motions&#8212;to engage in unwarranted intrusion into the legitimate domain of the legislature and the executive. <em>Suo motu</em> proceedings in defense of fundamental rights are good, but in case after case Chaudhry acted as if the Supreme Court was not a co-equal branch of government but a <em>de facto</em> legislature and executive branch. </p>

                <p>Further, Chaudhry used his discretionary powers to oversee, hire and fire government officials, intervening in governance areas ranging from <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/849128/sc-backs-sugar-price-fixed-by-lhc">economic policy</a> to traffic management. He seemed to relish triggering constitutional confrontations with parliament and government, undermining the elected parliament and disrupting governance just when Pakistan was undergoing a difficult transition to civilian rule. </p>

                <p>In just one example, in December 2011, Chaudhry embroiled the Supreme Court in the <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/memogate/">"Memogate" scandal</a> by agreeing to investigate Pakistan's former ambassador to the US on charges that he attempted to conspire with the US against Pakistan's military. Such an investigation was the responsibility of the government, not the Supreme Court. However, showing his biases, Chaudhry did not investigate allegations from the same source that the head of Pakistan's security services, the Inter-Services Intelligence, had <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/pakistan?page=2">conspired to oust</a> the elected government. </p>

                <p>In June 2012, a Supreme Court bench headed by Chaudhry took the unprecedented step of firing Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani for "scandalizing the judiciary." Gilani had refused to sign a letter to the Swiss government asking for an investigation into corruption allegations against then-president Asif Zardari, even though the Swiss government said that it would not act on such a letter. Chaudhry's order appeared to be an attempt to settle a personal score&#8212;many independent observers called the move a "judicial coup." <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/12/18/destroying-legality-0">After all the controversy</a> about the way Musharraf had sidelined the judiciary, the government decided to avoid a constitutional crisis and nominated a new prime minister. </p>

                <p>When a corruption scandal involving Chaudhry's son emerged around the same time, Chaudhry first used his <em>suo motu</em> powers to <a href="http://www.samaa.tv/CJP-Chaudhry-takes-suo-motu-notice-against-his-son-Arsalan-48622-1.html">seize judicial control</a> of the investigation and then effectively <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-122043-SC-moved-against-appointment-of-NAB-boss-">prevented</a> the investigation from proceeding. <br />
                    <br />
                    Chaudhry treated attempts at oversight or accountability of the judiciary, however reasonable or justified, as a personal attack. He <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-pakistan">muzzled media criticism</a> by the use or threatened use of overbroad "contempt laws." </p>

                <p>While Chaudhry lashed out at his critics, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/pakistan?page=2">access to justice in Pakistan remained abysmal</a> and the courts remained rife with corruption and incompetence. Case backlogs stayed huge at all levels of the court system. <br />
                    <br />
                    Chaudhry's supporters make much of his credentials as a champion of human rights causes. He deserves credit for standing up to a military dictator. He took a strong stand on government abuses in Balochistan and demanded the return of terrorism suspects forcibly disappeared by the military. However, after his much-publicized hearings into arbitrary arrests or disappearances, no military or intelligence officer was held accountable, even though he <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1061771/secret-detention-has-no-legal-cover">"loudly opined"</a> in court that the military had been responsible. </p>

                <p>Chaudhry showed political bias by focusing much of his energy on <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1061771/secret-detention-has-no-legal-cover">abuses against Islamists</a>, while saying little about the bombing campaign by Islamist militants that killed tens of thousands and destabilized the country. On attacks on religious minorities and issues that would anger Islamists, he generally chose not to use his <em>suo motu </em>powers or to speak up, such as after the assassination of Punjab Governor Salman Taseer for defending a Christian woman wrongfully accused of blasphemy. At other times, Chaudhry went further: encouraging investigations that endangered public defenders of minority rights, <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/779423/sc-admits-petition-against-sherry-rehman-over-alleged-blasphemy">such as another former ambassador to the US, Sherry Rehman.</a><br />
                    <br />
                    Chaudhry emerged in 2009 as the most powerful civilian Pakistan has seen in decades, and he ultimately was the most unaccountable one. He made repeated political interventions, some populist, others ideologically driven. Until the day he left it, he also used his office to prevent real public debate about himself.  </p>

                <p>Chaudhry's pursuit of judicial politics <em>sans</em> accountability worked for one messianic politicized judge and his quest to grab power, but it does not offer a viable template for preserving or cementing institutional autonomy for his successors. Equally, it would be a tragedy if the judiciary reverted to its erstwhile status as handmaiden of the executive. Chaudhry's successors seem well aware of this conundrum and the poisoned chalice handed to them in the name of judicial independence. Hence, the incumbent chief justice, Tassaduq Hussain Jilani cuts a far more conciliatory figure.   </p>

                <p>Yet those of us in Pakistan who fight for human rights, the rule of law and a working democracy have to hope that the post-Chaudhry's independent judiciary will overcome his excesses and will be led by judges with greater wisdom and fewer biases. Only then can we be sure that this essential institution will be permanently woven into the fabric of Pakistan's democracy. </p>

The court was asked to vacate an appellate court's decision to stay a district court's permanent injunction pending the appellate court's own review of the law on the merits. While the Supreme Court ultimately decided that plaintiffs had not met the heavy burden to overturn an appellate stay in such circumstances, its decision should not be seen as forecasting its views on the constitutionality of the Texas law. Still, the reasoning in Justice Antonin Scalia's concurring opinion, joined only by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, in support of the court's decision exhibits an alarming willingness to permit lower courts to prioritize a state's interest in enforcing a law in the face of a constitutional challenge, even where the rights deprivations that the law will allegedly cause are indisputably irreparable.<br />
                <br />
                In July 2013, the Texas legislature passed <a href="http://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/id/872841">House Bill No. 2</a> ("HB 2"), a bill enacting various restrictions on abortion in the state, including a requirement that all physicians who perform abortions have active admitting privileges at a hospital that provides obstetrical or gynecological services not more than thirty miles from where the abortion is performed. The <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a>, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> and <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> filed suit in September 2013 on behalf of Texas abortion providers and their patients, challenging this provision as unconstitutional because it is without medical justification and because it imposes an undue burden on women seeking to terminate their pregnancies, in violation of the standard set forth in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>. Following a bench trial in October, the federal district court in Austin <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-judge-strikes-down-restrictive-texas-abortion-law.php">issued</a> a <a href="http://howappealing.law.com/PlannedParenthoodVsAbbott-WDTex-102813.pdf">permanent injunction</a> (PDF) against the admitting privileges requirement, finding that "admitting privileges have no rational relationship to improved patient care" and place "an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion" because the requirement would force clinics to close, leaving large parts of the state without an abortion provider.<br />
                <br />
                Within twenty-four hours of the district court's decision, Texas filed an emergency motion with the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, seeking to stay the injunction pending resolution of their appeal, which they requested be heard on an expedited basis. The Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/federal-appeals-court-allows-texas-abortion-restrictions-to-take-effect.php">granted</a> both of the state's requests, calendaring the case for oral argument in early January and taking the extraordinary step of staying the district court's injunction. In so holding, the Fifth Circuit focused almost exclusively on the state's likelihood of success on the merits (an issue which had not yet been fully briefed) despite the well-settled standard clearly laid out in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18140831336757082096">Nken v. Holder</a> that a court must additionally consider (1) whether the party would be irreparably injured absent a stay; (2) whether issuance of a stay would substantially injure other parties; and (3) where the public interest lies. Here, approximately one-third of Texas's abortion clinics would have been forced to stop performing abortions immediately when the law requiring admitting privileges went into effect, leaving women in large swaths of Texas without access to safe and legal abortion, a harm that cannot be remedied at a later date. By contrast, the state's only asserted harm was a generalized interest in enforcing a law. Nonetheless, the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/13/13-51008-CV0.pdf">found</a> (PDF) that the state "necessarily suffers the irreparable harm of denying the public interest in the enforcement of its laws" and that this interest, coupled with the state's likelihood of success on the merits, was enough to outweigh the plaintiffs' "strong showing that their interests would be harmed by staying the injunction." The Fifth Circuit thus stayed the district court's injunction, allowing the admitting privileges requirement to go into effect.<br />
                <br />
                Plaintiffs, in turn, filed an application with Scalia requesting that the Supreme Court overturn the stay entered by the Fifth Circuit. Put differently, plaintiffs asked the court to take the relatively uncommon step of vacating the Fifth Circuit's stay (thereby reinstating the district court's permanent injunction) to immediately preserve the Fifth Circuit's ability to issue a remedy in favor of the plaintiffs and, in the longer term, to guard the Supreme Court's ability to grant plaintiffs' requested relief if <em>certiorari</em> is ultimately granted on the merits. Plaintiffs made this application because the Fifth Circuit's action caused approximately a third of the abortion clinics in Texas to stop performing abortions immediately, thereby preventing women from accessing safe abortion at a rate of about 20,000 women each year, and because some of those clinics would have to close soon and would be unable to reopen even if the law is later struck down, thus rendering the shortage in services and the geographical gaps in coverage permanent.<br />
                <br />
                Despite these facts, five Supreme Court justices voted to deny the plaintiffs' application. Scalia's concurring opinion, joined by Alito and Thomas, suggested that the Fifth Circuit did not commit any cognizable error by failing to preserve the status quo, even where the <strong>only</strong> alleged injury to the state is an inability to enforce the challenged law for several additional months. In so finding, Scalia heavily credited the significance of the state's interest in enforcing its law&#8212;a factor that will <strong>always</strong> weigh in the government's favor in any litigation challenging the constitutionality of a law&#8212;and failed entirely to balance this interest against the likelihood of irreparable injury to the plaintiffs and the women whose constitutional rights they seek to defend.<br />
                <br />
                The Supreme Court's willingness to let stand the Fifth Circuit's stay of the district court's injunction when the balance of harms tilted so heavily against the state could have implications in a variety of contexts where constitutional rights are at stake. Indeed, based on Scalia's reasoning, when a difficult question of law arises in civil rights litigation, an appeals court may stay a district court's injunction, regardless of the extent of the harm to the plaintiffs, because of the strength of the state's interest in enforcing its validly-enacted statutes. Granting such weight to a general interest present in <strong>all</strong> cases where states seek to enforce their laws is hard to square with the requirement laid out in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6367883419698261980">Greene v. Fair</a> that district court decisions should be stayed only in the most "extraordinary" or "exceptional" cases.<br />
                <br />
                Perhaps in an effort to cabin the implications of his analysis, Scalia specifically referenced federalism considerations as support for the Fifth Circuit's decision, suggesting that only an especially high likelihood of success on the merits can trump a state's interest in enforcing its laws. But these principles have no role to play when federal courts are assessing whether state statutes impede rights protected by the US Constitution. An appellate court's review of an application to stay a district court judgment enjoining a statute on constitutional grounds should not vary depending on whether congress or a state government enacted the law at issue.<br />
                <br />
                Finally, while the Supreme Court refused to vacate the Fifth Circuit's stay of the district court's injunction pending appeal, nothing in the concurring opinion indicates that appellate courts confronted with similar applications should follow the same course. Indeed, even Scalia, Alito and Thomas recognized that "reasonable minds can perhaps disagree about whether the Court of Appeals should have granted a stay in this case." Rather, once an appellate court has acted, the burden of overturning such a stay creates a high bar for plaintiffs, making it even more important that appellate courts exercise their power judiciously in cases involving constitutional rights.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.pravo.unizg.hr/tina.orsolic_dalessio?@=6hmn#profile_prikaz_31149">Tina Orsolic Dalessio</a> of the University of Zagreb Faculty of Law argues that while the passage of a Croatia constitutional referendum defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman breaks with the liberal trend of other EU members, it was made possible by Croatia's admittance into the EU and will require action by the parliament if it is to be reversed ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/tinadalessio.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he past few years have been marked by a slow, but continuous strengthening of the rights of same-sex couples&#8212;under both the <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/eu-high-court-rules-same-sex-couples-entitled-to-same-benefits-as-married-couples.php">European Union</a> (EU) and the <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/europe-rights-court-finds-greece-same-sex-civil-unions-ban-unlawful.php">Council of Europe's</a> legal mechanisms. However, in Croatia, the newest EU member state and a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, citizens have <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/croatia-passes-referendum-to-ban-same-sex-marriage.php">recently decided</a> not to follow this liberal trend.</p>

<p>On December 1, 2013, a referendum was held in Croatia to constitutionally define marriage as a union between a man and woman. This was the result of a successful petition circulated by a conservative catholic initiative, "In the Name of the Family," which collected 683,948 signatures in support of holding the referendum. With a population around 4.4 million, this easily satisfied the legal requirement of collecting signatures from 10 percent of the registered voters within two weeks in order to trigger a referendum. </p>

<p>In the referendum, Croatian citizens were asked to decide whether the already existing statutory definition of marriage, as a union between a man and a woman, should now be inserted into the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCsQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sabor.hr%2Ffgs.axd%3Fid%3D17074&ei=ceHdUqekLbStsQSkmoDIDQ&usg=AFQjCNHt8pfFdDQ9o2dtaUwgzigIK-5bRA&sig2=Q0AbPxFKARh5o8bxgu3EjA&bvm=bv.59568121,d.cWc">Constitution of the Republic of Croatia</a> [PDF]. Put simply, they were asked to vote on the introduction of a constitutional ban of same-sex marriage. The majority of those who voted, did so in favor.</p>

<p>Ironically, what indirectly facilitated the passage of this referendum was the legal process and strategy Croatia took in becoming a member of the EU.<br />
 <br />
According to the constitution, a decision concerning the association of the Republic of Croatia into alliances with other states, which would include the EU accession, must be passed by popular referendum. The threshold for the passage of such a referendum used to be set quite high. According to the constitution prior to being amended in 2010, a majority of the total electorate of Croatia was required to vote in favor. In order to ensure Croatia's entrance into the EU, however, the requirement was significantly weakened by constitutional reform in 2010. Pursuant to the amended constitution, the passage of such a referendum was conditioned merely by a majority vote of those taking part in the referendum.</p>

<p>Since the threshold for determining a question of significant constitutional importance was set so low, it did not make sense to keep a higher requirement for other, garden-variety types of referenda. Pursuant to the constitutional provision on the holding of a referendum on proposals to amend the constitution, a bill or any other issue falling within the Croatian Parliament's jurisdiction thus also called for amendment. The old requirement for the passage of such a referendum was the majority of the voters who have voted, provided that a majority of the total electorate had taken part in the referendum. Following the 2010 constitutional reforms, the bar for the passage of such was set much lower: a majority vote of the voters taking part in the referendum. The requirements for the passage of a "regular" referendum were thus equated to those for the passage of a referendum on the association of the Republic of Croatia into alliances with other states.</p>

<p>Just as the parliament had hoped for, this weakening of the constitutional referendum requirements enabled a smooth passage of the referendum held prior to Croatia's joining the EU, thus ensuring its membership in this integration of states. It also, however, enabled the easy passage of the most recent referendum concerning the constitutional definition of marriage. Under the old constitutional standard, this would have been much more difficult, perhaps even impossible given the low turnout. Concretely, the 2013 referendum on the constitutional definition of marriage, or as some like to call it the constitutional ban of gay marriage, was passed by a 65.87 percent majority vote of only 37.90 percent of the eligible voters.</p>

<p>Having realized that the weakened constitutional requirements to pass a referendum could easily become used as a tool for the systemic discrimination of minority groups by the majority, the Croatian government is now proposing yet another constitutional amendment. It is suggesting the adoption of a constitutional ban on regulating minority rights through a referendum. </p>

<p>In the meantime, the government's "Life Partnership" <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/croatia-considers-expanding-rights-for-same-sex-couples.php">proposal</a>, the first draft of which was published in November 2013, has entered the legislative process.</p>

<p>The proposed same-sex partnership legislation, if adopted, would grant new rights to same-sex partners and define them as a family. In essence, the Life Partnership Law would equate rights of homosexual partners to those of married heterosexual partners, except in matters of adoption. The institution of marriage, however, would remain reserved for heterosexual couples. </p>

<p>This legislative proposal has nonetheless sparked a new wave of dissatisfaction and criticism by the conservative Catholic group responsible for initiating the referendum on the constitutional definition of marriage. The representatives of the initiative "In the Name of the Family" insist that the purpose of the referendum was not only to preclude same-sex marriage, but also to prevent same-sex partners from enjoying the same rights as married couples. Thus, they see the proposed law as a betrayal of Croatian voters' trust and have asked the government to reconsider it, which the government has thus far refused to do.</p>

<p>If the adopted, which is likely, "In the Name of the Family" will likely put it up for  assessment of constitutionality. In this case, however, the government is likely to be backed by the Croatian Constitutional Court. </p>

<p>In November 2013, the court issued an <a href="http://sljeme.usud.hr/usud/praksaw.nsf/cda93f94f7a86b1fc1256a7f0042009a/c12570d30061ce54c1257c230044db5d/$FILE/SuS-1-2013%20-%20PRIOP%C4%86ENJE.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF] [Croatian] on the constitutionality of the marriage referendum and a request to block it. The court found that there were no constitutional obstacles that could prevent the referendum from taking place. However, the court also held that the potential insertion of a provision defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman into the constitution must not have any impact on further legislative developments of the institute of common law marriage and same-sex union in accordance with the constitutional provision guaranteeing respect for, and legal protection of, each person's private and family life, as well as human dignity. </p>

<p>The opinion, however, did not play in favor of the most recent complaint lodged before the constitutional court regarding the referendum. On January 9, 2014, the representatives of the Croatian LGBTIQ organization "Zagreb Pride" requested that the court make the final assessment of the constitutionality of the referendum results. This was their third and final attempt at fighting this, as they deem it, "discriminatory referendum." In the <a href="http://sljeme.usud.hr/usud/praksaw.nsf/cda93f94f7a86b1fc1256a7f0042009a/c12570d30061ce54c1257c5f00412add/$FILE/U-VIIR-164-2014.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF] [Croatian] issued on January 13, 2014, the Constitutional Court rejected their complaint on admissibility grounds. </p>

<p>It is now up to the parliament to make a final decision regarding the status of same-sex partners in Croatia. This should determine in which direction the country ultimately moves&#8212;one step forward, or two steps back. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.onu.edu/faculty_staff/faculty_staff_profiles/david_pimentel">David Pimentel</a> of Ohio Northern University's Pettit College of Law argues that South Sudan's rule of law challenges remain a stumbling block to its development and to its capacity for addressing internal conflicts and continuing violence ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/davidpimentel.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he prevailing mood in <a href="/feature/featured/south-sudan/detail.php">South Sudan</a> in 2005 was optimism: the <a href="http://unmis.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=515">Comprehensive Peace Agreement</a> (CPA) had been signed, ending the North-South Civil War, and the UN was there to help with its implementation. The people were celebrating liberation from the oppression of the Islamist Khartoum government, and an end to the bloody conflict against it.</p>

<p>South Sudan was not yet an independent state (that would come in 2011), but under the terms of the CPA, it enjoyed an unprecedented level of regional autonomy. The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), now recast as a civilian government, was busily establishing a new political structure to govern the sovereign south, including the creation of a legislature, a judiciary and all the other organs of government. The long history of inter-tribal conflict in the south&#8212;even that of the Dinkas and the Nuers, the two largest groups&#8212;had been largely pushed aside as Southerners united in their resistance to Khartoum's stranglehold on the region. Even after the war ended, hopes remained high that the hard-won autonomy and regional pride would continue to promote unity and harmony among the various ethnic groups. </p>

<p>Leadership of the SPLA was dominated by the Dinka after Nuer leader Riek Machar split with the SPLA in the 1990s and founded his own rebel group. After independence, and a reconciliation of sorts, Machar assumed the Vice-Presidency of South Sudan, serving alongside President Salva Kiir to form a presidency with both Nuer and Dinka representation; a promising development for promoting peace and cooperation within the newly independent country. </p>

<p>The honeymoon did not last long, however, as Kiir dismissed Machar in July 2013, along with the rest of his cabinet, reorganizing his government and, according to critics, consolidating his power. In December 2013, violence erupted again, this time between the Nuer loyal to Machar and the Kiir regime. This conflict killed thousands, and displaced half a million civilians before a tenuous cease-fire in January 2014 suspended hostilities.</p>

<p>So the region remains volatile; peace and security remain elusive goals. The question is whether the rule of law can help a place like South Sudan, and the degree to which the lack of the rule of law has engendered the conflict-laden status quo.</p>

<p>I arrived in South Sudan in 2006, as the Head of <a href="http://unmis.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=ygNoq2GIWiw%3d&tabid=2165">Rule of Law for South Sudan in the United Nations Mission</a> [PDF] there, with responsibility to help the new South Sudanese government establish its legal system and legal institutions. The CPA had liberated the south from the north's power and influence: South Sudan quickly rejected the Arabic language and the Islamic legal regime that the Khartoum government had, for decades, forced upon them. They adopted English as their official language and scrapped Shari'a altogether. South Sudanese officials announced that they would adopt a common law system, mirroring their southern neighbors and potential trade partners, Kenya and Uganda. The decision to embrace British traditions was ironic, given Africans' general sensibilities about the legacy of colonialism. To the South Sudanese at the time, however, Western European influence seemed benign compared to the oppression they had endured from the Islamists in Khartoum.</p>

<p>But these choices brought a host of challenges that South Sudan was ill-equipped to address. First, necessary human resources were lacking. When the initial judicial appointments were made back in 2006, only about half the vacancies could be filled because of the limited number of trained lawyers qualified for the posts. Later the remaining vacancies were filled, after a second recruitment, but the problems persist. Once all the skilled legal practitioners are placed on the bench, who is left to represent litigants in these courts? </p>

<p>At the same time the majority of these judges and lawyers were schooled solely in Islamic law and were Arabic-speaking (the only law school in South Sudan had been maintained by the Khartoum government not as a College "of Law" but "of Shari'a"). They were entirely unacquainted with common law principles, or how to argue or decide cases in a common law environment. Indeed, without a body of judicial precedent to draw upon, the concept of the "common law" was entirely without foundation. Not surprisingly, the level of dysfunction in these courts&#8212;lacking the physical and financial resources, the human resources, the knowledge base and the body of precedent necessary to make a common law system work&#8212;has been high. The result has been a system that falls far short of hopes and expectations.</p>

<p>But even before the war, the overwhelming majority of legal disputes in South Sudan were, and still are, decided by tribal elders and chiefs in the various ethnic communities scattered across the rural countryside. Villagers bring their disputes to their traditional leaders, who resolve them under principles of "customary law," an oral tradition handed down through the elders of those communities for unnumbered generations. </p>

<p>The customary law regime has been controversial in the human rights community because often these systems fall short of internationally accepted standards of human rights, particularly with respect to the protection of women and children. Some have called for the customary law to be swept aside, and replaced wholesale by a new statutory regime, enforced by regularly constituted statutory courts.</p>

<p>And yet, for most South Sudanese people the customary justice system provides the only access to justice they will ever see. A new common-law-based, adversarial system can do little for the overwhelming majority of South Sudanese, who could never afford legal representation, if they could even manage the travel from their rural villages to the regional centers where such courts are based.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/IMG/pdf/The_Draft_Transitional_Constitution_of_the_ROSS2-2.pdf">Constitution of South Sudan</a> [PDF] raises compelling jurisdictional tensions and choice of law questions as well. The constitution recognizes the legitimacy "of Traditional Authority, according to customary law"&#8212;as do many African constitutions, in an effort to dignify and legitimize indigenous law even as they were casting off the chains of colonial oppression. At the same time, the constitution sets forth a bill of rights that guarantees women "full and equal dignity ... with men." So the tribal elder's decision under customary law has the force of law but, at the same time, may violate the constitution. To enforce the constitutional rights, these cases must end up in statutory courts, at least the Supreme Court, which according to the constitution is "the court of final judicial instance in respect of ... National or state law, including statutory and customary law."  Whether this is done by appeal or, as I have strongly <a href="http://works.bepress.com/david_pimentel/5/">advocated</a>, by collateral review, the procedure has yet to be worked out.</p>

<p>But it is clear that the rule of law in South Sudan depends on the strength and functionality of customary justice. The overwhelming majority of individuals seeking justice, and the society as a whole, lack the resources necessary to make a Western-style common law system effective in addressing the justice needs of the community. Customary law, in contrast, not only is responsive to community needs, but also respects and is respected by local culture. When the war in South Sudan ended in 2005, there was great anticipation of a "peace dividend." Those who had suffered so much during the war, expected their lives to improve when the hostilities stopped. In this, they were largely disappointed. Although there was greater freedom of movement, the most pressing problems in their lives&#8212;hunger, disease, unemployment, poor (if any) public education, bad roads (many of which were heavily mined)&#8212;remained unaffected by the signing of the CPA.</p>

<p>To some degree, the frustration and resentment shifted, therefore, from the Khartoum government, to the leadership of the Government of South Sudan, dominated once again by the Dinka. As early as 2006, there was a popular perception in South Sudan that they were reserving plum government posts for fellow Dinka and feathering their own nests at public expense. Although it is hard to assess the merits of such complaints, the perception alone reinforces the idea that there is no justice even in a newly liberated South Sudan. </p>

<p>The dysfunction that reigns in South Sudan's legal system is hardly the source of the country's problems&#8212;the lack of economic opportunity or infrastructure are hardly the fault of a leadership that inherited a ravaged and war torn society&#8212;but it certainly impedes meaningful solutions. The legal system is but one of many public institutions that are failing to meet society's needs, reinforcing perceptions that those in power enjoy a privileged status at the expense of other ethnic communities in the region. In the presence of such inequality, and a legal system perceived as either unwilling or unable to correct it, it is hardly surprising that the internal conflicts will persist in a place like South Sudan; a society where violent protest and conflict have long been seen as the path to justice, security and prosperity. Hope lies in the commitment of South Sudan's leaders, and given the magnitude of the challenges, in the patience of its people.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Brian Harris, <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/wucl/">Willamette University College of Law</a>, Class of 2014, discusses the many institutional problems faced by foster children with behavioral health issues...<hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Harris.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Harris.jpg" width="120" height="144" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font>pproximately 35 percent of children and teens <a href="http://www.chcs.org/usr_doc/CHCS_CW_Foster_Care_Screening_and_Assessment_Issue_Brief_111910.pdf">enter</a> [PDF] foster care with significant dental and oral health problems. More problematic is the degree of behavioral health issues plaguing children in foster care. Children in foster care represent only three percent of children in Medicaid, yet they represent <a href="http://www.childwelfaresparc.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/medicaid-and-children-in-foster-care.pdf">15 percent</a> [PDF] of Medicaid children using behavioral health services. Many states have aggressively sought to protect the health of children in foster care by tying screening requirements to their <a href="http://www.childwelfaresparc.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/medicaid-and-children-in-foster-care.pdf">Medicaid programs</a> [PDF]. As of 2010, 35 states have enrolled foster care children in Medicaid managed care programs.</p>

<p>Under the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/social_security">Social Security Act</a>, people in Medicaid can receive benefits if the benefits are covered by their state and are deemed <a href="http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/tennessee-s-new-medically-necessary-standard-uncovering-the-insured-policy-brief.pdf">"medically necessary"</a> [PDF] for the person in question. However, states provide the statutory and regulatory definitions of "medically necessary", not the federal government.  </p>

<p>The Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1396d">provisions</a> of federal law create a unique medical necessity standard for children under 21. Under these rules, states are to provide any "necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment and other measures" that are needed to "correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions." Federal law requires coverage even in cases that would be denied to an adult. The result is a mandatory standard of medical necessity that may preempt state definitions as applied to those under 21. In fact, <a href="http://www.leagle.com/decision/19931530836FSupp694_11432">a class action lawsuit</a> forced Arizona to re-tool its <a href="http://www.chcs.org/usr_doc/Making_Medicaid_Work.pdf">definition</a> [PDF] of medical necessity, and a similar <a href="http://www.disabilityrightsohio.org/sites/default/files/doc_185-0%20Plaintiffs%27%20Motion%20for%20Summary%20Judgment_0.pdf">case</a> [PDF] is ongoing in Ohio.</p>

<p>The states use criteria, laid out in their medical necessity definitions, to determine if a preventative treatment is necessary to a child in foster care. Preventative treatments, such as Comprehensive Child Family Treatment (CCFT), have shown <a href="http://dc.etsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3661&context=etd">great success</a> stabilizing children with severe behavioral problems.  </p>

<p>For example, Oregon <a href="http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/rules/oars_400/oar_410/410_120.html">defines</a> "medically appropriate" treatments as those that are consistent with a health or mental condition, are appropriate standards of good health practice and are recognized treatments, are not done solely for convenience and are the most cost effective choice.  </p>

<p>Tennessee defines "medical necessity" <a href="http://www.lawserver.com/law/state/tennessee/tn-code/tennessee_code_71-5-144">statutorily.</a> Tennessee's coverage is generally more restrictive than Oregon. Tennessee provides TennCare, the agency running the state Medicaid program, some discretion towards deciding what constitutes <a href="http://www.lawserver.com/law/state/tennessee/tn-code/tennessee_code_71-5-107">medical necessity.</a> TennCare used its discretion to add permanency to the criteria for determining medical necessity for foster care children. </p>

<p>Moreover, TennCare, through an interagency agreement with Tennessee's Department of Child Services, coordinates enrollment and ongoing health services for all children in state custody. TennCare is notified as soon as a child enters state custody and assigns the child immediate Medicaid eligibility and a primary care practitioner (PCP) to serve as a medical home. PCPs are members of TennCare Select's Best Practice Network of physicians, dentists and behavioral health care providers who have agreed to serve the health care needs of children in foster care.</p>

<p>Arizona has taken the unique approach to enroll foster care children into a single Medicaid health plan specifically tailored for them. After <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16794804442305703851">JK v. Dillenberg</a>, Arizona re-tooled its medical necessity definition to be based on the principles of individualized services that are tailored to the needs of each child and family and are coordinated in accordance with the best practices in the most appropriate setting. Arizona's principles led to the development of Medicaid benefits with a broad array of home-and community-based services and supports, as well as jointly developed goals and protocols by behavioral health and child welfare. Moreover, Arizona has empowered child and family teams to determine medical necessity for the service plans. Service plans developed by the child and family teams are considered Medicaid "authorized" services. A few designated services&#8212;inpatient hospitalization, residential treatment, group home care and psychotropic medications&#8212;still require prior authorization outside of the teams. </p>

<p>Even though seemingly arbitrary, the varying state definitions of medical necessity can have a big impact. The small amount of discretion provide by Tennessee has increased treatment success. Oregon's standard has resulted in the ceasing of funds once a child is stabilized. Oregon's standard neglects a major root cause of behavior problems afflicting children in foster care&#8212;the lack of permanency. Permanency is essential to a child's wellbeing and is the primary goal in juvenile dependency. Oregon's definition results in the treating of the symptoms rather than a root cause. Children placed back into unstable conditions are likely to regress to pre-treatment behaviors. Arizona was forced to revise its standard due to litigation over its definition. The revised standard for children under 21 has led to a robust system that promotes a wide array of services tailored to an individual's needs.</p>

<p>Oregon and other states can receive the same results experienced by Tennessee and Arizona by revising their definitions of medical necessity. For example, Oregon can revise their laws to include permanency as a criterion for children in foster care. Other states can adopt Arizona's principles and funding structure to develop an individually focused system. Furthermore, with increasing litigation over whether state medical necessity standards conflict with the federal EPSDT standard, states like Oregon should re-evaluate their definitions to lower the risk of litigation. </p>

                <p>Representatives from the Abolitionist Law Center joined JURIST podcast moderator Ian Everhart to discuss their efforts at reform in the Pennsylvania criminal justice and prison system in this episode. ALC Executive Director Bret Grote and ALC staff attorney Dustin McDaniel shared information about their organization, the mission of which is to abolish "class and race based mass incarceration in the United States."</p>

                <p>Grote and McDaniel shared information about Russell Maroon Shoatz, currently a plaintiff in a case filed by the ALC against the state prison system. Shoatz was convicted of homicide in the 1970s, escaped from prison twice and was placed in solitary confinement after he became involved with a prisoners' rights movement as an inmate. Grote and McDaniel argue that the state prison system's treatment of Shoatz, who has now spent decades in solitary confinement with no history of disciplinary problems, is unconstitutional.</p>

                <p>Grote and McDaniel also discussed a case involving inmates' First Amendment rights to receive news and other material related to prisoners' rights. <span class="casename">Holbrook v. Jellen</span> challenges the way prison censors restrict mail sent to inmates; in particular, they object to the prison officials' determination that certain politically-oriented documents are likely to encourage disruptions among the prison population.</p>

		<title>Syrian Executions May Amount to War Crimes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.niu.edu/law/faculty/directory/morse_tan.shtml">Morse Tan</a> of Northern Illinois College of Law argues that the atrocities in Syria present a complex problem in international law that must be navigated so the people of the embattled nation may be protected  ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/morsetan.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>ver 100,000 people have lost their lives in atrocities committed during the ongoing Syrian civil war. Over 40 percent of the population find themselves displaced. The Syrian government has repeatedly been implicated for war crimes, and has been a frequent subject of UN warnings, condemnations and resolutions. On January 17, government opposition forces had their turn to be <a href="http://www.unog.ch/unog/website/news_media.nsf/%28httpNewsByYear_en%29/F60C4C33C0E42951C1257C630056DB68?OpenDocument">warned</a> by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay. The warning comes after the latest example of unfettered violence and disregard for international law during this conflict&#8212committed by opposition forces in the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp outside Damascus.</p>

<p>Particularly, Pillay indicates that humanitarian aid attempts by the UN have been violently blocked, leading to starvation of innocent civilians. Opposition violations may constitute war crimes, the High Commissioner warned, and perpetrators must be held accountable. From obstruction of vital aid, attacking relief workers and ultimately the starvation of innocent civilians, the opposition forces have violated international law and arguably committed war crimes. Humanitarian efforts to deliver vital supplies, such as food, must not be obstructed, and no harm should be directed at those who bravely provide aid, lest the perpetrators transgress international law. </p>

<p>Violent and successful efforts to deprive innocent civilians life-saving and sustaining supplies has become starvation as a method of warfare, also <a href="http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/print/v2_rul_rule53">prohibited</a> by international law. In the context of war, widespread death by starvation has amounted to mass execution of innocent civilians, and arguably, war crimes committed by perpetrators. The warning comes as the approximately 18,000 remaining in the camp are unable to leave and access to food and medicine has been blocked. As recently as <a href="http://www.unog.ch/unog/website/news_media.nsf/%28httpNewsByYear_en%29/F60C4C33C0E42951C1257C630056DB68?OpenDocument">December 2012</a>, the population in Yarmouk numbered 160,000 prior to a mass displacement. </p>

<p>Rampant violations of international law on the part of the Syrian government and opposition forces have been widely reported and condemned repeatedly by the UN and the international community. Even if a mere fraction of violations reported by reliable sources prove approximately accurate, both the government and the opposition are guilty of committing war crimes. Syrian government forces, in official and unofficial capacities, and opposition forces, in their multiple factions, have extrajudicially executed over 100,000 people. </p>

<p>High Commissioner Pillay calls for full accountability for all parties violating international law. The reasonable call for accountability and an end to violence illustrates complex challenges in theory and practice under international law.  The Syrian Civil War presents a myriad of theoretical paths, many with practical dead ends. UN resolutions, imposition of sanctions, and nongovernment organization (NGO) condemnations may serve to dissuade further violations. International law provisions under the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/about%20the%20court/Pages/about%20the%20court.aspx">Rome Statute</a> create the authority to prosecute perpetrators of war crimes. The <a href="http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/about-rtop/the-un-and-rtop">Responsibility to Protect</a> (R2P) adopted by the UN provides guidance on the role of the international community where the government has clearly failed to protect its people. The atrocities of the Syrian crisis constitute a human rights crisis warranting modern day international humanitarian intervention to protect the civilian victims trapped in the middle of two enemies unwilling to distinguish them from combatants. </p>

<p>UN action has included resolutions and condemnations of the above acts as each came to light. Arguably, most have been ignored thus far. Economic sanctions imposed by various countries and rebukes from NGOs have not dissuaded the parties from violence, even amongst and within the rebel coalition. The September 2013 <a href="http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_res_2118.pdf">UN Resolution 2118</a> [PDF] marks a positive step toward potential progress. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/sc11135.doc.htm">affirmed</a> the resolution as "the first hopeful news on Syria in a long time," but said, even amidst this important initial action, that "we must never forget that the catalogue of horrors in Syria continues with bombs and tanks, grenades and guns." He continued to state that the plan to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons is "not a license to kill with conventional weapons". The resolution passed with votes from both China and Russia, focusing on destruction of chemical weapons in Syria. It marks movement in a positive direction, as the Syrian military used chemical agents to perpetrate an August 2013 massacre, which killed an estimated 1,500 people. The mass execution of innocent children, among the victims, provoked outrage around the world. This news stunned some people previously unaware of the humanitarian crisis in Syria. </p>

<p>Government and opposition forces ignored previous resolutions and condemnations, as the focus shifted to impose chemical weapons destruction on the Syrian government. The rebel coalition has reportedly attacked the Christian minority more than the government forces. However, the resolution cannot legally reach the opposition coalition, as they do not constitute a valid entity to which international law applies&#8212;unless they become the next government of Syria.  </p>

<p>The International Criminal Court (ICC), created by the Rome Statute, presents another possible tool of accountability to prosecute perpetrators of war crimes. However, since Syria has not ratified the Rome Statute, prosecution by the ICC must come through a referral by the UN Security Council. An affirmative Security Council vote for referral remains unlikely since Russia and China hold veto power. While the ICC primarily provides an ex post measure, with no immediate assurance of safeguarding civilians targeted by violence, it may aid the peace negotiations or serve to deter further crimes against humanity, even if prosecution before the ICC becomes simply a plausible possibility in the minds of the perpetrators.</p>

<p>The current situation in Syria remains dire, and the measures mentioned above have failed to provide adequate ex ante means to stop the war crimes, calling for possible action under the doctrine of Responsibility to Protect (R2P).  R2P stems from the 2005 UN World Summit and includes core guidelines or the, "Three Pillars," for the international community regarding intervention on humanitarian grounds. Pillar One: the state holds a primary responsibility to protect its population against war crimes; Pillar Two: the international community assists with the responsibility, including through capacity building; Pillar Three: where the state fails to protect, the international community must collectively undertake additional measures. R2P constitutes a modern variation on the doctrine of international humanitarian intervention to protect civilian victims.</p>

<p>The ongoing atrocities in Syria illustrate an utter failure of the government to protect its population, which crumbles Pillar One. Those who have survived the atrocities have largely fallen victims of displacement, illness, or starvation. Over 100,000, reportedly a conservative and non-current figure, have not survived. A perpetrator of war crimes on its own people, the Syrian government not only intentionally has failed to protect, it has affirmatively harmed. <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/war-crimes-experts-find-clear-evidence-of-syria-violations.php">New evidence</a> illustrates the horrific extent of a particular program of systemic torture, starvation and execution. </p>

<p>While the Syrian government holds the primary responsibility to protect its people from ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity, the international community holds a concomitant responsibility to assist the State, as outlined in Pillar Two. The international community has repeatedly acted with diplomatic, humanitarian, and peaceful efforts to assist the Syrian government in protecting its people&#8212;at great risk and to the point of exhaustion. Aid workers as well as civilians find themselves subjected to the deadly crossfire of their own government as well as to the opposition forces. The international community has made some laudable efforts, but has not succeeded in stopping the massive bloodshed still transpiring. </p>

<p>When a State has failed to protect its population, and countless international efforts to assist do not provide a sufficient remedy, the international community is prepared to "take collective action, in a timely and decisive manner" in accordance with <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Chapter VII of the UN Charter</a>. Pillar Three remains the giant pillar standing in the international room. What does further action entail and how must it be considered and then implemented? Does the international community have the backbone to protect&#151with the potential economic and casualty costs? An ounce of ex ante prevention can provide more benefit than a pound of ex post cure. </p>

<p>Just as the international community would have to address the meaning in practice, the current <a href="http://www.unog.ch/unog/website/news_media.nsf/%28httpNewsByYear_en%29/A149A6EA1C89C59CC1257C6800685BAA?OpenDocument">Geneva Conference on Syria</a> provides a possibility of a diplomatic resolution. If the Syrian and main opposition delegations can agree on any measures to end the war, one hurdle has been cleared.  Whether they adhere to any agreement remains a major question. One way or another, the Syrian people must be protected: for many of them, it is literally a matter of life or death. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/about/legal-team/">Robert Popper</a> of <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/">Judicial Watch</a> defends the recent changes to Kansas' voter registration process...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/robertpopper.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>K</strong></font>ansas' decision to implement a <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-kansas-voter-registration-system.php">two-tiered system</a> for voter registration is a rational&#8212;and perfectly legal&#8212;response to a lawless situation that it did not create. Its decision must be understood within the larger context of the ongoing battle between the Obama administration and the states over the enforcement of both our immigration laws and our election integrity laws.</p>

                <p>Bluntly put, the administration has drastically scaled back, and to some extent abandoned, its immigration-related enforcement efforts. Worse, it has started lawsuits against states that seek to take up the slack by enforcing federal immigration laws within their borders. US Senator Jeff Sessions has put together a helpful timeline of the Obama administration's "<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/366776/timeline-obama-administrations-war-immigration-enforcement-andrew-stiles">War on Immigration Enforcement</a>." It is worth reading in its entirety, but to get a sense of this administration's priorities a few highlights stand out:</p>

                <p>In 2009, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security told employers and pro-amnesty groups that "we're not doing raids or audits under this administration." In January 2012, a report by the Inspector General revealed that officials of the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/">US Citizenship and Immigration Service</a> (USCIS) pressured employees to approve applications that should have been denied. In April 2012, the administration announced that it would reduce National Guard troops stationed at the border from 1,200 to 300. That same month, <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) officials offered to voluntarily close over 16,500 deportation cases pending background checks. In December 2012, ICE implemented an astonishing new policy that barred its agents from detaining unlawfully present aliens for illegally entering the country or for having false papers. Thereafter, they could be detained only for the commission of (another) crime. In February 2013, the USCIS released statistics showing that deferred action had been granted (at that point) to 199,460 unlawfully present aliens. And on and on.</p>

                <p>In one policy action after another, the relevant officials made enforcement weaker, detention harder, and <em>de facto</em> amnesty more common. The administration stood idly by while local policies were enacted for the same purpose. For example, the Obama administration ignored decisions by the District of Columbia to stop enforcing immigration laws and by New York City and Los Angeles to ignore ICE detainers. However, if a state sought to <em>more</em> actively enforce immigration efforts, the Department of Justice (DOJ) sprang into action. The DOJ sued Arizona, Alabama and Utah to stop their enforcement of the immigration laws.</p>

                <p>The Obama administration also has neglected its responsibility to enforce federal election integrity laws. To prevent voter fraud and ensure elections are fair, states are obligated to coordinate voter list maintenance programs and maintain accurate state voter registration rolls under Section 8 of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/nvra/activ_nvra.php">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</a> (NVRA). While the DOJ historically has brought lawsuits and exercised its jurisdiction to ensure states are complying with Section 8, the Obama administration has <a href="http://www.vitter.senate.gov/newsroom/press/vitter-doj-cant-just-pick-and-choose-which-voter-registration-laws-to-enforce">failed to do so</a>.</p>

                <p>The administration's view of both immigration and election integrity issues was on display when the DOJ participated as a friend of the court (and argued in behalf of the plaintiffs) in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14763185671625765035">Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc</a>. The plaintiffs there had sued Arizona over its plans to require proof of citizenship when registering with a federal voter registration form. The US Supreme Court duly held that federal officials had the authority to determine the content of that federal form. Of course, this administration has no intention of changing that form to require proof of citizenship. </p>

                <p>That dispute is not over. The Supreme Court also held that Arizona may renew its request that federal officials include proof of citizenship in the form's state-specific instructions. Because those officials recently denied the request of Arizona, Georgia and Kansas to change the form, there may be <a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/20140117%20EAC%20Final%20Decision%20on%20Proof%20of%20Citizenship%20Requests%20-%20FINAL.pdf">further judicial review</a> (PDF) of that decision.</p>

                <p>Kansas' decision to establish a dual registration process allows it to require the proof of citizenship on its state registration forms that it cannot (yet) require on its federal forms. It is a rational decision, given the federal government's unwillingness to enforce immigration laws generally and given the Supreme Court's most recent holding in the Arizona case.</p>

                <p>From a legal standpoint, there is nothing inherently wrong with a dual registration system. Two previous cases out of Mississippi where dual registration systems were struck down involved violations of particular laws that have no application whatsoever in Kansas. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=167832567080258143">Young v. Fordice</a>, the issue was whether the state had passed the law without obtaining the pre-clearance required under Section 5 of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/intro/intro_b.php">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA). Kansas has never been subject to the pre-clearance requirements of Section 5&#8212;indeed, no state is subject to those requirements now because the trigger for Section 5 was struck down last year in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4053797526279899410">Shelby County v. Holder</a>. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12112156054997561686">Operation PUSH v. Allain</a>, the registration system at issue was held to violate Section 2 of the VRA under a completely different set of facts with no relevance to Kansas.</p>

                <p>No VRA claim has been (or could be) asserted against Kansas' dual registration system. The American Civil Liberties Union's (ACLU) own <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/dual_reg_petition_final_-_file_stamped_11-21-13.pdf">lawsuit</a> (PDF) does not make a claim under the VRA or under any other federal law. Nor could such a claim be made. The Supreme Court made clear in <span class="casename">Young</span> that there is no inherent problem with a dual registration system, when it observed that, "[i]f Mississippi means that the NVRA does not forbid two systems and that &#167; 5 of the VRA does not categorically&#8212;<em>without more</em>&#8212;forbid a [s]tate to maintain a dual system, we agree."</p>

                <p>It is a fact that non-citizens have cast fraudulent ballots in US elections. In 2005, the Government Accountability Office <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05956.pdf">found</a> (PDF) that perhaps three percent of 30,000 persons called for jury duty from voter registration rolls in a single US district court were not US citizens. Instances of non-citizen voting are now a feature of every election. Michigan Secretary of State Ruth Johnson asked her attorney general to investigate ten non-citizens who voted in Michigan elections. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted was able to confirm that at least seventeen non-citizens voted in Ohio in the 2012 presidential election. A 2012 Philadelphia City Commissioner <a href="http://media.philly.com/documents/Voting+Irregularities+Report.pdf">report</a> (PDF) on voter fraud confirmed that nineteen non-citizens were registered in the city, with at least seven voting. A Bosnian citizen was among those illegally registering and voting in Iowa.</p>

                <p>Kansas seeks to uphold its interest in honest elections by requiring proof of citizenship in order to register and vote in state elections. It has a legitimate interest in doing so. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9378098557660608267">Crawford v. Marion County Election Board</a>, the US Supreme Court held that a state has an interest both in preventing voter fraud and in enhancing public confidence in the integrity of elections. Kansas' actions also will have the effect of bolstering the enforcement of federal immigration and voting laws that the Obama administration does not care to enforce.</p>

                <p>An interesting contrast can be made with Takoma Park, Maryland, where that city, for reasons of its own, has determined that non-citizens are eligible to vote in its elections. Because non-citizens are not eligible to vote in any other Maryland elections, Takoma Park has to have a separate list to keep track of non-citizen registrations.</p>

                <p>In other words, Takoma Park has instituted a dual registration system. Its efforts have not drawn the attention of either the DOJ or the ACLU, presumably because its system is intended to make it possible for non-citizens to vote. This suggests that the problem that the ACLU has with Kansas' system is not with the fact that it is a dual registration system, but with its purpose.</p>

                <p>Kansas' dual registration system is both legal and sensible.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Reid Murdoch, <a href="http://www.law.umich.edu/Pages/default.aspx">University of Michigan Law School</a> Class of 2016, explores the economic and political ramifications with recreational marijuana use being legalized in Colorado and Washington...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="murdoch.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/murdoch.jpg" width="180" height="141" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he legalization of recreational cannabis by Colorado and Washington voters in November 2012 created an unsustainable tension between state and federal power. The state reforms created <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4174729399921228676">no "positive conflict" of law</a>, because residents can <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2012/11/12/can-the-feds-stop-colorado-and-washingto">comply with both federal and state law</a> at the same time by not participating in the cannabis business. While the reforms were thus in no immediate judicial danger, one of two consequences was inevitable: either the states would proceed with legalized pot or federal law would stop the trend short. The fate of the ballot initiatives was contingent not on their legal survival, but on overcoming the pre-existing institutional barriers to a regulated market. Federal enforcement of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/812">Controlled Substances Act (CSA)</a>, related money laundering and tax provisions and requirements for educational institutions all pointed to the reforms' death. Recent developments have turned the tide in the other direction.</p>

<p><strong>Ball in Obama's Court: The Executive Branch Must Respond</strong></p>

<p>As federal issues, these institutional barriers were largely under the control of the Obama administration. While the President favored decriminalization early in his political career, by 2008 he <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2008/02/04/barack-obama-on-weed">reversed his stance.</a> In the fall of 2012, the veranda was precarious at best. Earlier that year, the Obama administration actually <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/obamas-war-on-pot-20120216">ramped up enforcement efforts.</a> All summer, US Attorneys' Offices (USAOs) had been <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/11/harborside-health-center-_0_n_1666850.html">seizing assets</a> of even the most (state) law-abiding and respected medical marijuana dispensaries despite <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/08/medical-marijuana-federal-interference_n_1137745.html">assurances to the contrary</a> (the Ogden memo). Sure enough, within days of the ballot measures' passage, the Department of Justice affirmed it would <a href="http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/11/doj-federal-marijuana-enforcement-remains-unchanged-148901.html">continue to enforce the CSA.</a></p>

<p>In December 2012, Obama expressed a new cautious <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/14/nation/la-na-obama-legal-marijuana-20121215">willingness to acquiesce to Colorado and Washington.</a> The shift reflected the <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/159152/americans-federal-gov-state-marijuana-laws.aspx">views of most Americans</a> at the time: states' rights should be respected in regards to marijuana. Though a Congressional amendment would completely resolve the tension, discretionary enforcement was now on the table as a federal comprise.</p>

<p><strong>Discretionary Federal Enforcement: An Inevitable Solution</strong></p>

<p>On August 29, 2013, the Department of Justice notified federal prosecutors of a new internal policy, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/August/13-opa-974.html">Cole memo.</a> US Attorneys were no longer to file cannabis cases in legalization states, except those falling within eight identified enforcement guidelines. A conference call with Governors Hickenlooper and Inslee suggested the DOJ was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/29/politics/holder-marijuana-laws/">serious about its intentions.</a> If Colorado and Washington proved they could effectively regulate cannabis in their states, federal enforcement would be reserved for cases seen as endangering public safety, such as those involving firearms and interstate trafficking.</p>

<p>The lack of a positive legal conflict, owing to the language of the CSA, limited federal options to stop the new laws. Yet, the directives in the Cole memo remained "guidelines." These vague enforcement priorities, reformers worried, could easily be stretched to target seemingly law-abiding cannabis retailers, as had occurred with medical marijuana and the Ogden memo in 2012. Prohibition, however, would create problems for federal law enforcement officials concerned with national security. Unlike medical marijuana, legalized recreational cannabis will be utilized by large swaths of the population in those states. Nearly $2.5 billion in legal cannabis is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/04/marijuana-market_n_4209874.html">projected</a> to be sold this year alone.</p>

<p>In a comprehensive April 2013 paper for the Brookings Institute, <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/04/11-marijuana-policy-taylor">Stuart Taylor, Jr.</a> argued that backing state regulation was Obama's only sensible option. Legal markets were scheduled to go live on January 1, with state officials actively creating regulatory schemes designed to comply with the Cole memo. If the DOJ were to go forward with prosecuting retailers in compliance with state laws, the market would shift back underground, a wholly <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/jacobsullum/2013/09/18/tolerating-pot-with-a-frown-why-the-feds-had-little-choice-but-to-let-legalization-happen-n1702739/page/full">unappealing consequence.</a> Encouraging states to heavily regulate their markets, on the other hand, would promote accountability and safe practices while preserving an aura of law and order. It became clear to the Justice Department that cracking down now would only sow chaos. Obama's best move would be allowing states to proceed, carefully tracking their regulatory effectiveness while using narrow discretion in filing cannabis cases.</p>

<p><strong>Dismantling Remaining Institutional Barriers to Regulation</strong></p>

<p>As foreshadowed by Deputy Attorney General James Cole, the most worrisome difficulty in keeping the industry safe was access to <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_24057692/congress-looks-at-justices-marijuana-decision">banking.</a> Dating back to alcohol prohibition, financial institutions and servicers kept a healthy distance from assets arguably derived from illicit substances. The Obama administration did itself no favors in this area in its handling of medical marijuana in the early 2010s: banks and credit card companies shut their doors to dispensaries after federal threats of money laundering charges.</p>

<p>As the amendments take effect, recreational cannabis retailers have been forced to operate as cash-only businesses. While this may not be an issue for your neighborhood cafe, pot shops will regularly pass tens of thousands of dollars, and criminals know it. Recognizing the enormous public safety hazard created by heaps of unsecured cash, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that regulations have been successfully worked out to allow law-abiding pot shops to <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2014/01/holder-feds-to-let-banks-handle-pot-money-181777.html?hp=l2">utilize national-scale banking services.</a></p>

<p>Regulation is thus seen as the removal of institutional barriers such that cannabis markets to operate safely above ground. While the new discretionary federal enforcement regime and liberalized banking are major steps in the right direction, institutional obstacles remain. While cannabis remains a Schedule I federally prohibited drug, any entity that has a relationship with the federal government will be wary of appearing to bless legalized pot. Educational institutions, in particular, are now feeling the tension. For example, any 21-year-old in Colorado may now legally possess cannabis, rendering its status analogous to alcohol. Any college student will, however, still receive a <a href="http://aod.colorado.edu/penalties">disciplinary violation</a> if found with cannabis on the property of either of Colorado's <a href="http://www.colostate.edu/announcements/ammendment64.aspx">public universities.</a> Washington colleges have similarly <a href="http://www.usatodayeducate.com/staging/index.php/pulse/colorado-and-washington-colleges-unwavering-on-marijuana-policies">declined</a> to adapt their policies thus far.</p>

<p>Institutions of higher education (IHEs), like banks, are acting conservatively, because their relationship with the federal government creates a presumption of financial liability. The <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/pg51.html">Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (DFSCA)</a> requires IHEs to maintain policies prohibiting illicit drug and alcohol use, made public and to be enforced with consequences. <a href="http://counsel.cua.edu/fedlaw/nacuanotesdrugfreeschools.cfm">Noncompliance</a> may result in loss of eligibility for Federal Student Aid and other grants. The exact language of the provision, however, is ambiguous enough that an IHE could plausibly formulate a student conduct code simultaneously permitting cannabis possession by those of age and complying with the DFSCA. Furthermore, any perceived threat of loss of aid is unsubstantiated: as reported by <a href="http://ssdp.org/documents/SSDP_DFSCA_PolicyBrief_2012.pdf">Devon Tackels</a> [PDF] with Students for Sensible Drug Policy, no IHE has ever lost federal assistance for a DFSCA violation.</p>

<p>A final institutional barrier for the regulated market is the tax code. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/280E">26 U.S.C. 280E</a> prohibits tax deductions for business expenses "trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of schedule I and II of the Controlled Substances Act) which is prohibited by Federal law or the law of any State in which such trade or business is conducted." By the letter of 280E, cannabis business are currently stuck with enormous tax burdens. One possible workaround cogently argued by law professor <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2226416">Benjamin Leff</a> is for businesses to apply for <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501">501(c)(4)</a> status as a non-profit social welfare organization. Other <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2013/04/25/harvard-law-school-offers-tax-planning-for-marijuana-dealers-no-joke/">loopholes</a> have been proposed, but the only long-term solution, barring an act of Congress, is for the IRS to come out in favor of a narrow 280E interpretation excepting cannabis businesses that are otherwise permitted to operate vis-a-vis federal discretion.</p>

<p>The last true obstacle to legalized and regulated cannabis is, in fact, its Schedule I status under the CSA. As of last fall, a sound majority of Americans <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/165539/first-time-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspx">support legalization.</a> Support from public officials is also growing, with major Congressional players such as <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-marijuana-laws-20140120,0,4841538.story#axzz2rHbbhD8T">Harry Reid</a> reversing long-held stances in the last week. Despite gradually dismantling institutional barriers, the Obama administration's recent rhetoric on the issue has been schizophrenic. Leading up to the announcements on liberalized banking, Obama proclaimed that marijuana is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-marijuana-alcohol-colorado-washington-weed-pot-2014-1">less dangerous</a> to the individual user than alcohol. This proposition is inconsistent with the criteria for keeping a substance in Schedule I. Likewise, on January 19, Obama voiced his <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2014/01/19/obama-on-marijuana-legalization-its-important-for-it-to-go-forward/">support</a> for legalization, but the White House <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/22/obama-marijuana-legalization_n_4647523.html">quickly reneged.</a></p>

<p>The future of legalization remains to be seen, but with the Colorado market already running, and Washington following suit this spring, <a href="http://www.thedailychronic.net/2013/17214/washington-delays-pot-cultivation-licenses-legal-marijuana-sales-delayed-till-spring/">barriers</a> to total regulation are likely on their last legs. As political and fiscal pressure increase, the Obama administration may have to choose between removing cannabis from Schedule I of the CSA, and creating a legal conflict of its own.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/people/academic/smh-nouwen/40">Sarah Nouwen</a> of the University of Cambridge Faculty of Law argues that the challenge facing both South Sudan and the international community is to ensure the South Sudanese right to decide on a future they want  ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/sarahnouwen.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>hese days are crucial for South Sudan. The most immediate question is whether the <a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan-republic/south-sudanese-parties-sign-agreements-cessation-hostilities-and">agreement on a cessation of hostilities</a>, signed on January 23 between the Government of the Republic of South Sudan (GoRSS) and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM/A) in Opposition, will bring an end to the fighting that has killed tens of thousands and has displaced hundreds of thousands of people since mid-December. But at least as important as the developments on the ground is the way that the conflict in South Sudan is analyzed, framed and acted upon by the South Sudanese themselves, foreign affairs policymakers, international activists, newspapers and the international public. That analysis, those frames and those actions will shape how the conflict is addressed, perpetuated or entrenched. </p>

<p>The civil war into which South Sudan has spiraled since December 15, 2013 was triggered by a political crisis, is fueled by a state-building crisis and deepens a societal crisis. At the heart of the political crisis is that the ruling party, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, has not been able to transform a politics of fighting against an external enemy&#8212;the Government of Sudan in Khartoum&#8212;into a politics of identifying and realizing a society's common goods. Its politics has instead degraded into a politics of a struggle for power between various factions, based on rivalries that already existed during the several-decades-long war with Khartoum. </p>

<p>The civil war has also revealed a crisis in state building, most clearly manifested by the position of the national army. Rather than a united national army with soldiers loyal to the centralized command, the SPLM/A remains, as during the war with the Government of Sudan, a collection of armed groups whose loyalty is dependent on personal ties to commanders and pay-outs. The result is a fissiparous and unaccountable army over which the GoRSS has limited control.</p>

<p>The third crisis that the civil war has laid bare is a societal one. Despite the hard work of a relatively vibrant civil society, the fabric of South Sudanese society is still heavily damaged by years of south-south violence during the war with Khartoum. As a result, the present social fabric is too weak to resist political and institutional crises. When the elites' disputes turn violent and the army begins to disintegrate, society also breaks up, with groups following those leaders and units that seem to offer most protection. In moments of existential threat, and in the absence of other forms of protection, ethnic ties easily become the organizing principle. </p>

<p>Confronted with this crisis, many international actors have called for action. The calls reverberate not just a desire to address the suffering of the South Sudanese, victims of yet another seemingly intractable crisis in Africa, but also a sense of disappointment. The independence of South Sudan was heavily supported by western actors who, perhaps too easily, constructed the civil war in Sudan as one of an evil government in Khartoum that suppressed innocent Southerners, thereby ignoring that the SPLM/A was deeply divided, had itself committed numerous brutalities, too, and was more about gaining territory than liberating people, its name notwithstanding. In this analysis, independence of South Sudan was an obvious solution. The fact that two years after its independence South Sudan is in arms again reveals the flaws of that paradigm. But the sense of failure of "our South Sudan project" has intensified calls for immediate action. </p>

<p>The core parts of the action called for are military (expand the number of peacekeepers), diplomatic (engage in peace talks) and, most relevant to this blog, legal (ensure accountability). On the one hand, this response is little surprising: these are today's most common components of responses to crises: peacekeepers are supposed to protect civilians, talks are meant to make the fighters stop fighting and accountability involves punishing perpetrators (often it is suggested that those who started the fighting should be held to account, but beginning a civil war is as such not an international crime). Of all these responses, accountability is the most retrospective: while consequentalist reasoning counts on punishment for deterring future violations of international law, accountability's dominant rationale is deontological, according to which crimes must be responded to for the sake of the response. </p>

<p>Undoubtedly, each of these responses could do some good. But before setting them, and particularly the accountability train, in motion, three warnings must be considered. </p>

<p>First, when proposing and deciding upon these responses we must ask whether they are actions based upon an analysis of the specifics of the South Sudan conflict or more reactions stemming from a desire on the part of the intervenor to at least do something. Peacekeepers, peace talks and accountability often fall in the latter category: they show involvement, compassion, and, in the case of accountability, a moral high ground&#8212;if we cannot prevent, then at least we should not condone. But these responses do not necessarily help address the crises that the civil war has laid bare.  </p>

<p>Second, while these responses can be useful and indeed sometimes necessary as intermediate steps, experience has shown that there is a huge risk of path dependency: peacekeepers, peace talks and accountability turn from instruments into aims and the responses themselves, rather than an analysis of the conflict, begin to frame the conflict and its trajectory. For instance, as the situation in Darfur has painfully illustrated, a referral of a situation to the ICC means that, as of then, the conflict will at least partially be analyzed through a criminal lens; at times at the cost of a political lens. Applying the criminal lens would mean seeing the conflict in South Sudan as one of a combination of crimes, committed by people with a criminal mind-set. This perspective blinds us to the political, institutional and societal crises that have been set out above. Even if those other, more structural, perspectives are given attention, action upon them may be obstructed by earlier responses. For instance, as illustrated by the 2006-2008 Juba peace talks concerning the Lord's Resistance Army, once an international criminal court is involved, it will impact on, and indeed claim legal primacy over, any political track. </p>

<p>Third, what will any of these responses mean for the one necessity that emerges from the three crises in South Sudan, namely the urgent need for a revitalization of South Sudanese politics? Many of the proposed responses risk displacing South Sudanese politics by seeking external solutions. Even any possible future peace talks between the GoRSS and SPLM/A in Opposition on substantive issues would not revive South Sudanese politics. While essential for reaching a ceasefire, these parties lack the legitimacy and unity to address the political, institutional and societal crises. </p>

<p>Such political revival is also essential for any possible future transitional justice effort. Transitional justice efforts require a high degree of domestic political consensus or the efforts themselves divide rather than unite. Establishing that domestic consensus through a national political process is thus a quintessential first step of any possible future transitional justice framework. </p>

<p>In sum, while immediate calls for seemingly forceful measures such as peacekeepers, peace talks and accountability are understandable, decisions on these measures should primarily be informed by how they would relate to addressing the crises that the South Sudanese civil war has exposed. </p>

<p>In designing responses, one useful guideline might be the same principle as the one that led to South Sudan's independence: self-determination. In the <a href="http://southernsudan2011.com/">2011 referendum</a>, the South Sudanese were given an opportunity to exercise the right to self-determination, but only negatively: they could decide who they did not want to be. The real challenge now is to ensure that the South Sudanese can themselves decide on the future that they do want. This requires a long-term and inclusive national process focused on identifying common objectives and developing a plan towards realizing these&#8212;politics in the positive sense of the word. For international actors this means creating an environment in which such a South Sudanese political process can take place, without taking decisions on fundamental issues such as the meaning of peace, justice and reconciliation for the South Sudanese. </p>

Herbert.</a> Judge Shelby courageously struck down a law against same-sex marriages in Utah, holding that the ban on same-sex marriages in Utah was unconstitutional. This decision now affords same-sex families in Utah with the ability to be married. If the same-sex couples choose to marry, the children of same-sex unions are now able to say that they have married parents.  </p>

<p>Seven months prior to Judge Shelby's holding, we, united in solidarity with the millions of American families waiting to know whether their sisters and brothers, mothers, fathers, friends and other relatives, would continue to be humiliated by the injurious language of the once-lawful <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defense_of_marriage_act_doma">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA), were thrilled when the US Supreme Court held that DOMA was unconstitutional on June 26, 2013, in the landmark decision, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">United States v. Windsor.</a> Because of the <span class="casename">Windsor</span> decision, children of same-sex marriages would no longer suffer by having two parents who were in federally unrecognized marriages.</p>

<p>DOMA, signed into law under the Clinton administration, excluded from the federal definition of "spouse" a same-sex partner, preventing same-sex couples from being recognized as married by the federal government. The restrictive and injurious language of DOMA was explicit in DOMA's Section 3, defining marriage as between "one man and one woman." The <span class="casename">Windsor</span> majority states that DOMA's "principal purpose is to impose inequality." Additionally, DOMA forced "same-sex couples to live as married for the purpose of state law but unmarried for the purpose of federal law." This differentiation, according to the majority, placed same-sex couples in an unstable position of being in second-tier marriages. It "demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the constitution protects." Most significantly, the <span class="casename">Windsor</span> majority held that DOMA humiliated "tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples." This humiliation makes it "even more difficult for children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family."</p>

<p>Judge Shelby was tasked with "the narrow question of whether Utah's current definition of marriage is permissible under the constitution." This question and predicted answer was outlined by Justice Scalia's dissent: "How easy it is, indeed how inevitable, to reach the same conclusion with regard to state laws denying same-sex couples marital status." </p>

<p>"Rather than protecting or supporting the families of opposite-sex couples, amendment 3 perpetuates inequality by holding that the families and relationships of same-sex couples are not now, nor ever will be, worthy of recognition," wrote Judge Shelby. "Amendment 3 does not thereby elevate the status of opposite-sex marriage; it merely demeans the dignity of same-sex couples."</p>

<p>Currently, <a href="http://gaymarriage.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004857">17 states legalized same-sex marriages:</a> Illinois, New Mexico, Hawaii, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Delaware, California, Maryland, Washington, Maine, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Iowa, Connecticut and Massachusetts. We anticipate that more states will have legal same-sex marriages. Additionally, we believe that more US District Court judges will strike down bans on same-sex marriages. Looking forward, the Utah decision may reach the Supreme Court, giving the court the opportunity to decide whether it will strike down state bans against same-sex marriages. With continued optimism, we hope that if the Supreme Court is presented with the issue of whether a state statutory scheme banning same-sex marriages is consistent with our constitution, that the court looks to the rationality of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5103666188878568597">Loving v. Virginia</a> and holds that banning marriages based on gender and/or an orientation classification violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process</a> Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>The most significant aspect of Justice Shelby's decision is that it reflects the respect that we, as a society, afford to our families. Specifically, holding that same-sex marriages and opposite-sex marriages are both equally valid benefits both the couple and the couple's children. The focus for a court should be on strengthening families, not demeaning them. Additionally, the heart of the family is the children. Courts should maintain laws that do not humiliate children, nor put certain children at a disadvantage to others. We hope that courts maintain the traditional value of preserving the family even as the definition of family changes with time.   </p>

		<title>The Ever-Shrinking Case for a Constitutional Right to Same-Sex Marriage</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law2.wm.edu/faculty/bios/fulltime/jgdwye.php?svr=law">James Dwyer</a> of William &#38; Mary Law School argues that the many incremental successes the same-sex marriage movement has had actually make it more difficult plausibly to argue now that every state is constitutionally required to issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples. The legal and factual premises on which Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring relies are simply not true today  ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/jamesdwyer.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/virginia-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">declaring </a>Virginia's exclusion of same-sex couples from its marriage laws unconstitutional, and announcing that his office would not defend the law, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring explained that because the law infringes a fundamental right, gays and lesbians need legal marriage for "orderly pursuit of happiness," homosexuals constitute a subordinated group insufficiently protected by the political process, courts should subject the law to strict scrutiny. Such an argument would have been persuasive at the beginning of this century, but not today.</p>

<p>On New Year's Eve 1999, a same-sex couple wanting legally to tie the knot could not secure legal marital status anywhere in the US, could not obtain the federal or state benefits that attach to legal marriage and indeed in many states were vulnerable to criminal prosecution for having an intimate relationship. At that time, it made sense to say the state interfered profoundly with the liberty, privacy and equal citizenship of homosexuals. Even then, however, a same-sex couple anywhere in the US could have held a wedding ceremony, without state-issued license, and declared love and commitment to each other; the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> would have precluded any state from prohibiting such private gathering and expression. Further, in practice, such a couple would have been free to share a home and intimate life, to act as a family, even in a state that criminalized homosexual conduct, because states generally did not enforce such laws. </p>

<p>Today both the legal and social climates for homosexuals are vastly different from what they were in 2000. Today, as a result of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas</a>, every adult in the US has a recognized Constitutional right to live with and share an intimate relationship with another consenting adult of the same sex or a different sex, whether married to each other or not. Moreover, today any same-sex couple living anywhere in America can get legally married. Such a couple could not secure a state-issued marriage license and certificate in Virginia, or in thirty or so other states, but a couple that lives in Virginia could drive to Maryland or fly to Boston and get legally married there. As a result of the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">Windsor v. US</a> and a subsequent <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-to-recognize-all-same-sex-marriages-for-federal-tax-purposes.php">IRS Revenue Ruling</a>, the federal government would thereafter treat the couple as legally married, even though they return to Virginia to live. They could file their federal income tax forms as a married couple and enjoy all the benefits the federal government confers on spouses. </p>

<p>The one way this couple's situation would differ from that of a heterosexual married couple in Virginia is that state agencies would not treat them as legally married. They might be better off in some ways as single persons (e.g., higher welfare payments or lower taxes), worse off in other ways (e.g., if not treated as spouses for health insurance or inheritance purposes). Even assuming it a net financial disadvantage to be denied Virginia's recognition of their marriage, that hardly amounts to infringement of a fundamental right. No one has a fundamental right to a particular tax-filing status, to piggyback on another person's employment for material benefits or to inherit.</p>

<p>There is also a stigma resulting from state non-recognition. I would not presume to judge the stigma's severity as sexual-orientation minorities experience it, but as a matter of constitutional doctrine avoiding such stigma is also not a matter of fundamental right. Members of religious minorities for whom polygamy is a sacred obligation must also feel some stigma from state refusal to recognize their plural intimate relationships, and likewise with individuals who want to marry their first cousin in states that refuse to issue marriage licenses to people in such "consanguineous" relationships. It is unlikely any court would treat that stigma as so threatening to basic wellbeing as to implicate a fundamental right.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has said legal marriage is a fundamental right, in several decisions Attorney General Herring cites. All of those decisions, however, are now, doctrinally, ancient history. The last Supreme Court marriage decision was a quarter century ago. At that time, in most of the US, only married people could legally "cohabit"&#8212that is, live together in a non-platonic way. The Court's opinions emphasized that legal marriage was a pre-condition for lawfully creating a family&#8212forming close personal attachment, procreating and raising children together&#8212an aspiration sensibly characterized as an aspect of fundamental wellbeing and human right. Legal marriage is simply no longer such a pre-condition for creating and enjoying a family. If the Justices are honest when they squarely address The Big Question ("Must every state in the US confer marriage certificates on same-sex couples?) they will acknowledge that it is no longer warranted to characterize receipt of a state marriage certificate as a matter of fundamental right. </p>

<p>The importance of what is actually at stake for homosexual individuals today is thus insufficient as a doctrinal matter to trigger strict scrutiny of state marriage laws. The alternative route to strict, or at least "heightened" scrutiny, of state laws, is to show discrimination against a "suspect" or "quasi-suspect" class of people. In explaining why he will not defend Virginia's marriage law, Attorney General Herring also suggested that an additional reason for subjecting that law to heightened judicial scrutiny is that it discriminates based on gender and sexual orientation. </p>

<p>Though some scholars and some lower courts have treated heterosexist marriage laws as gender discrimination, which the Supreme Court has usually subjected to heightened scrutiny, it is unlikely a majority of Supreme Court Justices would treat these laws as gender discrimination. It is far less clear that such laws, which apply equally to men and women, are "about" subordination of women than it was clear that Virginia's anti-miscegenation law, struck down in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5103666188878568597">Loving v. Virginia</a>, was about subordination of blacks. </p>

<p>As for sexual orientation, the Court has thus far declined to hold that homosexuals constitute a suspect or quasi-suspect class, and as with the fundamental-right argument, the argument that homosexuals constitute such a class has been undermined by the very success of the gay-rights movement. There is a fancy legal test for determining whether a group constitutes a suspect class, but at base the point of declaring a group such is that the group members need courts to protect them from a political process grossly unresponsive to their interests. In 2013 alone, five states <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">changed their marriage laws</a> to include same-sex couples, through the political process, without court compulsion. National polls now show most Americans support gay marriage. Though homophobia and discrimination persist, the situation of homosexuals today is nothing like that of blacks following abolition, when the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> and its Equal Protection Clause were added to the Constitution, or even like that of blacks in the Jim Crow era, when the Court established that it would subject racially discriminatory laws to strict scrutiny. </p>

<p>Many judges, including Supreme Court justices, are averse to designating new suspect classes that get stronger judicial protection against discriminatory legislation, because doing so has a long-term impact on separation of powers and democratic decision making in ways difficult to predict. Many lower courts have sidestepped the suspect-class issue by holding that laws denying state recognition to same-sex couples' relationships are unconstitutional even under rational basis review. This amounts to saying not merely "the state has legitimate reasons for doing so but they are not sufficiently compelling," but more starkly: "this serves no legitimate purpose whatsoever." Most Americans might believe that, on balance, the right thing to do is to grant homosexuals legal marriage. I myself do. But it might be only a small minority who would accept a Supreme Court pronouncement that it is entirely irrational and illegitimate for a state's elected officials to say: <br />
<blockquote>"We are not required to have a legal status called marriage. We have nevertheless done so historically because we hoped that by creating this special status, and by conferring financial benefits and special recognition in exchange for a promise of fidelity, we can induce some couples who are presumptively capable of procreating through sexual activity to produce children only within an enduring, committed relationship. We are not yet prepared to give up on that hope, and we simply have no reason to offer those costly benefits to couples for whom accidental procreation is not possible." </blockquote><br />
Though members of an elite class, the justices are not oblivious or insensitive to the general public's perception of their honesty and rationality.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a yet-unrecognized intermediate position between the status quo and a Supreme Court mandate that every state must issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples. It is the position currently prevailing as to common law marriages and marriages between first cousins. In some states a couple can become legally married by informal agreement and cohabitation, in others not. In some states, first cousins can secure a marriage license, in others not. But all states that do not have common law marriage treat as married any couples who migrate there after becoming legally married informally in a state that does have common law marriage. Likewise, if two first cousins legally marry in Virginia, where it is permitted, but move to or already live in a state where it is not (Virginia has no residency requirement for marriage), the other state will respect the marriage certificate Virginia issued. The Supreme Court might avoid The Big Question by issuing a ruling on <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiv">Full Faith and Credit</a> requiring all states to recognize same-sex marriage certificates issued in other states. A federal district court recently <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-Ohio-must-recognize-same-sex-marriage-on-death-certificates.php">imposed</a> such an order on Ohio. Or a state might avoid a judicial mandate that it issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples by deciding legislatively that it will henceforth give effect to such certificates other states issue. Many legislators would regard this as a big concession, and same-sex couples might still feel some sting of state denigration, but both sides might prefer this compromise to a loss in the courts.</p>

		<title>Chinese Government Must Close Gap Between Rhetoric and Reality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Maya Wang of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> says that the Chinese government must begin to consider the vehement demands of the people to reform...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>W</strong></font>hat is the difference between Xi Jinping and Xu Zhiyong?</p>

                <p>Both talk about fighting corruption, yet Xi is president of China, while Xu is now a prison inmate&#8212;put there by Xi's security services and politically-controlled courts. Over the next four years Xi will be feted at glittering summits with people like US President Barack Obama, while Xu will be in a cell in one of China's prisons, notorious for abuse and poor conditions.<br />
                    <br />
                    Xu was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/01/25/china-reverse-judgment-show-trial-xu-zhiyong">convicted</a> on January 26, 2014 in a show trial setting, a closed hearing that barred journalists and diplomats. His offense: that he "gathered crowds to disturb public order." Xu made an eloquent closing <a href="http://chinachange.org/2014/01/23/for-freedom-justice-and-love-my-closing-statement-to-the-court/">statement</a> defending his belief in the rule of law. He was ordered to stop speaking by the court after ten minutes. <br />
                    <br />
                    Xu's conviction has significance well beyond his own case. Xu is a leader of the "weiquan," or "rights defense," movement. He is a veteran campaigner who first came to public attention in 2003 as a 30-year-old scholar petitioning the Chinese government to abolish the abusive custody and repatriation administrative detention system. The petition generated widespread attention in China and was credited with the eventual fall of the system.<br />
                    <br />
                    At the beginning, the outlook for the rights defense movement was hopeful. The Internet was taking off in China, while the Chinese government was talking positively about creating the "rule of law." While the Communist Party maintained its grip on political power, more space for activists began to open up. A new breed of activists appeared on the scene. Xu himself set up the nonprofit legal aid organization, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/18/china-shuts-legal-aid-centre">Gongmeng</a>, which advocated change in a variety of areas, including the many forced evictions that accompanied China's frenzied construction sector. <br />
                    <br />
                    However, the government started to reverse course as it saw promotion of law had unleashed a flood of demands on the government. In 2010 alone, there were 180,000 <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2012/02/rising-protests-in-china/100247/">protests</a> and demonstrations recorded in China, chief among them are protests against officially-backed forced evictions, land seizures and corruption.<br />
                    <br />
                    The pressure on the rights defense movement has been steadily increasing since, with regular crackdowns. The government put more than one hundred activists under house arrest around the release of rights manifesto <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2008/12/10/china-retaliation-signatories-rights-charter">Charter 08</a> and slammed a thirteen year prison sentence on its main drafter, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/12/21/china-liu-xiaobo-s-trial-travesty-justice">Liu Xiaobo</a> (who later won the Nobel Peace Prize). The police also rounded up hundreds of activists and netizens following an anonymous online call for a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/03/02/wake-and-smell-jasmine">"Jasmine Revolution"</a> in 2011, although many detainees had little to do with the call. Many were kidnapped, tortured and held in secret locations for days and even months. <br />
                    <br />
                    The current crackdown is arguably one of the biggest and most concerted in the past twenty years. Ten activists who organize under the banner of Xu's New Citizens Movement have gone on trial within months&#8212;and that is not counting the detentions and imprisonment of many others not even related to the New Citizens effort. At the same time, the government has systematically tightened other contentious spaces for public activism, putting new controls on the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/09/13/china-draconian-legal-interpretation-threatens-online-freedom">Internet</a>, <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1385849/chinese-journalists-required-pass-ideology-exam-communist-party-tightens">mass media</a> and even <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1234453/seven-subjects-limits-teaching-chinese-universities-told">universities</a>. Pressure in Tibet and Xinjiang has also intensified, culminating with the arrest of Uyghur scholar <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1413164/uygur-scholar-ilham-tohti-accused-separatist-offences-prosecutors">Ilham Tohti</a> in mid-January for the crime of "splittism."<br />
                    <br />
                    What makes this latest round of repression distressing is that the message of the rights defense movement and the New Citizens Movement in particular was modest, inclusive and constructive. Xu borrowed the language of the government on the rule of law and justice, and that should have made him less of a threat. The New Citizens Movement never organized opposition parties or explicitly pushed for multi-party democracy, which is the Communist Party's greatest fear, but Xi Jinping and his new government seem unable to tolerate even moderate critics. <br />
                    <br />
                    In the short run, Beijing might feel more secure in the knowledge that it has crushed a movement that it perceives as a threat to the stability of its rule, and it might be relieved that its version of the "rule of law"&#8212;that is, the law as a weapon for the state, not as a source of <a href="http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2012/05/word-of-the-week-the-law-is-not-a-shield/">protection</a> for Chinese people&#8212;has once again triumphed.<br />
                    <br />
                    However, Xi Jinping and his government should think hard about the road they are taking. It is easy to espouse a commitment to reform and attack corruption, but the gap between Xi's rhetoric and reality will only create more activists from a population that increasingly is demanding basic freedoms.<br />
                    <br />
                    Instead of sending them to prison, Xi could make allies of people like Xu. It is a historic choice: subordinate all reforms to maintain Communist Party rule and risk escalating social unrest, or engage with reformers who have the vision of a modern Chinese state.</p>

		<title>One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: New Developments in the US-ICC Relationship</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Eric Leonard, the Henkel Family Chair in International Affairs at <a href="http://www.su.edu/">Shenandoah University</a>, argues that President Obama's recently issued memorandum regarding US troops in Mali represents a step backwards in the US-ICC relationship...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>J</strong></font>ust when things appeared to be taking a positive and constructive turn in the sometimes tumultuous US-International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="http://ijcentral.org/blog/the_us_and_the_icc_part_1_the_bush_years/">relationship</a>, a setback occurs. Over the past five years or so the US-ICC relationship began to settle into a pattern of both acceptance and at times US advocacy for the court. This benevolent pattern began near the end of the Bush administration and progressed under the Obama administration. Some clear indications of a warming relationship were the <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8351.doc.htm">abstention</a> on the UN Security Council vote on ICC intervention, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/081A9013-B03D-4859-9D61-5D0B0F2F5EFA/0/1970Eng.pdf">referral</a> [PDF] of the Libya case to the ICC, <a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42094.pdf">promised assistance</a> (PDF) for capturing Kony and most recently the <a href="http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/03/21/294703/icc-team-in-rwanda-to-transfer-ntaganda/">extradition</a> of Bosco Ntaganda to the ICC. </p>

                <p>However, just when advocates of the ICC believed that the US was on their side, President Barack Obama released the following <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/31/presidential-memorandum-certification-concerning-us-participation-united">memorandum</a>:<blockquote>By the authority vested in me as president by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> and the laws of the US, and consistent with section 2005 of the <a href="http://www.amicc.org/docs/ASPA_2008.pdf">American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002</a> (ASPA) (PDF), concerning the participation of members of the armed forces of the US in certain UN peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations, I hereby certify that members of the US armed forces participating in the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali are without risk of criminal prosecution or other assertion of jurisdiction by the ICC because the Republic of Mali has entered into an agreement in accordance with <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Article 98 of the Rome Statute</a> (PDF) preventing the ICC from proceeding against members of the armed forces of the US present in that country.</blockquote></p>

                <p>Article 98 agreements&#8212;also known as Bilateral Immunity Agreements (BIA)&#8212;were a Bush administration tactic to undermine the legitimacy of the ICC. These arrangements provide that both parties agree not to extradite current or former government officials, military personnel (regardless of their national status) or citizens of the other party to the ICC. The purpose of these agreements is to protect US nationals from politically motivated prosecution in the ICC. As John Bolton <a href="http://www.aei.org/article/society-and-culture/american-justice-and-the-international-criminal-court/">articulated</a> in November of 2003:<blockquote>Article 98 agreements serve to ensure that US persons will have appropriate protection from politically motivated criminal accusations, investigations and prosecutions. These straightforward agreements require that our partners agree, either reciprocally or non-reciprocally, not to surrender US persons to the ICC, not to retransfer persons extradited to a country for prosecution and not to assist other parties in their efforts to send US persons to the ICC. We have worked hard to find mechanisms and formulations in these agreements that meet our requirement of blanket coverage while also responding to the needs of our bilateral partners.</blockquote></p>

                <p>Obama's citing of these agreements in his memorandum is disheartening to ICC advocates but is also peculiar to those that follow US-ICC relations. With the Obama administration warming to the ICC, why take such a step to undermine the court and its role as the ultimate overseer of international criminal justice? Some, <a href="http://justiceinconflict.org/2014/02/05/no-bush-style-bia-a-clarification-on-mali-and-the-us/">Mark Kersten in particular</a>, have begun analyzing this situation and it has now come to light that this BIA is actually not an overt BIA. Instead, the reference to "an agreement in accordance with Article 98" is predicated on a <a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL34531.pdf">1997 Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) (PDF) (see Table 6 for summary) between the US and Mali. Thus, Obama can claim that this is not a return to the anti-ICC BIAs of the past but is the upholding of a long-standing SOFA with the government of Mali. </p>

                <p>For those that study the ICC, this clarification does not really clarify anything. In fact, it may raise more questions than it answers. For one, why did the Obama administration release the memorandum and make this overt declaration of US service member immunity? If the SOFA is in place, why not publicly declare immunity if the situation necessitates it&#8212;in other words, when a US service member is in danger of prosecution before the ICC. By remaining silent on the issue, the Obama administration could retain its pro-international justice momentum along with its renewed sense of soft power. </p>

                <p>Further, why give legitimacy to a Bush-era piece of legislation (the ASPA) that large portions of the international community refer to as the "Hague Invasion Act." Despite Congress amending certain parts of the act, it remains that the ASPA is an anti-ICC piece of legislation that many thought the Obama administration was attempting to move beyond. However, this recent memorandum brings the benevolent relationship cultivated by the current administration into question. </p>

                <p>So this situation essentially begs two questions&#8212;first, what does this mean for the court? If the US begins to undermine the actions of the ICC will this hinder the legitimacy of the institution or possibly hinder its ability to fulfill its mandate? I believe having US support is beneficial but not necessary for a strong ICC. Empirically, the speed in which the ICC came into force and the number of cases and prosecutions in its first twelve years proves this ability to succeed without overt US support. It is important to emphasize that the ICC can succeed without the US but would be a stronger institution with US support.</p>

                <p>Second what does this mean for the US? That is difficult to discern because it is not clear what this means for the US-ICC relationship. Maybe this memorandum is just a blip in the developing relationship or possibly a nod to the conservative opponents of the ICC. However, it is clear that this memorandum is a restatement of US exceptionalism by Obama. The administration may be in favor of a strong and robust ICC, as long as the court does not try to assert its strength over the US. The message from this administration is clear&#8212;the fight for international justice is important and the principle of international criminal law apply to all, but the US can prosecute its own criminals as US sovereignty remains the final form of authority for its citizens. Therefore, the fight for international justice applies to all, but the ICC does not apply to the US. In the end this will hurt US soft power and as a result, it will hurt US legitimacy in the eyes of the democratic global community.  </p>

		<title>Examining the Constitutionality of Abortion Clinic Buffer Zones</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Stephanie Toti of <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">The Center for Reproductive Rights </a> discuss the challenge to Massachusetts buffer zone laws in <span class="casename">McCullen v. Coakley</span>...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/stephanietoti.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he US Supreme Court recently <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-abortion-clinic-buffer-zones.php">heard</a> oral argument in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Mccullen+v.+Coakley&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=12653693490693214117&scilh=0">McCullen v. Coakley</a>, involving a Massachusetts <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter266/Section120">statute</a> that creates 35 foot buffer zones around abortion clinic entrances and driveways. Enacted in response to a long and well documented history of intimidation, obstruction, and violence outside abortion clinics, the law seeks to ensure the safe passage of women into such facilities and to maintain safety and order on the public streets surrounding them.  </p>

                <p>In the past, the Supreme Court has upheld similar measures imposed by court order as well as by statute. Most recently, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=hill+v.+colorado&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=13410055345323866526&scilh=0">Hill v. Colorado</a>, the court upheld a state statute making it unlawful for anyone, within 100 feet of the entrance of a healthcare facility, to approach within eight feet of another person without consent for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill, displaying a sign, or engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling.  </p>

                <p>The decision in <span class="casename">Hill</span> generated controversy among First Amendment scholars, some of whom thought that the court improperly classified the law as content neutral, even though, on its face, it distinguishes among speech based on its content. In making the "content neutrality" determination, the court relied on the fact that the statute had a neutral justification (i.e., one unrelated to the expressive content of speech)&#8212;namely, to ensure safe passage of those seeking to enter abortion clinics and to maintain safety and order on public streets&#8212;despite its differential treatment of speech amounting to protest, education, or advocacy. Although the court's decision in <span class="casename">Hill</span> is less than fifteen years old and was adopted by a six member majority, one of the questions presented in <span class="casename">McCullen</span> is whether <span class="casename">Hill</span> should be overruled. Many commentators and Supreme Court watchers believe the court will answer that question in the affirmative given the criticism aimed at <span class="casename">Hill</span> and the changes in the composition of the court since that case was decided in 2000.</p>

                <p>I remain hopeful, however, that the Supreme Court will uphold the Massachusetts buffer zone law&#8212;or, at the very least, render a decision on narrow grounds that would not foreclose the enactment of similar laws. There was much discussion at oral argument about whether the exceptions in the Massachusetts law were overly broad&#8212;they could easily be amended should the court strike the statute on that basis. There are several reasons why the court may (and should) affirm the general principle that a state may restrict people from occupying the areas immediately. </p>

                <p>First, the Massachusetts buffer zone law is distinguishable from the statute upheld in <span class="casename">Hill</span> in ways that make its constitutionality more evident. For example, the Massachusetts statute is content neutral on its face in addition to having a neutral justification; it merely prohibits physical presence within a buffer zone. It makes no reference to protected expression of any kind. This makes clear that the statute should be treated as content neutral. It is also makes clear that <span class="casename">McCullen</span> is not a good vehicle for reconsidering the more controversial aspects of <span class="casename">Hill</span>; it provides no occasion to revisit the debate about whether a neutral justification, on its own, is sufficient to support a determination of content neutrality.    <br />
                    <br />
                    In addition, because the Massachusetts buffer zone law does not regulate speech directly, it is best understood as a regulation of conduct, rather than as a regulation of the time, place or manner in which speech occurs. Any burdens on speech that result from the law are incidental to its regulation of physical proximity to a clinic entrance or driveway.  </p>

                <p>Under the rubric first set forth in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12229836877065678192">United States v. O'Brien</a>, upholding the conviction of a Vietnam-war protester for publicly burning his draft card in violation of a statutory prohibition on the destruction of such cards, a regulation of conduct that imposes incidental burdens on speech satisfies the First Amendment if it furthers an important governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression and the burdens on speech that result from it are no greater than necessary to further that interest. The Roberts' court, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3881292757575809578">Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.</a>, sustained the Solomon Amendment under this rubric, holding that the statutory provision requiring universities to provide military recruiters equal access to their campuses and students or forfeit their federal funding did not directly regulate the speech of the plaintiff law schools even though, as a practical matter, it required them to advertise military recruiters' presence on their campuses.  <br />
                    <br />
                    The Massachusetts buffer zone law easily passes the <span class="casename">O'Brien</span> test. As explained above, it has a neutral justification related to important governmental interests. And the record in the case, which included trial testimony from law enforcement officers, shows that the creation of 35 foot buffer zones has proven to be a highly effective means of maintaining safety and order outside of abortion clinics, succeeding where other measures adopted by the Commonwealth had failed.<br />
                    <br />
                    Second, buffer zones are not unique to the abortion clinic context. Numerous federal, state, and local laws limit people's ability to congregate in certain public spaces when doing so would pose a security threat. You cannot congregate on the White House grounds or the steps of the Supreme Court, for example, even if you wish to engage in peaceful protest or quietly converse with the people entering or leaving those buildings. Massachusetts and its <em>amici</em> provided examples of buffer zone laws protecting everything from houses of worship to foreign embassies to hospitals to political conventions. Although the plaintiffs in <span class="casename">McCullen</span> characterize buffer zones as a form of censorship, they do not actually prevent anyone from speaking. Instead, they merely require everyone to take a few steps back, reducing congestion at building entrances, minimizing opportunities for aggression, and making it easier for law enforcement officers to keep the peace. </p>

                <p>Accordingly, their relatively common occurrence has posed little danger to our First Amendment freedoms. The Supreme Court's most well known case about buffer zones outside the abortion context is, perhaps, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12745677593961169991">Burson v. Freeman</a>. There, the court upheld a buffer zone law that prohibited electioneering within 100 feet of polling locations on election days. That law (and dozens like it across the country) had been enacted to prevent intimidation and harassment of prospective voters by campaign workers, which had been a big problem historically. The court treated that buffer zone law as content based because it only applied to the solicitation of votes and display of campaign materials, but nevertheless upheld it under strict scrutiny, concluding that the government had a compelling interest in ensuring that individuals are able to exercise their right to vote and that the 100 foot buffer zone requirement was narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  <br />
                    <br />
                    The parallels between <span class="casename">Burson</span> and <span class="casename">McCullen</span> are plain. Both cases concern the creation of buffer zones on certain public sidewalks to protect individuals seeking to exercise their fundamental rights from interference by third parties, as well as to maintain safety and order in a relatively small space that would otherwise be crowded with opposing factions whose passions are running high. Moreover, in both cases, the buffer zone laws were enacted in response to an extensive historical record of harms.  <br />
                    <br />
                    If a content based, 100 foot buffer zone requirement satisfies First Amendment scrutiny, then surely, a content neutral, 35 foot buffer zone requirement does so, as well. Conversely, if the court strikes down the abortion clinic buffer zone law, it would be putting at risk buffer zones that protect polling locations as well as houses of worship, courthouses, and the like, taking an effective tool for keeping the peace out of the hands of law enforcement officers.   <br />
                    <br />
                    Third and finally, laws securing women's safe passage into abortion clinics are part of a long tradition of government action aimed at safeguarding the exercise of fundamental rights from interference by third parties. During Reconstruction, for example, Congress enacted the <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ku-klux-act-passed-by-congress">Civil Rights Act of 1871</a> in response to an organized campaign of violence and intimidation designed to prevent African Americans from exercising the rights granted to them by the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. Similarly, in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12120372216939101759">Brown v. Board of Education</a>, the federal government took various steps to secure safe passage for African American children into newly integrated schools. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/intro/intro_b.php">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> and various state buffer zone statutes of the kind upheld in <span class="casename">Burson</span> were enacted to prevent intimidation and obstruction of those seeking to exercise their right to vote. And a wave of recent amendments to state and local public accommodation laws afford members of the LGBT community protection from those who would seek to discriminate against them on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity.  <br />
                    <br />
                    The Supreme Court has long held that such measures are presumptively valid under the First Amendment as long as they target the conduct of rights opponents and not their message. In other words, while the government may not prevent rights opponents from denouncing the exercise of fundamental rights, it may prevent them from impeding the exercise of those rights. The Massachusetts buffer zone law abides this distinction. It permits opponents of abortion rights to convey their message through any means they prefer, whether loud protest or quite conversation, as long as they do so at a safe distance from clinic entrances and driveways. And that distance is relatively short&#8212;less than twelve yards.  <br />
                    <br />
                    In sum, the incidental burdens on speech imposed by the Massachusetts buffer zone law are justified by the protections the law affords to those seeking to enter abortion clinics as well as its demonstrated effectiveness in keeping the peace outside such facilities. I hope that, following the Supreme Court's decision, buffer zones will continue to be a viable tool for law enforcement officers in Massachusetts and elsewhere.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/cope-kevin-l.cfm">Kevin Cope</a> of Georgetown University Law Center argues that the crisis in South Sudan suggests that the international community might consider refocusing more of its attention on the role of constitutional structure ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/kevincope.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>E</strong></font>xperts disagree about the biggest source of the current crisis in <a href="/feature/featured/south-sudan/">South Sudan</a>. They cite longstanding ethnic divides, misdirected foreign intervention, <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/printreport.aspx?reportid=99487">tension among factions within the army</a> and <a href="http://www.voanews.com/articleprintview/1826903.html">personal animosity between</a> President Salva Kiir and former-Vice President Riek Machar. Those are surely the most important and direct factors. But another, rule-of-law-based cause may be worth adding to the conversation: the recent constitutional process that, with a deft bait-and-switch from the 2005 interim constitution, concentrated largely unchecked power in the South Sudanese presidency.</p>

<p>It's tempting to write off as naive formalism the notion that constitutional law can "matter," especially in a place without much law. South Sudan touts one of the world's worst human rights records, a bottom fifth-percentile governance <a href="http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.aspx#reports">score for rule of law</a>, and a "parent" (Sudan) with the <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1989979">world's most "sham" constitution</a>. Skepticism about law's impact in South Sudan is understandable. But that doesn't mean we should abandon hope for constitutional law altogether. As some empirical research <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctqjm0/Files/melton_humanrights.pdf">shows</a> [PDF], constitutions can matter, even in fledgling democracies like South Sudan, in part because leaders can abuse them to amass power, building strong, highly centralized governments. Understanding how this happens helps us unpack the current crisis in South Sudan.</p>

<p><strong>Constitutional Design and Divided Societies</strong></p>

<p>Constitutional theorists have long endorsed a divided government as a guard against autocracy. In <a href="http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm">Federalist No. 51</a>, James Madison argued that without the necessary structural institutions, bills of rights were meaningless "parchment barriers." On the other hand, giving those within each branch the "means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others," he wrote, can prevent concentration of too much power in any one branch. "Ambition," Madison said, "must be made to counteract ambition." </p>

<p>Over two hundred years later, comparative political scientists and legal scholars have developed those ideas and applied them to culturally divided societies. As Mark Fathi Massoud <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/socio-legal-studies/laws-fragile-state-colonial-authoritarian-and-humanitarian-legacies-sudan">argues</a> about modern rule-of-law initiatives in Sudan, legal politics that emphasize changes to substantive law, but which "reinforce the authority and power of [authoritarian] legal institutions," are more likely to sustain authoritarianism than to bring about democratic reform. Conversely, robust vertical and horizontal separation of powers, by dispersing power among actors with competing interests, makes it harder for any single actor to gain hegemony.</p>

<p>In South Sudan and other weak states, elite power and personal ambition&#8212more than established legal norms&#8212are unusually important in driving peace or violent upheaval. That reality, together with South Sudan's divided ethnic composition, make achieving stalemate by pitting "ambition against ambition," critical in places like South Sudan. There, armed factions have engaged in a battle for the center of power. One key to fostering equilibrium is for constitutional designers to decrease the value of, and therefore the incentive to fight for, that center of power.   </p>

<p>South Sudan's recent constitutional process, which converted the <a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/4ba74c4a2.html">2005 subnational constitution</a> into the current <a href="http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/South%20Sudan/South%20Sudan_Transitional_constitution_2011.pdf">2011 transitional constitution</a> [PDF], failed to accomplish that goal. As I <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2159604">argued</a> last year in the Virginia Journal of International Law, the 2005 and 2011 constitution-writing processes were, in a sense, a "bait-and-switch." The 2005 process that followed the civil-war-ending <a href="http://unmis.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=515">Comprehensive Peace Agreement</a> between Sudan's Khartoum government and Southern forces produced a relatively decentralized sub-national government. It included a federal structure with some meaningful checks on the central executive. </p>

<p>The 2011 process did away with much of that: many of the 2011 "technical" revision committee's changes consolidated power in the central government or executive and expanded the power of the national government generally. In the process, it gave President Kiir powers more commonly associated with autocracies than democracies. </p>

<p><strong>The Bait-and-Switch </strong></p>

<p>How did this happen? First, it seems that even before the region of Southern Sudan became the country of South Sudan in 2011, its leaders preferred a strong, centralized Southern Sudanese government. In 2005 the South was also interested in maximizing its autonomy with Sudan, which required decentralization at the Sudanese national level. Effectively, that meant that the South had to give its states and localities the same rights it was demanding from the government of the Sudan. Agreeing to this decentralized structure made the South's case for semi-autonomy far more credible. </p>

<p>That all changed after the July 2011 <a href="http://southernsudan2011.com">independence referendum</a>. Following the vote to secede from Sudan, Southern leaders lost their political competition, and with it, the incentive to maintain decentralization. The ongoing security crisis may have also contributed. The leaders of Kiir's Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) felt threatened by militias&#8212many led by disgruntled SPLM rivals&#8212and believed the best way to manage these threats was the flexibility of unrestrained central executive authority. The constitutional drafting committee (dominated by President Kiir's own party) seized the opportunity to restructure the document into the centralized, strong executive model it wanted all along. </p>

<p>Among other things, that model erodes legislative and judicial checks on the executive. Under the current constitution, the president arguably can now unilaterally dismiss federal justices for "incompetence." The president has unchecked power to dissolve the national legislature pursuant to a "state of emergency" provision, which he can invoke upon finding an "economic" "threat" to "any part" of the country. (It appears the legislature can override the president's declared state of emergency, but presumably not if it's been dissolved). The 2011 changes also rolled back federalism, moving power from the states to the national government. They empowered the president to dissolve state councils and dismiss state governors. They eliminated state-level courts altogether. The changes also created structural threats to individual rights guarantees. The 2011 constitution actually contains robust rights provisions, sometimes implausibly so (e.g., a universal right to free health care). But under the state of emergency provision, the president can suspend many of those rights, and take "any such measures as deemed necessary." </p>

<p>Not all of South Sudan's leaders supported the changes. Some minority members of the Legislative Assembly suggested alternative options, including meaningful checks on presidential power like those in South Africa's widely emulated <a href="http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/index.html">constitution</a>. But allies of President Kiir defended the moves, arguing that Kiir would never abuse the powers. </p>

<p>That promise was put to the test this past summer. Amid a series of sweeping changes to his military leadership, Kiir's popularity had slowly been dwindling. In July, Kiir began putting his robust executive powers to use. In one day, Kiir fired Machar and the entire cabinet, blaming their alleged insubordination. Machar later declared his intention to challenge Kiir in the next election, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/12/s-sudan-president-says-coup-attempt-foiled-2013121613417331572.html">saying</a> that South Sudan cannot tolerate "one man's rule," and calling Kiir's actions a "step towards dictatorship." In November, Kiir dissolved all of his party's high-level institutions, including the National Liberation Council, the National Convention, and the Political Bureau. </p>

<p>In December, fighting broke out in the presidential guard between factions of Kiir's Dinka tribe and Machar's Nuer tribe. Citing an unsuccessful coup attempt by political rivals (though Machar denied involvement), Kiir had eleven political opponents imprisoned. He appeared on national television in army regalia and vowed justice for those responsible. Throughout the rest of December and into February, the fighting escalated, spreading through other regions. In late December, recent mass graves were found near Bentiu and Juba. In January, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/15/world/africa/south-sudan.html?_r=1">reported</a> that over 400,000 civilians had been displaced and that nearly 75,000 refugees had fled the country. The International Crisis Group has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/world/africa/new-estimate-sharply-raises-death-toll-in-south-sudan.html?_r=0">estimated</a> the death toll, including both military and civilian, at 10,000 people.</p>

<p><strong>The 2011 Constitution and the Present Crisis</strong></p>

<p>It's impossible to predict with certainty whether a more divided structure might have averted the conflict, but theory and history suggest a relationship. Both horizontal and vertical diffusion of power can mitigate upheaval in different ways. </p>

<p>Vertical diffusion, commonly embodied in a federal system, allows minority groups to have a greater say in governance, thereby both serving those groups' substantive interests and helping to quell frustration about political exclusion. In South Sudan, the SPLM did the opposite during the 2011 constitutional revision process. It concentrated power where the party is strongest: around the capital. The move disempowered minorities and raised the stakes of securing power in the central government. </p>

<p>Power can also be separated by, for instance, vesting relatively more authority in a branch and dividing it among its members. Political scientists have <a href="http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/constitutional-design-divided-societies">recognized</a> that in divided societies like South Sudan's, a proportional representation parliamentary system virtually ensures minority representation. Because power is shared among different groups, it does a better job of limiting the appeal of the "center" and discouraging political opponents from resorting to violence to obtain it. </p>

<p>Horizontal separation can also diffuse tensions among political rivals. The impression of too much power is, of course, threatening to those who have less. Machar foreshadowed his alleged coup by warning that Kiir was taking "step[s] towards dictatorship." Had there been more effective constraints on presidential power in the other branches or state governments, the threat of dictatorship might have been less threatening to the Vice President. With a stronger sense of political efficacy, the breaking point for Machar and other opponents of Kiir might have come a little later, or not at all. </p>

<p>Both foreign interventions in fledgling democracies and international human rights institutions tend to focus more on individual human rights than on elements of government structure. That phenomenon may reflect a perception of bigger constitutional payoffs, or the greater public appeal of rights compared with structure. That approach probably has many advantages. But as the South Sudan experience suggests, it may be worth refocusing at least some of that attention on the role of constitutional structure.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.lclark.edu/live/profiles/271-tung-yin/">Tung Yin</a> of the Lewis &#38 Clark Law School argues that the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board's report on the NSA's telephone records program is likely best directed toward statutory changes in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act rather than influencing decisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/tungyin.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>L</strong></font>ast month, the federal Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/us-privacy-board-finds-nsa-phone-program-illegal.php">issued</a> a 234 page report, concluding that the National Security Agency's (NSA) Telephone Records Program not only had failed to achieve any significant counterterrorism impact, but also fell outside the claimed statutory authority of Section 215 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ56/pdf/PLAW-107publ56.pdf">USA PATRIOT Act</a> [PDF] and violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a>. It was far from a unanimous report, as two of the five members of the PCLOB disagreed with the legal analysis (<a href="http://www.pclob.gov/SiteAssets/Pages/default/PCLOB-Cook-Statement.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.pclob.gov/SiteAssets/Pages/default/PCLOB-Brand-Statement.pdf">here</a>). Perhaps not coincidentally, both dissenters are Republicans. The PCLOB also disagreed with numerous decisions issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). Interested observers may be left wondering, who's right?</p>

<p><strong>The NSA program</strong></p>

<p>Much of what is believed to be known about the NSA's Telephone Records Program comes from the unauthorized disclosures by former Booz Allen Hamilton employee Edward Snowden, first <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">reported</a> by The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald. Snowden provided Greenwald with a copy of a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon-telephone-data-court-order?guni=Article:in%20body%20link">secret order</a> by the FISC requiring cellular phone company Verizon Inc. to provide the NSA, every day, with all telephone records in its possession. </p>

<p>To be clear, the phone records are not the contents of the call&#8212i.e., the actual conversation. Rather, the records concerned the "metadata" of the calls: the number at the other end of the call, the location of the caller at the time of the call, the duration of the call, and so on. Greenwald's initial article also disclosed a second NSA program, code named <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">PRISM</a>, which collected the contents of emails; that program will be the subject of a subsequent PCLOB report.</p>

<p>The NSA stored the phone records it obtained from telecom providers in a database. Analysts could seek approval from a small list of supervisors to perform targeted inquiries in the database for a specific phone number based on "reasonable, articulable suspicion ... that the number is associated with terrorism," according to the PCLOB's description of the program. The result of the search would be a list of phone numbers in contact with the original number, as well as all phones numbers in contact with the first list of numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Statutory analysis</strong></p>

<p>Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act amended the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to apply for an order from the FISC "requiring the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other things) for an investigation to protect against international terrorism ..." This is the same provision that, at the dawn of the USA PATRIOT Act, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2003/09/a_guide_to_the_patriot_act_part_1.html">gave rise to concerns</a> that the FBI would snoop around in public libraries, getting access to the lists of books checked out by people under suspicion.</p>

<p>The PCLOB concluded that Section 215 cannot justify the NSA's telephone records program because that statutory provision enables the FBI, not the NSA, to seek business records relevant to a specific investigation. Here, the NSA had vacuumed up a tremendous amount of information without any reasonable, articulable suspicion. The subsequent targeted inquiry&#8212i.e., the inquiry into the database of a specific phone number&#8212more closely resembled the type of business record search authorized under section 215 by its text, but only if the database were that of a third party entity.</p>

<p><strong>Constitutional analysis</strong></p>

<p>The PCLOB identified a second problem with the NSA's telephone records program&#8212namely, that it appeared to violate the Fourth Amendment. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9210492700696416594">Katz v. United States</a> determined that a search occurs for Fourth Amendment purposes when law enforcement agents violate a person's reasonable expectation of privacy. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3033726127475530815">Smith v. Maryland</a>, the Supreme Court held that there was no expectation of privacy in the phone number that a person dials to make a telephone call, and that the use of a pen register device to record those numbers was therefore not a search.</p>

<p>Recognizing that <span class="casename">Smith</span> could plausibly be read to conclude that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in cellphone metadata&#8212including the phone number on the other end of the call&#8212the PCLOB nevertheless argued that modern technology has advanced well past what the Supreme Court had faced over 30 years ago, and that the NSA program poses a far greater threat to privacy and civil liberties than the primitive (by today's standards) pen registers at issue in <span class="casename">Smith</span>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the PCLOB's analysis conflicts with a judicial opinion from the FISC, the so-called secret court made up of Article III judges that hears applications for FISA surveillance warrants. Last August, FISC Judge Claire Eagan <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-intelligence-court-releases-opinion-justifying-constitutionality-of-surveillance-program.php">concluded</a> that section 215 provided sufficient legal authority for the NSA telephone records program, because the NSA searches were adequately related to FBI counterterrorism investigations, and because <span class="casename">Smith</span> established the absence of reasonable expectations of privacy in non-content metadata.</p>

<p>Based on its analysis of the mismatch between section 215's explicit text and the NSA program in operation, as well as the Fourth Amendment concerns, the PCLOB recommended that the NSA abandon the telephone records program in its current form; that Congress amend FISA to provide the FISC with independent views (presumably to approximate an adversarial process); and that Congress increase the transparency of FISC decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Observations</strong></p>

<p>The PCLOB was established in 2007 upon the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission as essentially an advisor to/watchdog of the Executive Branch to ensure that its counterterrorism efforts will not unduly infringe privacy rights or civil liberties. By statute, the five members of the PCLOB must be divided by political affiliation 3-2 (or 2-2-1 in the event of a non-affiliated member).</p>

<p>The PCLOB was acutely aware of Eagan's FISC opinion and discussed it thoroughly in its report. It might be tempting to attribute the difference in conclusions about the validity of the NSA's telephone records program to politics, as the three PCLOB members in the majority were selected from Democrats while Eagan was appointed by a Republican President. That observation is at least consistent with the traditional ideologies of the two major parties, with Republicans generally more supportive of law enforcement activities and Democrats generally more concerned about invasions of privacy. On the other hand, when viewed through a partisan, as opposed to ideological lens, the two conclusions are perplexing, given that the current occupant of the White House&#8212and hence beneficiary of a ruling that upholds the NSA's activities&#8212is a Democrat.</p>

<p>One might note that there were three people behind the PCLOB opinion, compared to just a single FISC judge, and that more weight should be accorded the PCLOB opinion for the same reason that federal appellate court opinions are "better" than district court opinions. "Three minds are better than one" is one of the reasons that appellate courts review questions of law de novo. Of course, if we are just counting votes, the PCLOB dissenters should be added to Eagan's side, leaving it as a 3-3 tie. In addition, the FISC has apparently ruled in other cases on analogous bulk collection matters and reached the same conclusion about the link between NSA analysis as a precursor to FBI investigations, as is alluded to in Eagan's opinion and in the dissenting opinions of the PCLOB, where Rachel Brand wrote: "Moreover, [the bulk collection under Section 215] has been upheld by many Article III judges, including over a dozen FISC judges and Judge Pauley in a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/order_granting_governments_motion_to_dismiss_and_denying_aclu_motion_for_preliminary_injunction.pdf">thorough opinion</a> in a regular, public proceeding in US District Court.") To be sure, there are reasons to question the correctness of the FISC ruling(s) regarding Section 215, as Professor Orin Kerr <a href="http://www.volokh.com/2013/09/17/thoughts-august-2013-fisc-opinion-section-215/">notes</a>: "[I]t seems strange that the government's previously secret claim that the entire database has to be turned over itself makes it legal to turn over the entire database first and then search it later."</p>

<p>Perhaps the best way to view the difference of opinion between the PCLOB and FISC judges is to recognize the political and structural forces acting on each. The former is an advisory board consisting of political appointees, whereas the latter is a federal court consisting of judges with <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> protections (life tenure, protection against salary diminution). Arguably, Eagan's opinion should be accorded more weight because the Article III protections are supposed to ensure independence on the part of the federal judge. But, it is important to keep in mind that proceedings before the FISC are ex parte. Thus, multiple FISC judges have indeed ruled in favor of the government&#8212but based on arguments from only the government. As with traditional criminal search warrant applications, the target of the search is obviously not present to argue against issuance of the warrant. Traditional search warrants are far more likely to be litigated, however, which means that judges receive more feedback to calibrate their probable cause assessments. FISA warrants, not so much.</p>

<p>The PCLOB, on the other hand, has a dual role of serving as a privacy and civil liberties watchdog and as an advisory board to Congress. Its written analysis looks as much to the future as to the present, and many of the recommendations are policy-based. Indeed, the Fourth Amendment analysis admits as much, contending that technology has outstripped the legal content of <span class="casename">Smith</span>. Ironically, one part of the oft-reviled USA PATRIOT Act likewise recognized that mobile cellphones had rendered the previous statutory provisions governing telephone wiretapping warrants obsolete, because it was often too cumbersome to seek a separate search warrant every time the surveillance target crossed into a new federal judicial district. As a result, Section 220 of the USA PATRIOT Act authorized nationwide service for a search warrant for electronic evidence&#8212that is, a roving wiretap. The PCLOB opinion is likely more usefully directed toward statutory changes in FISA to address the privacy and civil liberties concerns raised than as a legal opinion, given the consistency of the apparent FISC rulings in favor of the NSA.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.duq.edu/academics/faculty/steven-baicker-mckee">Steven Baicker-McKee</a> of the Duquesne University School of Law notes that the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in ruling that a declaratory judgment action does not affect the court's jurisdiction or shift the parties' burden of proof  ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/stevenbaickermckee.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n a simple patent infringement case, it is settled law that the federal courts have jurisdiction over the dispute, and that the patent holder/plaintiff has the burden of proving infringement. What happens, though, when the parties have a licensing agreement and the licensee, not the patent holder, brings an action seeking a declaratory judgment of non-infringement? May this action, governed at least in part by a common law contract, proceed in federal court? And who has the burden of proof? </p>

<p>The answers to these questions were so obvious&#8212at least to the Supreme Court, but apparently not to the court below&#8212that they resulted in a unanimous decision <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-reverses-federal-circuit-in-medtronic-patent-case.php">reversing</a> the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1918943172384201617">Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC</a> on January 22, 2014. </p>

<p>First, the court clarified that parties may bring an action for a declaration regarding patent infringement in federal court, even if the parties' rights are, to some degree, established in a licensing agreement. In other words, the underlying question of patent law authorizes federal subject matter jurisdiction even if the parties' rights are governed by a contract which normally must be adjudicated in state court in the absence of diversity jurisdiction. Second, the court held that the patent holder will still have the burden of proof, even though not the plaintiff (who typically bears the burden of proof). </p>

<p>While the court's answers are not controversial or surprising on the particular facts presented in <span class="casename">Medtronic</span>, however, the court did not provide much guidance as to how its rulings might apply in a more nuanced situation. In fact, it is more surprising that the court granted certiorari in <span class="casename">Medtronic</span>, as it was, on the surface and at virtually every layer, a patent infringement case through and through. Consequently, the court's analysis in <span class="casename">Medtronic</span> does not shed much light on how a court is to analyze a case where the true nature of the case is not so easily discerned.</p>

<p>Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC had patents related to implantable heart stimulators. It licensed certain rights to Medtronic, Inc, which agreed to pay royalties for products that it sold that used Mirowski's patents. Mirowski believed that Medtronic was selling products that infringed its patents without paying royalties, and provided notice to Medtronic under the license agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, Medtronic then commenced a declaratory judgment action to determine the parties' rights and obligations, contending that its products did not infringe Mirowski's patents either because the products fell outside the scope of the patents or because the patents were invalid.</p>

<p>The US District Court for the District of Delaware <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3539486346974027608">held</a> that, although the defendant in the action, Mirowski had the burden of proving patent infringement. Following a bench trial, the court ruled that Mirowski had not met its burden, and ruled in Medtronic's favor. The Federal Circuit came to the opposite conclusion regarding the burden of proof, and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15782852993082616372">held</a> that Medtronic, as the plaintiff, held the burden of proof where, as here, the rights were governed by a license agreement. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, and reversed. </p>

<p><strong>Federal Subject Matter Jurisdiction</strong></p>

<p>Before reaching the burden of proof issue, the court considered whether the federal courts had subject matter jurisdiction over the action. The court started its analysis with the observation that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2201">Declaratory Judgment Act</a> does not extend the federal courts' jurisdiction. In other words, if a federal court would not have jurisdiction over the underlying dispute, it cannot gain jurisdiction simply by virtue of the Declaratory Judgment Act.</p>

<p>In its complaint, Medtronic asserted jurisdiction under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1331">provision</a> giving jurisdiction over claims arising under federal laws and on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1338">provision</a> giving federal courts jurisdiction over "any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, plant variety protection, copyrights and trademarks." An amicus argued that the dispute here arose under the parties' license agreement, not under the federal patent laws, and therefore that the federal courts did not have subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The court agreed with the amicus that subject matter jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment action is determined by the "character of the threatened action." The federal courts will have jurisdiction if the action brought by the declaratory judgment defendant "would necessarily present a federal question." Here, if Medtronic had, instead of commencing the declaratory judgment action, continued its allegedly infringing practices, Mirowski had the option of terminating the license agreement and bringing a patent infringement action. Therefore, the court concluded, the underlying "threatened action" was one for patent infringement over which the federal courts have jurisdiction, and therefore jurisdiction was proper over the related declaratory judgment action.</p>

<p><strong>Burden of Proof</strong></p>

<p>The court then turned to the burden of proof issue. As everyone acknowledged, in a patent infringement suit, the plaintiff patentee has the burden of proof (or persuasion) to demonstrate infringement. Furthermore, the Federal Circuit recognized that this burden does not shift simply because the infringement dispute is framed as a declaratory judgment action. These principles would suggest that Mirowski had the burden of proof. The wrinkle that exists in this case is that the parties' rights were, at least to a certain extent, governed by a license&#8212a private agreement between the parties. The Federal Circuit had held that Medtronic had the burden of proof regarding Medtronic's right to sell the products under the license.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court disagreed in terms that were somewhat dismissive of the Federal Circuit&#8212normally considered one of the most influential courts after the Supreme Court&#8212calling its contrary conclusion a matter of "simple legal logic." It noted that the operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act is only procedural, but that the burden of proof is a substantive issue. Because the patentee always has the burden of proof in a patent infringement action, the fact that the issue is presented procedurally in a declaratory judgment action cannot shift the burden of proof. </p>

<p>Moreover, the court observed, the contrary rule would lead to problems. From a practical perspective, there are often numerous potential infringement arguments a patent holder might make. Placing the burden of proof on the non-patentee might require that party to disprove every possible theory of infringement in its case-in-chief, without knowing the basis for the alleged infringement. Furthermore, if the burden of proof differed in declaratory judgment actions, those actions would not preclude subsequent infringement actions, because the different proof standard would eliminate the preclusive effects of the ruling. Finally, the court noted that licensing agreements are quite common, such that a rule that shifted the burden of proof depending on who commenced the action would lead to uncertainty in the marketplace. Accordingly, the court reversed the Federal Circuit and unanimously ruled that Mirowski, the declaratory judgment defendant, had the burden of proving infringement.</p>

<p><strong>Implications of Medtronic</strong></p>

<p>The facts of <span class="casename">Medtronic</span> dictated the results. Although the parties had a license agreement, Medtronic framed its complaint almost exclusively in terms of the patent issues, arguing that its products fell outside the scope of the patents or that certain of the patents were invalid. The complaint did not seek a declaratory judgment regarding breach of the licensing agreement, the parties' rights under the licensing agreement or any other aspect of the licensing agreement. Thus, the case was truly one arising out of patent law, and could not be resolved without adjudicating the patent issues. This led to the court's two rulings.</p>

<p>The general rule is that the basis for federal jurisdiction must be present in the "well pleaded complaint," and cannot be based on a likely affirmative defense or counterclaim. However, a court may exercise federal question jurisdiction over a state law claim if resolution of the claim necessarily depends on a substantial issue of federal law. Here, although the parties had entered into a license agreement (normally covered by state law), the claims in the complaint were exclusively dependent on patent issues, and thus appropriate for federal subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p>A similar analysis underlies the court's burden of proof analysis. The well-settled law places the burden of proof for patent infringement on the patentee, Mirowski. The fact that the issues are presented in the form of a declaratory judgment does not change the burden of proof. Again, the license agreement is really peripheral to the dispute.</p>

<p>These issues might not be as readily resolved, however, if Medtronic had filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment about its rights under the licensing agreement, and Mirowski had alleged patent infringement as a defense or counterclaim. The court's analysis provides scant guidance as to how a court should address subject matter jurisdiction or burden of proof under such circumstances. The ruling also raises questions about whether a thoughtful plaintiff could influence this analysis by the way it pleads its claims&#8212framing them in terms of the contract if it prefers state court or in terms of the patent issues if it prefers federal court. It will be interesting to see whether the court refines its analysis to address these issues in the future.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Catherine Short of <a href="http://lldf.org/">Life Legal Defense Foundation</a> discusses the upcoming decision in <span class="casename">McCullen v. Coakley</span>...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/catherineshort.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>W</strong></font>hen the state of Massachusetts came before the US Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-abortion-clinic-buffer-zones.php">defend</a> its abortion clinic buffer zone law in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12653693490693214117&q=571+F.3d+167&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">McCullen v. Coakley</a>, one would have expected it to rely heavily on the most recent Supreme Court decision in this area of the law, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13410055345323866526&q=530+U.S.+703&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Hill v. Colorado</a>. In <span class="casename">Hill</span>, the court upheld a Colorado law prohibiting unconsented approaches within eight feet of any person located within 100 feet of medical facility entrances, for the purpose of leafleting, protest, education, or counseling. Although the statute applied to all medical facilities, it was widely understood to be targeted at anti-abortion speakers, and, indeed, many similar "bubble zone" laws enacted post-<class span="casename">Hill</span> apply only outside abortion clinics. </p>

                <p>However, rather than attempting to align its law prohibiting "entering or remaining" within thirty-five feet of abortion clinic entrances and driveways with <span class="casename">Hill's</span> endorsement of a governmental interest in protecting patients from "unwanted speech," Massachusetts vigorously denied any similarity between the two cases and disclaimed any interest in shielding unwilling listeners.</p>

                <p>The state also had little use for the lower court opinions upholding its law. In rejecting both facial and as-applied challenges to the law, the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit gave a novel twist to the "secondary effects" doctrine, a doctrine used almost exclusively to uphold zoning restrictions on sexually-oriented businesses. The First Circuit held that "abortion protesters are particularly aggressive and patients particularly vulnerable" at abortion clinics, and that the 35-foot buffer zones were narrowly tailored to curb the "deleterious secondary effects of anti-abortion protests." One would think the state would find this rationale ideal to justify its singling out of abortion clinics, but the state ignored it in its briefing and argument before the Supreme Court.</p>

                <p>Neither of these strategies on the part of the state is difficult to understand when one considers the current make-up of the Supreme Court. Massachusetts would be far from certain of finding five votes to affirm. <span class="casename">Hill</span> itself, much less an expansion of <class span="casename">Hill</span> to create zones where even consensual speech is banned. It is even less likely to find five votes to endorse the First Circuit's "secondary effects" theory that a restriction on speech applicable only outside abortion clinics, because they are abortion clinics, is nonetheless content-neutral.</p>

                <p>So, while ignoring the lower court opinion and running away from <class span="casename">Hill</span>, how did the state propose to win the votes of a majority of the justices? </p>

                <p>Its strategy was to cast the case as a challenge to the validity, not of a restriction on speech at abortion clinics, but of a restriction on conduct at any category of locations where there was a "history" of problems. Massachusetts claimed that its "unique," decades-long history of violence, blockades, intimidation, and even peaceful congregating around abortion clinic entrances had driven it to the expedient of creating the thirty-five foot buffer zones, excluding all members of the public not specifically exempted. Other methods of protecting access to clinic had been tried, but "none worked," the state claimed. </p>

                <p>The state's argument is riddled with difficulties, both factually and legally.</p>

                <p>First, the evidentiary basis for the finding of these supposedly longstanding and intractable problems was oral and written testimony in hearings before the Massachusetts legislature. Testimony supporting the law was unsworn, not subject to cross-examination, shot through with hearsay, frequently vague and lacking foundation, and primarily from indisputably biased witnesses. Yet time and again, the state pointed to individual statements from this testimony as solid proof of the problems that the statute was narrowly tailored to address. </p>

                <p>Even more tenuous was the record that other laws were inadequate to remedy the alleged problems. The primary focus of the legislative hearings that led to the enactment of the buffer zone law in 2007 was the difficulty of enforcing the prior bubble zone law prohibiting unconsented approaches within six feet of a person for the purpose of speech or leafleting. In upholding the similar statute in <span class="casename">Hill</span>, the Supreme Court found that the law provided ample alternative channels of communication because leafleters could "stand on the sidewalk at entrances and (without physically blocking the entrance) peacefully hand [patients] leaflets as they pass by." However, when sidewalk counselors in Massachusetts, barred from approaching patients, employed precisely this channel of communication, the state complained that the result was congestion around the clinic entrances, leading patients to "pass very close" to leafleters - just as the Supreme Court described.</p>

                <p>The enforcement "problem" the state faced was not that pro-life counselors were breaking the law but that they weren't breaking the law. Again and again, in briefs and in oral argument, the state contended that prosecuting troublemakers under existing laws would not address the problems allegedly caused by law-abiding picketers and counselors. According to Massachusetts, the clinic entrances were "perceived by patients to be blocked" by these peaceful speakers. Hence a new law was needed that would sweep them in as well, or, more accurately, would sweep them 35 feet away from the clinic entrances and driveways. </p>

                <p>The state insisted that abortion clinics had not been singled out; a buffer zone was possible at any class of locations that had a similar "history" of problems. The sincerity of this assertion was undercut when Justice Alito asked if a similar restriction could be imposed at all labor picketing sites, and the attorney general responded that it was unlikely an equivalent history of disruptive labor picketing would be found. </p>

                <p>And that is the crux of the problem: reliance on a supposedly factual history of problems to justify an otherwise unjustifiable restriction. There are already remedies in the law that take a fact-based approach: on-site police response and court-ordered injunctions. If a prosecutor or party can prove, through admissible evidence, that specific persons have damaged or threaten to damage some defined interest, a court may enter a judgment of conviction or sentence or issue an order restraining the responsible parties from causing further damage to that interest. Meanwhile, those who have not damaged such interests retain their rights. </p>

                <p>The legislative process is an inappropriate and inadequate substitute for the adversarial fact-finding and specificity that precedes issuance of a criminal judgment or an injunction. Legislatures hold hearings on the subjects they are interested in hearing about, and frequently only on those subjects they have already decided to act on. The evidence gathered in such hearings is selective, and "findings" are made by those who have usually already made up their minds. Massachusetts claims that a thirty-five foot no-entry zone could have ended up anywhere where there was evidence of picketing problems, but would the Massachusetts legislature even have held hearings if, for example, the Catholic Church complained about disruptive picketing by homosexual activists? </p>

                <p>Moreover, legislatures create laws that limit everyone, not just those who have wrongfully infringed on the rights or interests of another. Statutes and ordinances imposing restrictions on speech thus must be narrowly drawn as to all to whom they apply, i.e., every member of the general public. By contrast, a criminal sentence or injunctive restrictions need only be tailored to a single wrongdoer. An example is the case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1876391558280554729&q=487+F.2d+986&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Gallela v. Onassis</a>. Just because paparazzo Ron Gallela could be enjoined from coming with fifty feet of Jackie Onassis does not mean a law keeping the general public, or all photographers, fifty feet away from all former First Ladies would be narrowly tailored. </p>

                <p>The concept that, as the Solicitor General summarized it, "history matters" in assessing whether a speech restrictive law is narrowly tailored has other ramifications. If it is only the "unique" history in Massachusetts that makes one-size-fits-all, thirty-five foot zones narrowly tailored to fit the diversely configured clinics in that state, then such a law would not be narrowly tailored in Connecticut or New York or California or New Jersey&#8212;that is, not until their legislatures hold hearings and discern that they, too, all have similarly unique histories of "perceived blocking" at abortion clinics.</p>

                <p>As a practical matter, such a pre-textual history would mostly likely not be necessary if the Supreme Court upheld the Massachusetts law. If a thirty-five foot buffer zone around abortion clinics were held to be narrowly tailored to serve significant governmental interests in Massachusetts, it would almost certainly be held to be narrowly tailored everywhere else in the country, because that's how the time, place, and manner test for speech-restrictive laws works. The particular history of a jurisdiction has never been a decisive factor in the analysis. </p>

                <p>Unfortunately, the Supreme Court itself is responsible for confusing the constitutional standards governing injunctions and generally applicable laws. Twenty years ago, in another case involving anti-abortion speech activities, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7454820790275139037&q=Madsen+v.+Women%27s+Health+Center&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&scilh=0">Madsen v. Women's Health Center</a>, the court held that an abortion clinic could be granted an injunction imposing a thirty-six foot speech-free zone on the basis of the same type of broadly worded governmental interests that frequently undergird generally applicable laws, e.g., ensuring public safety and order and promoting the free flow of pedestrian traffic. Thus, the Supreme Court licensed a private party to assert governmental interests to justify injunctive relief restricting the free speech rights of its ideological opponents. </p>

                <p>The Supreme Court is not likely to use the <span class="casename">McCullen</span> case as a vehicle to untangle two decades' worth of jumbled First Amendment jurisprudence. However, it could make a beginning by enunciating the crucial importance of distinguishing between fact-based, individualized responses (police action, injunctions) that have impacts on First Amendment activity, on the one hand, and general legislative approaches that bind all persons willy-nilly. The former, individualized approach tailors the remedy to the wrong; the latter, across-the-board approach disrespects free speech rights by negating the freedom of the many in a purported attempt to rein in the few.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/adam-coogle">Adam Coogle</a> of <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> discusses Saudi Arabia's new terrorism law...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>S</strong></font>audi Arabia's <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ai-new-saudi-arabia-antiterrorism-law-will-worsen-human-rights-violations.php">new terrorism</a> law might look like a step forward, if only because it's written down. Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries with no written criminal penal code, and the penal regulations that authorities have issued are so vague that Saudis are mostly in the dark about what specific acts constitute crimes. </p>

                <p>The <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/02/06/saudi-arabia-terrorism-law-tramples-rights">Penal Law for Crimes of Terrorism and its Financing</a> (the "terrorism law") is the latest of a series of criminal laws that Saudi officials have created over the last five years, under international pressure to reform the criminal justice system. But instead of achieving their stated purpose of defining specific crimes, in practice these piecemeal reforms have created a veneer of legality for ongoing human rights abuses by Saudi criminal justice authorities. The terrorism law is no exception.</p>

                <p>The terrorism law is a vague, catch-all document that can&#8212;and probably will&#8212;be used to prosecute or jail anyone who criticizes the Saudi government and to violate their due process rights along the way. </p>

                <p>Consider, for example, the case of Mohammed al-Bajadi, a young Saudi political and civil rights activist. He has largely <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE23/025/2013/en/d3c89d65-c85b-4615-a8a9-da6d1103714b/mde230252013en.pdf">remained</a> (PDF) behind bars since March 21, 2011, a day after he helped organize a small demonstration in front of the Interior Ministry in Riyadh for Saudis who say the authorities are arbitrarily detaining their relatives. </p>

                <p>Authorities held al-Bajadi in <em>incommunicado</em>  detention for four months and in March 2012, Saudi Arabia's terrorism tribunal&#8212;the Specialized Criminal Court&#8212;convicted him and sentenced him to four years in prison and a five year ban on foreign travel. Al-Bajadi refused to participate in the trial proceedings because they were closed to his family and the public and he did not have a lawyer during interrogation or trial. The charges under which the court convicted him relate solely to his peaceful activism, including "participating in setting up an unlicensed association," "distorting the reputation of the state through the media," "insulting the impendence of the judiciary" and "inciting protests and sit-ins."</p>

                <p>On August 6, 2013, just before the Islamic Eid al-Fitr holiday, authorities suddenly released al-Bajadi from al-Ha`ir prison without explanation, sending him out on a deserted road south of Riyadh, forcing him to ask passers-by for a phone to call his family. Less than a week later, authorities re-arrested him and returned him to the prison&#8212;also without explanation.</p>

                <p>Under the new terrorism law, many of the severe due process violations that al-Bajadi suffered&#8212;including arbitrary arrest and detention on vague charges, <em>incommunicado</em>  detention, lack of access to a lawyer during the investigation stage and closed trial proceedings&#8212;are now "legal" in Saudi Arabia.</p>

                <p>The problems with the law begin with its extraordinarily vague and overly broad definition of terrorism. Other countries restrict the definition of terrorism to violence intended to force a state to take or refrain from a particular action. The Saudi law only refers to violence as an element of the crime with regard to attacks carried out against Saudis outside the kingdom or onboard Saudi transportation carriers. Inside the kingdom, "terrorism" can evidently be non-violent&#8212;it comprises "any act" intended to, among other things, "insult the reputation of the state," "harm public order" or "shake the stability of the state," which the law fails to clearly define. </p>

                <p>The practice of Saudi courts indicates that there is a serious risk that they will apply these terms in the terrorism law not just to terrorists but to peaceful dissidents as well. Al-Bajadi's charges, for instance, include "distorting the reputation of the state through the media." The Specialized Criminal Court is currently trying Fadhil al-Manasif, an activist from the Eastern province, on charges that include "contacting foreign news agencies to exaggerate news and insult the government of Saudi Arabia and its people." In 2013, Saudi courts convicted several <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2013/12/17/challenging-red-lines">prominent activists</a> from al-Bajadi's group, the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association&#8212;including Abdullah al-Hamid, Mohammed al-Qahtani and Abd al-Kareem al-Khudr&#8212;on charges that included "disturbing public order." All three are serving long prison sentences.</p>

                <p>The law applies not only to Saudi citizens or residents, but to non-Saudi citizens outside the kingdom, who could face terrorism charges for aiming to "infringe on the interests of the kingdom, or its economy, or its national or social security." It remains to be seen how Saudi authorities will use this overly broad provision, but it is vague enough to potentially apply to non-Saudis abroad who merely criticize Saudi Arabia's human rights record, such as journalists or international human rights activists.</p>

                <p>The terrorism law also grants extensive powers to the interior minister that undermine the due process rights of the accused in existing Saudi law. The new law authorizes the minister to order the arrests of terrorism suspects himself, without going through the public prosecutor, as well as to access the suspect's private banking and communications information, all without judicial oversight.</p>

                <p>The law guarantees access to lawyer, a right not granted to al-Bajadi in 2011. But access to the lawyer doesn't begin until an undefined time determined by the investigating agency, instead of during interrogation, in direct opposition to the explicit guarantees in the Saudi criminal procedure law. The law also raises the current legal limit on the time officials may hold a suspect in pretrial detention from six to twelve months, with unlimited extension upon court order, and allows for <em>incommunicado</em> detention of suspects for up to 90 days from the date of arrest.</p>

                <p>The law also gives the Specialized Criminal Court&#8212;to which it assigns jurisdiction over terrorism cases&#8212;the authority to hear witnesses and experts without the presence of the defendant or the defendant's lawyer. It requires the court only to inform them of the content of the testimony after the fact, greatly hampering their right to challenge this evidence though cross-examination. </p>

                <p>The law undermines the presumption of innocence for people suspected of terrorism-related crimes by giving criminal justice authorities the right to send them&#8212;including those who have not faced trial&#8212;to special "rehabilitation centers" that aim to "correct incorrect concepts" or "deepen patriotism" in lieu of detention and prosecution. </p>

                <p>If Saudi authorities want to make a true step forward in codifying criminal law, they should start by ditching the new terrorism law. The authorities could also amend the law to remove the arbitrary powers assigned to the interior minister without judicial oversight and to stipulate a clear definition of terrorism that could not be applied to peaceful dissidents and activists. But such amendments would require the revision or abrogation of most of the law's existing articles. </p>

                <p>In fact, Saudi authorities should review their entire criminal law codification strategy to ensure that any law it puts into effect spells out clearly defined criminal behavior and does not contradict international standards by criminalizing basic rights. Anything less constitutes a setback for human rights in the kingdom rather than an advance.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/deans-faculty-staff/profile.aspx?fac=152">David Crane</a> of the Syracuse University College of Law discusses some of the alleged human rights abuses occurring in connection with preparations for international sporting events ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/David_Crane.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font>s the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia draw to a close, many eyes are on the athletes competing for the most coveted prizes that international sport has to offer. We will inevitably hear stories about their many milestones and sacrifices that they have made to get where they are today. Moreover, we will hear stories of the triumphs and hurdles that the host government of Russia and local government of Sochi have overcome in order to stage a successful event. No doubt, these stories are very real and impressive. However, what you will most likely not hear about are the sacrifices made by the local citizens, the migrant workers, the environment, journalists, and ultimately the integrity of major international sporting events such as the Olympic Games.</p>

<p>In an event that was supposed to improve Russia's image within the international community and rejuvenate the city of Sochi, has instead become a catalyst for the commission of several human rights violations. In February 2013, an international "watchdog" organization, Human Rights Watch (HRW), issued a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2013/02/06/race-bottom-0">report</a> titled, "Race to the Bottom," which identified numerous abuses being committed against the migrant workers in relation to the construction of the venues for the games.  </p>

<p>The report indicated that workers are often housed with several dozen other workers in facilities that are meant for single families and are forced to work twelve hour shifts for days without any breaks. Additionally, many workers report that employers either fail to pay them their full wages or fail to pay them at all. Employers often engage in this practice to ensure that the workers will stay and continue to work despite the poor living conditions. As a measure to prevent the workers from bringing any claims of abuse to the government, employers refuse to provide them with copies of their employment contracts or their identification papers, passports and work permits. Consequently, there are numerous documented cases in which workers have been deported without pay when an employer no longer needs their services because they lack these papers.</p>

<p>Abuses have not been limited to the migrant workers. Local Sochi citizens have suffered as a result of construction as well. HRW has documented several cases in which the Russian government has evicted people from their homes in order to provide room for the Olympic sites. These people are often provided no compensation and left with nowhere else to go. Additionally, construction has caused serious environmental issues in the local villages surrounding the Olympic venues. For example, construction crews continue to conduct illegal trash dumps at sites in these villages and the citizens of the mountain village of Akshtyr have gone five years without a reliable source of drinking water after being disrupted by construction. Further, NGOs or protest groups advocating for these abuses to end have been subject to harsh inspections and harassment by the Russian government. Demonstrators won't even be able to freely protest unless they are in a location pre-designated by the government far away from the site of the games. Even journalists have been subject to constant harassment by police.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these abuses are not unique to just Sochi. Back in 2008, we saw the same abuses to migrant workers and local villagers in the years leading up to the summer games in Beijing. Workers suffered harsh working conditions and thousands of people were removed from their homes by the Chinese government never to be heard from again.  Additionally, the government also forcefully silenced many journalists and activists trying to bring light to these abuses.  Furthermore, forced evictions are already being reported in preparation for the 2016 summer games in Rio De Janiero to make way for new facilities.     </p>

<p>Nor are these types of abuses limited specifically to the Olympic movement. Construction of athletic venues for the quadrennial FIFA World Cup tends to yield the same types of human rights abuses seen during Olympic construction.  In 2010, many people were forced out of their homes so that new facilities could be built in South Africa. Some reports even indicated that people were moved into the equivalent of tin cans in remote communities. Currently, worker abuse is being documented for the construction of events as far out as the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. According to a recent Amnesty International <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_dark_side_of_migration_-_spotlight_on_qatars_construction_sector_ahead_of_the_world_cup.pdf">report</a> [PDF], 1.2 million migrant workers are part of the construction team in Qatar and are suffering the exact same abuses that we are seeing in Sochi. </p>

<p>Despite these well-documented abuses, neither the International Olympic Committee (IOC) nor FIFA have done much to intervene aside from public statements promising to investigate further into the allegations. As bodies that are supposed to be the symbols for peace and unity in our world, it is time for these organizations to take a stronger stand against these abuses. Both organizations have a duty under international law as well as their own governing charters to prevent these abuses from happening. Much can and should be done.</p>

<p>HRW has recommended that the IOC establish a standing committee on human rights to monitor human rights abuses.  FIFA should establish the same type of body. Additionally, both organizations must enforce the right to free press at these events, which is required by both the <a href="http://www.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf">IOC</a> [PDF] and <a href="http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/01/09/75/14/fifa_statutes_072008_en.pdf">FIFA</a> [PDF] charters. Even the corporate sponsors of these events could do more to help by threatening to pull sponsorships unless the abuses are remedied. Additionally, while much cannot be done to prevent the abuses currently taking place in Sochi, the IOC must make it a point to ensure that the Russian government redresses the harms that have already occurred.     </p>

<p>At the end of the day, as we marvel at the magnificent venues and the inspiring feats of the athletes at this year's games we must be sure to remember the hidden sacrifice of what it took to host the games. In the future, the organizing bodies of these prestigious events should protect the rights of both the athletes and non-competitors who are nonetheless affected by the games so that they can truly be a symbol of peace and unity that the rest of the world can aspire. As the <a href="http://www.olympic.org/documents/reports/en/en_report_1303.pdf">Olympic Creed</a> [PDF] reads: "The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well."  Have we lost the true spirit of the Games for political show?  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/law/faculty/rjs255/">Ronald Sievert</a> of the Bush School of Government at Texas A&#38;M University and adjunct professor at the University of Texas School of Law in national security and international law argues that when weighed against the minimal privacy interests impacted, government metadata surveillance programs produce a net gain to society but face a real constitutional challenge from Senator Rand Paul's lawsuit given the current composition of the Supreme Court ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/ronaldsievert.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n February 12, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/rand-paul-files-complaint-over-nsa-surveillance-program.php">announced</a> that he is filing a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1017524-rand-paul-complaint.html">lawsuit</a> challenging the constitutionality of the <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">NSA metadata program</a>. Paul is one of the most articulate of the potential 2016 presidential candidates and it is likely that in some part his actions are designed to attract the attention of liberals and libertarians alike. Whether he would eventually secure more votes than Barry Goldwater, George McGovern or other perceived fringe candidates is far beyond this writer's expertise. For those interested in national security law, however, it is hard to remain silent on the fascinating constitutional law questions raised by his complaint.</p>

<p>Before getting into truly controversial issues, it is necessary to keep in mind the incontrovertible basic facts that underlie this dispute. The metadata program does not monitor the content of telephone conversations or emails. As it exists today, it stores within a vast database only numbers called, duration and time. This data is only reviewed when senior NSA leadership determines that a number must be queried because there is articulable suspicion it is connected with terrorist activity. The phone activity of the average American citizen, therefore, is almost never accessed. On December 27, in <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/cases/show.php?db=special&id=364">ACLU v. Clapper</a>, US District Judge William Pauley noted that obtaining these records does not constitute a "search" and therefore probable cause is not needed to review it. The reason he held that it is not a search is because the data is willingly shared with a third party&#8212;the phone company&#8212;and the Supreme Court held in 1979 in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3033726127475530815">Smith v. Maryland</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15052729295643479698">US v. Miller</a> in 1976 that there is no expectation privacy for information you knowingly provide to another. </p>

<p>However, just eleven days prior to <span class="casename">Clapper</span>, US District Judge Richard Leon held the program was unconstitutional in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=533874086721635393">Klayman v. Obama</a>. This holding was justified in part because, unlike the case in <span class="casename">Smith</span>, hundreds of millions of records were stored and the ubiquity of cell phones today has made them "essential," leading citizens to have "an entirely different relationship with phones than 34 years ago." Lurking just beneath the surface of Leon's opinion is Justice Sonia Sotomayor's concurring opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6122276400056758151">US v. Jones</a> in which she wrote: "More fundamentally, it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. E.g., <span class="casename">Smith</span> and <span class="casename">Miller</span>. This approach is ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks." The opinions of the other justices in supporting restrictions on the government's long established use of transponders that generally only reflect location data observed by numerous third parties on the highway were in accord with Sotomayor's reasoning.</p>

<p>In answering the contested question of whether this particular government program is constitutional, it is easier to state what law and precedent is established today than to guess what the Supreme Court will say tomorrow. The Supreme Court of course has a history of completely reversing itself depending on the ideological makeup of the Court while claiming that they are adhering to precedent. In the national security realm we have the recent examples of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1251834070131661299">Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</a> finding President Bush had no authority to order military commissions pursuant to statutory language in the Uniform Code of Military Justice after the Court held in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11622761329856762325">Ex Parte Quirin</a> that the same statute gave President Roosevelt this authority. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2483936489630436485">Boumediene v. Bush</a> the court found enemy combatants had the right to habeas appeals to civilian courts after the court had held in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18438284635958239009">Johnson v. Eisentrager</a> that "[n]othing in our constitution extends such a right. The practice of every modern government is opposed to it."</p>

<p>If one assumes that accessing telephone records is a seizure, a fundamental element in determining the constitutionality of the NSA program is balancing the government's interest as reflected in the efficacy of the program versus the actual privacy interest compromised. This is of course because the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> does not demand all searches be supported by probable cause, but only that there be no "unreasonable" search and seizure. The usefulness of the metadata program is in great dispute. Leon wrote, "the government does not cite a single instance in which analysis ...of bulk metadata ... actually stopped an imminent attack." The left and the media repeatedly trumpeted this statement but ignored the rest of Leon's opinion where he did note the NSA and FBI presented a number of instances where terrorist connections were identified. These connections were significant enough that Pauley felt compelled to boldly highlight them in his opinion. Specifically, he cited the fact that metadata led to the identification of a co-conspirator of Najibullah Zazi in 2009, who attempted to blow up New York City subways as well as three others who were in the early stages of a plot to attack the New York Stock Exchange. He also noted that metadata had revealed the connection between David Headley in Chicago and the horrific Mumbai attacks. Leon had accorded little weight to these facts because the plots were "nascent" and there was theoretically time to find them with other techniques. But this latter reasoning upon review seems specious because without metadata the identity of the other terrorists might never have been discovered and, if undiscovered they easily might have successfully planned a devastating future attack. Those who argue the need for this program would appear to have the better of this argument.</p>

<p>As for the privacy interest compromised, because the data is never examined absent articulable suspicion that it is connected to a terrorist investigation, it is apparent that that the impact on privacy of the vast majority of American citizens is minuscule. It is true, as civil libertarians have argued, that unethical NSA employees may access the data of an ex-wife or rival. This may have even been done on a few occasions. We have had the same problem with IRS employees. As with the cop on the beat, all who have authority can occasionally abuse their power. But the answer is not to completely remove the power and authority of the police or an important agency because errant employees occasionally abuse their power. The answer is to seriously punish those who step over the line. Because the NSA, and the IRS, have computers that trace every search an employee makes, this can be done quite efficiently.</p>

<p>When Leon emphasizes the essential nature of telephones today, one wonders whether he has forgotten how much we relied on phones in 1979. In addition, where does his logic on reliance lead us? Are we to say that because today we all rely on air travel the TSA should not be able to search us without probable cause and thus overrule the Ninth Circuit's 2002 ruling in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6482278614730483973">Torbet v. United Airlines</a> that airport searches are legal because you could always choose not to fly?</p>

<p>Accordingly, to date most of those who have examined the NSA program have found it to be legal either because there is no expectation of privacy or the Constitutional balance favors the government. This includes President Obama, a former constitutional law professor. It also includes a number of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> judges (see <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7132559957157092438">US v. Moalin</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15257798982190471592">US v. Graham</a>) and, as the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/us-privacy-board-finds-nsa-phone-program-illegal.php">acknowledged</a>, at least 12 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court District Court (FISC) Judges. Yet the PCLOB, divided 3-2 along party lines, found the program unconstitutional and the expectation of privacy questions raised by Leon are serious.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's holdings that you have no expectation of privacy in what you share with third parties may be undercut in today's high tech world where third parties have vast information that, when accessed, can disclose almost everything about us. This is why Sotomayor questioned the long established third party doctrine and one of the reasons Leon ruled against the NSA. The counter argument is that many people today understand that, if you are not a hermit, numerous outside entities have access to your personal data. You need only look at the pop up advertisements on your computer that are tailored to your personal interests. Most of my students when questioned seemed to have reconciled themselves to this lesser expectation of privacy. Yet the line should be drawn somewhere and many would argue that the time and place to draw that line is when the government is accumulating the data. I can attest that the great majority of government employees have outstanding ethics and strong adherence to the rule of law. But the legacy of J. Edgar Hoover, Richard Nixon, Watergate and King George III runs very strong in the public mind.</p>

<p>President Obama may deflect this issue by placing data collection in the hands of the private providers. That would require the government to contact twelve or more companies every time it wanted basic data. An alternative would be to create an "independent agency" to hold the information. Many would see this as another arm of the government, and the government would feel hindered if it had to get court orders based on articulable suspicion or probable cause to access the data. Regardless, for the defense of privacy reasons indicated above, if Paul's lawsuit gets by standing and other procedural questions, and if the program is reviewed by the Supreme Court as it now exists, it is my opinion that a combination of liberal and libertarian thinking would lead to a conclusion that it is unconstitutional. A court opinion would also likely lead to the imposition of strict procedural standards before the data can be accessed under any new program. The trend of our culture is away from <span class="casename">Smith</span> and <span class="casename">Miller</span> and towards the thinking expressed by Sotomayor.</p>

<p>A Supreme Court opinion of this nature would be unfortunate. Those who so ardently defend what in reality might be insignificant effects on civil rights forget that the most important right of all is the right to life and that even the UN human rights community has acknowledged that a fundamental responsibility of governments is to protect the lives and security of their people. Daniel Saperstein and Richard Posner have <a href="http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2173&context=ilj">noted</a> [PDF] that in the UK, Germany, and other European nations, the government may access phone communications including content when national security is at stake without traditional judicial intervention and without meeting our high standard of probable cause. In the UK, interceptions only must be "necessary and proportionate" and in Germany there must be "actual indications" of terrorist activity. The US, however, with the FISA statute in 1978 applied criminal law standards to national security issues and our national security agencies have faced great challenges ever since. It would be helpful if the government's job could be made a little easier by a favorable Supreme Court decision supporting the NSA in Rand Paul's case. I doubt that will happen.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/faculty/directory/kirchmeier.html">Jeffrey L. Kirchmeier</a> of the CUNY School of Law argues that public opinion and litigation worked together to protect the constitutional rights of individuals in recent suits regarding New York's stop-and-frisk law ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/jeffreykirchmeier.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>D</strong></font>uring the tumultuous year of 1968, a few days after the funeral of Robert F. Kennedy and only a few months after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the US Supreme Court issued one of the most important <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> decisions in its history. In the case, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17773604035873288886">Terry v. Ohio</a>, the court held that a Cleveland police officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment when he <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=stop+and+frisk">stopped and frisked</a> John Terry based on a suspicion standard less than probable cause. </p>

<p>In the lone dissent from the decision, sixty-nine-year-old Justice William O. Douglas acknowledged that the times presented "hydraulic pressure" on the court to water down the constitution to give the police greater powers. Instead of joining the court's holding, though, he believed that such a drastic change from prior Fourth Amendment decisions first required citizens to evaluate whether or not to amend the Constitution. Warning that the court's step would take the country down a "totalitarian path," Douglas asserted that giving police so much discretion "should be made only after a full debate by the people of this country."</p>

<p>After <span class="casename">Terry</span> gave police officers the ability to stop and pat down citizens based on an articulable "reasonable suspicion" standard, many <a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/frdurb23&div=17&id=&page=">critics</a> argued that the case allowed more privacy intrusions to fall unfairly on the poor and on people of color. The lower standard further created an atmosphere that could permit some police officers to abuse that discretion either consciously or subconsciously, using race as a factor in deciding whom to stop. </p>

<p>Lawyers still debate these issues in courtrooms today, so it was not surprising when, recently, New Yorkers went to court to argue that the city's police department abused the practice of stopping and frisking people. But one may be surprised that the general public ultimately played a key role in finding a solution. Thus, in New York, a complex constitutional debate was addressed by the intersection of litigation, politics and popular opinion.</p>

<p>The stop-and-frisk litigation included <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4409525825240270486">Floyd v. City of New York</a>, where in the summer of 2013 US District Court Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled in favor of African-American and Hispanic plaintiffs who had been stopped by police. In the plaintiffs' <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983">Section 1983</a> class action against the city, Scheindlin considered evidence of a large number of unjustified police stops of citizens, as well as the ineffectiveness of the stops where only six percent of all stops resulted in any type of arrest and a much smaller percentage led to the discovery of any weapons. Scheindlin also evaluated studies showing that police officers were more likely to stop blacks and Latinos than whites (and with less justification). For example, in 2011, nearly 87 percent of all police stops were of blacks and Latinos, and overall, police were more likely to use force against blacks and Latinos. Further, she concluded that these discrepancies resulted from official policies. </p>

<p>In a separate opinion in August 2013, Scheindlin <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/Floyd-Remedy-Opinion-8-12-13.pdf">ordered</a> [PDF] several remedies for the constitutional violations. She instructed the New York City Police Department to institute reforms to ensure that police officers comply with the requirements of <span class="casename">Terry</span>. Additionally, she mandated a pilot project where police officers would wear cameras, and she appointed a monitor to oversee the reforms. </p>

<p>The City of New York challenged the rulings. In November 2013, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, citing Scheindlin's <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin">media interviews</a> about the litigation, <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/842f6125-dfa3-476a-96e3-6939a881b61c/1/doc/13-3123_13-3442_post.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/842f6125-dfa3-476a-96e3-6939a881b61c/1/hilite/">removed</a> [PDF] her from the case as the city continued to appeal the judge's ruling.  </p>

<p>Outside the courtroom, the federal litigation in <span class="casename">Floyd</span> and in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4155629147681289320">Ligon v. City of New York</a> helped spur additional public debate about invasions of privacy, part of the discussion that Justice Douglas sought more than forty years earlier. Organizations that had long been advocating for stop-and-frisk reform, like Communities United for Police Reform and the Open Society Foundations, used the litigation to garner further public attention on the issue. And more citizens began to express outrage about the police department's policy. A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/20/nyregion/new-yorkers-views-of-the-mayor-and-the-police.html">2012 poll</a> showed that New Yorkers were divided on the issue, although a substantial number of New Yorkers (45 percent) said they thought the police department's policy was excessive and that innocent people were being harassed.   </p>

<p>Politicians reacted to the court decisions and the public debate. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg <a href="http://rt.com/usa/stop-frisk-appeal-bloomberg-174/">defended</a> the city's policy, warning that changing the police department's stop-and-frisk program would leave more guns on the street and lead to more murders. Bloomberg's fears went back to when he began his stint as mayor more than a decade earlier in January 2002 following an election in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The country, and in particular New York City, faced the twenty-first century version of "modern forms of lawlessness" evoked in Douglas's dissent. The city's stop-and-frisk policy expanded during Bloomberg's first term as mayor, and he continued to support the policy even as evidence mounted about its failings and ineffectiveness.</p>

<p>The Fourth Amendment continued to be a political issue in the fall 2013 New York City mayoral campaign. Democratic candidate Bill de Blasio joined other officials and candidates to advocate against the city's excessive stop-and-frisk policy. There were other issues in the mayoral campaign, but the stop-and-frisk issue seemed to help de Blasio, who <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Mayor-Race-Democrat-Bill-de-Blasio-Joe-Lhota-Republican-230579591.html">won</a> the fall 2013 election overwhelmingly against Republican Joe Lhota, who had <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/11/01/nyc-stop-and-frisk-appeal-could-be-over-after-election/">asserted</a> that the policy was "good for New Yorkers." </p>

<p>After the election, Mayor de Blasio continued to listen to the citizens who complained about the racially discriminatory practice. Some might have wondered whether it was politically sound for a mayor to put his police force under federal oversight, but he recognized the public outrage at the policy and remembered his campaign pledge. Mayor de Blasio first <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/bratton-named-nypd-commissioner-v21770623">appointed</a> a new police commissioner, Billl Bratton, a popular former commissioner who supported stop-and-frisk reforms. Then, not long after de Blasio's election, his office reached <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/nyregion/de-blasio-stop-and-frisk.html?_r=0">an agreement</a> with the litigation plaintiffs to allow a court-appointed monitor for three years to oversee the New York Police Department's work to reform the policy. As part of the agreement, the city <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/files/City%27s 1 30 2014 Unopposed Motion for Remand..pdf">asked</a> [PDF] the Court of Appeals to remand the pending <span class="casename">Floyd</span> case back to the district court to allow the parties to settle the case, and on February 21, 2013, the appellate court <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/21%20Feb%202014%20COA%20Decision%20on%20remand.pdf">granted</a> [PDF] the request.</p>

<p>Usually, courts&#8212and not a majority vote&#8212play a necessary role to protect the constitutional rights of those accused of crimes. Popular opinion often is not the best source for protecting the rights of individuals. But here, litigation and popular opinion worked together. Lawyers like those at the Center for Constitutional Rights and others involved in the litigation won an important court victory that highlighted problems with the city's stop-and-frisk policy. Additionally, through public education by organized groups, media coverage of the litigation, and politicians openly debating an important policy issue, public discussion played a key role in helping curb a practice that invaded the privacy of many citizens in a discriminatory manner.</p>

<p>The decisions in New York will not end all stop-and-frisk practices, which are still constitutional if carried out within the guidelines of <span class="casename">Terry</span>. But the voice of the people, not just the courts, helped drive reform to limit abuses of <span class="casename">Terry</span> and of the Fourth Amendment. In these worrisome times where the government has the ability to be more invasive in our lives than it ever has been before, the lessons from New York and the advice of Douglas calling for public debate are worth remembering. </p>

		<title>The Deception of &quot;Arab Spring&quot;: Legal Dilemmas in Egypt</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://cfms.uct.ac.za/staff/ibrahim-saleh-phd/">Dr. Ibrahim Saleh</a> of the <a href="http://www.uct.ac.za/">University of Cape Town</a> says that a wide array of problems are currently plaguing Egypt and are severely hampering the nation's development...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/ibrahimsaleh.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he fear and mistrust that result from violence and crisis limit people's perception of their political community and contribute to a "fragility of citizenship" on various levels. Such "fragility of citizenship" has had direct consequences for the quality of democratic governance that Egypt has experienced over the last few decades. Specifically, since December 2010, a new kind of cultural resistance was introduced emphasizing "street republics" over the formal institutions of states. Additionally, the relations between the media and military affairs, and the media and the security field, have been dramatically altered as a result of the increasing socio-political and economic pressures that have redefined the social contract in many of the other Middle East and North African nations.</p>

                <p>Islamic movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and Salafis, have become a political majority in Egypt after the recent elections. This has had dire consequences for Egypt. The Freedom and Justice Party, the political arm of the MB aimed at re-Islamization of Egypt, strives towards the application of Sharia&#8212;with the aim of establishing a tyrannical theocratic regime akin to that of Iran. MB received funding from tithes from members' annual income, as well as generous donations to operate on doctrines of proselytization (da'wa) and deception (taqiyyah).</p>

                <p>The political upheaval and waves of popular protests since 2011 are inadequately explained by public discontent towards economic hardship, political oppression and social inequalities. Egypt has fallen into disarray with continuous negative human development indications that range from being the lowest in personal income in the world, declining productivity, poor scientific research, decreasing school enrollment, high illiteracy and lagging health conditions that are behind comparable nations. The gendered dynamics of poverty, income gaps, unemployment and illiteracy (as well as the gender relations) help to better explain the protest movements.</p>

                <p>The Egyptian media is still crippled by repressive measures that range from the <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-expert-attacks-against-journalists-in-egypt-need-to-be-investigated.php">jailing and persecution of journalists </a> to the widespread terrorizing journalists of "'insult laws" and criminal defamation that created a sort of nauseating communication crisis setting. The state of human rights is in one of its lowest ebbs; including the Press Law, the Publications Law, and the penal code regulation governing the press. According to Freedom House, Egypt is <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/freedom-press-2013#.UwvFWBxYfqI">deemed</a> to have an un-free press, while the Reporters Without Borders emphasized that harassment and imprisonment of journalists remain prevalent in Egypt, which <a href="http://fr.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/classement_2013_gb-bd.pdf">placed</a> (PDF) Egypt on the rank of 158 out of 179 nations on press freedoms.</p>

                <p>The status of journalism in the country reflects the values of its society (particularly its soci-political and economic environment). It is not surprising to observe the very low ebb of journalism practices and civil liberties in Egypt. Journalism remains sitting in a shadow as a result of state intervention, censorship, legal and regulatory issues. The Egyptian journalists are used to being on the front lines and fighting for basic human rights while being confronted with oppressive laws and regulations. Journalists certainly would never think of having a future, unless they enter an automatic alliance with the "Patron State."</p>

                <p>In this hostile environment, extreme manipulation of the media is routinely implemented and transformed through the cumulative effects of fear. In this destabilizing setting, it is rational to find the spin of increasing radical tone in political voices and new modes of political engagement. This volatile situation has gradually led  to "deliberative enclaves," where group positions and practices are reinforced rather than openly critiqued.</p>

                <p>Confusion and lack of institutional legitimacy is another side of the crisis. Many non-Arab media and political experts disregarded the fact that tensions between the West and the Muslim world are not a result of a clash of religions; they are rather a symptom of deep-rooted clashes of interest and a lack of any mutual understanding of the contenders. The political coalition of Muslims in Egypt, however, has constantly been projecting rhetoric of protection against "otherness" to rescue the Egyptians from dreadful dangers that cannot be seen. According to the MB media, it is an attempt to conduct social and religious cleansing to protect the purity of "Ummah" (Islamic State) from sinners and anyone who would not comply with their law without questioning. </p>

                <p>MB has always used "taqiyah" (lying) for political gains. However, much of the MB threat is a fantasy which has been exaggerated and distorted to justify using force and violence against the potential enemies everywhere. Along with taqiyah, violence is utilized. The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) has identified 701 cases of torture at Egyptian police stations since 1985, with a record of 204 victims dying of torture and mistreatment in that time. The EOHR contends that many crimes of torture occur in broad daylight at police checkpoints and in people's homes, in flagrant violation of the people's dignity and freedom. </p>

                <p>Further, civil rights in Egypt are jeopardized by number of laws that have a bearing on their applications such as the Riotous Assembly Law, the Meetings and Demonstrations Law, the Emergency Law and the Police Organization Law. </p>

                <p>The Riotous Assembly Law is by nature an exceptional law similar to a martial decree. This law was promulgated during the exceptional circumstances Egypt experienced under the oppression of the British occupation. <br />
                    In May 1999, the Egypt Parliament passed a <a href="http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/07/2law153.cfm">law</a> (Law Number 153 of 1993) encroaching upon the freedom of non-governmental organizations (NGO) to organize and act. The law banned private groups from working to influence government policy or union activity. It gave the Ministry of Social Affairs power to disband boards of directors. As a result, NGOs had to seek permission from the government before accepting foreign donations. Following a wave of protests by both Egyptian and international NGOs, the law was <a href="http://www.cihrs.org/?p=5852&lang=en">found unconstitutional</a> by the Constitutional Court on procedural grounds, and it was suspended. However, the country's older law on NGOs (Law Number 32 of 1964), which is seen as equally repressive, remains in force. </p>

                <p>Over a period of a year, MB disclosed their apocalyptic vision of a disease that was spreading from the west throughout the world and called it "jahilliyah" (a state of barbarous ignorance), but in fact, they were regressing to a barbarous age. Jahilliyah under these circumstances is used as a way of fighting the enemy, and in fact has a kind of existential weight, because somehow it is doing God's will on earth. However, torture in Egypt was and is still wide spread, and escalation of sectarian violence exists (especially the plight of Copts and Shias who have been killed in many occasions). The faltering economy does not help matters, either (the price of everything is rising and everything seems to be falling apart).</p>

                <p>On February 1, 2011, senior Egyptian Brotherhood leader Muhammad Ghannem <a href="http://library.constantcontact.com/download/get/file/1101941066390-13/The+Muslim+Brotherhood+Evolution+-+An+Overview.pdf">stated</a> (PDF) on the Iranian Arabic TV network Al-Alam that the MB would demand the closure of the Suez Canal as soon as the organization gets into a position of power. His statement alone spiked the oil price. His further declaration that Egypt should go to war with Israel was unsettling as well.</p>

                <p>As stated by Elias Canetti in his book <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Crowds_and_Power.html?id=_DNDCGkrAf0C">Crowds and Power</a>, the most blatant tyranny is the one which asks the most blatant questions. Canetti discerned six ingredients necessary for oppression: secrecy, physical brutality, swift reaction, the right to question and to demand answers, the right to judge and condemn and the right to pardon and show mercy. Egypt turned its back on a secular dictatorship only to fall into the arms of what looks like a budding religious fascism dictatorship that made many of those who the streets in the first revolution wish that the good old days of Hosni Mubarak would come back. As nineteenth century satirist Ambrose Bierce once quipped, revolutions are "an abrupt change in the form of misgovernment." </p>

                <p>Many revolutionaries that fought the country's successive authoritarian regimes have been marginalized and are forced to watch as the bloodletting continues. Life in Egypt has become a faint glimmer and is in danger of being extinguished completely. Many Egyptians and non-Egyptians that lived in the euphoria of "Arab Spring" downplayed the detrimental finale that profoundly undermined democracy in Egypt.</p>

                <p>Moving abruptly from rigid authoritarianism to national elections without first building civil society has made Egypt at prey and hijacked by Islamist forces again. "Despair is betrayal" is a mantra that has echoed throughout Egypt during the many tough times over the past three years. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.vermontlaw.edu/Our_Faculty/Faculty_Directory/Laurie_Ristino.htm">Laurie Ristino</a> of the Vermont Law School argues that an array of environmental, economic and political factors have broken down the traditional coalition behind the farm bills' passage in the past, but in its wake shifting policy objectives and broader interest in the bill have emerged that promise to substantially alter the nature of the bill, whether for better or worse remains to be seen ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/laurieristino.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>E</strong></font>nding a tortuous legislative journey, President Obama recently <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/obama-signs-farm-bill-into-law.php">signed</a> into law the <a href="http://agriculture.house.gov/sites/republicans.agriculture.house.gov/files/pdf/legislation/AgriculturalAct2014.pdf">Agricultural Act of 2014</a> [PDF], popularly known as the farm bill. At nearly a thousand pages and costing an estimated $956 billion over the next decade, this omnibus legislation fundamentally impacts American life. The farm bill's twelve titles cover policy areas ranging from agricultural commodities to energy. Once the legislative province of certain lawmakers, industry groups and environmental non-profits, a broader spectrum of interest groups have now taken note of the farm bill's importance and the rare opportunity it presents to fund new programs and influence policy.</p>

<p>There are many policy changes reflected in the 2014 farm bill: shifting of farmer benefits from commodity payments to crop insurance; reduced benefits to the nation's poor under the Supplemental Food and Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)&#8212;previously known as "food stamps"&#8212;and consolidation of conservation programs with reduced funding, are just a few examples. But, arguably, the most compelling aspect of this farm bill process was its difficult road to passage. The traditional coalition of farm state and urban lawmakers that pushed previous farm bills past the legislative finish line in the past has broken down. The erosion of the traditional coalition has occurred at a time when broader interest in the farm bill has emerged. These two factors, together, signal a watershed change in farm bill history, which could greatly impact future farm bill programs and priorities.</p>

<p>Why discuss the next farm bill now? The fact of the matter is that this omnibus legislation is so important that strategy for the next farm bill is already in the works in many corners. What exactly is at stake and why should we care? I will give an overview of farm bill policies that were hotly debated during the 2014 farm bill process as likely areas that will be revisited during the next farm bill. These policies were concentrated in the three biggest ticket items in the farm bill: commodities (title I), conservation (title II) and nutrition (title IV).</p>

<p>Since the dust bowl, Congress has struggled, with mixed results, to develop an effective farm safety net, which would protect farmers from price volatility, over production, and crop failure. The <a href="http://www.usda.gov/documents/Bill_6124.pdf">2008 farm bill</a> [PDF] safety net focused resources on commodity payments to farmers. Direct payments, however, increasingly came under fire as wasteful and disproportionately benefiting the largest producers. Given this and the need to find cost savings, Congress eliminated direct commodity payments and shifted the farm safety net to crop insurance (title XI) in the 2014 farm bill.</p>

<p>Crop insurance is heavily subsidized by taxpayers at approximately 60 percent of the cost of insurance premiums. Originally authorized in the 1930s, federal crop insurance had traditionally low enrollment. However, over the last two decades, enrollment has skyrocketed with increased federal subsidies and coverage. Federal spending on crop insurance has also increased dramatically due to higher crop prices and extreme weather events. For example, <a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40532.pdf">crop insurance spending</a> [PDF] reached a high of $14 billion in 2012 when crops failed due to drought. Consequently, one important question is whether shifting the safety net to crop insurance will result in a net savings as climate change-driven weather events intensify. Another question is whether expanded crop insurance coverage will result in perverse incentives to producers to adopt riskier and environmentally harmful planting practices such as breaking-out fragile lands in order to increase production. </p>

<p>A critical debate during the 2014 farm bill was whether crop insurance benefits would be coupled with soil and wetland conservation compliance (title II). In the 2008 farm bill, in order to qualify for commodity payments, producers were required to comply with these soil and wetland conservation policies&#8212;popularly known as Sodbuster and Swampbuster. In the end, Congress adopted the Senate's proposal to link conservation compliance to crop insurance. This was a critical victory for the environment. Without such a requirement, years of public investment to reduce soil erosion and prevent wetland conversion would have been undermined. Yet, it remains to be seen whether the shifting of the farm safety net to the crop insurance program will have other, unintended environmental consequences.</p>

<p>Another area of contentious debate was how much to reduce SNAP spending, which is nearly 80 percent of the cost of the farm bill. It was this debate that contributed significantly to the delay in passing the omnibus legislation. The House proposed to reduce SNAP spending by $39 billion while the Senate's proposal would have trimmed the program by $4 billion. <a href="http://www.farmland.org/programs/federal/documents/2014_0213_CRS_FarmBillSummary.pdf">Ultimately</a> [PDF], the conferees agreed upon $8 billion in reduced spending, avoiding deep cuts. SNAP is our <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=2226">most important </a>anti-hunger program, helping feed 47 million low-income Americans last year. Over 70 percent of SNAP participants are comprised of families with children. The average SNAP benefit in 2013 was $133 per recipient or about $4.45 a day. In 2014, the average benefit is <a href="https://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/meet-new-farm-bill_781555.html">estimated</a> to drop below $130. The fractious SNAP debate embodied the new farm bill politics and death of the Carter-era rural-urban coalition.</p>

<p>There were subtler changes to this farm bill as well, reflecting the opportunity that the farm bill presents to germinate progressive programs and policies. In particular, support for local, regional and diversified food systems programs was doubled to over $500 million. This is still a drop in the bucket given total farm bill outlays, but this funding gain is an important acknowledgment of consumer demand for alternatives to the conventional agriculture. For example, the farm bill <a href="http://sustainableagriculture.net/blog/farm-bill-subsidy-reform/">authorizes</a> the development of new risk management products for diversified and organic farms. In addition, the farm bill includes increased funding for programs supporting local, diversified food systems, including direct marketing and cost share for organic certification.</p>

<p>Americans are increasingly concerned with what they eat and how it is produced. As a consequence, there is greater interest in the farm bill policies that shape American food and farming. Similarly, environmental groups are becoming more engaged in the farm bill because of the enormous environmental impacts of agriculture and the potential of the farm bill to ameliorate some of those harms through the conservation title. It's a whole new ball game for the farm bill. The question is whether a new coalition emerges that is able to produce a farm bill that better balances limited financial and natural resources against the demand for food and fiber.</p>

		<title>Paroline Raises Difficult Questions for Supreme Court</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <http://www.willamette.edu/wucl/faculty/profiles/binford/>Warren Binford</a> of <http://www.willamette.edu/wucl/index.html>Willamette University College of Law</a> argues that the US Supreme Court should hold individual possessors of child pornography liable for the full damages allowed under the Violence Against Women Act first to help victims of child pornography recover as quickly and fully as possible and to uphold US international treaty obligations ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/warrenbinford.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n January 22, 2014, the US Supreme Court  <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-child-pornography-gun-purchasing.php">heard</a> oral argument in what promises to be one of the most difficult decisions of this term, <a href=" http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-8561_bqm2.pdf">Paroline v. United States</a> (PDF). At issue is the amount of restitution owed to victims of child pornography by offenders guilty of possession.<br />
According to the attorney for Doyle Paroline, the offender in this case, the restitution amount should be nothing. The attorney for the victim argued that Paroline should be ordered to pay the full amount of the victim's losses, and the US Solicitor General maintained that the amount should be somewhere in between, but was unable to identify a reliable formula to guide courts. </p>

<p>The case arose from the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit interpretation of <a href=" http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2259">18 U.S.C. &#167; 2259</a>, a 1994 law passed as part of the <a href=" http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c106:H.R.1248: ">Violence Against Women Act<a/> ("VAWA") that mandates full restitution for victims of certain federal sex crimes, including possession of child pornography. The mandatory restitution statute includes six categories of potential losses for a victim, including (A) health services; (B) rehabilitation; (C) transportation, temporary housing, and child care expenses; (D) lost income; (E) attorneys' fees and costs; and (F) "any other losses suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the offense."</p>

<p>The Fifth Circuit read the phrase "as a proximate result of the offense" to apply only to the sixth "catchall" category of losses. Every other circuit court that has interpreted the statute reads the phrase to apply to all six categories of potential losses. </p>

<p>A significant amount of ink in the parties' briefs was devoted to canons of statutory construction such as the rule of the last antecedent, distinctions of usage between commas versus semi-colons, and the application of <a href=" http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3730389075567285346 ">Porto Rico Railway, Light & Power Co. v. Mor</a>. Despite the statute's express language and orderly punctuation, even the most well-recognized grammarian among the justices, Antonin Scalia, looked his former law clerk, Paul Cassell (who was representing the victim, "Amy," in this case), squarely in the eye during oral argument and insisted that Congress could not have intended "to sock" Paroline with all of Amy's losses. After all, Paroline possessed only two images of Amy being raped by her uncle, and Amy's estimated total damages are nearly $3.4 million. Sure, Paroline is a "bad guy," Scalia acknowledged, and of course, he should be punished and ordered to pay restitution, but $3.4 million for possessing two child sex abuse images?</p>

<p>Without a moment of hesitation, Cassell assured the court that indeed, Congress intended precisely that result. In support of Amy's position, Cassell relied on the plain language of the statute, which mandates that a court "shall order restitution for any offense under this chapter" and "the order of restitution ... shall direct the defendant to pay the victim ... the full amount of the victim's losses ..." (emphasis added). Amy's attorney also relied on the legislative history of the statute, which was <a href=" http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Paroline-Amicus-Brief-Final.pdf ">summarized</a> (PDF) in an amicus brief submitted by a bipartisan group of seven US senators who served in the 103rd Congress and supported VAWA. The legislative history presented by the US senators also supports a plain reading of the statute. </p>

<p>Why would Congress have enacted such an aggressive restitution statute and why should the US Supreme Court uphold the Fifth Circuit's plain reading of the statute? Modern child pornography is expanding at an explosive rate. The invention of the Internet and the digitalization of images have made modern child pornography a crime without borders that continues victimization indefinitely for countless children. Now, anyone with a smartphone and access to a child can become a producer of child pornography and anyone with Internet access is a potential consumer and distributor of sex abuse images.  </p>

<p>As a result, millions of individuals <a href=" http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A.HRC.12.23.pdf">all over the globe</a> are viewing more than fifteen million sex abuse images of children in an international market valued between three and twenty billion dollars annually. As the world's appetite for sex abuse images of children grows, the victims selected are increasingly younger and the acts more violent, according to <a href=" http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/paroline-v-united-states/ ">amici</a> in <class span="casename">Paroline</span>. </p>

<p>Even prior to the widespread digitalization of sex abuse images and global Internet access, the US Supreme Court recognized in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4775063558409617777">Osborne v. Ohio</a>, that the insidious nature of child pornography possession takes a heavy toll on its victims: "[t]he pornography's continued existence causes the child victim's continuing harm by haunting the children in years to come."</p>

<p>In this case, Paroline is just one of at least 70,000 people who have collected images of Amy's rape as a child. Unfortunately, Amy was not his only victim. He had hundreds of child sex abuse images in his possession, and pled guilty to the federal crime of possession of child exploitation materials. What the court record does not reveal, but the <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20101128-In-just-a-few-clicks-of-5077.ece">media</a> did, is that, at the time of his arrest, Paroline was in the final stages of adopting two young sisters, one of whom had previously been sexually abused. </p>

<p>As with all identified child pornography victims whose sex abuse images are in the <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/CVIP">National Child Victim Identification Program</a> database, Amy receives a legal notice each time one of her sex abuse images is found in the collection of another offender. These notices arrive every day, all year long, year after year. Amy has arranged for the notices to be sent to her attorney rather than her directly. However, experts have advised trial courts that Amy's awareness of the continuous consumption of her child sex abuse images by countless people all around the globe will impact her for the rest of her life. Amy's losses primarily result from psychological care and lost wages, and will amount to several million dollars over her lifetime.</p>

<p>Did Paroline cause Amy's losses? He at least contributed to them, according to Amy's attorney, along with the countless other offenders involved in the production, distribution, and collection of images showing her rape as a child. Together, this group of offenders is indivisible and ever-expanding. Collectively, they caused and continue to perpetuate Amy's harm, which is also indivisible. Amy's significant psychological harm endures simultaneous with her continuing victimization, and cannot be disaggregated among the producer, distributors, and possessors of her child sex abuse images. If Paroline thinks they can be aggregated, it is he and the other offenders who should bear the burden of disaggregation, maintains Amy's attorney, not the child sex abuse victim. </p>

<p>What about those who cannot pay? Ultimately, the statutory scheme limits recovery from each offender in accordance with his income and assets, and many offenders are judgment proof. Thus, each offender will be liable for the entire amount of Amy's losses, but will only pay according to his ability. For those whose wealth allows them to pay a greater share, their equitable shares should be addressed by allowing them to recover contributions from other offenders; not by limiting the ability of child pornography victims to recover restitution fully and quickly from the convicted child pornographers who have victimized them.   </p>

<p>The Fifth Circuit's plain reading of the mandatory restitution statute also should be upheld because it is consistent with the US's treaty obligations and compliance reports. Unfortunately, the US is the leading source country for both child pornography victims and offenders in the global market. Fortunately, the US has taken a leading role in the global effort to combat child pornography through the development of an international legal framework that recognizes child victims' rights to restoration and supports more robust cross-border enforcement mechanisms through entities such as Interpol. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPSCCRC.aspx">Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography</a> is the cornerstone treaty focused on child victims of sex abuse within this international legal framework. The US was a leader in drafting the treaty and promptly ratified it. The Optional Protocol expressly provides for victim recovery from offenders, and the US State Department has repeatedly relied on the mandatory restitution statute to support US compliance with the treaty in reports to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which serves as the treaty's monitoring body.</p>

<p>The US needs to maintain its leadership in the international community not simply by fighting child pornography aggressively both domestically and abroad, but also by ensuring that victims are restored promptly and fully. A plain reading of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2259 will accomplish both goals. The US Supreme Court should uphold the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of the mandatory restitution statute ordering Paroline to pay his victim the full amount of her losses. </p>

<p>On this episode of the JURIST Podcast, Pitt Law students Taras Shablii and Slava Opeida discuss the recent protests, legislation and political deals to come out of their native Ukraine. They gave some background on the cause of the first wave of protests: the suspension of negotiations on a long-expected trade deal with the European Union. The government of Viktor Yanukovych then passed several laws in response to the ongoing protest movement, largely aimed at suppressing dissent. Finally, we turn to ongoing developments in this fast-moving story, including the release from prison of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, confirmed during our recording session on Feb. 22, 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Quagmire of Statutory Interpretation at Center of ABC v. Aereo Copyright Case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Antonio Del Mastro, <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/law/">Northeastern University School of Law</a>, Class of 2014, discusses the possible interpretations of the Copyright Act that the US Supreme Court is tasked with choosing in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/american-broadcasting-companies-inc-v-aereo-inc/">American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. v. Aereo, Inc.</a>, which will determine whether or not Aereo's business model is a clever innovation or a patent infringement of copyright ...</p>

<p><br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="ADelMastro.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/ADelMastro.jpg" width="120" height="180" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>The case</strong></font></p>

<p>The Supreme Court recently surprised many when, on January 10, 2014, it <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supeme-court-to-hear-streaming-television-copyright-case.php">granted review</a> to a particularly thorny copyright case coming out of the Second Circuit: <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15534053238558488142">ABC, Inc. v. Aereo, Inc.</a> The surprise stems from the relatively undeveloped case history behind the issues at hand. Typically, the Supreme Court will wait for a split in the circuits before granting review to a particular matter&#8212allowing an opportunity for the lower courts to develop multiple analyses of the underlying issues&#8212but the stakes in this case may have prompted faster action. Certainly Aereo's equally surprising move to <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Aereo-Cert-Petition-Response-Brief-Final-Filed-12-12-13.pdf">agree</a> [PDF] to the review encouraged the court's decision.</p>

<p><strong>Aereo</strong></p>

<p>Aereo, the respondent, is an upstart technology service company based in New York City. It offers its paying subscribers the capability to view local broadcast television stations through the Internet. The manner in which it achieves this, however, is the core subject matter of the litigation. </p>

<p>Aereo's service works by linking its subscribers to an array of antennas on a motherboard. Importantly (for reasons seen below), each subscriber is only linked to a single antenna at any time; although each assignment to an antenna is both dynamic and temporary. The <a href="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1296989/thumbs/o-AEREO-facebook.jpg">antennas</a> themselves are small, zig-zagged structures about the size of a dime. This allows Aereo to house thousands of inter-connected antennas and antenna arrays in a relatively small area of space. </p>

<p><strong>The Dispute</strong></p>

<p>According to Aereo, its service model is akin to facilitating the connection between a user and the user's own, private television antenna for the authorized reception of local broadcasts. The petitioners in this case, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and its affiliates, disagree. They say that Aereo's service is directly analogous to the retransmission of a broadcast signal by a television provider, an act which&#8212under the provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/topn/cable_television_consumer_protection_and_competition_act_of_1992">Cable Television Comsumer Protection and Competition Act</a>&#8212requires permission from the broadcaster. As one might guess, the "permission" in question is granted in the form of a license and is conditioned upon the payment of an appropriate fee. In fact, retransmission fees can account for a <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/902241-cbs-keeps-broadcast-profitable-atop-retransmission-syndication-fees-for-now">sizeable portion</a> of a broadcaster's revenue. </p>

<p>It's not just that broadcasters are concerned about losses of potential revenue, however. What is actually at stake in <span class="casename">Aereo</span> is the entire compensation model for the broadcast television industry. In other words, broadcasters are not solely concerned with fees that Aereo might be avoiding, but with the consequences that any green-light to Aereo's business model might have on their means of generating revenue.</p>

<p>The prime basis for a broadcaster's revenue stream is the bundle of intellectual property rights vested in the content that it provides. Not only do broadcasters use the exclusivity of these rights to charge retransmission fees, but they also leverage the control of these rights when negotiating fees with advertisers. Under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17">Copyright Act</a>, a broadcaster's content is classified as an <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101">"audio visual work"</a> and &#167; 106 of the act protects the broadcaster's exclusive right to "publicly perform" that work. ABC and its affiliates claim that Aereo's service is a violation of the exclusive right to publicly perform their proprietary content. Aereo claims that it is not publicly performing anything; it is merely facilitating each individual subscriber's lawful viewing of the broadcast transmission. Therefore, the key question before the Supreme Court is: "Does Aereo's service constitute a 'public performance'?" Even though the question seems simple, the answer is not. </p>

<p><strong>"Public Performance" . . . Right?</strong></p>

<p>According to &#167; 101 of the Copyright Act, the performance of a work "publicly" means:<blockquote>(1) to perform or display it at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered; or</p>

<p>(2) to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to a place specified by clause (1) or to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.</blockquote>Although Aereo's service model avoids the type of public performance described in clause (1), the petitioners assert that the model is nonetheless a violation of clause (2). This clause is known as the Transmit Clause. </p>

<p>The Transmit Clause is the fulcrum of dispute in the Aereo case and the source of its uncertainty. On the surface, it seems that Aereo's system does indeed "transmit" the broadcaster's "performance or display" to "members of the public," even though they are in "separate places" and at "same [or] different times." However, Aereo points out that this conflates the term "performance or display of the work" with the work itself (rendering the phrase redundant). Because courts must seek to avoid <a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-589.pdf">"surplusage"</a> [PDF] in matters of statutory interpretation, such an interpretation is impermissible. The only way to properly make sense of the Transmit Clause, says Aereo, is to understand the term "performance or display" (that "the public" is "capable of receiving") as the actual "transmission" of the work. In this technical reading of the statute, Aereo is in the clear because each actual transmission of the broadcast content is only received by an individual antenna and transmitted separately to an individual user. No public performance occurs.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/193319105-13-461.pdf">rejoin the petitioners</a> [PDF], "it would be a miscarriage of justice to arrive at such an economically devastating conclusion merely due to a linguistic technicality!" (paraphrasing). They urge the Supreme Court to look at the functionality of Aereo's service. According to ABC, the purpose of the Transmit Clause was to protect legitimate copyright holders from unauthorized retransmissions of their works. And doesn't the technical argument indeed seem a little ridiculous when one takes a step back to see that Aereo's arrays of little antennas are actually functioning similarly to a single, giant transmitter? Especially so if one considers that one single transmitter connected to multiple recipients would indeed constitute a violation of the Copyright Act? According to this view, the term "performance or display" refers to the content of the transmission. Because the content is transmitted to the public, the performance is "public" under the statute.</p>

<p><strong>A Line In the Sand</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, the dispute between the parties boils down to the appeal of either the technical or functional argument, which makes the whole question seem a bit like a Gestalt image. Both interpretations make sense and have a supportive rationale, so other factors must necessarily contribute to the court's determination in order to break the stalemate.</p>

<p>It is hard, then, to even guess how the Supreme Court will approach <span class="casename">Aereo</span>. As mentioned above, the issues in this case have not been fully developed in the lower courts. For example, the petition for <em>certiorari</em> doesn't even challenge the digital reproductions necessary for Aereo to transmit the broadcast signal to its users; a potentially literal violation of the petitioners' copyright. </p>

<p>On the one hand, Aereo seems to have the better argument regarding the letter of the law. Indeed, <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121023/02391420798/aereo-has-no-one-noticed-its-insane-that-were-being-accused-infringing-because-we-carefully-followed-cablevision-precedent.shtml">commentators</a> have pointed out the paradoxical fact that the petitioners have cited Aereo's attempts to follow the law as evidence of its intent to bypass the law. On the other hand, the petitioners' functional argument is compelling because of how potentially disruptive Aereo's model is to the broadcast industry.</p>

<p>If the Supreme Court gives precedence to the principals of statutory interpretation (as the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts did in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13801335114793867538">Hearst v. Aereo</a>) then Aereo's technical argument will likely win the day. But this leaves the annoyance of the functional argument, and the real economic fallout pressing in from the periphery. History has shown that the court is not blind to significant public policy considerations. Even if the Supreme Court finds in Aereo's favor, ABC and other broadcasters have indicated (in the petition and elsewhere) that such a finding will force cable providers to make the economically rational choice of creating their own Aereo-type service to continue offering broadcast programming without the obligation of paying the retransmission fee. As this and related revenue streams dry up, the broadcasters claim, it will no longer be economically viable to even provide broadcast television at all. If these assertions are true, a victory for Aereo might erode the very service it hopes to provide.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/73776/what-happens-to-broadcasting-if-aereo-wins?utm_source=NetNewsCheck-rss&utm_medium=originals&utm_campaign=originals-What-Happens-To-Broadcasting-If-Aereo-Wins-">reason to believe</a>, however, that these claims are merely puffed-up speculation. In either case, the Supreme Court will have to draw a line in the sand somewhere. In fact, this is likely why they have chosen to review the case in the first place. The issues in <span class="casename">Aereo</span> are, at bottom, the progeny of ambiguities or inadequacies in the Copyright Act. Because copyright is so fundamental to intellectual-property-based industries, this fact inextricably links the policy considerations in <span class="casename">Aereo</span> to the technical issues of statutory interpretation. The court may turn a blind eye to these considerations, but it is not likely to do so. In the end, these extraneous factors will undoubtedly determine the angle from which the court will view the textual arguments.</p>

Wurie</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6124673921923766275">Riley v. California</a>&#8212;dealing with the Fourth Amendment's application to new technologies. The specific issue in each case is whether police can search a cell phone, without a search warrant, after arresting someone. But while the issue may seem narrow, these cases provide the court with another opportunity to decide what the Fourth Amendment means in the 21st century.</p>

                <p><strong>Is a Cell Phone a Pack of Cigarettes?</strong></p>

                <p>The Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits "unreasonable" searches, which generally means that police must have a warrant before "searching" a person or their "houses, papers, and effects." But there are a number of exceptions to the warrant requirement, one of which permits police to search someone incidental to their arrest. These searches are "reasonable" because of the need for officers to protect themselves from hidden weapons and to secure any contraband or evidence that could be destroyed.</p>

                <p>At one time this exception was interpreted quite broadly to permit searches of the desks, safe and file cabinets in a one-room office. But in 1969, the Supreme Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7674807914957393039">Chimel v. California</a> narrowed the searchable "area" to the arrestee's physical person or "the area within the control of the arrestee." That included "containers," defined as an item capable of holding another object, found on the person or in an area within their control, like a <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5387812968771120977">pack of cigarettes</a> in an arrestee's jacket or <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9458978918547962167">clothing</a>. But a warrantless search of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7941794401088685966">personal property</a> not immediately associated with the arrestee, or a search of the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4755468061403609564">interior of a car</a> when the arrestee cannot actually gain access to items within it are not permitted. Police don't have to actually believe their safety is threatened or evidence will be destroyed before searching without a warrant since searches incident to arrest are justified by the mere fact of arrest.</p>

                <p>There is a significant judicial split when it comes to applying these rules to cell phones, and the two cases before the Supreme Court show the differing approaches.</p>

                <p>In <span class="casename">Riley</span>, police looked at pictures, videos and potentially text messages in a Samsung smartphone without a warrant. The evidence was admitted at Riley's criminal trial under the California Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4163737842445285261">People v. Diaz</a>, which ruled police could search a cell phone incident to arrest. <span class="casename">Diaz</span> found a cellphone found in an arrestee's pocket was "immediately associated" with the arrestee. The storage capacity of cell phones didn't matter because the validity of a Fourth Amendment search did not depend on the character of the item being searched. The court worried that creating a rule that determined whether police could search based on the type of phone at issue would be difficult for police in the field to apply.</p>

                <p>At least four circuit courts and a number of state appeals courts have reached the same conclusion, permitting police to search a cell phone incident to arrest. Although the Supreme Court declined to review <span class="casename">Diaz</span> in 2011, it granted Riley's petition for <em>certiorari</em> but narrowed the issue to only cover whether evidence admitted at trial was obtained through an unconstitutional search of the phone.</p>

                <p>In <span class="casename">Wurie</span>, police searched a simple flip phone, observing the picture set as the "wallpaper" and looking through the call log. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit found the search unconstitutional, noting that the storage capacity of modern cell phones is "immense," containing far more personal pieces of information than would be found in physical items, like a purse or an address book. But apart from emphasizing the nature and scope of the item being searched, the First Circuit also focused on the nature and scope of the search itself. Finding that a cell phone search was not justified by either of the justifications in <span class="casename">Chimel</span>&#8212;officer safety and evidence preservation&#8212;it found the search unconstitutional. The government did not (and could not) argue that a cell phone search was necessary to protect officers. But it did argue that a search was necessary to look for and preserve evidence that could be remotely destroyed. The First Circuit rejected that argument, finding there were alternative ways to preserve the evidence on the phone. Police could place the phone in a faraday bag, which prevents the phone from receiving a signal, or pull the battery or SIM card. Most notably, if evidence preservation were really a concern, police would be better off securing the phone immediately upon arrest rather than spending precious time searching it instead.</p>

                <p>A minority of courts has reached the same conclusion, including the Supreme Courts of <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/docs/pdf/0/2009/2009-Ohio-6426.pdf">Ohio</a> (PDF) and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13217509022871205941">Florida</a>. The government asked the entire First Circuit to rehear <span class="casename">Wurie</span> <em>en banc</em>, but the court declined, with Chief Judge Lynch <a href="http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/11-1792O-01A.pdf">writing</a> (PDF) separately that the Supreme Court needed to resolve the split, which it agreed to do.</p>

                <p><strong>An Opportunity</strong></p>

                <p>Now that the US Supreme Court will resolve this split, hopefully it will rule that the massive amounts of personal data stored on a phone makes it too far removed from "the person" and the original justifications for the exception to be allowed incident to arrest. But beyond this specific issue, these cases present the court with another opportunity to determine the impact technology plays in determining Fourth Amendment protection.</p>

                <p>More than a decade ago, the court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15840045591115721227">Kyllo v. United States</a> noted that technology has the power to "erode" Fourth Amendment privacy. Today, technological advances have given police powerful new tools&#8212;drones, stingrays, facial recognition software, rapid DNA analyzers&#8212;to investigate crime and conduct surveillance. Yet courts are slow to keep up with these technology changes. As constitutional challenges to new forms of warrantless electronic searches, seizures and surveillance have been raised before lower courts, the government has relied on faulty analogies to older cases involving dissimilar physical items or primitive technologies to defeat Fourth Amendment challenges. So a <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3033726127475530815">1979 case</a> permitting police to collect, without a warrant, the phone numbers one person dialed <a href="/forum/2014/01/marjorie-cohn-nsa-metadata.php">has been stretched</a> to justify the NSA's bulk collection of phone records from every American. Here, whether police can search a cell phone incident to arrest has boiled down to whether a cell phone is like a pack of cigarettes or not. <span class="casename">Wurie</span> and <span class="casename">Riley</span> give the court a chance to reign in government overreach and abuse, provide clarity to the public&#8212;who will be better informed about their privacy rights and can take affirmative steps to protect themselves&#8212;and give police clear, easy to follow rules about what they can and can't do in the field.</p>

                <p>But the court's recent track record suggests it may not tackle these pressing constitutional questions. In 2010, the US Supreme Court avoided answering the question of whether people have a Fourth Amendment expectation of privacy in text messages sent to a city issued pager in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12274714788827628889">City of Ontario v. Quon</a>. Rather than determining the Fourth Amendment question directly, the court assumed the Fourth Amendment protected the texts but found the search nonetheless reasonable as a valid government workplace search. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the court needed to "proceed with care" before "elaborating too fully on the Fourth Amendment implications of emerging technology before its role in society has become clear," despite the fact the court was dealing with messages sent to a pager, a clearly outdated piece of technology by 2010 (if not earlier). As a result, law enforcement must rely on a patchwork of federal and state statutes and case law to determine if and when they can access the contents of electronic communications.</p>

                <p>Similarly, in its 2012 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6122276400056758151">United States v. Jones</a>, the court had an opportunity to determine whether people have an expectation of privacy in their public movements over an extensive period of time so that police needed a search warrant to use a GPS device to track an individual's car for a month. But the court resolved the issue by focusing on trespass, holding that the Fourth Amendment was violated when police physically installed the GPS device onto a car without a search warrant in order to obtain information. This property-based approach to the Fourth Amendment, dating back to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5577544660194763070">decisions from the 1920s</a>, had been considered outdated, replaced with a focus on an individual's expectation of privacy following the Court's 1967 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9210492700696416594">Katz v. United States</a>. Indeed, the two concurring opinions in <span class="casename">Jones</span>, signed onto by a majority of the justices, lamented that technology was evolving rapidly and a physical trespass may no longer be necessary to track a person's location over an extended period of time. Again, local and federal law enforcement has had to rely on patchwork law to determine whether they can install a GPS device. The larger questions about expectation of location privacy continue to be hotly contested, as seen in the many <a href="/hotline/2013/09/hanni-fakhoury-cell-phone.php">legal challenges to cell phone tracking</a> filling up dockets around the country bear this out.</p>

                <p>Just like it did in <span class="casename">Quon</span>and <span class="casename">Wurie</span>, the court has also given itself a way out from answering the weighty questions posed in <span class="casename">Riley</span> and <span class="casename">Wurie</span>. It narrowed the grant of <em>certiorari</em> in <span class="casename">Wurie</span> to focus only on whether the evidence admitted at the trial was the product of an illegal search. In effect, the court could find that even if there was an error, it was harmless, not requiring Riley's conviction to be reversed and allowing the court to bypass answering the question definitively. <span class="casename">Wurie</span> gives the court with two ways it can issue a narrow decision since the search involved a flip phone, not a smartphone, and the officers only looked at the phone's wallpaper and call log. The court could issue a limited decision, issuing a ruling that only applies to officers searching non-smartphones or, like the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court did, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12178741829341312686">allowing</a> police to search a call log incident to arrest, and saving for another day the issue of broader searches.</p>

                <p>But if the court takes serious what it said in <span class="casename">Kyllo</span>, that it is "foolish to contend that the degree of privacy secured to citizens by the Fourth Amendment has been entirely unaffected by the advance of technology," then it should decide the issue head on and not piecemeal. Beyond clarifying the rule on cell phone searches incident to arrest, the court's guidance on how the Fourth Amendment applies to new technologies is important as technology continues to advance, and the government, whether local police or the NSA, threaten to further intrude on expectations of electronic, communication and associational privacy. Indeed, permitting police to search a cell phone incident to arrest, giving law enforcement access to a wealth of personal detail about a person, is worse than the broad, open-ended searches of rooms and buildings incident to arrest <span class="casename">Chimel</span> specifically did away with.</p>

                <p>The US Supreme Court once again has an opportunity to recalibrate the balance and explain that the Fourth Amendment is very much alive and well in the 21st century. For the sake of every American who uses a cell phone&#8212;approximately <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/06/06/cell-phone-ownership-hits-91-of-adults/">ninety-one percent</a> of the US population&#8212;let us hope the court takes it.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Angela Johnson, <a href="https://law.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame Law School</a> Class of 2014, offers insight into the short <em>per curiam</em> decision in <span class="casename">Stanton v. Sims</span> issued by the US Supreme Court on November 4, 2013 which may have created a major hurdle for plaintiffs vindicating constitutional rights via &#167;1983 litigation by expanding the availability of qualified immunity to officials acting under color of law...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Angela_Johnson.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Angela_Johnson.jpg" width="120" height="180" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-1217_bpmc.pdf">T</strong></font><strong>he Facts:</a></strong> [PDF]</p>

<p>Around one o'clock in the morning on May 27, 2008, Officer Mike Stanton and his partner responded to an "unknown disturbance" involving a person with a baseball bat in La Mesa, California. Upon arrival they found three men; two fled while the third (Nicholas Patrick) headed toward a residence. Stanton loudly called out "police," and ordered Nicholas Patrick to stop. Instead, Patrick "looked directly at Stanton, ignored his lawful orders[,] and quickly went through [the] front gate of a fence enclosing Sim's front yard." When the gate closed behind Patrick, the six-foot tall wooden fence blocked Stanton's view of the yard. Because Stanton believed Patrick committed a jailable misdemeanor (disobeying an order to stop) and because Stanton feared for his safety, he made the split-second decision to kick open the gate in pursuit of Patrick. Unbeknownst to Stanton, the owner of the residence, Drendolyn Sims, was standing behind the gate. "The swinging gate struck Sims, cutting her forehead and injuring her shoulder." Sims sued Officer Stanton in federal district court via <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983">42 USC &#167;1983</a>, alleging Stanton "unreasonably searched her home without a warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment." </p>

<p><strong>Background: </strong></p>

<p>To understand the significance of Stanton, it is helpful to have some background on &#167;1983 and qualified immunity. Section three of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (now codified as &#167;1983) does not create any substantive rights. Rather, it provides a procedural mechanism through which civil rights plaintiffs can file suit in federal court against state officials and local governments that violated constitutional or certain federal statutory rights while "acting under color of law." </p>

<p>Opponents of &#167;1983 feared a federal statute granting authority to federal courts to hear cases against state actors constituted an overreach in national government. To balance these concerns, federal courts created several limitations to &#167;1983 liability. For instance, state governments are not viable defendants under &#167;1983 due to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxi">Eleventh Amendment</a> sovereign immunity principles. However, state officials acting in their individual capacities (but still acting "under color of law") are amenable to suit for damages, as per <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1565538130560862626">Hafer v. Melo</a>  and municipalities are able to be sued per <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/436/658/">Monell v. New York City Department of Social Services</a>, but only if its policy, practice or custom violates a constitutional right.</p>

<p>Another limitation, found in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13486920831186038844">Harlow v. Fitzgerald</a>, is the availability of qualified immunity which protects government officials (including police officers) from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate "clearly established federal statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known." If the law is not clearly established, the actor could not have had notice his conduct was unconstitutional. It would thus be unfair to impose liability on actors who can only guess as to the constitutionality of their conduct. The idea is to insulate those who reasonably made the wrong prediction. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2627220117035332675">Ashcroft v. Al-kidd</a> stated sources of "clearly established" rights include the US Constitution and very factually similar precedent case law. To ensure officers have "fair and clear warning" of what the Constitution requires, according to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11289049388986146171">States v. Lanier</a>, he or she will only be held to the standard of "clearly established" law in his or her own jurisdiction.  Although, according to <span class="casename">Ashcroft v. Al-Kidd</span>, in some instances involving national officeholders faced with differing and inconsistent jurisdictions, a "robust" consensus of persuasive authority in jurisdictions may be sufficient in the absence of binding contrary authority.  </p>

<p>Because the &#167;1983 statutory text is silent with respect to immunities, the creation of qualified immunity is controversial. Courts recognized that officers make "split-second decisions" while facing imminent harm in dangerous situations without time to consult legal counsel. Without some immunity, officers may be hyper-cautious and hesitant to act quickly as needed out of fear of possible legal liability for a mistaken judgment. Accordingly, courts made available a doctrine of qualified immunity to insulate certain actors to allow for execution of duties with the decisiveness and judgment required by the public good. Qualified immunity also bars potentially frivolous suits and resolves them quickly and efficiently (immunity provides <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_12">Rule 12(b)(6)</a> dismissal from suit - not merely freedom from liability). </p>

<p>Nevertheless, critics of qualified immunity point to several downfalls. First, they assert qualified immunity runs counter to the purpose of &#167;1983 to compensate monetarily people whose rights were violated. Second, by granting immunity, actors may be reckless in ensuring their conduct is indeed lawful; as Justice Stevens <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/98-83P.ZX">articulated</a>, until a right is "clearly established" there is a "one free violation" for constitutional harms. Third, because immunity bars suits even when a constitutional violation in fact occurred, not only are courts denying compensation for constitutional injuries, it is a symbolic denial&#8212;as if those rights do not matter. </p>

<p>Ultimately, as articulated in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-751.pdf">Pearson v. Callahan</a> [PDF], it is important that "[q]ualified immunity balances two important interests&#8212;the need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties reasonably." Yet as case law develops, qualified immunity is available with increasing frequency. <span class="casename">Stanton v. Sims</span> contributes further to this expansion.</p>

<p><strong>The Case:</strong></p>

<p>Before <span class="casename">Stanton</span>, the established inquiry of qualified immunity, found in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12881500287411882090">Anderson v. Creighton</a>,  was not just whether the law was "clearly established" but also the "objective legal reasonableness" of the action. A defendant will be immune from liability only if no objectively reasonable officer could have believed his conduct was lawful or constitutional at the time the violation occurred. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12074975541007910866">Malley v. Briggs</a>, only in dicta, noted that the policy behind the "objective legal reasonableness" standard gives officers "breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions," such that "[w]hen properly applied, it protects "all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law." </p>

<p><span class="casename">Stanton</span> ignores the well-established "objectively reasonable" standard and seizes on the dicta statement of <span class="casename">Malley</span>, holding, (quoting <span class="casename">Malley</span>): "Stanton may have been mistaken in believing his actions were justified, but he was not 'plainly incompetent.'" This holding sets a new standard: an officer will lose his immunity only if he was "plainly incompetent" in believing his conduct did not violate clearly established law. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court's reliance on <span class="casename">Malley</span> is disingenuous; it splices the <span class="casename">Malley</span> policy statement and narrows-in on the "plainly incompetent" dicta (those words appear only once in <span class="casename">Malley</span>), transforming it as an authoritative rule in <span class="casename">Stanton</span>. The <span class="casename">Malley</span> holding does not reference "incompetence" but rather holds "objective reasonableness" "defines the qualified immunity accorded to an officer whose request for a warrant allegedly caused an unconstitutional arrest."  Even <span class="casename">Ashcroft</span> (which the <span class="casename">Stanton</span> court relies heavily for support) follows the "objectively reasonable officer" standard.  </p>

<p>Did <span class="casename">Stanton</span> lower the floor on qualified immunity standards? Because one could act unreasonably, but still be competent, plaintiffs will have greater difficulty in overcoming the qualified immunity bar to liability. As <a href="http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/constitutional_thoughts/">noted</a> by Law Professor Howard Wasserman (author of the leading treatise on &#167;1983 litigation, <em>Understanding Civil Rights</em>) in "The Rhetoric of Qualified Immunity", a "'plainly incompetent' standard seems to be suggesting that a court that denies qualified immunity is, <em>per se</em>, labeling that officer as 'plainly incompetent.' If lower courts and defendants seize on that, qualified immunity will become even harder to overcome (and dismissal easier to obtain), because ... no court wants to sign onto calling police officers names or questioning their integrity and ability." </p>

<p>But <span class="casename">Stanton</span> might also harm defendants and undermine the policy goal of quick disposition of unmeritorious claims. While the pre-<span class="casename">Stanton</span> standard was "objectively reasonable," the "incompetent" standard under <span class="casename">Stanton</span> is subjective, which involves factual questions. This precludes quick disposition via summary judgment or 12(b)(6) motion, since litigants will be unable to prove until much later in the factual development of the case whether the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity. This brings added expense, less predictability, and greater disruption to officials and government - the same concerns the Harlow "objectively reasonable" standard was created to extinguish; per <span class="casename">Malley</span>: it was "specifically designed to avoid excessive disruption of government and permit the resolution of many insubstantial claims on summary judgment." </p>

<p><span class="casename">Stanton</span> also creates confusion by its treatment of precedent in the "clearly established" inquiry. The Supreme Court held the law was not "clearly established" because binding precedent held that a warrantless entry to arrest a misdemeanant should be rare - not that it is never justified. In granting even greater leniency for determining what is "clearly established law," the Supreme Court also stated "it cannot be said the law was clearly established because the "federal and state courts of last resort around the Nation were sharply divided."  Recall, the laws of the officer's jurisdiction are what count in determining whether the law was "clearly established;" the "sharply divided" standard as articulated in <span class="casename">Ashcroft</span> is applicable only for national officeholders, who would otherwise be forced to comply with varying and conflicting jurisdictions to maintain its eligibility for immunity. This expansion in <span class="casename">Stanton</span> might impose a second hurdle for civil rights plaintiffs - defendants will be entitled to qualified immunity so long as federal (and state) jurisdictions are "sharply divided" on the applicable law. Thus, an officer could know his conduct violates clearly established law in his jurisdiction, but point to a split in circuits as a defense. </p>

<p>Once it found the officer was immune from liability, the <span class="casename">Stanton</span> court did not need to decide whether Sim's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> rights were violated. While this furthers efficiency, it stunts the development of what is a "clearly established" law and leaves actors without guidance. The law post-<span class="casename">Stanton</span> remains unclear as to whether an officer may pursue an unarmed fleeing misdemeanant under the "hot pursuit" exception. It is too soon to determine the consequence of <span class="casename">Stanton</span> on future &#167;1983 claims and how lower courts will interpret its potentially expanded qualified immunity to officers who are not "plainly incompetent." Unfortunately, this case is just the latest that fails to "clearly establish" the law of &#167;1983. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/about-us/staff-board/dixon%2C-j.-wells">J. Wells Dixon</a>, Senior Staff Attorney for the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>, says that the continued detentions at Guant&#225;namo are arbitrary and unduly perpetual...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n his recent State of the Union address, President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/28/president-barack-obamas-state-union-address">declared</a> that the US would complete its military mission in Afghanistan by the end of this year and "America's longest war will finally be over." This echoes his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/remarks-president-national-defense-university">remarks</a> of nearly a year earlier when he cautioned that "[u]nless we discipline our thinking, our definitions, our actions, we may be drawn into more wars we do not need to fight ... [T]his war, like all wars, must end."</p>

                <p>Obama also said that as the conflict comes to a close, indefinite detention under the laws of war must be brought to an end at Guantanamo Bay, which "has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law."  </p>

                <p>Despite his repeated promise to close Guantanamo, the president has not made meaningful progress toward shuttering the prison in the last three years. Among the 155 men who are still detained, half have been approved for transfer unanimously by all relevant military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies but are not being repatriated or resettled anywhere. In the last year, only eleven men were transferred, including two who were forcibly returned to Algeria despite persecution fears and three who had successfully challenged the legality of their detention years earlier. Military commissions also continue despite the lack of any measurable progress, and Periodic Review Boards are slowly getting underway for those men not approved for transfer or charged with war crimes, albeit so far without tangible results.</p>

                <p>It should therefore come as no surprise that the remaining detainees are not sanguine that the withdrawal of US combat troops from Afghanistan will mark an end to their detention.  </p>

                <p>Last month, Kuwaiti detainee Fawzi al Odah <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/guantanamo-detainee-demands-release-following-afghanistan-pull-out.php">filed</a> a legal brief in the US District Court for the District of Columbia requesting a declaration that he will be released at the end of combat operations in Afghanistan, which, again, Obama has said will happen by the end of this year. He seeks a ruling that his detention may not continue after that time on the basis of a continuing world-wide "war on terror" against al Qaeda and associated forces. Al Odah, who does not currently appear to be cleared for transfer, notably does not ask the court to declare the war over or to dictate the precise policies or procedures to effectuate his release. Instead, he simply wants to ensure that he will not continue to be held beyond the end of active hostilities, which would exceed what is authorized by the laws of war. </p>

                <p>Alternatively, citing <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=hamdi&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=6173897153146757813&scilh=0">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a>, he seeks an order of release on the ground that the practical circumstances of the current conflict have become so unlike those of the conflicts that have informed the development of the laws of war that the traditional law-of-war detention standard&#8212;i.e., until the end of hostilities in order to prevent return to the battlefield&#8212;has unraveled. He specifically contends that his detention has continued for so long and under such conditions that it is no longer preventive but rather punitive and disproportionate, thus violating due process.</p>

                <p>The government opposes al Odah's argument on the ground that it is not ripe for decision because hostilities continue in Afghanistan and al Odah can only speculate that they will end this year as the president has promised (or that he will continue to be detained after they do end). The government may succeed on that point in the short term before a district court that has plainly been cowed by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (which has never ruled in favor of a detainee on the merits of any <em>habeas corpus</em> case). However, as we near the end of the year and the withdrawal of US combat troops from Afghanistan, the argument will continue to gather strength. The courts may well be required to intervene if, as the government hints in its motion to dismiss al Odah's petition, it ultimately takes the position that the withdrawal of combat troops from Afghanistan is not coterminous with the end of hostilities and that a world-wide war with al Qaeda and its affiliates continues and justifies al Odah's ongoing detention even after the US has left Afghanistan.  </p>

                <p>The unraveling of traditional law-of-war detention authority in these circumstances is evident in several respects.  First, the ongoing fight with al Qaeda is now the longest military conflict in US history, bar none. Second, as Obama noted in his May 2013 speech at the National Defense University, Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda's core leadership are dead, imprisoned or detained. Finally, as other commentators have <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2013/03/04/130304taco_talk_coll">explained</a> at length, any fighting that may continue globally after the US leaves Afghanistan will involve al Qaeda-inspired "franchise" groups that likely did not exist at the time that al Odah and other detainees were brought to Guantanamo more than twelve years ago. Again, however, as the president has acknowledged, the problem is one of definition: "[A]s long as there are bands of violent Islamic radicals anywhere in the world who find it attractive to call themselves al Qaeda, a formal state of war may exist between al Qaeda and America. The Hundred Years War could seem a brief skirmish in comparison."  </p>

                <p>If the war with al Qaeda is to last for the foreseeable future, it cannot be that the ongoing, indefinite detention of a Guantanamo detainee such as al Odah&#8212;potentially for life&#8212;has any precedent under the traditional laws of war. However, that will be for the courts to decide, as they surely will if these men are not released by the end of 2014. Obama would be wise to heed his own caution about the perils of perpetual war and release al Odah without delay.</p>

                <p>Although a court may be unlikely to declare an end to hostilities, which the government claims the US Supreme Court has <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Ludecke+v.+Watkins&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=11618476027227715138&scilh=0">held</a> is an unreviewable political decision, it may conclude that al Odah is no longer detainable even though hostilities continue because the nature of the conflict is unending and unprecedented under the traditional law of war. Indeed, there is a strong <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/REDACTED_AmezianeMotionforOrderofRelease%2808-12-2013%29.pdf">argument</a> (PDF) that detainees who are approved for transfer from Guantanamo are currently no longer detainable under the laws of war even as the conflict continues on the theory that their clearance for release manifests a discretionary determination by the government that they do not present a risk of return to the battlefield, and thus that their indefinite detention no longer serves any ostensible purpose and is arbitrary and perpetual. As the court in <span class="casename">Hamdi</span> proclaimed, "a state of war is not a blank check for the president."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Shanshan Liu, <a href="http://www.wcl.american.edu/">American University Washington College of Law</a> Class of 2015 explores the legal analysis surrounding current antitrust litigation in regards to online search engines and monopolization...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>T</strong></font>he field of antitrust litigation has focused on the settlement between the world's largest search engine, Google Inc. (Google) and the European Union Commission (EU Commission). The EU's investigation of Google commenced in 2010 and was initiated by complaints filed by price comparison websites, <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business/21595966-third-attempt-settlement-likely-be-last-search-over">alleging</a> that Google has abused its dominant power over Internet searching. The settlement <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/technology/google-reaches-tentative-antitrust-settlement-with-european-union.html">resulted</a> in Google modifying its display results, allowing competitors like Yahoo and Bing to display their results on Google's site, providing opt-out options for content providers and removing difficult conditions for advertisers to move campaigns to rival sites.</p>

<p>The settlement means that Google would escape a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/29/us-eu-google-antitrust-idUSBREA0S0TE20140129">possible fine</a>, as much as five billion dollars. This seems to be another victory for Google after its settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) earlier in 2013, though critics are concerned that Google's concession would <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/01/google-agrees-change-its-business-practices-resolve-ftc">strengthen</a> monopolization. Despite the brief statements provided by the FTC and the EU Commission, neither authority has provided a detailed economic framework analysis explaining the decision. Google's case presents facts that shift away from the traditional antitrust analysis, and by choosing not to carry out further analysis, both decisions reflect a gap in both the US and EU antitrust regulators' analysis and interpretation with respect to cyberspace marketplace. <br />
	<br />
<strong>The FTC's Investigation of Google: Difficulties in Defining Market Power and Willful Acquisition</strong> </p>

<p>The US antitrust laws treat monopolization as a great harm to competition. Section 2 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2">Sherman Act</a> imposes severe penalties on any person "who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize...any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations." Both federal and state authorities can enforce the Sherman Act, and successful plaintiffs will be entitled to treble damages. Extending beyond the scope of the Sherman Act, Section 5 of the<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-2/subchapter-I"> Federal Trade Commission Act</a> (FTC act) prohibits "unfair methods of competition", the statute empowers the FTC a broad discretion to "define and proscribe an unfair competition, even though the practice does not infringe either the letter or the spirit of the antitrust laws."  </p>

<p>The FTC chose to investigate Google under the broader FTC act. However, Google and rival companies' business operation model differ greatly from traditional industries. Difficulties in analyzing and applying the unique facts to monopolization requirements were big hurdles to the FTC's enforcement pathway.  </p>

<p>Regardless of whether a charge is brought under the Sherman Act or the FTC act, to find monopolization two elements must be present. The first element is the possession of monopoly power, and the second element is the willful acquisition of the power, known as the bad act. The mere possession of monopoly power is <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8700837978103397300">not a violation.</a> The monopoly power in a relevant market consists of both a product market and a geographic market. If a company has a large percentage of product market share, inferences can be drawn that the firm has certain amount of monopoly power. For analytical purposes, the US will be the geographic market for web search engines.</p>

<p>For a firm that engages in traditional manufacturing, inferring monopoly power from a large market share is relatively easy. Defining a proper product market for Internet service providers like Google is complex. Although Google controls over two thirds of the market share, due to the integration of multiple products, defining its operation as the "online search" or "search advertising" purely on market share is <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-112shrg71471/pdf/CHRG-112shrg71471.pdf">too narrow</a> [PDF] for antitrust analysis purpose.</p>

<p>Another method of measuring market power is to consider the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2334890018415598660">cross elasticity of demand</a>, in which the rate of customers turn to one product in response to a price increase in the other product is measured mathematically. When it is difficult to measure market share, measuring entry barriers as an indication of market power occasionally serves as an alternative method. If there has been frequent entry in the past and the company's productive assets can be easily converted to other uses, then the market <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12607804483000438759">cannot be monopolized</a> regardless of market share.</p>

<p>However, all the methods described above are difficult to apply in Google's case, primarily because search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing are free of cost to customers, therefore no price is involved. It is also very difficult to measure entry barriers. One might argue that Google has used data to increase the quality of search to customers, presenting a barrier that other competitors cannot match. However, it cannot be ignored that other newly entrant search engines, like Bing and Yahoo, have also been successful in obtaining data to develop <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2013/01/03/ftcs-google-antitrust-investigation-was-silly-critics-and-competitors-move-on/">competitive offerings</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a more accurate definition of monopoly power in Google's case can be derived from customers' <a href="http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/antitrust/articles/Patterson.pdf">inability to evaluate the quality</a> [PDF] of search product they are receiving. If Google does not provide enough transparency in its search process, it likely that users will be unable to evaluate the search engine. Some scholars have suggested that if Google is able to manipulate search results shown to customers, such distortion can be anticompetitive, and can be used as direct evidence to prove market power. The FTC, however, ignored this issue in its investigation <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/google-agrees-change-its-business-practices-resolve-ftc-competition-concerns-markets-devices-smart/130103googlesearchstmtofcomm.pdf">statement</a> [PDF].</p>

<p>In addition to the possession of monopoly power, monopolization also requires the company's bad act. In Google's case, the conduct would be analyzed as non-predatory pricing, which consists of a three-factor economic framework: exclusion of rivals; harm to competition; and the harm outweighs the potential benefit. The requisite bad act must have <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17987618389090921096">"anticompetitive effect"</a> that harms the competitive process, not merely one or more competitors. Courts allow the plaintiff to make <em>prima facie</em> case demonstrating anticompetitive effect, then the defendant makes precompetitive justifications, which are non-pretextual claims that its conduct is indeed a form of competition on the merits. The plaintiff may rebut the defendant's precompetitive justification or demonstrate that the anticompetitive harm outweighs the precompetitive benefit.</p>

<p>If Google's case had proceeded further, the <a href="http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/antitrust/articles/ManneRinehart.pdf">ultimate question</a> [PDF] would become, by placing the rivals search results on the second or the third page of its search results, is Google conducting a search bias, as to constitute an exclusionary, anticompetitive conduct? In addition, although "willful acquisition" requires intent&#8211;but intent is a very ambiguous term and has been formulated <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15519300671749179648">differently</a> by <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2019566369655969532">courts</a>&#8211;therefore it should not be placed with a greater weight in the analysis. Nonetheless, the FTC chose to put more weight on analyzing intent. Despite contentions that the nature of Google's conduct is exclusionary and anticompetitive, the FTC decided to skip the analysis on the exclusionary act, and closed the <a href="http://www.arizonalawreview.org/pdf/47-3/47arizlrev609.pdf">investigation</a> [PDF] based on the procompetitive justifications and Google's intent.</p>

<p><strong>The EU Commission's Investigation of Google: Uncertainties in Competition Protection and Customer Benefits</strong></p>

<p>The legal framework of monopolization under EU is <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52009XC0224(01):EN:NOT">Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a> (Art.102). It characterizes monopolization as the abuse of dominant position. Similarly to the US monopolization requirements, Art.102 does not prohibit companies from mere domination; the use of the market power in an abusive way is also required. The EU Commission would need to establish the following elements for making a successful case. </p>

<p>The first element is to define the dominant position, which is a position of economic strength that is enjoyed by a company, enabling it to behave free from the pressure of competition and independently of its competitors. Possession of high market shares is <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&numdoc=61976J0085&lg=en">sufficient</a> to establish the existence of a dominant position unless exceptional circumstances like rapid entry or a volatile market apply. A market share of 50 percent or more will be considered high and result in a <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61986J0062:EN:HTML">presumption of dominance</a>, and the burden is then shifted to the defendant to prove they are not dominant.</p>

<p>What makes the EU enforcement slightly different from the US approach is the broad embrace of entry barriers as a substitute of market share. The non-exhaustive entry barrier list gives the EU Commission more flexibility to condemn a company of possessing dominant market power. In other words, the EU's enforcement is more stringent than the US. For instance, EU courts will consider a broad range of entry factors, such as <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&numdoc=61978J0022&lg=en">national regulations</a>, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61976J0027:EN:HTML">access to capital fund</a>, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&lg=en&numdoc=61981J0322">essential facility</a> and <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61976J0027:EN:HTML">superior technology.</a> In contrast, the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12968554720625735055">US Supreme Court</a> neither repudiates nor embraces the essential facility doctrine.</p>

<p>Art.102 also allows efficiency justifications to preclude the Commission from finding abuse of dominant position. The defendant must demonstrate efficiencies based on <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/art82/discpaper2005.pdf">four conditions</a> [PDF]: first, efficiency is realized as a result of the product concerned; second, the company's conduct is indispensible to realize these efficiencies; third, efficiencies must benefit consumers; and fourth, there will be no elimination of competition in relation to the market.<br />
      <br />
Unlike the problems encountered by the FTC in defining Google's monopoly power, Google has been holding market shares well above 90 percent in most European countries. The EU Commission's <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-383_en.htm">primary concerns</a> about Google's practices are its specialized search, which makes the competitor's results less visible to customers, its content usage without consent and exclusive agreements and restrictions to the advertisers. In particular, the EU Commission pointed out that Google "limits the ability of European users to find other search services competing with Google which contain information relevant to their query. Many such services might be potentially very innovative and Google's practices could therefore be limiting European consumers' opportunities to benefit from such innovative services."</p>

<p>However, reading from the settlement agreement, it does not reflect the Commission's strong intent to protect consumers. The actual effect on Google's dominant position and the potential benefits to consumers brought by the changes are hard to predict. For example, Google agreed to display competitors' search results, but place them in a shaded box on the search results page. Whether customers would perceive the results in shaded box as advertisements or proper alternative results from competitors remains <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-05/google-clinches-eu-antitrust-pact-with-pledge-over-rivals-links.html">unknown.</a> The Commission's denial of the market test, which allows competitors and customers to comment on the commitments, imposes uncertainties on monitoring Google's future practice.</p>

<p>To conclude, both authorities chose to terminate the investigation, leaving many substantive legal issues unresolved. This may shadow the future complaints challenging the company's position. However, it also opens opportunities for the legislative branch to detail the interpretation of requirements in monopolization, especially relating to legal issues arising from cyberspace.</p>

The question was in reference to a label on Organon Pharmaceutical's product, NuvaRing, listing negative side effects. The primary side effect listed was the increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), a <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/innovation_quality_patient_care/areas_expertise/infections_complications/dvt/what_is_dvt_vte.html">condition</a> marked by the formation of potentially deadly blood clots.

While the aforementioned injuries and deaths are tragic and may even result in Merck's liability, this article will instead examine the board's liability and the fiduciary duties it owes to its shareholders. </p>

<p>I. The Product Overview</p>

<p>In 2001, Organon brought to market and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a unique birth control product, NuvaRing. The vaginal ring is appealing to many women because it is a simple device used weekly as compared to a birth control pill taken daily. <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/ortho-evra-birth-control-patch-higher-blood-clot-risks-remain-market-fda-article-1.990882">That same year</a>, the FDA approved Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical's Ortho Evra, the first birth control patch. Following its release, regulators found the patch exposed women to increased levels of estrogen. As a result, the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/2005/ucm108517.htm">FDA approved</a> a product label in 2005 warning users that high levels of estrogen could lead to VTE. This label coincided with a drop in sales and prescriptions for Ortho Evra, while sales of NuvaRing, which had no such warning label, remained robust. </p>

<p>In 2007, Schering-Plough Corporation bought Organon, and shortly thereafter hundreds of <a href="http://www.classaction.org/nuvaring">lawsuits</a> were brought against both companies for intentionally concealing the negative side effects of NuvaRing. In 2009, Merck merged with Schering-Plough and assumed all of its assets and liabilities. <a href="http://business.rutgers.edu/news/faculty-insight-professor-michael-santoro-raises-questions-about-mercks-continued-marketing-nuv">One commentator</a> argued the merger was devised to position Merck to corner the birth control market and recoup financial losses from the expiration of several other of its lucrative patents. </p>

<p>NuvaRing has two active <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2001/21-187_NuvaRing_medr_P1.pdf">components</a> [PDF] &#8212; progestin etonogestrel and estrogen ethinyl estradiol. A 2012 FDA <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/drugsafety/ucm277384.pdf">report</a> [PDF] indicates that continuous exposure to this combination of hormones &#8212; in NuvaRing's case by osmosis through mucous membranes into the bloodstream &#8212; can yield increased levels of estrogen and up to a 56 percent greater risk of VTE compared to other combined hormonal contraceptives, especially for younger women. Another type of VTE: deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is the <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/innovation_quality_patient_care/areas_expertise/infections_complications/dvt/what_is_dvt_vte.html">formation</a> of a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg or pelvic veins, that can dislodge &#8212; or embolize &#8212; and travel to the lungs, at which point it becomes a pulmonary embolism (PE) potentially causing asphyxiation and death. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, "[in] the United States and the United Kingdom, VTEs kill more people than AIDS, breast cancer, prostate cancer and traffic accidents combined."</p>

<p>Unlike the FDA's response to <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d6423">studies</a> involving the side effects of Yaz and Yasmine, two Bayer AG birth control pills, the FDA did not require that NuvaRing's label reflect Dr. &#216;jvind Lidegaard's <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e2990">findings</a>: the combination of NuvaRing's hormones can cause a spike in estrogen levels and a higher likelihood of VTE. Merck responded to the FDA study with <a href="http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/ACOG/32592">its own clinical trials.</a> Merck found no increased incidences of VTE among women using NuvaRing compared to those using other combined hormonal contraceptives. <br />
	<br />
II. Questionable Behavior</p>

<p>In one of Organon's NuvaRing clinical trials, a young healthy woman developed a VTE. When filing for FDA approval, Organon inserted this outcome into the body of the voluminous application with other clinical results instead of placing it in the thirty-page executive summary or citing the incident in a footnote. The FDA requested that Organon include a statement in NuvaRing's packaging insert mentioning the contraceptive might cause greater risk of VTE as compared to other contraceptives.</p>

<p>Organon's director opposed the statement because it could have discouraged women from using the contraceptive and led to a decline in sales, as was the case with the Ortho Evra contraceptive patch. Since clinical trials are intended primarily to test efficacy, the FDA acquiesced to Organon but mandated language stating <a href="http://www.nuvaring.com/Consumer/risks-and-side-effects/">"unknown"</a> risks of blood clots.</p>

<p>III. Corporate Implications</p>

<p>A corporation's board of directors owes fiduciary duties to its shareholders. Shareholders can sue their board in a derivative suit for breach of those duties. For our purposes, those duties are care and good faith. A duty of care claim can be analyzed under a malfeasance standard or a nonfeasance standard, depending on which standard is brought by shareholders in the suit. The malfeasance standard requires the board to have made an affirmative business decision that was <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15445043763196054007">reckless or grossly negligent.</a> The board's decision is otherwise protected by the business judgment rule, a presumption that the board acted reasonably. Under this rule, courts accord deference to the board for the vast majority of its business decisions. Liability is difficult to prove under this standard, unless for example a memorandum or email indicates the board recognized a substantial and unjustifiable risk yet decided to act regardless. If shareholders can somehow show the board's decision was reckless or grossly negligent, they must then show the decision caused harm to the corporation. These steps tend to insulate the board from shareholder liability.</p>

<p>At face value, the email from Organon's director, in which he opposed any mention of VTE, could arguably amount to a reckless decision. Organon's board knew that NuvaRing's continuous delivery of progestin etonogestrel and estrogen ethinyl estradiol could cause VTE and possible death, facts which the board had attempted to bury. However, at that time there had only been one documented incident of VTE &#8212; and zero deaths &#8212; among young users in the clinical trials. The Organon board justifiably recognized the result as a slight risk. Merck's board would have known through due diligence of this trial case of VTE as well as the two aforementioned studies that linked NuvaRing to greater risks of VTE. Merck responded with its own study, in which it found no link between NuvaRing and higher risk of VTE.  Although perhaps less ideal than an independent study, Merck's decision to perform its own study and publish its findings suggests the board did not make reckless decisions. </p>

<p>A duty of care claim under the nonfeasance standard alleges a board <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14782220911008163269">failed to act</a>. Specifically, shareholders in the suit would have to show the qualified directors failed to establish a compliance system to prevent malfeasance, failed to monitor the corporation and remain informed and failed to attend board meetings. A court analyzing a duty of care claim under the nonfeasance standard defers to the board so long as the directors made a good faith effort to use a compliance system, regardless of any malfeasance that may have been perpetrated by lower level employees. In fact, Merck implemented a compliance system with <a href="http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/IROL/73/73184/CorpGov/pr2013.pdf">oversight officers</a> [PDF] as a result of its 2000 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/business/14merck.html?_r=1&">VIOXX>scandal.</a> It is likely this claim against Merck would fail because the qualified board members implemented such a committee. </p>

<p>A <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11948517900530056942">duty of good faith</a> claim requires the shareholders show that the directors intentionally disregarded their duties, violated the law, or had mal-intent to harm the corporation. Without stronger evidence of alleged fraudulent activity, Organon's director's email and the burying of the negative clinical trial outcome alone will likely not demonstrate intent required to meet the good faith claim because Merck's directors adhered to their fiduciary duties and actively addressed the problem by conducting clinical studies. </p>

<p>IV. Moving Forward</p>

<p>Though the board may not suffer corporate legal consequences, Merck will likely require a re-branding strategy. In addition to what plaintiffs demand &#8212; clear and informed disclosures on the product label and the website &#8212; I would suggest Merck study British Petroleum's <a href="http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/sustainability/safety/preventing-and-responding-to-accidents-and-oil-spills/oil-spill-preparedness-and-response.html">marketing response</a> to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Merck's campaign should remind the public that the company invests in the well-being of its patients through an expansive health product line. Merck's public relations campaign would ideally re-brand its corporate image as a steward of holistic health and wellness, ideals the corporation should also strive to live up to. Not every product liability can be traced back to the boardroom, but the board should seriously consider how it will respond if Merck is to regain public trust.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.barry.edu/law/future-students/faculty/staff/judithkoons.html">Judith E. Koons</a> of Barry University School of Law situates in constitutional history the recent case by Florida same-sex couples, arguing that it is part of a compelling period in our nation's history that is likely to lead to marriages of same-sex couples to be recognized in every state ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/judithkoons.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n <a href="http://www.nclrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Florida-Pareto-v.-Ruvin-Complaint.pdf">Pareto v. Ruvin</a> [PDF], six same-sex couples and Equality Florida Institute are challenging Florida's <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3&Tab=statutes&CFID=327450287&CFTOKEN=16847682">constitutional</a> and <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0741/Sections/0741.212.html">statutory </a> provisions that prohibit marriage for same-sex couples. The case is part of an extraordinary moment in our nation's constitutional history, in which same-sex couples across the US are seeking the freedom to marry. </p>

<p>This watershed moment was unleashed on the last day of the Supreme Court's session in 2013 when the court issued its opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">United States v. Windsor</a>, striking down the one-man, one woman definition of marriage in the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a>. In <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, Justice Kennedy found that DOMA violated the liberty interest of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> because "the avowed purpose and practical effect of the law here in question are to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma" upon lawful same-sex marriages. </p>

<p>The Florida case embraces Kennedy's reasoning to contest the constitutionality of the state's marriage laws. According to the complaint, each of the couples wishes to publicly declare their love and commitment to their chosen partners and to share in the protections, benefits and security of marriage. Yet, Florida's constitutional and statutory scheme categorically excludes them from marriage, which undermines their life goals, disadvantages them financially and (quoting <span class="casename">Windsor</span>) denies them "dignity and status of immense import." Noting that four of the couples are raising children, the Florida Plaintiffs assert that they are stigmatized in ways that (again quoting <span class="casename">Windsor</span>) not only "humiliates" the children but also "makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community." </p>

<p>Florida's case reflects the significance of the right to marry, both in terms of its constitutional underpinnings as well as its singular importance to individual couples and their children. In constitutional history, <span class="casename">Windsor</span> opens the door for same-sex couples to be lawfully married in every state and points the way for other courts to consider the interplay between the content of constitutional rights and their far-ranging effects on couples' lives. </p>

<p>This time and place for the freedom to marry of gay and lesbian couples is the latest chapter in the history of our Constitution, which the Supreme Court has <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1428365285620704265">described</a> as "the story of the extension of constitutional rights and protections to people once ignored or excluded." As <span class="casename">Windsor</span> points out, most citizens did not even consider the possibility of marriage between persons of the same sex until recently. In 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/library/documents/HIBaehr.pdf">ruled </a> [PDF] that the state's gay-marriage ban was discriminatory. Two phenomena came on the heels of that decision. The first was one of panic, in which elected officials reacted to fears that the traditional and religious basis of marriage was being threatened. In an atmosphere of homophobic hysteria, twenty-seven states passed anti-gay-marriage legislation and Congress enacted DOMA. When the Massachusetts Supreme Court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16499869016395834644">ruled</a> in 2003 that the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage violated the <a href="https://malegislature.gov/laws/constitution">state's constitution</a> [PDF], another wave of homophobia seized the nation, resulting in thirty-one states passing constitutional amendments defining lawful marriage as between one man and one woman. </p>

<p>The Hawaii and Massachusetts decisions triggered a second phenomenon, characterized by an evolution of thought or, according to Kennedy, "the beginnings of a new perspective, a new insight" on marriage equality. In the US this insight has steadily grown to a recognition that limiting lawful marriage to heterosexual couples is "an unjust exclusion." </p>

<p>Consequently, a host of state courts and legislatures has joined in rectifying the injustice of the marriage bans. As of the date of this commentary, <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">seventeen states</a> and DC have legalized marriage for same-sex couples through court decisions, legislation or popular votes. In addition, gay and lesbian couples across the US have <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/litigation">filed over forty-five cases</a> in state and federal courts, claiming that the marriage laws of their states are violating state and federal constitutional rights. </p>

<p>That <span class="casename">Windsor</span> has opened the door to striking down state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage is demonstrated by six recent federal court decisions. Following <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, all of the federal courts that have been presented with the issue have upheld the marriage rights of same-sex couples. As of this commentary, federal district courts have stuck down restrictive marriage laws in <a href="http://freemarry.3cdn.net/bad5c95a34f7651277_fym6ivbec.pdf">Utah</a> [PDF], <a href="http://freemarry.3cdn.net/d4e555ea37a5c34dda_2gm6bny48.pdf">Ohio</a> [PDF], <a href="http://freemarry.3cdn.net/b8ca418e704c549eb5_bkm6b54o1.pdf">Oklahoma</a> [PDF], <a href="http://freemarry.3cdn.net/a451e58ab634d16ae9_gxm6i6uxk.pdf">Kentucky</a> [PDF], <a href="http://freemarry.3cdn.net/e8025153a31b09d519_jpm62bgle.pdf">Virginia</a>[PDF] and <a href="http://freemarry.3cdn.net/a0a0c5831fbc07811b_k9m6ibsqu.pdf">Texas</a>[PDF]. These cases were brought by same-sex couples to claim the right to marry in their state or to require their state to recognize validly performed same-sex marriages in other jurisdictions. In all of these cases, the courts found that there was no rational basis for the marriage bans&#8212literally no connection to a legitimate governmental purpose. Furthermore, a number of the courts suggested heightened scrutiny to be appropriate due to the fundamental right at stake, animus toward gay and lesbian citizens, or sexual orientation as a suspect class. Following this trend, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8348147310064959409">held</a> that <span class="casename">Windsor</span> compels the application of heightened scrutiny in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">equal protection</a> claims based on sexual orientation. </p>

<p>In the wake of <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, the federal courts are engaging, at a deeper level, the meaning of liberty and the operation of equality. For example, the federal court in Utah reasoned that the fundamental right to marry protects the choice of a same-sex partner because this choice goes to "the heart of the right to liberty." Focusing on the "inner attributes of marriage," the court understood the right to marry as intertwined with rights of privacy and intimate association that are integral to a person's dignity and autonomy. </p>

<p>The federal court in Oklahoma also observed that equal protection lies at the heart of our system of laws and is "central to our consent to be governed." In upholding the marriage rights of same-sex couples, the federal court in Kentucky advised that the opinion was making real the promise of equal protection and profoundly affecting the experience of same-sex couples in the state simply by elevating their marriages "to an equal status in the eyes of the law." In Virginia, the federal court proposed that our nation is continually being brought to a "deeper understanding of the first three words in our Constitution: we the people." According to the court, the "people" covered by the protections of the Constitution are "a broader, more diverse family than once imagined."<br />
	<br />
Denying same-sex couples the right to marry or recognizing their valid marriages is of enormous personal significance to gay and lesbian families. In <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, Kennedy advised that "DOMA writes inequality into the entire US Code." Similarly, in the Florida case, the state's marriage laws "write inequality" into the entire legal system of the state. </p>

<p>Among the substantive rights denied the Florida couples are the right to sue for wrongful death of their partner, the right to own property with a spouse as an estate by the entireties and the right to protect a homestead from a spouse's creditors as well as from alienation and devise of the homestead. In addition, the Florida couples are denied the right to make medical decisions for an ill or incapacitated spouse without an advance health care directive, the right to inherit a share of the estate of a spouse who dies without a will and the right to receive an elective share of the estate of a spouse who dies with a will. Hundreds of additional rights are at stake, from the right of spouses of military personnel to participate in the state's program for military spouses to the right to receive certain workers' compensation benefits for a deceased spouse who dies as a result of a work-related accident as well as the right to spousal insurance coverage and benefits, where spousal benefits are otherwise available.</p>

<p>The dignitary interests of gay and lesbian couples are just as significant. Imagine, for example, not being able to make medical decisions for your child or participate in your child's educational activities. Imagine getting engaged and not being able to announce this joyous occasion to co-workers, for fear of losing your job. Imagine planning to celebrate your love and commitment at a local restaurant, only to be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/us/religious-right-in-arizona-cheers-bill-allowing-businesses-to-refuse-to-serve-gays.html">turned away by the management</a>. Imagine getting lawfully married in another state and, upon returning home, to have your home state effectively terminate your marriage. </p>

<p>Imagine your spouse's having complications during childbirth and the hospital's forbidding you to see her, leaving you in the waiting room, not knowing whether she or the child are alive. Or imagine having your loved one die, only to be evicted from your home by the state-sanctioned official heirs of your partner or, as in the case of the Ohio plaintiffs, not being able to be listed on the death certificate as the surviving spouse. </p>

<p>Each of these egregious, hurtful and demeaning events has happened to gay and lesbian couples. Oppression against gays and lesbians has not only been condoned by the state in many cases without civil recourse but, in the case of marriage inequality, it has also been required by the state. Marriage laws of a state, written across the expanse of the legal system, carry a deep and disqualifying punch of state disapproval, telling the world that gay and lesbian couples are in second-tier relationships that are not worthy of the shelter, benefits or dignity given by the state to opposite-sex couples. </p>

<p>Reviewing the historical background and legislative history of the laws in Ohio, the federal court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-Ohio-must-recognize-same-sex-marriage-on-death-certificates.php">concluded</a> that the state was "engaging in discrimination of an unusual character" against gay and lesbian couples. In a similar vein, the federal court in Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-strikes-down-virgina-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">identified</a> the "gravity of the ongoing significant harm being inflicted upon Virginia's gay and lesbian citizens." According to the court, a proposal to wait for a legislative or electorate solution "ignores the needless accumulation of that pain" on gay and lesbian couples and "the stigma, humiliation and prejudice that would be visited upon these citizens' children." </p>

<p>As a nation, we are walking with the courts out of a shameful history of tragedy and oppression. Gay and lesbian couples have come out of the closet to claim their love and their right to marry. In Florida, one of the named plaintiffs is Equality Florida Institute, which has launched a "Get Engaged" campaign to make visible the love and commitments of gay and lesbian families. As civil society has responded, so have the courts, turning the tide of misunderstanding to one of greater understanding and acceptance. While the Florida plaintiffs litigate their case, the other cases move toward the Supreme Court, which will likely bring this chapter of constitutional history to a more inclusive close. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://aclj.org/our-mission/staff">Walter Weber</a> criticizes the US Supreme Court for what he sees as departures from established rules of law...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/walterweber.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he Constitutional litigators are already familiar with the abortion distortion factor. As Justice O'Connor <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3420134328076928385">described</a> it, "no legal rule or doctrine is safe from <em>ad hoc</em> nullification by this [c]ourt when an occasion for its application arises in a case involving state regulation of abortion." The abortion distortion factor has claimed many jurisprudential victims, including even the otherwise venerable rules protecting the constitutional right to free speech, as demonstrated in the Supreme Court's appalling decision in 2000 in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13410055345323866526">Hill v. Colorado</a> (<span class="casename">Hill</span> upheld a law essentially banning speaking to or handing literature to persons entering abortion facilities. Can anyone imagine the court upholding a law banning leafleting by environmental protesters outside a store selling products the protesters deemed toxic?).</p>

                <p>There is now another legal goblin on the block: the homosexual distortion factor. The Supreme Court has again and again shown that its obsession with affirming "the dignity and status" of homosexual and lesbian unions will trump law and logic.</p>

                <p>First, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17758055891258118781">Romer v. Evans</a>, the court insisted that it <strong>knew</strong> the proponents of a state constitutional amendment barring special legal protection based on sexual orientation could <strong>only</strong> be motivated by "animosity" toward persons with homosexual inclinations, and that this required the court to strike down the state amendment. It was inconceivable to the court that there might be any legitimate reason to treat sexual proclivities different from, say, race.</p>

                <p>Next, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas</a>, the court held that what had historically been regarded as a criminal felony&#8212;sodomy&#8212;was actually a constitutional right essential to "defin[ing] one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life" (Any defendants who invoke this passage to justify their failure to heed even relatively new laws, e.g., regarding the wearing of seat belts or helmets, or insider stock trading, much less a host of more traditional crimes like fraud or robbery, are likely to be laughed out of court).</p>

                <p>Then, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10772194664096336702">Christian Legal Society v. Martinez</a>, the court used its fixation with homosexuality to trump the First Amendment. The court held that the right of a student religious group to require that its officers and members believe in the religion in question (as if it were somehow invidious to only let Catholics be priests or Jews be rabbis?) and adhere to its moral standards for sexual conduct (as if groups cannot set standards for behavior as a matter of institutional integrity?) must fall in the face of a state university's requirement that groups not "discriminate" on the basis of religion or, crucially, sexual orientation.</p>

                <p>The court's decision this past spring in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">US v. Windsor</a> only confirms this sorry trend. The decision is so incoherent as to be inexplicable other than as an expression of an obsession with the notion that homosexual and lesbian lifestyles must be affirmed. Consider the following:</p>

                <p>The court declared that the federal <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-104hr3396enr/pdf/BILLS-104hr3396enr.pdf">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) (PDF) was problematic because the federal definition of marriage was different from the state definitions. Yet the court conceded that this same difference already exists&#8212;apparently without constitutional problem&#8212;elsewhere in federal law. In fact, federal definitions commonly determine meanings, for federal statutory purposes, of a variety of terms that may well be defined differently under state law. Recently, for example, the Supreme Court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6577565239241615023">addressed</a> the proper meaning of a federal law defining "child" for purposes of Social Security benefits, concluding that the posthumously conceived IVF offspring at issue were not "children" for purposes of the relevant federal law. The whole point of federalism is that the state and federal governments are independent, with neither bound slavishly to follow the other.</p>

                <p>The <span class="casename">Windsor</span> court insisted that not redefining marriage to include same sex couples "degrade[d] or demean[ed]" such couples. The flaws with this argument are multiple. First, there is no "Demean Clause" in the Constitution. When a government official excoriates some class of people&#8212;corporate executives, union bosses, bankers, welfare dependents&#8212;there may be political consequences, but it is not unconstitutional. Second, even if there were a right not to be "demeaned," exclusion from a definition is not <em>ipso facto</em> an insult. There are countless legal definitions that include some and exclude others. For example, there are federal definitions of "accountant," "attorney," "commodity broker," "creditor," "custodian," "debtor," "disinterested person," "family farmer," "family fisherman," "farmer," "individual with regular income," "patient," "relative," and "stockbroker"&#8212;and that is just in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/101">one section</a> of the federal code! Do these definitions "demean" those left out (e.g., a farmer who only earned 75% of his income from farming and thus does not count as a federal "farmer")? Third, if "demeaning" is to be a constitutional claim, where is the limit? Can those suffering from medical conditions not included in the minimal coverage requirements of Obamacare successfully challenge that law for "demeaning" them? </p>

                <p>How about those home schooled students not allowed to participate in public school athletics? Are believers "demeaned" by federal laws restricting religious activities in connection with federal grant programs? Again, claims phrased in these terms would likely be laughed out of court.</p>

                <p>The <span class="casename">Windsor</span> court noted that New York's more same-sex marriage-friendly laws reflected the "initiative of those who sought a voice in shaping the destiny of their own times," and lamented that DOMA's definition did not defer to that state initiative. But DOMA itself equally reflected the initiative of others who sought a voice in shaping this nation's destiny at the federal level. Why did their initiative not count?</p>

                <p>The court said DOMA "seeks to injure" those who are not treated as married for federal law. If that is so, then expanding DOMA to cover same sex marriage (SSM) is not enough either, as a DOMA-plus-SSM sweep "seeks to injure" cohabitants, bigamists, siblings who are mutually dependent but cannot marry, etc. For that matter, any law that stops someone from doing what they want (e.g., a non-Senator who wants to cast a vote in the U.S. Senate, parents who want to claim a federal tax deduction for their children's private school tuition, protesters who want to enter restricted military facilities, etc) causes people to be "injured" in the same way.</p>

                <p>Astoundingly, the court even said DOMA made it hard to instill in children of same-sex couples the belief that their family is equal to all others. As if the government was constitutionally obligated to inculcate acceptance of the sexual revolution in children! And again, does not a DOMA-plus-SSM statute inflict the same supposed constitutional injury on the children of single parents or cohabitants?</p>

                <p>This potpourri of arguments would never carry the day in any other context. <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, like its predecessors <span class="casename">Romer</span>, <span class="casename">Lawrence</span> and <span class="casename">CLS v. Martinez</span>, cannot be explained as the application of law or logic. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that a majority of the Supreme Court suffers from a jurisprudential fever, analogous to the abortion distortion malady, that renders it incapable of perceiving good faith or legitimacy in any measures inconsistent with unqualified acceptance of the homosexual legal agenda. Any law daring to resist or question that agenda provokes intense emotional repugnance#151;heterophobia, anyone?#151;which clouds the jurisprudential mind and trumps otherwise established rules of law.</p>

                <p>There is a remedy. In the abortion context, the court, after nearly twenty years of struggle in the wake of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673">Roe v. Wade</a>, finally mustered a majority to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994">recognize that</a> "men and women of good conscience can disagree" over the issue of abortion, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=595549759656336885">and that</a> there were "common and respectable reasons for opposing" abortion. A healthy dose of that same civility is badly needed in the current legal wars over the meaning of gender and sexuality.</p>

                <p>Men and women of good conscience can disagree over same-sex marriage and the significance of sexual orientation. There are common and respectable reasons for opposing the homosexual legal, political and cultural agenda. If the Supreme Court cannot bring itself to acknowledge these facts as a matter of basic human decency, then the court is ruled by bigotry against moral traditionalists, and this country is in for a protracted period of ideological totalitarianism fomented by that august body.</p>

                <p>Enjoy what's left of your religious liberty and free speech, while it lasts.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Melissa Brumer <a href="http://law.fordham.edu">Fordham University School of Law</a> Class of 2015, discusses the differences in settlement amounts between recent contraceptive lawsuits and argues that Merck may be getting out much more cheaply than its competitors...<hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Brumer.jpg"src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Brumer.jpg" width="129" height="213" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n Friday, February 7, 2014, Merck &#38; Co., Inc. (Merck) <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/merck-agrees-to-100-million-nuvaring-settlement.php">announced its agreement</a> to pay $100 million to settle mass litigation concerning Merck's NuvaRing, a vaginal contraceptive device. The thousands of product liability lawsuits allege that Merck failed to adequately warn consumers about the increased risk of potentially fatal blood clots caused by NuvaRing. Merck's <a href="http://www.moed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/1679-NuvRing-A.pdf">settlement agreement</a> [PDF] denies fault and must be accepted by 95 percent of the over 3,800 eligible claimants. Eligible claimants must enroll in the <a href="http://www.nuvaringofficialsettlement.com/Un-Secure/FAQDetails.aspx">settlement program</a> by March 10, 2014.</p>

<p>On August 22, 2008, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) consolidated pending NuvaRing cases and <a href="http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/sites/jpml/files/MDL-1964-Tag-Along-Transfer-02-14.pdf">transferred</a> [PDF] them to Judge Rodney Sippel of the Eastern District of Missouri. On Friday, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Brian Martinotti supported the settlement for the over <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-06/merck-said-to-agree-to-100-million-nuvaring-settlement.html">200 consolidated cases</a> brought before him and Judge Sippel subsequently approved the settlement for the consolidated cases in the MDL litigation. In 2001, Organon began selling NuvaRing after the company obtained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Schering-Plough Corp. obtained Organon in 2007, which was subsequently <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB123659326420569463">acquired by Merck</a> in 2009. Thus, Merck inherited the pending products liability suits concerning NuvaRing.  </p>

<p>The $100 million dollar settlement is much less than other competing contraceptive lawsuits, such as the $1.6 billion dollar <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-31/bayer-s-yasmin-lawsuit-settlements-rise-to-402-6-million.html">settlement</a> that Bayer AG offered to settle litigation concerning Yaz and Yasmin contraceptive pills. Like the plaintiffs in the NuvaRing litigation, more than 10,000 plaintiffs in the Yaz and Yasmin litigation claimed that Bayer failed to adequately warn consumers about the increased risks of blood clots caused by the contraceptive pills. </p>

<p>But the discrepancy in settlement amounts reflects the strength of the plaintiffs' cases. According to Merck's <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000031015813000004/mrk0630201310q.htm">quarterly report</a> for June 30, 2013, at the outset of the litigation, Judge Sippel ordered the parties to select a pool of more than 20 cases, later narrowed down to seven cases to serve as bellwether trials. Judge Sippel denied Merck's summary judgment motion on the first NuvaRing MDL trial that was scheduled to take place in January 2014. In New Jersey, Judge Martinotti ordered the parties to select a pool of nine cases for bellwether trials. The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed two cases with prejudice and Judge Martinotti granted Merck's summary judgment motion to dismiss the remaining seven cases.</p>

<p>In his opinion granting Merck's summary judgment motion, Judge Martinotti revealed the weaknesses in the plaintiffs' claims in New Jersey. He faulted the plaintiffs on causation, noting that they <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/434705/merck-s-nuvaring-win-puts-pressure-on-mdl-plaintiffs">failed to testify</a> whether they still would have taken the drug if its labeling included the information they claimed was missing, about the additional risks posed by NuvaRing in comparison with older contraceptives. Because "the test is whether the [NuvaRing] label's language met the standard of adequacy in each jurisdiction," Judge Martinotti applied New Jersey's products liability law, found in New Jersey's Products Liability Act, to the seven cases that were before him. Judge Martinotti noted that "only New Jersey had a presumption of adequacy based on FDA approval." Thus, Martinotti was bound by New Jersey's "super-presumption" of adequacy where the FDA had approved the NuvaRing warning label. </p>

<p>Under New Jersey law, the presumption of adequacy can be rebutted by plaintiffs under two exceptions: the <span class="casename">McDarby</span> exception and the <span class="casename">Perez</span> exception. Judge Martinotti explained that in <span class="casename">Perez v. Wyeth Labs, Inc.</span>, the court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17346799864828934593">held</a> that a presumption of adequacy could be overcome "through the introduction of evidence that the pharmaceutical company 'deliberate[ly] conceal[ed] or [did not] disclose after-acquired knowledge of harmful effects.'" Additionally, in <span class="casename">McDarby v. Merck &#38; Co., Inc.</span>, the court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11590223975392740985">held</a> that a presumption of adequacy could be overcome "through the introduction of evidence of the manufacturer's 'economically-driven manipulation of the post-market regulatory process.'" Judge Martinotti found that plaintiffs were unable to overcome the "super-presumption of adequacy" required by New Jersey law and were unable to meet the <span class="casename">Perez</span> or <span class="casename">McDarby</span> exceptions.</p>

<p>Still, at the time of the settlement, there were only 200 consolidated cases before Judge Martinotti in New Jersey. More than 1,500 consolidated cases were still pending before Judge Sippel in the Eastern District of Missouri and other cases were filed in state courts in California and Illinois. However, the settlement bound all of these pending cases and several unfiled cases, for a total of over 3,800 cases. University of Richmond professor Carl Tobias <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-06/merck-said-to-agree-to-100-million-nuvaring-settlement.html">explained</a>, "Merck may be getting out much more cheaply than its competitors because proving the liability case against the NuvaRing device appears to be more difficult than against the other contraceptives."</p>

<p>The mere fact that NuvaRing gained and maintained FDA approval for its products and labels distinguishes the litigation concerning the product from similar litigation, such as that surrounding Bayer for Yaz and Yasmin. The differences between the two are reflected in Bayer's larger settlement agreement amount. In 2009, Yaz and Yasmin cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois before Chief Judge David Herndon. Although a series of bellwether trials were scheduled, Judge Herndon delayed the trial schedule while the parties negotiated settlements. </p>

<p>In April 2012, the FDA ordered Bayer and other contraceptive makers to change the warning labels on their products to reflect research that showed that pills like Yaz and Yasmin increased, perhaps even tripled the risk of blood clots. FDA reports linked at least 50 deaths to Yasmin from 2004 to 2008. Like Merck, Bayer denied fault in its settlement agreement. However, unlike Bayer, NuvaRing's product and labels remained in compliance with the FDA after it was put on the market. Despite allegedly over one dozen studies and a 2011 FDA report that showed that NuvaRing may be linked to a higher risk of blood clots, Merck remained in compliance with the FDA and was not required to change NuvaRing's warning labels to reflect the higher risks associated with the product. Accordingly, the plaintiffs' cases against Merck are more difficult to prove than those cases against Bayer, as reflected in the differences in the settlement amounts.</p>

<p>The $100 million settlement is still contingent upon acceptance by 95 percent of the 3,800 eligible claimants. Some claimants, like Erika Langhart's family, whose story was <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2014/01/nuvaring-lethal-contraceptive-trial">featured</a> in Vanity Fair in 2013 may be reluctant to accept a settlement offer. Langhart suffered a massive double pulmonary embolism, which caused her death and was a direct result of the NuvaRing. The Vanity Fair article suggests that although the NuvaRing manufacturers negotiated with the FDA for warning labels that downplayed the risks associated with the drug, NuvaRing makers were aware of the risks that caused Erika Langhart's death.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.suffolk.edu/law/faculty/26811.php">Andrew Perlman</a> of the Suffolk University Law School argues that government surveillance programs have adversely affected lawyers' efforts to safeguard confidential information and that lawyers should consider various options to address these new risks ... <hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/andrewperlman.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>P</strong></font>rotecting client confidences used to be so much easier. Lawyers could place sensitive documents in a locked file cabinet behind a locked office door, and that pretty much did the trick.</p>

<p>Today, the protection of confidential information is considerably more difficult. Lawyers store a range of information in the "cloud" as well as on smart phones, laptops, flash drives, and law firm networks. Information that should remain confidential can easily be lost or stolen, <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_magazine/2012/january_february/hot-buttons.html">hacked</a>, inadvertently sent, <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/this_pineapple_can_intercept_wi-fi_traffic/">intercepted</a> while in transit, and even accessed without permission by foreign governments or the <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA). Put simply, the duty of confidentiality is now a lot more complicated than knowing how to use a lock and key. <br />
  <br />
Until recently, the American Bar Association's (ABA) <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/model_rules_of_professional_conduct_table_of_contents.html">Model Rules of Professional Conduct</a> offered little advice to lawyers who wanted to understand their confidentiality obligations in a digital age. In fact, the word "technology" did not even appear in the Rules. Part of the problem was that the relevant rule on confidentiality&#8212;<a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_6_confidentiality_of_information.html">Rule 1.6</a>&#8212;was drafted in the "locked file cabinet" era, when the necessary precautions were far more obvious.     </p>

<p><strong>New Guidance for Lawyers</strong></p>

<p>Fortunately, the Model Rules have been updated to give lawyers more direction. In August 2012, the ABA Commission on Ethics 20/20 proposed, and the ABA House of Delegates <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/ethics_2020/20120808_revised_resolution_105a_as_amended.authcheckdam.pdf">adopted</a>, amendments to Rule 1.6. These amendments state explicitly what had long been implied: a lawyer must "make reasonable efforts to prevent the inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, information relating to the representation of a client."  </p>

<p>The instruction to make "reasonable efforts" is necessarily vague, so new language was added to the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_6_confidentiality_of_information/comment_on_rule_1_6.html">official comment</a> to Rule 1.6&#8212specifically comments 18 and 19&#8212;to help lawyers determine whether their efforts are "reasonable." One of the comments suggests that lawyers should consider a range of factors, including, but not limited to: the sensitivity of the information; the likelihood of disclosure if additional safeguards are not employed; the cost of employing additional safeguards; the difficulty of implementing the safeguards; and the extent to which the safeguards adversely affect the lawyer's ability to represent clients&#8212;e.g., by making a device or important piece of software excessively difficult to use. These factors are intended to be specific enough to give lawyers some direction, but flexible enough in a world of rapidly evolving technologies to address new threats to client confidences.</p>

<p><strong>An Example: NSA Surveillance of Foreign Clients</strong></p>

<p>The <em>New York Times</em> recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/us/eavesdropping-ensnared-american-law-firm.html?_r=2">reported</a> that the NSA collaborated with its counterpart in Australia to intercept communications between a US law firm and its foreign client&#8212;the government of Indonesia&#8212;in order to learn more about trade issues in the region. One striking feature of the story is that the NSA knew the targeted lawyer-client communications concerned perfectly lawful conduct, not some terrorist plot.</p>

<p>Until this news broke, lawyers had suspected that the NSA might be monitoring privileged communications, but there was little proof. In fact, just last year the Supreme Court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13987610465347808803">held</a> that the surveillance of privileged communications was so speculative that lawyers had no standing to challenge it.  </p>

<p>The <em>Times</em> story suggests that lawyers' concerns are not speculative. Existing litigation may now be on much stronger ground, and the ABA has <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/uncategorized/GAO/2014feb20_privilegedinformation_l.authcheckdam.pdf">asked</a> [PDF] the NSA for more information about its handling of privileged communications.  </p>

<p>In the meantime, what should lawyers do when communicating with clients abroad? How can lawyers satisfy their ethical duty of confidentiality?</p>

<p>The language of the newly adopted comment offers some guidance. For example, one important factor is the extent to which the lawyer's communications with a foreign client are "sensitive." The reality is that some legal matters are unlikely to be of interest to the US government. Moreover, other matters may be of interest to the NSA or a foreign government, but a particular communication may not be especially sensitive. In these situations, the use of email would seem to be appropriate and ethical, despite the risk of interception. It is important to keep in mind that the touchstone here is "reasonableness," so the mere possibility that a particular type of communication&#8212;e.g., email&#8212;could be intercepted does not by itself mean that the communication is ethically impermissible.      </p>

<p>But what about sensitive communications with clients that may be of interest to the NSA or foreign governments, such as the communications described in the <em>New York Time</em>s article? In such cases, lawyers appear to have several options. One would be to jump on a plane and meet with the client in person. The obvious problem with this approach is that it is an awfully expensive and time-consuming way to represent a foreign client, and the new comment language states that cost is a relevant consideration when determining a lawyer's ethical duties. So an in-person meeting may be desirable in some situations, but it is probably not ethically required.</p>

<p>A much less expensive option&#8212;though arguably less reliable&#8212;is for lawyers and clients to encrypt their email communications. A recent <em>NBC News</em> <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/techies-vs-nsa-new-encryption-techniques-wont-keep-out-spies-f2D11674370">report</a> illustrates that encryption is not foolproof and the NSA's ability to crack or find ways around encrypted communications appears to be more robust than people had previously thought. With that said, new solutions are emerging all the time, such as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2014/02/10/former-nsa-security-architect-pushes-email-encryption-for-the-masses/">one</a> recently created by two former NSA security experts. In short, encrypting email is not a perfect solution, but it is better than nothing.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/06/07/verizon_nsa_scandal_can_disposable_burner_cell_phones_protect_you_from_government.html">Another option</a> might be best described as the "Walter White" solution, where you and your client purchase prepaid phones that are used only for lawyer-client conversations. These so-called "burner" phones are not a guarantee of confidentiality, but they can help to reduce the likelihood that the government will listen to the privileged conversations. </p>

<p>Regardless of the option used, it is increasingly important for lawyers to be aware of the risks different methods of communication impose and to inform clients of the same. Of course it is difficult to quantify the likelihood that particular communications will be intercepted, especially given how little we know about existing surveillance methods, but clients need to be told that most kinds of communications are not risk-free. If a client consents to the use of a particular form of communication despite the reasonably knowable risks, lawyers should feel comfortable that they have complied with their ethical duty of confidentiality. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The unfortunate reality is that lawyers are finding it increasingly difficult to protect a client's confidences without resorting to extreme or unduly expensive measures. Such measures may be advisable in certain kinds of legal matters, but they are probably not ethically required. A lawyer's ethical duty is to make reasonable efforts, and we may have to accept that those efforts do not provide the same kind of comfort the trusty lock and key once afforded.    </p>

		<title>New York&amp;apos;s Solitary Confinement Reforms May Spark Larger Discussion</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/faculty/directory/zeidman.html">Steven Zeidman</a> of the CUNY School of Law argues that changes to solitary confinement laws present an opportunity to discuss larger issues with the prison system as a whole ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/stevenzeidman.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he recent <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/new-york-agrees-to-reform-solitary-confinement-law.php">agreement</a>, growing out of the case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15891956208564504564">Peoples v. Fischer</a>, reached by the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) and the New York State Department of Community Corrections (DOCCS) to bar the use of solitary confinement for minors, pregnant women and the developmentally disabled is unquestionably momentous. Of similar magnitude is the state's pledge to develop strict isolation sentencing guidelines and maximum sentences limiting the use of solitary applicable to all inmates. </p>

<p>Similar movements are happening across the country in states as diverse as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/opinion/my-night-in-solitary.html?_r=0">Colorado</a>, <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/georgia-s-new-disciplinary-practices-no-solitary-confinement-and-limited-use-of-restraints">Georgia</a>, Indiana, Ohio and <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/solitary-factsheet">California</a>. The US Senate Judiciary Committee has also, very recently, <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=f00b2bec76ceca7ac77335d8aa01e76a">held</a> hearings about the use of solitary confinement.  From an international perspective, Juan Mendez, Special Rapporteur on Torture for the United Nations, <a href="https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40097">argues</a> that "[c]onsidering the severe mental pain or suffering solitary confinement may cause, it can amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, indefinitely or for a prolonged period, for persons with mental disabilities or juveniles."  </p>

<p>While the agreement reached in <span class="casename">Peoples</span> provides for considerable and meaningful change, it is certainly not time for reformers to declare victory. The agreement does not significantly reduce the length, or improve the conditions, of solitary confinement for the majority of people currently enduring its debilitating effects. While it provides a measure of relief for certain groups (e.g., minors 16 and 17-years-old), other vulnerable populations (e.g., the elderly and the disabled) are left, literally, in the dark. Further, although it contemplates a revision of guidelines with respect to what misbehavior can be punished and for how long, it ultimately still permits people to be placed in 23-hour lock down for years at a time.</p>

<p>While there are undeniably enduring issues surrounding solitary confinement, the growing disquiet over its use presents an opportunity for an even larger discussion about prison reform generally. In the lawsuit that compelled the abovementioned agreement, NYCLU <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/files/publications/nyclu_boxedin_FINAL.pdf">showed</a> [PDF] that black and brown men are more likely to be sentenced to solitary confinement, and for longer periods of time, than are white inmates. That reality is nothing new. Almost twenty-five years ago, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13109876182026806228">Santiago v. Miles</a>, a federal judge found a pattern of racial discrimination in the inmate disciplinary practices of one of New York's maximum security prisons. It is that invidious and undeniable racism that should, finally, cause a deeper look into prisons. </p>

<p>New York, like many other states, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/12/the-prison-industrial-complex/304669/">built the majority of its prisons</a> in rural regions of the state far away from the urban cities where so many of the incarcerated live. Almost half of New York prisoners are from New York City, but every prison built in the state since 1982 is in upstate New York. Put another way, 90 percent of all New York prisoners are in upstate prisons, far from New York City.</p>

<p>Some maintain that it is a function of raw space&#8212;rural towns and cities have the vacant acreage necessary for state prisons. Others argue in similar fashion that prisons end up upstate because of the "not in my backyard" mentality expressed by the large numbers of people who dwell in cities. While those claims certainly have merit, they obscure the real reason for the proliferation of state prisons built in isolated, distressed rural areas&#8212;elected officials and community members from those towns, weighed down by lack of industry, manufacturing and jobs, expressly and vigorously lobby for prisons as economic saviors. The relationship between the decline of the upstate New York economy and the prison construction boom of the 1980s is unmistakable.    <br />
   <br />
There are indeed myriad reasons for the "upstate" prison industrial complex, but no one even tries to suggest that any measure of concern, let alone compassion, for those locked in state prison serves as the slightest motivation behind the rural push for prisons. The US Census <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/25/AR2009042501403.html">counts</a> incarcerated people as "residing" in the county of their correctional institution. As a result, and at the expense of the communities and neighborhoods where so many inmates actually live, prison counties garner increased federal appropriations under standard population-based formulas. Further, in most states, counting inmates as residents of the county of the correctional facility impacts the number of representatives from state legislative districts. These truths supply ample incentives for towns to aggressively seek state prisons in their districts. </p>

<p>Ultimately, it is for purely economic reasons that so many elected officials in isolated rural towns and localities argue forcefully for "their" prisons. In many rural communities, the entire economy and job market <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/01/27/133276372/new-york-gov-threatens-to-mothball-more-prisons">revolve around the local prison</a>. Prisons offer many unskilled jobs for members of the community with no or limited training or experience in law enforcement or security. Correction officers make up the most common form of prison-related job. Rural towns in upstate New York employ hundreds of locals to oversee thousands of outsiders. Add to the mix the racial imbalance&#8212;predominantly, if not exclusively, white officers guarding predominantly black and brown men&#8212;and the potential for abuse is as clear as the ugly images conjured up of plantations and slavery. </p>

<p>It is this upstate/city, white/black, guard/prisoner dynamic that leads, consciously or subconsciously, to so many of the prison abuses that have been exposed over the years. Whether it is due to lack of familiarity, understanding, and trust, or racial animus, intolerance, indifference or neglect, the predictable results are endemic abuses like discrimination in housing and job assignments and inadequate access to medical and mental health treatment. And now, more fully revealed, is the abuse of what are euphemistically called "special housing units" or "isolation cells"&#8212;in other words, rampant and prolonged solitary confinement.</p>

<p>Once inmates are locked up, in obscure, distant parts of the state, with limited access to family (or lawyers), the potential for abuse grows immeasurably. The question "who knows what goes on behind closed doors" becomes especially apt the farther and farther away those doors are from other people. Correction officers have vast discretion and authority to issue disciplinary charges. Hence, there are prisoners in solitary confinement for "infractions" as minor as having an untidy cell or talking too loudly. Thereafter, it is other Corrections employees who adjudicate the charges and determine the sentence. Consequently, draconian solitary confinement sentences are meted out on regular basis. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Due process</a> rights are rendered illusory in a world where Corrections officials act as judge and jury, far away, behind closed doors.</p>

<p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has shown a willingness to tackle much needed prison reform. He is moving to finance college classes for inmates in ten state prisons so that they can <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/opinion/gov-cuomos-bold-step-on-prison-education.html">earn an associate or bachelors degree</a> in two to three years, and it is on his watch that the state agreed to the changes in the use of solitary confinement. Now, he needs to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/02/nyregion/criminal-justice-hard-goal-for-cuomo.html">meaningfully act</a> on his promise of closing state prisons, prisons that were, ironically, <a href="http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/public-safety/650-cuomo-could-shrink-the-prison-system-his-father-built-">built</a> during an unprecedented expansion of prisons during his father, Mario Cuomo's, tenure as governor. In particular, he should close those prisons that are farthest away from the communities of the people they hold, and bring the incarcerated back home to their families to be "counted" in their neighborhoods and communities. </p>

<p>The spotlight on solitary confinement has revealed lawlessness, inhumanity and racism that define the insides of state prisons as many correction officers correctly intuit that their actions are effectively shielded from view. The changes in solitary confinement are unquestionably historic, but hopefully in the long run they will be even more unprecedented for the overall reform they generate.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/heather-barr">Heather Barr</a> of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> says that the deplorable state of women's rights in Afghanistan should not be tolerated and that changes must be made...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/heatherbarr.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>F</strong></font>our years ago, a long-awaited law to protect women and girls from violence, the <a href="http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm">Law on Elimination of Violence Against Women</a> (EVAW), was finally passed in Afghanistan. In a country where many women and girls are forced to enter and stay in abusive marriages, it seemed a ray of hope. However, in January, a provision in Afghanistan's draft criminal procedure code became the latest in a series of attempts to roll back the already fragile legal protections for women and girls.<br />
                <br />
                The 128-page draft code had undergone a six-year drafting process involving hundreds of hours of meetings and discussion among Afghan justice officials and international advisers on criminal justice, but the version passed by  parliament and sent to President Hamid Karzai for his signature on February 9, 2014 included "relatives of the accused" among a list of people who "cannot be questioned as witnesses" in criminal proceedings. The rule, in Article 26, allowed no exceptions. It would have given the abusers of women effective immunity for their crimes.<br />
                <br />
                The context for this latest drama matters. This is not a strange legislative drafting mishap or an unintended consequence of a poorly thought-through good intention. This comes after a year of frequent and serious attacks on women's rights by the Afghan parliament, government and judiciary.<br />
                <br />
                Not only did that version have an outright prohibition against calling the "relatives of the accused" to testify in criminal proceedings, it also had a very broad definition of the term "relatives." A "relative" was defined as "husband or wife and their ancestors and descendants up to the second generation, mother and father and their ancestors up to the second generation and brother, sister, uncle, aunt and their descendants up to the second generation." In Afghanistan, that could have easily excluded an entire village.</p>

                <p>If the provision were left intact, Article 26 would have gutted Afghanistan's new and still tentative protections for women who are victims of domestic violence by silencing a very large potential pool of witnesses to crimes committed against women in the privacy of the family home.<br />
                    <br />
                    Crimes against women in their homes by family members remain a serious problem. In 2008, research by Global Rights <a href="http://www.globalrights.org/sites/default/files/docs/final_DVR_JUNE_16.pdf">showed</a> (PDF) that 87 percent of a sample of Afghan women reported that they had faced at least one form of abuse in their lifetime, 39 percent said they had been hit by their husband in the last year and 59 percent said they were in forced marriages.<br />
                    <br />
                    Article 26 of the proposed code violates the underlying aim of EVAW. The law bolstered legal protections for women by, for the first time, criminalizing rape, child marriage and forced marriage and by imposing tough new penalties for domestic violence. The UN has closely tracked the enforcement of EVAW, and the findings offer a mix of both frustration and hope for Afghanistan's women. Its 2013 <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/Portals/UNAMA/Documents/UNAMA%20REPORT%20on%20EVAW%20LAW_8%20December%202013.pdf">analysis</a> (PDF) indicates that government enforcement efforts have in many parts of the country been slow, uneven and lackluster, but the UN also reported progress in that both the number of cases of reported violence against women and related cases prosecuted under the law are gradually rising. For example, in 2013, 28 percent more cases of violence against women were registered than in the previous year. However, the number of prosecutions under the new law rose only two percent, suggesting that while the law is having a positive impact, it is far too slow.<br />
                    <br />
                    So who would want to derail EVAW and why? It is not clear who drafted Article 26 in its present form, but a majority of members of parliament supported it, notwithstanding the negative impact it posed to efforts to protect women from violence.<br />
                    <br />
                    Besieged by pleas from Afghan activists and a growing number of donor countries not to sign the draft criminal procedure code into law without further amendments, Karzai paused. Officials initially argued that there had been a misunderstanding and that Article 26 would only prevent courts from compelling relatives to testify (but would permit voluntary testimony). Eventually the Justice Ministry conceded that the language of Article 26 suggested otherwise and agreed to revise it.<br />
                    <br />
                    In late February, Karzai sought to defuse the controversy by signing into law the parliament's version of the code but following it up with a separate <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/afghanistan-president-orders-changes-to-controversial-law-impacting-womens-rights.php">presidential decree</a> amending Article 26. The decree clarifies that relatives of the accused are permitted to testify voluntarily. It also allows compelled testimony from anyone who is a "complainant or informant regarding the crime" and slightly narrows the definition of "relatives."<br />
                    <br />
                    Karzai's revised Article 26 still exempts far too many family members from being called to court as witnesses. The new version of the law exempts grandparents and grandchildren and everyone in between from testifying, including former wives or husbands. Limiting testimony in criminal proceedings to only those witnesses who choose to "voluntarily" testify poses serious challenges for successful prosecution of violence against women and to victim and witness protection in Afghanistan. Even with the decree, in its current form Article 26 provides a legal shield to those accused of domestic violence who threaten relatives and intimidate them from testifying in courts.<br />
                    <br />
                    Additionally, Afghan lawmakers hostile to women's rights will have the opportunity as soon as this month to reverse the presidential decree when parliament reconvenes, but even if parliament leaves that decree intact, bureaucratic challenges may also inadvertently victimize women. Afghanistan's system of distributing legal codes is not computerized, so courts could receive copies of the code that do not include the presidential amendment to Article 26.<br />
                    <br />
                    The last year has been a very rough ride for women's rights in Afghanistan. Lawmakers have argued for the repeal of EVAW and tried to abolish a set-aside of seats for women on provincial councils. The courts <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/world/asia/afghan-court-reverses-conviction-in-torture-of-young-woman.html">reversed</a> the 10-year sentences handed down to the in-laws who brutally abused 13-year-old bride Sahar Gul in a case that had previously been seen as emblematic of the positive impact of EVAW. Female police officers, legislators and activists suffered attacks, some fatal, and threats without receiving support from the government.</p>

                <p>Karzai undermined the credibility of the government's human rights commission by appointing unqualified new commissioners, including a former Taliban government official who urged repeal of EVAW. A committee including representatives of key government institutions prepared a draft law that would have reinstated stoning as a punishment for adultery.<br />
                    <br />
                    It is likely that such attacks on women's rights will continue. The eagerness of Afghanistan's foreign donors to reduce their overall commitment to Afghanistan in line with the planned end-2014 withdrawal of foreign military forces is creating a space in which opponents of women's rights have freer rein to pursue their agenda. Foreign donors, who continue to provide virtually all of the Afghan government's budget, should insist that it respect and strengthen legal protections for women, not eviscerate them. Until they do, Afghanistan's hard-fought women's rights will remain perilously fragile.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Bhagwat/index.aspx">Ashutosh Bhagwat</a> of University of California, Davis School of Law argues the US Court of Appeals' decision to uphold the ban on American flag shirts at Live Oak High School on Cinco de Mayo may have constituted a heckler's veto over the rights of free speech ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/ashutoshbhagwat.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n February 27, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ninth-circuit-upholds-schools-ban-on-us-flag-t-shirts.php">announced</a> its decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9241432031769824686">Dariano v. Morgan Hill Unified School District</a>. The case raises some very difficult questions about the free speech rights of public-school students, and how those rights should be reconciled with school officials' legitimate desires to maintain a safe and orderly school environment. At a more basic level, the case also poses very fundamental questions about the nature of debate and tolerance in our diverse society.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/06/california-students-sent-home-wearing-flags-cinco-mayo/">controversy</a> in <span class="casename">Dariano</span> arose from the Cinco the Mayo celebration held at Live Oak High School in Morgan Hill, California on May 5, 2010. Live Oak has a history of violence among students, including gang violence and racial tensions between Caucasian and Mexican students (I use the court's terminology in describing students' ethnicities). During the 2009 Cinco de Mayo celebration, a year before the incident involving the <span class="casename">Dariano</span> lawsuit, a verbal altercation had broken out between Caucasian and Mexican students over the raising of an American flag by the former. Then in 2010, on Cinco de Mayo a group of Caucasian students wore t-shirts depicting the American flag to school. The students were confronted by several of their fellow students, and during "brunch break" school officials were told that "there might be problems" because of the t-shirts. In response, school officials met with the t-shirt-wearers, and asked two of them to either turn their shirts inside-out, or go home for the rest of the day, with an excused absence. The students chose to go home. Following these events, the students received threats by text message and telephone. Eventually, the students and their parents filed suit against the school district alleging violations of their <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> free speech rights (as well as other, more marginal claims that we will ignore). The trial court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13567660637446275026">dismissed</a> the lawsuit, and the plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit.</p>

<p>The framework applied by the appellate court to resolve the case derives from the Supreme Court's groundbreaking 1969 opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15235797139493194004">Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District</a>. <span class="casename">Tinker</span> was the first Supreme Court opinion to recognize that public school students possess First Amendment rights. In that case, the court concluded that the Constitution did not permit school officials to punish students simply for wearing black armbands to school, in protest of the Vietnam War. <span class="casename">Tinker</span> did not, however, hold that students' rights are unlimited, or even equal to the rights of adults. In particular, the <span class="casename">Tinker</span> court explicitly recognized that schools may prohibit speech that "materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others." Later cases confirm that schools may punish or prohibit student speech that is vulgar or lewd, speech which is "school sponsored" or part of the curriculum (in particular, the contents of the school newspaper), and speech advocating illegal drug use (the infamous <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10117776825257150184">"Bong Hits 4 Jesus" decision</a>). The Supreme Court, however, has provided essentially no guidance on how the "materially disrupts" and "substantial disorder" language of <span class="casename">Tinker</span> should be applied in run-of-the-mill cases.</p>

<p>Under the rules laid out by <span class="casename">Tinker</span> and its progeny, <span class="casename">Dariano</span> is a genuinely hard case. The reason is that the wearing of an American flag t-shirt is obviously not itself lewd or disruptive, nor is there any allegation that the t-shirt wearing students acted in an aggressive or disruptive manner. The Ninth Circuit concluded, however, that the risk of violence created by the t-shirts justified the school officials' actions, especially since the students were not officially sanctioned for refusing to turn their shirts inside-out. The court emphasized that the students themselves did not deny that their shirts might provoke violence, and the later threats (which resulted in the plaintiffs staying home from school on May 7) leave little doubt that the risk was real. Given all of these circumstances, and the school's history of violence, the court concluded that school officials acted reasonably as well as constitutionally.</p>

<p>At first glance, it seems hard to argue with the <span class="casename">Dariano</span> decision. After all, the Caucasian students' decision to wear flag t-shirts on May 5 was plainly and intentionally provocative. Moreover, the risk of violence was clearly real, and obviously school officials have a paramount obligation to prevent violence on school campus. But on closer look the Ninth Circuit's reasoning is quite troubling. For starters, the fact that the students' actions were provocative does not mean that their speech was unprotected. The Constitution, after all, has been interpreted to protect wearing a jacket with the words <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7398433541275578772">"Fuck the Draft"</a> written on it, and to protect <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2084618710761560217">burning the American flag</a>. It surely then must protect wearing a t-shirt portraying the American flag, even if the t-shirt may be perceived as racist by onlookers (one student asked one of the plaintiffs "Why are you wearing that? Do you not like Mexicans"). Admittedly, schools are different from public places, and courts have permitted schools to exclude explicitly racist symbols as well as Confederate flag depictions because of the risk of racial violence. But the American flag is hardly such an inherently racist symbol. Even in <span class="casename">Tinker</span>, after all, protesting a war during the middle of that war was highly provocative/controversial and could be understood as unpatriotic&#8212;in fact the arm-band wearers were subject to hostile remarks.</p>

<p>According to the Ninth Circuit, what distinguished <span class="casename">Tinker</span> was the lack of any violence in that case. The key to <span class="casename">Dariano</span>, then, must be the violence inherent in the situation. But now things get very sticky. When <span class="casename">Tinker</span> referred to disruption of schools, the court appeared to be primarily referring to disruptive or violent conduct on the part of the speakers, which schools can of course punish. Here, however, the potential violence arose because of onlookers' hostile reaction to the speech. The Supreme Court's approach to potential violence by hostile audiences, however, has generally been very different from the <span class="casename">Dariano</span> court's decision. In two foundational First Amendment cases from the 1940s, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10099999677896592458">Cantwell v. Connecticut</a> (involving a Jehovah's Witness) and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2189837708321658845">Terminiello v. Chicago</a> (involving a red-baiter and anti-semite), the court made clear that speech cannot be suppressed simply because it offends, or even riles up, a hostile audience. The court backed off of this commitment to protect unpopular speakers in a (much-criticized) McCarthy era decision, but then in subsequent cases from the Civil Rights era it once again embraced and repeatedly reaffirmed the principle that hostility or even threats of violence from onlookers cannot by themselves justify silencing unpopular speakers. Rather, the obligation of the police is to take all reasonable steps to protect the speaker, and step in to stop the speech only if there is no other way to avoid violence.</p>

<p>Moreover, this approach to protecting provocative speakers must be correct. The alternative would be to create a "Heckler's Veto," in which unpopular speakers and viewpoints could be silenced completely by hostile crowds. Civil rights protestors, needless to say, were not popular among the Caucasian majority in the South during the Civil Rights era, and southern police regularly used the excuse of hostile crowds to shut down protests. The court's decisions quite correctly held that this violated the First Amendment, since granting a Heckler's Veto would eviscerate the right to protest majoritarian policies. The primary role of the First Amendment is to protect the democratic process, and the right of the minority to protest and criticize the majority is an essential part of that process.</p>

<p>Now back to <span class="casename">Dariano</span>. The risk of violence at Live Oak was undoubtedly real; but the threats of violence came not from the speakers, but from hostile onlookers. The Live Oak officials' response, however, was not to protect the speakers or punish the threat-makers, but rather to silence the speech. This seems a classic Heckler's Veto, and would surely be impermissible if the speech was part of a public protest in some other setting.</p>

<p>Does that fact that these events occurred at a school change things? Maybe. High schools, after all, are small communities in which ongoing interactions&#8212;and thus the potential for violent reactions&#8212;between students are inevitable. Perhaps we can also be less confident that angry teenagers will refrain from acting on their violent impulses than we can be with adults. Furthermore, presumably we would not be happy with a "solution" to tensions in high schools that involves deploying riot police on a regular basis (as happens when unpopular groups such as Nazis hold assemblies in other public places). Finally, with regards to the threat of violence, it is not clear from the facts as described by the Ninth Circuit that any of the Mexican students had made sufficiently explicit threats to justify punishment. Thus, officials may have been faced with a real, significant risk of violence (given the history) and no easy way to avoid it. Under those special circumstances, perhaps their decision to briefly silence the speech was justified&#8212;after all, the school did not ban flag t-shirts for good, but only on that one day. There is, however, always a cost when public officials effectuate a Heckler's Veto. Such actions reward intolerance and threats of violence, and silence unpopular views, perhaps at the time and place where they might have the most communicative effect. In an age when civility in political dialogue seems to be fast disappearing, that is something that should give us pause.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://genevadiplomacy.com/doebbler-curtis">Curtis Doebbler</a> of the Geneva School of Diplomacy &#38; International Relations argues that while many US lawyers and diplomats have condemned Russia's involvement in Ukraine as a violation of international law, recent practices of states using force against other states suggests that it may be the United States that is in violation of international law ... <hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/curtisdoebbler.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he threat of <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/obama-russia-military-intervention-in-ukraine-is-a-violation-of-international-law.php">Russian intervention</a> in Ukraine has caused American lawyers and diplomats to raise their voices about the legality of Russian military action in Ukraine. These complaints, however, are based more on political rhetoric and posturing than on an understanding of international law. In fact the most recent practices of states using force against other states show that perhaps it is the United States that is violating international law once again. </p>

<p>In using force against first <a href="/feature/2013/07/the-war-on-terror.php">Afghanistan</a> and then <a href="/feature/2013/07/iraq-war-1.php">Iraq</a> in a period of less than three years, the US acted in violation of <a href="https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml">Article 2, Paragraph 4</a>, of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">Charter of the United Nations</a>. This provision of the Charter prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of another sovereign state. Without a doubt the terrible bombing of these two countries&#8212;which killed millions of Afghanis and Iraqis&#8212;was a use of force against both the territorial integrity and political independence of these two countries. </p>

<p>In the case of <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya</a>, the US and NATO <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-releases-report-justifying-actions-and-cost-in-libya.php">claimed</a> that it was authorized to use force by the UN Security Council. Russia and China challenged this assertion, claiming that even if the US and NATO were correct in interpreting UN Security Council <a href="http://www.cfr.org/libya/un-security-council-resolution-1973-libya/p24426">resolution</a> to authorize the use of force, the US and NATO action had gone much further than authorized. The US and NATO bombing of Libya's infrastructure  took the country from being the richest country in Africa&#8212;and on track to attain all the UN's <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">Millennium Development Goals</a>&#8212;to a failed State. Thus even if the Security Council authorized the use of force in Libya, it likely violated fundamental human rights of the Libyan people in a massive and widespread manner. Such a violation of Libyans' rights is inconsistent with the Charter's obligations in <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter9.shtml">Article 55 and 56</a> that all states cooperate to achieve development and respect for human rights. It also violates Article 2, Paragraph 4, of the Charter, which prohibits the use of force "in an other manner inconsistent with the purpose and principles of the UN." </p>

<p>Syria is another example where international law is not only applicable but has been manipulated. As a sovereign state, Syria is allowed to seek international assistance to maintain its public order and to provide security to its people. When <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">civil war</a> broke out in Syria, foreign states were legally entitled to assist the government in pacifying the country. Under international law, states are not allowed to provide weapons to non-state actors and they act in violation of international law when they do so. Non-state actors can only justify the use of force if they are recognized as a National Liberation Movement. The Syria's foreign backed rebels were not. When foreign states support such a group, they commit a serious violation of international law. They violate the injunction against states from interfering in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of another state. This prohibition&#8212;like the prohibition against the use of force&#8212;is laid down in the UN Charter. It is found in <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter3.shtml">Article 2, Paragraph 7</a>.</p>

<p>But Syria has also been a good example of the use of international law. In an enhancement of the status of international law, the negotiations with the US concerning NATO and US plans to intervene in Syria using force frequently referred to the applicable international law. The US alleged that its intervention&#8212;even if not authorized by the UN Security Council&#8212;was legitimate. Russia countered by arguing it was inconsistent with international law. The Russians pointed out to the Americans that the use of force against Syria&#8212;a sovereign State&#8212;was a serious violation of international law via the UN Charter. They also pointed out that&#8212;despite the US claim that the use of force was legitimate&#8212;the US could point to no justification for the use of force that was generally accepted as international law.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Russian negotiators in Geneva highlighted that the US had a legal obligation under international law not to arm non-state actors that were seeking to overthrown the sovereign government of Syria, particularly since that same group may have carried out <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-finds-more-evidence-of-chemical-weapons-used-in-syria.php">chemical weapons attacks</a> which the Syrian government was being accused of orchestrating. Some observers went so far as to point out to US Secretary of State John Kerry that he and President Obama might be liable to prosecution for international crimes if they authorized the use of force against Syria without a clear UN mandate. In this situation, the US backed down and accepted a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rights-chief-calls-for-negotiations-to-end-syria-conflict.php">negotiated solution</a>. International law once again prevailed.</p>

<p>The recent situation in the Ukraine also raises questions of international law; however, American lawyers and diplomats are once again trying to contort the law to make it fit their political agenda. Again, it is Russia that is left in the position of apparently defending international law. </p>

<p>While American lawyers and diplomats claim that the use of force against the Ukraine is illegal, they forget that the elected President of the Ukraine is requesting it. When the legitimate government of a state requests foreign assistance, it can receive it under international law. The provision of assistance to another government, even military assistance, is consistent with international law.  </p>

<p>The case is much different when foreign governments interfere in the domestic affairs of a state to change its government because they do not like it. In Ukraine this is exactly what the US and the EU did, not merely by expressing their political opinion from abroad but by sending money, weapons and advisers to the non-state actors who eventually stormed government buildings and caused the elected-government to flee through the use of force against it.</p>

<p>In such a situation, Russia's continued recognition of the elected government as a government that is entitled to assist if it so requests is consistent with international law. Such assistance must, of course, conform with the rules of international law relating to the use of force by the states against its citizens. However, when a state acts&#8212;even using necessary force&#8212;to restore the public order, which includes securing the elected government. The state and those who support it are then acting in accordance with international law, not contrary to it. Any action from foreign countries to prevent Russia from assisting the elected government would itself be inconsistent with international law as an interference with a domestic affairs of a State that has requested assistance.</p>

<p>Now that the elected President of the Ukraine&#8212;Viktor Yanukovich&#8212;has requested Russian assistance&#8212;including military forces&#8212;in writing, US President Obama is wrong in claiming that Russia is violating international law. In fact, action taken by the US to prevent Russia from assisting the elected government in the Ukraine is likely a violation of international law to the same extent that the United States and European efforts to change the government of the Ukraine were inconsistent with the prohibition of interference in the internal affairs of the Ukraine without the permission of its government.  </p>

<p>More problematic is the Russia justification of intervention to protect its nationals in the Crimea region of Ukraine. Although the United States tried to justify its invasions of Grenada and Panama on this ground, there is little support for such a justification of the use of force under international law. Again, however, such an illegal action may be made legal under international law if the elected government of the state requests it. And again, it is the elected President of the Ukraine that has requested Russia's assistance to protect vulnerable Ukrainians.</p>

<p>More important and constructive for the development and application of international law are the indications from Russia that it wants to exhaust all peaceful means to resolve the situation in the Ukraine. As part of these efforts, Russia is calling for the people who took power by force in the Ukraine to talk with the elected government and to express their assurances that they will honor the Ukraine's international agreements as international law requires. </p>

<p>It is perhaps ironic that its is Russia&#8212;a superpower during the cold war that still possess one of the world's largest weapons arsenals and armies&#8212;that is relying on international law to triumph over brute force. Nevertheless, it is a testimony to the resilience and relevance of international law that even states with the propensity to act on the mere basis of the use of force feel compelled to resort to international law to justify their actions. And it is even better when the legal arguments are based on a consensual understanding of the law shared by most states; even if some states claiming extraordinary privileges that run counter to the rule of international law, have to be increasingly ignored.</p>

There are indications that the Ukrainian Parliament has taken steps to submit the situation to the attention of the ICC for the alleged criminal acts covering the period of October 30, 2013 to February 22, 2014. Some allegations include mass murder, torture and enforced disappearances. The current brief covers the elements of jurisdiction, admissibility and applicable law as regards potential situation in Ukraine. </p>

<p><strong>Jurisdiction </strong></p>

<p>Does the ICC have jurisdiction over the situation in Ukraine? Ukraine has signed the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [PDF] in January 2000 but has not ratified the statute. As such, Ukraine cannot be considered a state party to the ICC. In this circumstance, according to Article 12 (3) of the Rome Statute, an acceptance of jurisdiction on part of Ukraine is necessary. Ukraine will be required to lodge a declaration with the ICC to accept the exercise of jurisdiction of the Court with respect to the crimes in question. Additionally, according to Rule 44(2) of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/legal%20texts%20and%20tools/official%20journal/Documents/RulesProcedureEvidenceEng.pdf">ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence</a> [PDF], such declaration implies acceptance of jurisdiction for all potential crimes listed in Article 5 of the Rome Statute. Such referrals following the acceptance of jurisdiction have happened before as in the situation in Ivory Coast. Once the state declaration is accepted and the Pre-Trial Chamber concludes that the ICC can exercise jurisdiction over the alleged crimes, the procedure under Article 15 of the Rome Statute pertaining to the role of the Prosecutor is triggered. </p>

<p>In accordance with Article 15(3) the Prosecutor would conclude whether there is a reasonable basis to proceed with the investigation and, if so, she would submit a request for an authorization for an investigation. It means that when the Prosecutor decides whether there is a reasonable basis to proceed, Article 53(1)(a), (b), and (c) shall be leading as to whether the information available to the Prosecutor provides a reasonable basis to believe that a crime within the jurisdiction has been committed, whether the case would be admissible under Article 17 of the Rome Statute, and whether the gravity of the crime and interests of the victims is serious enough. The Pre-Trial Chamber basically ascertains the jurisdictions ratione materiae, ratione temporis according to Article 11, and ratione loci or ratione personae according to Article 12(2) of the Rome Statute. </p>

<p>Second, Article 13(b) allows for the UN Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a> to refer a situation to the ICC Prosecutor. Such development is highly unlikely as Russia would most likely veto such referral on the situation in Ukraine pertaining to alleged criminal acts involving the former President Yanukovich for primarily political reasons. Moreover, it should be noted that it is reported that the former President is currently located in Russia. As Russia has just signed the Rome Statute in 2000 but has not ratified it yet, the eventual transfer to the ICC of any suspects on its territory involved in an eventual Ukraine situation remains highly unlikely. </p>

<p>The case would be inadmissible if the case for the alleged crimes under Article 5 of the Rome Statute is being investigated or prosecuted by Ukraine or any other state with jurisdiction over it unless the state is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out investigations or prosecution according to Article 17(1) of the Rome Statute. Hence, if the ICC is satisfied that no such proceedings exist at domestic level, the investigation of the situation in Ukraine may be authorized if it meets the element of gravity set in Article 17(1)(d) of the Rome Statute. It is interesting to note that the Ukrainian authorities are not precluded from investigating the alleged perpetrators for other crimes such as economic crimes or abuse of power crimes. </p>

<p><strong>Crimes</strong></p>

<p>The jurisdiction of the ICC is limited to the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. In the particular circumstances and specifically but not limited to the events for the period of February 18-21, the ICC may exercise jurisdiction over crimes against humanity pursuant to Article 5(1)(b) as the confrontations between the protesters and the state authorities did not reach the threshold of an armed conflict. The charges would most likely fall under crimes against humanity for murder, while other counts relating to acts of torture, enforced disappearance of persons, imprisonment or other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health may also be applicable. </p>

<p>Crimes against humanity are based on the following elements: 1) an attack directed against any civilian population; 2) a state or organizational policy; 3) an attack of a widespread or systematic nature; 4) a nexus between the individual act and the attack; 5) knowledge of the attack. "Attack directed against a civilian population" is understood to mean a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in Article 7(1) of the statute against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a state or organizational policy to commit such attack. The Berkut or other law-enforcement forces under the orders or guidance of the former administration and/or the President may be implicated as having participated or using lethal force which resulted in the deaths of more than 80 persons who were not randomly selected but were targeted for their participation in the protests. Hence, the victims could not be claimed to be just incidental victims. </p>

<p>In terms of the nature of the attack as widespread or systematic, "widespread" usually refers to a large scale of the attack, which should be massive, frequent and carried out collectively by state forces against multiplicity of victims. It should be duly noted that the attacks against the demonstrators in Kiev may qualify as widespread as a widespread attack also incorporates the cumulative effect of a series of inhumane acts or the single effect of an inhumane act of very serious or extraordinary magnitude (see <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/icc0211/Pages/situation%20index.aspx">Ivory Coast decision</a>, ICC 02/11, para 53). Additionally, allegations of torture and enforced disappearance of journalists and political activists of the opposition may fall under series of inhumane acts or even, because of their gravity, under the chapeau of a single act of extraordinary magnitude.</p>

<p>Another pertinent issue is whether the policy to commit such an attack requires that the state or organization actively promotes and encourages such an attack or, in exceptional circumstances, is implemented by a deliberate failure to take action, which is consciously aimed at encouraging such attack. The nexus between the individual acts and the widespread attacks may be derived from the geographic and temporal scope of the attack and the crimes, the use of excessive and lethal force on part of the state organs against civilians/demonstrators and deployment of special forces and snipers. The mental element is that the accused knew that the conduct was part of or intended the conduct to be part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population. </p>

<p>In terms of the alleged crimes, murder as a crime against humanity means the act of the killing or causing death of one or more persons committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population. Instances of murder occurred in Kiev on or about February 18-21 2014. Torture requires that the perpetrator inflicted severe physical or mental pain or suffering upon one or more persons and such person was in the custody or under the control of the official perpetrator or its forces. Such instances were alleged to have taken place against political activists who were critical of the former government and president. The crime of enforced disappearance requires that the perpetrator must have arrested, detained or abducted one or more individuals or refused to acknowledge their arrest, detention or abduction, or to give information on their whereabouts and fate. The arrest, detention or abduction must have been carried out by, or with the authorization, support of acquiescence of the state officials. </p>

<p>Based on the evidence, official positions and effective control of the suspects, the most likely applicable liabilities would concern ordering, soliciting or inducing the commission of the crime(s) (Article 25(3)(b) of the Rome Statute), aiding and abetting the commission or the attempted commission of the crimes (Article 25(3)(c) of the Rome Statute) or contributing to the commission or attempted commission of such crimes by participation in a criminal group with a common purpose (Article 25(3)(d) of the Rome Statute). Additionally, the issue of immunities would not be applicable as pursuant to Article 27 of the Rome Statute, the statute applies equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity, including former and acting heads of states or government.</p>

<p>In conclusion, a legal pathway to The Hague exists for the most responsible for the violence which gripped Ukraine and especially Kiev in February 2014. The decision to refer the situation might involve complex political calculations and the ICC possesses the ultimate authority whether to accept the situation. Finally, the likelihood of any practical development remains low as regards the situation as long as the potential suspects are on the territory of Russia. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.eff.org/about/staff/hanni-fakhoury">Hanni Fakhoury</a> of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> discusses state courts and cell phone privacy...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/hannifakhoury.JPG" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n a span of ten days, three separate state Supreme Court decisions expanded privacy protections in cell phones in important ways. While residents of Massachusetts, Texas and Washington got a little more security, state and federal courts got a glimpse of how old and hallowed principles of privacy can survive the technological onslaught of the 21st century. <em>Full disclosure: I submitted an amicus brief in all three of these cases on behalf of the Electronic Frontier Foundation ("EFF")</em>.</p>

                <p><strong>Massachusetts: Cell Phone Tracking Requires a Warrant</strong></p>

                <p>In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=commonwealth+v.+augustine&hl=en&as_sdt=4,22&case=7508768174056854700&scilh=0">Commonwealth v. Augustine</a>, police, without a search warrant, obtained two weeks worth of historical cell site records from Sprint in connection with a murder investigation. Cell site data is simply the cell phone company's record of which cell phone tower a user connects to throughout the day when using their phone for phone calls, text messages, surfing the web or using apps like Facebook and Twitter. Augustine argued that police violated the Massachusetts state constitution's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. While federal courts faced with this argument under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> to the US Constitution have <a href="/hotline/2013/09/hanni-fakhoury-cell-phone.php">mostly rejected arguments</a> that a search warrant is needed to obtain cell site records, state courts are free to interpret their state constitution to provide greater privacy protection than the Fourth Amendment. Last year, the New Jersey Supreme Court believed a warrant was needed under state law for cell site data in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17491858830599072236&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">State v. Earls</a>.</p>

                <p>Massachusetts followed New Jersey's lead, requiring police to obtain a search warrant to access historical cell site records under state law. Extending its prior decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15413733525106553587&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Commonwealth v. Rousseau</a>&#8212;which held that a passenger in a car had standing to challenge pervasive GPS monitoring of the car even if they didn't own or operate the car&#8212;<span class="casename">Augustine</span> found people also have a right to be free from invasive, long term tracking of their movements through their cell phone, even when those movements are done in public places. </p>

                <p>While the commonwealth quibbled with whether cell tracking is as precise or accurate as GPS tracking of a car, the Supreme Judicial Court believed cell tracking implicated even greater privacy concerns than GPS tracking because unlike a device attached to a car, a cell phone is carried almost everywhere a person goes, even by their bedside at night. As a result, these records reveal a detailed and intimate portrait of a person's location over time, including a person's patterns of movements and whom they associate with. Indeed if the location information wasn't precise, there'd be no reason for the police to request it in the first place.</p>

                <p><strong>Texas: Cell Phones are Not the Legal Equivalent of a Pair of Pants</strong> </p>

                <p>A week after <span class="casename">Augustine</span>, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals decided <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=granville&hl=en&as_sdt=4,44&as_ylo=2014&case=10789203390855436030&scilh=0">State v. Granville</a>, which hinged in part on the question of whether a cell phone is the legal equivalent of a pair of pants. Local police officer arrested Granville, a high-school student, on a misdemeanor charge and booked him into the county jail. Three hours after his arrest, a different officer retrieved Granville's phone from the evidence locker and, without a warrant, looked through the contents of the phone for evidence of an unrelated crime. The state attempted to justify the search by claiming that, similar to clothing worn by an inmate, once the phone was in the control of the jail officials, Granville no longer had any expectation of privacy in its contents.</p>

                <p>Common sense says a cell phone and a pair of pants are not the same thing and thankfully, the high court agreed. The majority opinion noted that "given modern technology and the incredible amount of personal information stored and accessible on a cell phone," a phone was indeed not like a pair of pants and therefore people don't lose their expectation of privacy in the contents of the phone merely because it was stored in the jail's property room. </p>

                <p><strong>Washington: People Don't Assume the Risk Police Will Intercept Text Messages</strong></p>

                <p>The day after <span class="casename">Granville</span> was decided, the Washington Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=hinton&hl=en&as_sdt=4,48&as_ylo=2014&case=3477003458041840806&scilh=0">State v. Hinton</a> that police violated state law when, after seizing a cell phone from a suspect during a drug investigation, it reviewed old text messages and monitored and responded to incoming texts, pretending to be the suspect and arranging drug deals with the defendant Hinton. The state had argued that Hinton didn't have an expectation of privacy in the text messages once they were sent to the suspect's phone because he had assumed someone else could intercept the texts, or that the person they thought they were communicating with was really someone else. </p>

                <p>The court disagreed, explaining that the societal expectation that police won't intercept phone calls or postal letters extends to text messages. It noted, "unlike letters, which are generally delivered to the home where they remain protected from intrusion, text messages are delivered to a recipient's cell phone instantaneously and remain susceptible to exposure because of a cell phone's mobility." But just as putting a letter in the mail doesn't eliminate the sender's privacy interest in its contents, the same is true of text messages.</p>

                <p><strong>Technology Matters</strong></p>

                <p>All three of these cases accept the fact that technology changes have constitutional significance. These decisions appreciated the breadth of data revealed by and stored on a cell phone meant it was foolish to analogize to physical items like a physical GPS device, a pair of pants or a letter sent in the mail. As the US Supreme Court <a href="/hotline/2014/03/hanni-fakhoury-cell-phone-privacy.php">gets ready to decide</a> this term whether police can search a cell phone without a warrant incident to arrest&#8212;and as the challenges to the NSA's controversial surveillance practices work their way through the courts&#8212;these opinions provide a blueprint on how to treat the wealth of information stored in cell phones and other electronic devices. The nature of the item or the breadth of data being searched matters in determining what the reasonable scope of a search can be. Although it may be reasonable for the police to rummage through an inmate's clothing, it is a far different thing to rummage through their cell phone, which contains far more information than could ever be stored in the pockets of a pair of jeans.</p>

                <p>These cases also rejected the false notion that the mere act of exposing some information to others gives law enforcement free reign to seize and search through the reams of sensitive data emanating from and stored on cell phone. As constitutional challenges to new technologies have been raised in court, both the state and federal governments have raised the US Supreme Court's 1979 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3033726127475530815">Smith v. Maryland</a> to argue that people don't have an expectation of privacy in information turned over and exposed to others. But the capabilities of new technologies are requiring courts to not only confront these old decisions dealing with antiquated technologies, but more fundamentally require courts to reexamine what "exposure" means in the 21st century. </p>

                <p>A person driving home from work can reasonably be said to briefly expose their location to the driver next to them. But no driver expects they'll be followed in public for days, weeks or months on end, even if all of their driving is done in public. Similarly, a person may expose their backyard to fleeting glimpses by a low flying helicopter for a few minutes. You may expect your next-door neighbor to see you enter your home every once in a while. But no one expects to have a drone stealthily flying over their backyard with a high-powered camera, recording everything that occurs in your backyard. And you would certainly be bothered if you found a video camera pointed at your front door for six weeks, watching everyone who comes and goes from your house. </p>

                <p>In <span class="casename">Augustine</span>, the Supreme Judicial Court acknowledged this reality, finding the information at issue in <span class="casename">Augustine</span>&#8212;phone numbers a person dialed&#8212;was less revealing than the location information sought here. <span class="casename">Granville</span> and <span class="casename">Hinton</span> implicitly rejected <span class="casename">Smith</span>too, finding that privacy expectations existed even when the defendants had lost their ability to exclusively control the phone or text messages. Massachusetts, Texas and Washington got it right. Hopefully as more state and federal courts confront these types of issues, they will too.</p>

Heiden, Legal Director of the <a href="http://www.aclumaine.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Maine</a>, says that the Portland, Maine ordinance banning anyone from standing, sitting or loitering in any median strip is a content-based restriction that fails to comply with the First Amendment...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/zacharyheiden.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n <a href="http://www.aclumaine.org/sites/default/files/uploads/users/Zach/Cutting%20v.%20Portland.pdf">Cutting v. City of Portland</a> (PDF), the US District Court for the District of Maine permanently <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-rules-panhandling-ban-in-maine-unconstitutional.php">enjoined</a> a Portland, Maine city ordinance that prohibited people from being on the city's median strips. The ordinance banned anyone from standing, sitting or loitering in any median strip anywhere in the city (it defined a median strip as the paved or planted area dividing a road by direction of travel). The ban applied at all times and for all reasons (other than while crossing from one side of the street to the other). Portland's median strips vary in size from a few feet to approximately twenty-five yards in width. Historically, they have been used by activists holding political signs, by politicians and their supporters while holding or planting campaign signs and by people asking for charity (whether for themselves or for others). The court found that Portland's ordinance violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>.</p>

                <p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Maine and the law firm Goodwin Procter challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance on behalf of two activists who sometimes stand on median strips holding signs addressing timely matters of public concern (do not invade countries, do not torture prisoners, do work to eradicate economic inequality and so on) and a woman who, since becoming homeless, sometimes stands on median strips seeking charitable support from motorists. </p>

                <p>Both <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/310/88">holding signs</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/672">seeking alms</a> are expressive activities that are entitled to protection under the First Amendment, a point that many members of the Portland public were <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2013/07/15/news/portland/on-second-try-portland-approves-rule-blocking-panhandling-from-median-strips/">unwilling to acknowledge</a>. </p>

                <p>A central question posed in <span class="casename">Cutting</span> was what level of scrutiny to apply to the ordinance: if the ordinance was content-based, the court would apply strict scrutiny (which in all probability would be fatal), but if the ordinance was content-neutral, then a less searching scrutiny would apply (though the ordinance would still be unconstitutional because it was not narrowly tailored to address the government's asserted safety interest and did not leave open ample alternative means to reach the speakers' intended audience).</p>

                <p>The touchstone case for making that distinction is still <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=ward+v+rock+against+racism&hl=en&as_sdt=3,39&case=2205493593660669069&scilh=0">Ward v. Rock Against Racism</a> (though <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/12-1168">perhaps not for long</a>). <span class="casename">Ward</span> involved the constitutionality of anti-noise restrictions adopted by the New York Parks Department governing the sound amplification systems used at Central Park's Naumburg Bandshell. The bandshell is the site of numerous concerts during the warm months of the year, but the noise from some of these concerts tended to intrude upon the tranquility and peaceful enjoyment of the Sheep Meadow area of Central Park, which is a site traditionally reserved for quiet, contemplative activities. In order to balance the needs of both the bandshell listeners and the Sheep Meadow relaxers, the city adopted a rule that said that musical events at the bandshell had to use the city's sound-amplification equipment and sound technicians. Rock Against Racism, the sponsor of an annual concert at the bandshell, objected to this rule and filed suit challenging it on First Amendment grounds.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court rejected this challenge, holding that the regulation was simply a time, place and manner restriction that did not regulate the content of the expression. The government's original purpose (which the Court said is "controlling") was constraint on the volume of sound, not on expression. Content-neutral time, place and manner restrictions, such as the restriction upheld in <span class="casename">Ward</span>, need to be narrowly tailored to serve a "significant" government interest and need to leave open ample alternative channels of communication. In contrast, content-based restrictions need to pass strict scrutiny by being narrowly tailored to serve a "compelling" government interest and being the least restrictive means of achieving that interest.</p>

                <p>Government lawyers are generally careful to draft ordinances that do not make reference to the content of expression, and Portland's lawyers were no exception. In fact, the Portland ordinance did not make reference to expression at all&#8212;instead, it referred to the conduct of being on a median strip, whether for expressive or purely recreational purposes. The plaintiffs argued that the ordinances were motivated by a hostility to particular expressive content&#8212;that of panhandlers asking motorists for money&#8212;but proving purpose in the absence of textual evidence is difficult. </p>

                <p>What tipped the case for the plaintiffs in <span class="casename">Cutting</span> was an unwritten exception to the ordinance's general prohibition covering the placing and removing of campaign signs during election season. Because Portland ratified this exception in its pleadings, the court considered it part of the city's "authoritative construction of the ordinance." Portland allowed for the placement of signs bearing a message relating to an election but not other types of political signs (such as a sign relating to war or economic policy). This construction&#8212;"the favoring of campaign messages over all others," in the court's words&#8212;put the city on the wrong side of the content line, and in order to survive the city would have had to satisfy the most exacting scrutiny (which it could not do).</p>

                <p>Ordinances of this type have been debated and adopted with increasing frequency, and though the putative justification is safety, it is difficult to imagine that standing on median strips or in downtown areas has suddenly become more dangerous. More likely, many of these ordinances are motivated, at least in part, by a desire to minimize the appearance of poor people seeking charity in downtown commercial districts. </p>

                <p>The city of Worcester, Massachusetts for example, recently adopted an ordinance banning "aggressive solicitation" (which includes any manner of solicitation carried out within an hour of sunset) and sharply limiting standing or walking on a traffic island. That ordinance was challenged in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=thayer+v+city+of+worcester&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=6540208195414794227&scilh=0">Thayer v. City of Worcester</a>; the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts rejected a First Amendment challenge to that ordinance and the matter has been <a href="http://blogs.findlaw.com/first_circuit/2014/01/1st-cir-to-weigh-in-on-panhandling-ordinances-in-mass.html">appealed</a> to the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The court in <span class="casename">Thayer</span> treated the ordinance as content-neutral, though it is possible that the appeals court will have a different view of the matter. For one thing, the ordinance was adopted in the context of a substantial debate in Worcester about panhandling. In addition, the enforcement of the Worcester ordinance appears to suffer from the same content-dependent determinations. <a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/policysocial-context/23045-cities-attack-panhandling-compromise-free-speech-rights.html">Similar laws</a> have been adopted, or are being considered, in Boise, Idaho, Missoula, Montana, Parkersburg, West Virginia and Madison, Wisconsin.</p>

                <p>Though the <a href="http://www.dailybreeze.com/general-news/20120530/redondo-beach-man-wins-first-amendment-award-for-fighting-day-laborer-law">weight of authority</a> is against the constitutionality of these ordinances, their future is far from certain. At the public hearing for Portland's ordinance, one woman who had personal experience with homelessness and begging on the street acknowledged that it makes people uncomfortable to see poor people holding signs on median strips or asking for spare change on the sidewalks of downtown shopping districts. She asked the city council, and the people of Portland, however, to remember that life is much more uncomfortable for the person doing the asking.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.aviation.und.edu/Faculty/FacultyPages/vacek.aspx">Joseph J. Vacek</a> of the University of North Dakota School of Aerospace Sciences argues that the recent decision by an Administrative Law Judge of the NTSB that struck down the FAA's ban on the commercial use of drones for procedural reasons raises a larger issue concerning the FAA's authority to regulate low-altitude, non-navigable airspace that may usher in the legal use of commercial drones in the US ... <hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/josephvacek.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>R</strong></font>ecent advancements in technology have facilitated new uses for small drones which have captured public attention. Commercials depicting an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le46ERPMlWU">airborne package delivery</a> from an Amazon.com branded drone and a GPS-enabled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmHwXf8JUOw">beer delivery by drone</a> from Lakemaid Beer have stimulated much public comment. While airborne cargo services, autonomous flight and very small aircraft by themselves are old news in the discipline of aviation, in combination they represent a paradigm shift which the federal regulatory system governing aircraft and aviation have not yet fully comprehended. </p>

<p>Experimenters and hobbyists have assembled and flown small semi-autonomous aircraft of various shapes and sizes for years, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulators have officially ignored their activities&#8212;which are deemed "model aircraft" activities under a <a href="http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/0/1acfc3f689769a56862569e70077c9cc/$FILE/ATTBJMAC/ac91-57.pdf">1981 advisory notice</a> [PDF]&#8212;as long as the modelers fly low and avoid manned aircraft activities and airports. Fully autonomous flight has been around since WWII, when the first drones were developed by the military for aerial gunnery practice or weapons delivery.</p>

<p>The advent of remote sensing equipment&#8212;small and light enough to be carried on a small, remote controlled aircraft&#8212;and the concurrent development of more efficient batteries have led to commercial sales of relatively simple consumer-oriented <a href="http://www.amazon.com/UDI-2-4GHz-RC-Quadcopter-Camera/dp/B00D3IN11Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394628812&sr=8-1&keywords=drone">"flying cameras"</a> to very <a href="http://www.avinc.com/uas/small_uas/qube/">sophisticated drones</a> designed for surveillance use by police, carrying infrared or thermal sensing devices. The FAA&#8212;tasked with regulating air commerce and protecting the flying public and people on the ground under <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title49/pdf/USCODE-2011-title49-subtitleVII-partA-subparti-chap401-sec40103.pdf">49 USC 40103</a> [PDF]&#8212; has, since 2005, held that the commercial use of small drones is prohibited in US airspace absent special permission. That position was outlined in a policy document known in the aviation industry simply as 05-01&#8212;later as <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/jurist.org/viewer?url=http://rmgsc.cr.usgs.gov/uas/pdf/uas_guidance08-01.pdf">08-01</a> [PDF]. The only way a person was allowed to operate a drone&#8212;defined technically as an unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) or unmanned aircraft system (UAS)&#8212;was to <a href="http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=14153">apply</a> to the FAA's Unmanned Aircraft Program Office for a Certificate of Authorization (COA), which grants the special permission that the FAA determined necessary to operate a UAS in the US. In 2007, the FAA <a href="http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/uas/reg/media/frnotice_uas.pdf">issued</a> [PDF] a clarification of FAA policy in the Federal Register, declaring: <br />
<blockquote>People and companies other than modelers might be flying UAS with the mistaken understanding that they are legally operating under the authority of AC 91-57. AC 91-57 only applies to modelers, and thus specifically excludes its use by persons or companies for business purposes.</blockquote>But in order to obtain a COA, a person had to be affiliated with a public institution of some kind&#8212;like a university, a sheriff's department or the federal government. The result was a rash of rogue operators who, <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2014/03/drone-pilots-flying-high/">according</a> to the FAA, operated small drones for commercial purposes under the agency's radar&#8212;such as aerial photography, agricultural observations and advertising. One of those operators was Raphael Pirker.</p>

<p>Pirker&#8212;under the pseudonym "Trappy"&#8212;created <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZnJeuAja-4">videos</a> by flying drones at low altitudes and sold some of those videos. The FAA fined Pirker $10,000 for those videos in its first enforcement case related to unauthorized commercial use of small drones, alleging his flight violated Federal Aviation Regulations by flying close to people and structures at such a low altitude that it was dangerous. Certified pilots of manned aircraft occasionally engage in similar reckless behavior and receive similar sanctions from the FAA. If, for example, a private pilot in a small Cessna-type aircraft "buzzes" at low altitude at a friend's barbecue party, a similar enforcement case will result with the pilot's pilot certificate generally being suspended or revoked. In Pirker's case&#8212;since he did not possess a pilot certificate&#8212;the FAA's only option was a monetary fine.</p>

<p>Pirker, however, responded by arguing not that his flight wasn't dangerous to people or property on the ground, but that the rules the FAA purported to apply to him were not, in fact, valid rules. The crux of his argument was that the FAA's policies related to UAS were merely advisory and lacked the force of law because they were not made in accordance with the <a href="https://www.oalj.dol.gov/LIBAPA.HTM">Administrative Procedure Act's</a> (APA) requirement for a period of public notice-and-comment. </p>

<p>The FAA responded by arguing that since UAS are aircraft&#8212;which are <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div8&node=14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.1">defined</a> very broadly as "a device that is used or intended to be used for flight in the air"&#8212;they had the authority to regulate them, which they did by way of their policy documents. Pirker's arguments and the FAA's responses were styled as motions to an Administrative Law Judge of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and the judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/administrative-judge-strikes-down-faa-ban-on-commercial-drones.php">granted</a> with prejudice Pirker's motion to dismiss <a href="http://www.kramerlevin.com/files/upload/PirkerDecision.pdf">finding</a> [PDF] that the FAA's policies lacked the force of law since they had not been created in accordance with notice-and-comment rulemaking. The FAA has since <a href="http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=15894">announced</a> its intention to appeal the decision. Pirker also raised some interesting issues that&#8212;in this author's opinion&#8212;are far more momentous. The background issue that looms larger than rulemaking procedure was the substantive issue raised in the motions that the FAA is attempting to regulate airspace that is not "navigable."</p>

<p>While Pirker's motion only briefly addressed the "navigable airspace" issue, the FAA responded by affirmatively alleging that it has the power to regulate <u>all</u> airspace in the US, not just that which is defined as navigable. A series of Supreme Court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17209011020287234065">decisions</a> have roughly defined the boundaries on ownership of airspace&#8212;property owners own as much airspace above their property as they can reasonably use, and the air above is akin to a public highway that all persons have a right to transit. Additionally, zoning rules near airports defining approach and departure paths have been <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18119954310347127834&q=Griggs+v+Allegheny,+369+US+84+(1962)&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">held</a> as valid exercises of governmental police power. And while <a href="http://skyvector.com/">aeronautical charts</a> used by pilots define certain categories of airspace&#8212;some of which start at the ground&#8212;and establish the operating rules within them, no court has squarely addressed the question of whether the FAA's designation and current claim of jurisdiction over all airspace in the US goes beyond its statutory authority to regulate only navigable airspace. </p>

<p>Before small drones were available on the market, that question was not ripe because relatively few activities used "non-navigable" airspace close to the ground. Now, it appears small drones operated at those very low altitudes have become useful tools in many contexts: airborne photography, property surveying and agricultural uses, among others. If the FAA stands on its assertion that it has the power to regulate all devices used or intended to be used in the air at all altitudes, it will collide with precedent defining property rights and what constitutes reasonable regulation of the use of that property. </p>

<p>Pirker may avoid his $10,000 civil penalty with his procedural argument, but his case represents a new aviation archetype to which the FAA must adapt. It will not be enough for FAA to quickly enact their UAS policies into binding rules. As jet transport aircraft turned high altitude blue sky into a public highway, small UAS are similarly changing low adjacent altitudes into something new.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Balkees Jarrah of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> makes the case for why the US should publicly support a referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>R</strong></font>ecently, US Secretary of State John Kerry reported that President Barack Obama had asked his top aides for <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-soliciting-new-policy-options-for-syria-from-top-aides-as-peace-talks-flounder/2014/02/14/6a8386fe-95b2-11e3-afce-3e7c922ef31e_story.html">new policy options</a> to address the situation in Syria. Though Kerry did not elaborate what exactly was under consideration, one option the White House has not pursued&#8212;and should&#8212;is to support referring the situation in Syria to the<a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx"> International Criminal Court</a> (ICC).</p>

                <p>The Obama administration has repeatedly said that those responsible for <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/war-crimes-experts-find-clear-evidence-of-syria-violations.php ">serious crimes</a> in Syria must be held accountable. Until now, the US government's approach to <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/hrw-us-undermining-efforts-to-try-assad-regime-in-global-court.php">justice</a> has been focused on <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/218664.htm">supporting</a> <a href="http://www.syriaaccountability.org/">documentation</a> and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304027204579332910328812046">investigative initiatives</a>. These efforts are important and will no doubt be vital to future domestic and international accountability processes. Nevertheless, with the Syrian crisis entering a fourth year, it is long overdue for the United States to raise the stakes and support a concrete accountability measure that could begin work immediately and potentially help deter further abuses.</p>

                <p>The horror that the Syrian people have endured over the last three years is well-known. Human Rights Watch has <a href="http://www.hrw.org/middle-eastn-africa/syria">extensively documented</a> abuses by government and pro-government forces and concluded that they have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes. The government continues to carry out indiscriminate air and artillery strikes on residential areas and to arbitrarily detain, torture and extra-judicially execute civilians and combatants. Human Rights Watch has also documented war crimes and crimes against humanity by some opposition groups, including the indiscriminate use of car bombs and mortars, kidnapping, torture and extrajudicial executions.</p>

                <p>These abuses take place in a pervasive climate of impunity. Syrian authorities have shown no interest whatsoever in ensuring credible justice for past and ongoing grave human rights crimes. Predictably, the failure to hold those responsible for these crimes to account has only fueled further atrocities by all sides. Indeed, the latest <a href=" http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx">report</a> of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria stated plainly that "[t]he warring parties do not fear being held accountable for their acts."</p>

                <p>As a permanent international court with a mandate to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity when national authorities are unable or unwilling to do so, the ICC was created to address exactly the type of situation that exists in Syria today. However because Syria is not a member of the treaty that established the court, the UN Council would have to give it jurisdiction through what's known as an "ICC referral."</p>

                <p>While a <a href="http://www.news.admin.ch/NSBSubscriber/message/attachments/29293.pdf">significant cross-section of UN members</a> (PDF) have expressed support for the court's involvement, including nine out of fifteen current Security Council members, Russia and China are likely to oppose an ICC referral. For its part, the US, one of the most powerful potential proponents of ICC involvement, has not backed a role for the court.</p>

                <p>Instead, US officials are <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/u-s--war-crimes-ambassador--assad-%E2%80%98absolutely%E2%80%99-should-be-tried-for-war-crimes---231439748.html">exploring options to establish an ad hoc tribunal for Syria despite the practical, political, and financial <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/A.HRC.22.59_en.pdf">difficulties</a> (PDF) involved in starting from scratch to create a complex institution that could deliver credible prosecutions. Moreover, the delay involved in setting up such an entity from the ground up would remove any potential deterrent effect that could be achieved by examining crimes in Syria now, as abuses persist. US officials themselves recognize that such an endeavor takes a long time&#8212;something the Syrian people don't have.</p>

                <p>By contrast, ICC involvement in the course of the ongoing conflict in Syria would send a clear message to all parties that grave crimes will lead to serious consequences. It would put those in senior positions, no matter their political allegiance, on notice that they could be held responsible for crimes they order or commit, or for crimes they fail to prevent or punish. Regardless of the outcome of the conflict, they would face the threat of prosecution indefinitely. <br />
                    US officials may see supporting an ICC referral as a vain effort given that Russia would be likely to veto such a move in the Security Council. Russia has described the effort to seek an ICC referral as <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/15/syria-crisis-russia-idUSL6N0AKCNB20130115">"ill-timed and counterproductive"</a> though a referral would answer head-on Russia's concerns over rebel atrocities since the court would have a mandate to examine crimes by all sides.</p>

                <p>However, Russian opposition should not be accepted as a permanent state of affairs nor a justification for policy decisions. As the situation on the ground shifts in Syria, we have seen changes in Russia's position on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/un-approval-near-on-syrian-chemical-arms/2013/09/27/da007544-27aa-11e3-9372-92606241ae9c_story.html">chemical weapons</a> and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/22/us-syria-crisis-un-idUSBREA1L0OV20140222">humanitarian access</a> to people in need. Moreover, there hasn't been enough pressure on Russia to change its stance on the court. It would be a mistake to preclude circumstances in which Russia would allow a referral by the Security Council.</p>

                <p>No doubt Washington's vocal support for ICC involvement would encourage close allies on the Security Council and raise pressure on Moscow to change its obstructive posture. That could contribute to the momentum needed for action, but more fundamentally, a US decision to get behind an ICC referral would signal that the administration is serious about its commitment to end impunity in Syria and would send a message that accountability must be squarely on the agenda. It would also underscore Washington's commitment to impartial justice.</p>

                <p>The Obama administration has afforded Russia much more space by failing, both in Washington and at the UN, to come out in favor of ICC involvement. An <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByLPNZ-eSjJdX29vd2Y3WlNxQWc/view?sle=true&pli=1">early</a> draft of the Security Council resolution on the use of chemical weapons in Syria included an ICC referral, but it was removed apparently at US insistence before even being presented to the Russians during the negotiations on the text. Regrettably, this meant Russia was spared having to justify its opposition to a referral.</p>

                <p>US officials may be further disinclined to back a role for the court due to concerns it may complicate the (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/13/us-syria-crisis-un-idUSBREA2C1VV20140313">currently stalled</a>) Geneva talks and that the court would be an obstacle to any peace deal. However, the record from other conflicts indicates that criminal indictments of senior political, military and rebel leaders can actually <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/06/syria-path-justice">strengthen peace efforts</a> by delegitimizing and marginalizing those who stand in the way of resolving the conflict. For example, the indictments of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Radovan+Karadzic">Radovan Karadzic</a>, the Bosnian Serbs' wartime political leader, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ratko+Mladic ">Ratko Mladic</a>, their military commander, by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia are credited with keeping them sidelined during the Dayton peace talks, which led to the end of the Bosnian war. This was also the lesson from the experience with the former Liberian president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=charles+taylor">Charles Taylor</a>. The unsealing of the arrest warrant against him at the opening of talks to end the Liberian civil war was ultimately viewed as helpful in moving negotiations forward.</p>

                <p>To be clear, US support for an ICC referral will not necessarily make it happen nor is the ICC a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/12/17/syria-holistic-approach-needed-justice ">comprehensive</a> solution to impunity in Syria, but it is a start. The stakes are extremely high&#8212;both for the victims of atrocities there and for global efforts to curtail impunity for grave crimes. At such a moment, substantive action is vital. By coming out in support of an ICC referral as so many countries around the world have already done, the Obama administration would send an important message on how the Security Council should be reacting to the deteriorating situation in Syria. Otherwise, the White House's declarations on justice risk becoming empty rhetoric.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.avemarialaw.edu/faculty/profile/Kevin.Govern">Kevin Govern</a> of Ave Maria School of Law considers the life and times of the late First Amendment advocate-antagonist Fred Phelps ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/kgovern2.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>J</strong></font>URIST has <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=westboro">previously examined</a> the strident <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> struggles of the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), founded in Topeka, KS in 1955, that became notorious for picketing military funerals, public events and businesses, attacking Christians, Jews, gays and others with hateful signs and shouted slurs. That church's charismatically confounding founder, Fred Waldron Phelps, died at age 84 on March 19, 2014. Phelps ironically <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/20/us/westboro-church-founder-dead/">turned down</a> a West Point appointment and a career in the military, to serve as civil rights advocate, only to be <a href="http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/wbc/disbarred.html?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&xpicked=3&item=WBC">disbarred</a> in his home state for having "little regard for the ethics of his profession," and then served as an ordained minister of God to preach a false gospel of hate. With his passing, perhaps America will find relief from his outrageous efforts to defame and outrage others while seeking the protection of the First Amendment.</p>

<p>The Phelps saga became particularly poignant for me almost exactly nine years before Phelps' demise, when I served as a casualty assistance officer for the family of a fallen Soldier. In my 23 years of being an Army officer, the most difficult&#8212;and important&#8212;task in peacetime and in war that I ever performed was aiding and comforting the family of Cpl. Manny Lopez. Lopez died in Baghdad, Iraq, on April 12, 2005, when a rocket-propelled grenade struck his Humvee.</p>

<p>As I have <a href="http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2010/oct/21/guest-commentary-free-speech-doesnt-include-disrup/?print=1">reflected</a> on this in print in the past, it took many days and the help of dozens of federal, state and local officials of many ranks and responsibilities to organize proper and dignified honors for Lopez, as our collective token of appreciation for his honorable and faithful service. I will never forget the hundreds who came in quiet respect from far and wide to commemorate his life, and to show their pride in their departed friend and loved one.</p>

<p>That is why the case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2981429692939250360">Snyder v. Phelps</a> especially gripped me five years later as a citizen, a lawyer and as a recently retired Soldier. The US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in 2010 on what was&#8212;and continues to be the most controversial First Amendment "freedom of speech" case of our times. It involved Phelps' WBC, and one of many military funerals they have chosen to picket out of the "922 cities" visited by the WBC to date, or the "52,337 pickets "over the "6,801... soldiers that God has killed in Iraq and Afghanistan," as according to the WBC's website. </p>

<p>On March 10, 2006, Phelps and his church picketed the funeral of Lance Cpl. Matthew A. Snyder, a Marine who died in combat in Iraq on March 3, 2006&#8212;nearly a year after Lopez. Picket signs included, but were not limited to, the following quotes: "Semper Fi F** (anti-Gay epithet)," "Maryland Taliban," "Matt in Hell," "You're Going to Hell" and "God Hates You."</p>

<p>Phelps' picketing presence created what local law enforcement considered a credible threat of violence. Snyder family attorneys cited how, at no small cost to the taxpayers, a SWAT team, a command post, local, county and state police, a traffic engineer, communication clerks, the fire department and ambulances were called to the funeral area on standby to prepare for violence that might follow from Phelps' inflammatory efforts. Through counsel, the Snyder family also noted how Phelps disrupted the funeral, prevented normal access to the church campus and "changed the entire atmosphere of the religious services for Snyder and his family into a 'negative and circus-like atmosphere during a solemn and religious occasion.'" The protests also purportedly led to an elementary school lockdown across the street from the funeral site.</p>

<p>As a result, legislatures around the nation worked on enacting laws to ban funeral protests. The Snyder family also sued; and in 2007 a federal jury <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/federal-jury-orders-military-funeral.php">found</a> Phelps, his church and his two daughters liable for defamation, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. That court awarded Snyder's father $2.9 million in compensatory damages, $6 million in punitive damages for invasion of privacy and an additional $2 million for causing emotional distress. Phelps and his co-litigants successfully appealed that this speech was protected under the First Amendment. Incurring further expense and effort, the Snyder family appealed, then successfully <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-to-rule-on-picketing.php">received a grant of certiorari</a> for the US Supreme Court to hear this case.</p>

<p>In 2011, our Supreme Court justices considered not only the words, but also the context of what Phelps and his disciples said&#8212;and where and how they said it. Our nation's highest court determined whether freedom of religion and assembly is subordinate to&#8212;or coequal with&#8212;the freedom of speech. Its collective wisdom considered whether the Snyder family was effectively a "captive" audience and could not escape the epithets that Phelps specifically targeted against the Snyder family, funeral attendees and the public at large.</p>

<p>The nine justices weighed the value of unfettered free speech against the intentional harm inflicted. The court judged the liberty at stake against Phelps' disruption to the Snyders' mourning process. Unfortunately for families whose sons, fathers, daughters and mothers gave what Abraham Lincoln called "<a href="http://www.thelastfullmeasure.com/gettysburg_address.htm">the last full measure of devotion</a>," and as a further insult to the bereaved and the aggrieved who suffered Phelps' incendiary invective, the court blithely <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-allows-military-funeral-protests.php">ruled</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and&#8212;as it did here&#8212;inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we have chosen a different course&#8212;to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate. That choice requires that we shield Westboro from tort liability for its picketing in this case. </blockquote>

<p>A lone voice of reason, that of Justice Alito, rang out from a moral high ground to pronounce that "[o]ur profound national commitment to free and open debate is not a license for the vicious verbal assault that occurred in this case," and while "[t]he Court [held] that the First Amendment protected respondents' right to brutalize Mr. Snyder, [he, Alito] cannot agree."</p>

<p>I thank our Members of Congress for passing the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1627enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1627enr.pdf">Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012</a>, and especially Sec. 601's Prohibition on disruptions of funerals of members or former members of the Armed Forces, finding the inspiration and the authority under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Article I, section 8</a>, paragraphs 1, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 18, for the freedom from disruption to: <br />
 <br />
<blockquote>Provide for the common defense, raise and support armies, provide and maintain a navy, make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces, and provide for organizing and governing such part of the militia as may be employed in the service of the United States.</blockquote></p>

<p>I earnestly pray for Fred Phelps, and those misled by him. More fervently, I pray for the repose of the souls of Cpls. Lopez, Snyder and all of our fallen heroes, that their sacrifices might serve as exemplary precedent for all Americans.</p>

However, while some women rejoiced upon being able to receive this contraception, many women quickly discovered that they were not so lucky. Although the contraception mandate touts its program as "equal and free," the reality is that a woman's ability to obtain free contraception depends on who her employer is.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish equal access to contraception, the contraception mandate (one of the provisions of the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr3590/text">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a>, also known as Obamacare) requires employers to provide employee health insurance plans with free contraceptive services. Employers that do not provide such plans are fined $100 a day per employee. Although on its face the mandate seems to accomplish the objective of free contraception, it falls short in actuality. This is because certain religious employers, as well as employers that employ less than 50 employees or that have grandfathered health insurance plans, have all been exempted from the mandate and thereby do not have to provide free contraception to their employees.</p>

<p>However, the contraception mandate was created to ensure that all women would have access to free contraception, since most women cannot afford it. Unfortunately, contraception is prohibitively expensive and women desperately need it for a variety of preventive measures. Moreover, women use contraception so that they can accomplish their goals without having to worry that an unplanned pregnancy will postpone such goals.</p>

<p>Although the contraception mandate has been ineffective in providing free contraception to all women, the Obama administration can still accomplish this goal by implementing three alternative plans. First, the Obama administration can incentivize pharmaceutical companies to provide free yearly supplies of contraception to doctors, through the use of tax credits. This would eliminate the need for contraception prescriptions, as doctors would just provide their patients with free contraception. Further, the tax credits will enable the pharmaceutical companies to deduct the cost of the free contraception from their tax bill on a dollar for dollar basis.</p>

<p>Second, all women should be able to receive free contraception from Title X clinics, such as Planned Parenthood, which are designed to provide free contraception to women. However, currently by law, priority has to be given to low-income, uninsured women. To expand the reach, the Obama administration can require that Title X clinics treat all women equally, regardless of income status. Further, the clinics should receive additional federal funding so they have the financial capacity to provide all women with free contraception.</p>

<p>Lastly, although there are over 4,000 clinics and centers supported by Title X, not all women have access to a Title X clinic. Therefore, other clinics and healthcare centers should also be able to provide women with free contraception. To make this possible, the Obama administration can make these clinics and healthcare centers eligible for the 340B federal drug-pricing program. Being a part of the 340B drug-pricing program enables the clinics and healthcare centers to buy contraception at nominal prices, so they in turn can provide free contraception to anyone who needs it.</p>

<p>Implementing one of these alternative solutions would guarantee all women access to free contraception, regardless of their employer, thus fulfilling the Obama administration's promise of equal access to free contraception for all women.</p>

		<title>Criminalization of Defamation in Ukraine: A Step Towards Europe?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Pavlo Malyuta, <a href="http://ukma.edu.ua/eng/">National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy</a> Class of 2016, comments on the passage of new Ukrainian laws that restrict fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and assembly ... <hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>O</strong></font>n January 16, 2014 the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a number of controversial laws and by January 17, 2014 they were signed by the Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. These acts received a great deal of criticism because deputies failed to follow the proper procedure for their approval and because the provisions of the acts restrict fundamental constitutional rights and freedoms, particularly the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of speech. One of the laws contains an <a href="http://www.oscepa.org/news-a-media/press-releases/1473-osce-pa-president-expresses-concern-over-legislation-restricting-protests-recriminalizing-defamation-in-ukraine">amendment</a> to the <a href="http://legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/16257/preview">Criminal Code of Ukraine</a> which reads as follows:<blockquote>Defamation ... should be punishable by a fine up to 50 tax-free minimum incomes, or community service for a term up to 200 hours, or correctional labor for a term up to one year. Defamation in the product that is shown publicly, in the media or on the Internet should be punishable by a fine of 50 to 300 tax-free minimum incomes, or community service for a term of 150 to 240 hours, or correctional labor for a term up to one year. Defamation accompanied with charges of a grievous or special grievous offense shall be punishable by correctional labor for a term of one to two years, or imprisonment for a term of up to two years.</blockquote>Thus, Ukraine re-criminalized defamation after it had been de-criminalized in 2001. The drafters of the amendment hypocritically claim that it is supposed to align the provisions of Ukrainian legislation with European standards. They argue that in 21 states of Europe, defamation is recognized as a criminal offense. However, they are turning a blind eye to the fact that in most countries such laws are rarely applied and "European standards" are, in fact, completely different.</p>

<p>Many human rights institutions, including the Council of Europe and the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression, have called for the decriminalization of defamation. On October 4, 2007, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/main.asp?Link=/documents/adoptedtext/ta07/eres1577.htm">Resolution 1577</a> entitled Towards Decriminalization of Defamation in which it exhorted the member states to "abolish prison sentences for defamation without delay" and stressed that "[e]very case of imprisonment of a media professional is an unacceptable hindrance to freedom of expression and entails that ... journalists have a sword of Damocles hanging over them."  </p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/cdmsi/CDMSI(2012)Misc11_en%20Defamation%20study.pdf">document</a> investigating ECHR case law on defamation practices provides insight into standards that Ukrainian law should strive to follow. Ukrainian Law "On the Implementation of Decisions and Application of the Case-Law of European Court of Human Rights" implies that Ukrainian legislation should be compatible with ECHR practice. So, it is necessary to take a look at its decisions concerning defamation. In such cases (regarding remarks not containing any hate speech or incitement to violence), it has been stressed by the court that the mere fact that a sanction is of a criminal nature has in itself a disproportionate chilling effect. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-67816">Cumpana and Mazare v. Romania</a> the ECHR noted that "[t]hough sentencing is in principle a matter for the national courts, the court considers that the imposition of a prison sentence for a press offense will be compatible with journalists' freedom of expression as guaranteed by article 10 of the convention only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been seriously impaired, as, for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence." Even suspended sentences were considered by the ECHR as unnecessary. For instance, in <a href="http://echr.ketse.com/doc/26680.95-en-20000718/view/">Şener v. Turkey</a> the court deemed that the decision of the Istanbul State Security Court to suspend the imposition of a final sentence on condition that the journalist did not commit any further offense as an editor within three years had the effect of restricting the applicant's work and reducing the ability to offer the public views which have their place in a public debate. </p>

<p>Pursuant to the amendment, the most severe punishment is applied to defamation accompanied with charges of a grievous or special grievous offense. This charge is punishable by correctional labor for a term of one to two years, or imprisonment for a term of up to two years. The determination of what is a "grievous or special grievous" offense is often manipulated to lessen punishments of officials' wrongdoing. It is commonly known that the level of corruption in Ukraine is extremely high. In the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index 2013, Ukraine is ranked 144 out of 177 countries. According to the Criminal Code of Ukraine, certain crimes of corruption could be ranked as grievous or special grievous offenses. Thus, it seems that one of the purposes of this law is to prevent the exposure of official wrongdoing and corruption. The majority of cases will certainly be brought by government officials, civil servants and prominent businessmen, who will use the law as a protection from disclosure of certain shameful facts. </p>

<p>Interestingly, in the <a href="http://jurist.org/dateline/doc_288429.pdf">explanatory note</a> to the law it is stated that one of the dangers of spreading such phenomenon as defamation in Ukraine is "undermining the authority of the public bodies." It is clear that defamation laws cannot be justified when their purpose is to protect the reputation of public authorities. In this regard it is appropriate to pay attention to ECHR considerations: "[a]lthough the Contracting States are permitted, or even obliged ... to regulate the exercise of freedom of expression, they must not do so in a manner that unduly deters the media from fulfilling their role of alerting the public to apparent or suspected misuse of public power."</p>

<p>According to the amendment, punishments provided for the defamation on the internet and in the media are the same. However, the Special Rapporteur emphasized that the unique characteristics of the internet give the defamed individual the ability to exercise his/her right of reply instantly to restore the harm caused. Thus, types of sanctions which may be deemed legitimate and proportionate for traditional media are often not so for to the internet. The drafters of the law should have taken into account the specifics of Internet publications and established different punishments. </p>

<p>Furthermore, it is well established in case-law of the ECHR that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider when applied to public figures than for private individuals. It would be logical to differentiate the sanctions on the basis of category of person defamed. However, it contradicts the whole purpose of the law which is to decrease the number of journalistic investigations concerning crimes committed by officials. One hopeful deterrent inherent in the law is that the possibility of being prosecuted, arrested by the police and sentenced will decrease the number of publications concerning the misuse of power by public authorities. </p>

<p>Ironically, Ukraine was one of the first countries among participants of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to decriminalize defamation and protect free speech. Now, the current government is attempting to stifle the EuroMaidan protests and passing laws that restrict fundamental rights, including freedom of expression.</p>

<p>Since the law has been <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-pm-steps-down-parliament-repeals-anti-protest-laws.php">repealed</a>, maybe it is appropriate to a note in the end: "The article was prepared just after the adoption of the discussed Law. On the 28 January, 2014 the Supreme Council of Ukraine repealed a number of 'dictatorship laws,' including one that provided for the criminalization of defamation."</p>

Wurie...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>O</strong></font>n Tuesday, April 29, the US Supreme Court will hear argument in the case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16084637220099838131">United States v. Wurie</a> involving the search incident to arrest exception to the Fourth Amendment as it pertains to cell phones taken from the person of an arrestee. </p>

<p><strong>Factual Background</strong></p>

<p>Brima Wurie was arrested under suspicion of selling narcotics in South Boston. He was brought to the police station where officers removed a set of keys, two cell phones and $1,275 from his pockets. Prior to Wurie's booking, officers realized that one of the phones taken from him had been ringing. The name of the caller was displayed as "My house." Officers opened the phone in order to obtain the number associated with "My house." After obtaining the number and running it through an online white pages directory, officers went to the address. They entered the house to freeze the building and give themselves time to obtain a warrant. After the warrant was issued, officers searched the home and found 215 grams of cocaine and a firearm. </p>

<p>The US District Court for the District of Massachusetts denied a motion to suppress the evidence, finding the search of Wurie's cell phone reasonable under the search incident to arrest exception to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment.</a> Wurie appealed and the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed the lower court's holding and found that the evidence should have been suppressed. In doing so, the First Circuit held that warrantless searches of cell phones are categorically unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The government petitioned the US Supreme Court for <em>certiorari</em>, which was granted January 17, 2014.</p>

<p><strong><span class="casename">Chimel v. California</span> and the Search-Incident-to-Arrest Exception<br />
</strong></p>

<p>The search-incident-to-arrest exception to the Fourth Amendment has been adjudicated many times in front of the Supreme Court and other lower courts. One of the most cited &#8212; and relevant &#8212; decisions is <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7674807914957393039">Chimel v. California.</a> In deciding if a search incident to arrest was reasonable, the court articulated two criteria to make such a determination. A warrantless search would be reasonable if it was conducted (1) "to search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee's person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction" or (2) to search "the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary items." </p>

<p>The court reiterated the importance of the <span class="casename">Chimel</span> factors some 40 years later in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4755468061403609564">Arizona v. Gant</a>. The court held a warrantless search of an arrestee's vehicle was unreasonable once the arrestee had been fully detained. Following the court's rationale in <span class="casename">Chimel</span> and <span class="casename">Gant</span>, an object will not meet the required justification to be a lawful search incident to arrest once it has been reduced to the exclusive control of officers and it is determined not to pose a threat to safety. Surely an officer can check to make sure the cell phone is not a stun gun as cell phone shaped stun guns can be purchased. Once the object is in the exclusive control of an officer and determined not to pose a threat, there is generally no potential for the destruction of evidence. Therefore, justification under <span class="casename">Chimel</span> will not be present. </p>

<p>A modern cell phone presents an interesting difficulty under the <span class="casename">Chimel</span> test because it can be remotely erased through applications such as Apple's "Find my iPhone." With the press of a few buttons from a remote location, an accomplice could erase a phone and destroy all evidence contained within. In the time it would take police to get a warrant, an accomplice could execute a previously arranged contingency plan to destroy the evidence on a phone. </p>

<p>Suppose Wurie had pre-arranged with the person associated with the number "My house" to call him every minute that he was not home on time. Further suppose that if he does not answer after three attempts, the orders would be to execute a remote wipe of the cell phone. The police would have no idea exigent circumstances existed until it was too late. </p>

<p>The government contends, and the dissent below agrees, that a cell phone &#8212; as a class of object &#8212; meets the <span class="casename">Chimel</span> requirements for warrantless searches because of the aforementioned threats of evidence loss. The First Circuit answers this concern by suggesting three possibilities to combat this. First, they suggest turning off the phone or removing its battery as a preventative measure against remote wiping. This may not work in all &#8212; or even most &#8212; instances because the "Find my iPhone" application can be set to erase the phone as soon as it is powered back on. Even if a warrant were obtained in the mean time, the information would be lost as soon as police try to re-power the phone. </p>

<p>Second, the court suggests placing the phone in a Faraday enclosure &#8212; essentially a device designed to block incoming signals. This solution fails for the same reasons as suggestion one; as soon as the device is removed from the enclosure, it could be erased.</p>

<p>Third, the court suggests mirroring the phone to a computer so that if it is remotely wiped, the data will still be accessible. This seems possible, but it may entail actions that are commensurate to a search in that the information being copied would likely be visible on the screen of the computer. Further, the phone could be remotely wiped while this process is taking place. </p>

<p>A suggestion the court did not seem to consider is that the police simply put the phone into airplane mode. This would disable the incoming signal, breaking any connection "Find my iPhone" could make with the device. This appears to be the most effective means of preserving the device. There is an issue of when the phone is password protected. This will remain for the Court to solve. 	 </p>

<p><strong>The Fight Over a Bright-Line Rule</strong></p>

<p><span class="casename">US v. Wurie</span> holds particular significance in the modern world because of the amount of people with cell phones. Should the court rule that police are able to search cell phones incident to arrest, there must be limits placed on what data is accessible. Officers should not be able to go on a fishing expedition within the cell phone of a person simply because they were arrested. This unbridled discretion seems similar to the general warrants the founding fathers so adamantly rejected in the Fourth Amendment. </p>

<p>The question then becomes where the court should draw a line against the warrantless searches of cell phones incident to arrest. A bright-line rule categorically barring warrantless searches of cell phones, as imposed by the First Circuit, seems contrary to the analysis of what is reasonable. "The <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16128185020980229395">constitutional validity</a> of a warrantless search is pre-eminently the sort of question which can only be decided in the concrete factual context of the individual case." The First Circuit held that <span class="casename">Chimel</span> justification must be present for every category of item searched. This would require that the government prove that all cell phone searches incident to arrest are reasonable. </p>

<p>Judge Posner, writing for the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2701408392642022333">US v. Flores-Lopez</a>, provides some insight into a possible alternative to a bright-line rule. He writes, "[i]f police are entitled to open a pocket diary to copy the owner's address, they should be entitled to turn on a cell phone to learn its number. If allowed to leaf through a pocket address book, as they are, they should be entitled to read the address book in a cell phone." Such a balancing test seems reasonable, as it would curtail police discretion to fit with established case law. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Privacy interests of the person whose property is searched and police duty to prevent and solve crime are at the heart of Fourth Amendment cases. Warrantless searches incident to arrest bring this clash even more to the forefront. Ultimately, the court will weigh these conflicting interests in handing down a decision. The search incident to arrest exception to the Fourth Amendment has long been adjudicated in the American legal system. With <span class="casename">US v. Wurie</span>, this long history will gain another page.</p>

		<title>Is Dragnet Surveillance Constitutional?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Alex Abdo of the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) explains the constitutional issues surrounding dragnet surveillance and why the ACLU and others are correct in challenging the broad surveillance...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/alexabdo.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>E</strong></font>ver since <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Edward+Snowden">Edward Snowden</a> exposed the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency's</a> (NSA) sweeping surveillance of US citizens and residents, our country has been engaged in a historic debate about privacy in the digital age. The centerpiece of that debate is a question that has the potential to shape the meaning of privacy in this country for decades to come: does the Constitution permit the NSA to collect the phone records of millions of innocent Americans every single day? </p>

                <p>The government thinks so, based on a US Supreme Court case from 1979 called <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3033726127475530815&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Smith v. Maryland</a>. Given the importance of that case to the ongoing debate, it's worth asking whether <span class="casename">Smith</span> actually answers the question raised by the NSA's unprecedented surveillance program.</p>

                <p>The question is important in part because it reflects a fundamental shift in the way that the intelligence agencies do their business: from targeted collection to bulk collection. However it is critical for yet another reason: at stake are not just our phone records, but every digital track we leave as we browse the internet, communicate with loved ones, or even just carry around our increasingly nosy phones. Should the NSA have access to <em>all</em> of that information every single day about every single American?</p>

                <p>Within a week of the disclosure of the NSA's phone-records program, the ACLU and others filed lawsuits challenging the program. Most recently, Senator Rand Paul <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/rand-paul-files-complaint-over-nsa-surveillance-program.php">joined</a> the fray with a class action on behalf of all Americans. </p>

                <p>The challenges differ in various ways, but central to each is the key question of whether the Supreme Court effectively approved the dragnet collection of our phone records in <span class="casename">Smith</span>. Two federal judges have already issued dueling opinions on that question. One&#8212;Judge Richard J. Leon&#8212;<a href="/paperchase/2014/01/gathering-phone-records-unlawful.php">declared</a> what is perhaps intuitive to many: that bulk collection of the records of innocent Americans likely violates the Constitution, <span class="casename">Smith</span> notwithstanding. The other&#8212;Judge William H. Pauley III&#8212;<a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-nsa-data-collection-legal-and-useful.php">countered</a> that the phone-records program is unquestionably constitutional under <span class="casename">Smith</span>. </p>

                <p>So which is it? Does <span class="casename">Smith</span> justify the NSA's dragnet collection of every American's phone records (and perhaps every American's bank records, credit-card statements, and internet and email records)? </p>

                <p>The answer is "no." Here's why.</p>

                <p>In <span class="casename">Smith</span>, the Baltimore police suspected that Michael Lee Smith was making threatening and obscene phone calls to a woman he had robbed days earlier. To confirm their suspicions, they asked Smith's telephone company to install a "pen register" on his line to record the numbers he dialed. After just a few days, the pen register confirmed that, sure enough, Smith was the culprit. </p>

                <p>He was convicted, he appealed, and the Supreme Court for the first time faced the question of whether the warrantless use of a pen register on a criminal suspect violated the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that it did not, because&#8212;in the court's estimation&#8212;individuals do not expect privacy in the telephone numbers that they dial.</p>

                <p>That's what the Supreme Court held: that an individual had no expectation of privacy in the numbers that he dialed over the course of several days.</p>

                <p>Here's what the court did <span class="casename">not</span> hold: that the government may, therefore, record the phone numbers that every American dials for all time.</p>

                <p>The distinction is important. It confirms one predicate of Leon's ruling, that <span class="casename">Smith</span> does not&#8212;in the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/br13-09-primary-order.pdf">words</a> (PDF) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court&#8212;"squarely control" the legality of the NSA's program. In other words, the Supreme Court simply has not decided whether the mass, suspicionless collection of millions of innocent Americans' phone records is constitutional.</p>

                <p>Of course, even the government concedes that the Supreme Court has not actually answered the precise question that the NSA's phone-records program raises. What it argues, instead, is that if you have no right to privacy in your phone records for a few days, you have no right to privacy in your phone records for five years. That is to say, the government argues that zero plus zero equals zero.</p>

                <p>Sounds reasonable, right? The problem is that our constitutional right to privacy is not a mathematical equation. Just as grains of sand piled up eventually form a mountain, so too can the accumulation of seemingly insignificant privacy invasions eventually trigger the Constitution's protections. The Supreme Court has made that clear on several occasions.</p>

                <p>Take the case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2281447873975736215">United States v. Knotts</a> from 1983, which involved the use of a beeper to track the car of a suspected manufacturer of illicit drugs. Based in part on <span class="casename">Smith</span>, the Supreme Court held that the warrantless tracking of a suspect as he moves in public does not violate the Constitution, because Americans do not expect their public movements to remain private.</p>

                <p>Here's the critical part: the court made clear that its ruling on the tracking of a single person's location for a short period of time could not be mathematically converted into a formula for pervasive surveillance:<blockquote>[I]f such dragnet-type law enforcement practices ... should eventually occur, there will be time enough then to determine whether different constitutional principles may be applicable.</blockquote></p>

                <p>In other words, dragnet surveillance is different. When it comes to privacy, zero plus zero does <em>not</em> always equal zero. And that makes sense. When you share bits and pieces of your private life with others, that's not the same as sharing everything with everyone all at once. If that logic sounds familiar, it's because the government uses precisely the same logic when it argues that seemingly innocuous details in classified reports cannot be disclosed lest they be combined into a "mosaic" that reveals far more than the sum of their parts.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court confirmed this understanding of our privacy&#8212;that the mosaic is often more revealing than the individual tiles&#8212;just a few years ago in the landmark case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6122276400056758151">United States v. Jones</a> (PDF). In that case, five justices in two concurring opinions rejected the government's argument that the pervasive tracking of an individual's location in public is no different than the isolated beeper-tracking in <span class="casename">Knotts</span>. </p>

                <p>Some have argued that the <span class="casename">Jones</span> concurrences were just that: concurrences and not a majority opinion. However, that's beside the point. The five justices in <span class="casename">Jones</span> only confirmed what the Supreme Court made clear in 1983 in <span class="casename">Knotts</span>. If there were any doubt about that, you would only need to look to the appellate decision in <span class="casename">Jones</span>, which the Supreme Court eventually upheld. In that case (<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16217722717895634408">United States v. Maynard</a>), the United States Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit (the very same court that will hear the government's appeal from Leon's ruling) held that cases like <span class="casename">Smith</span> and <span class="casename">Knotts</span> are relevant to the question of dragnet surveillance, but do not actually answer the question.</p>

                <p>In short, the constitutionality of the NSA's mass tracking of our phone calls is an open question, at least insofar as Supreme Court precedent is concerned. The real question is the one that has now divided the courts: whether dragnet surveillance is a simple extension of <span class="casename">Smith</span> or rather a radical departure from our values and from our Constitution. The answer to that question should be straightforward: the Constitution protects us from dragnet surveillance.</p>

		<title>Unprecedented Notice of Warrantless Wiretapping in a Closed Case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Ramzi Kassem of the CUNY School of Law argues that a notice of warrantless wiretapping could lead to the reopening of criminal cases ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/ramzikassem2.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>L</strong></font>ate February brought some downright fascinating developments in the Agron Hasbajrami case. Hasbajrami had <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nye/pr/2013/2013jan08.html">pleaded guilty</a> in April 2012 before a federal judge in Brooklyn to attempting to provide material support to a "designated foreign terrorist organization." He was sentenced in January 2013 to 15 years in prison for the offense, and will be deported from the United States, most likely to his native Albania, after he has served his sentence.</p>

<p>In a pair of filings the US government late last month <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1028728-hasbajrami-supplemental-notice-2-24-2014.html">informed</a> Hasbajrami and the federal judge in Brooklyn presiding over his pending <a href="/forum/hasbrajamihabeascorpusnotice.pdf">habeas corpus case</a> that the criminal case against Hasbajrami was built, at least in part, on evidence collected under the <a href="http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/laws/pl110261.pdf">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Amendments Act</a> [PDF]&#8212;that is to say, evidence derived from what is known in popular parlance as the government's warrantless surveillance program. The implications of this disclosure for the future course of the Hasbajrami case could be quite significant.</p>

<p>Thanks in part to Edward Snowden, the public now knows that the warrantless wiretapping program is founded on Title VII of FISA, now codified at <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1881a">50 USC &#167 1881a</a>, which had been added through Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. Based on this provision, the US government intercepts without a court order the communications of targeted persons "reasonably believed to be located outside the United States." To the extent that the government's reasonable belief is mistaken or that those targeted individuals happen to be in communication with persons within the United States, then the communications of US persons, too, can be swept up under this surveillance program, known within the National Security Agency (NSA) and the larger US intelligence community as <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">PRISM</a>. </p>

<p>The constitutionality of the government's authority to collect intelligence without a warrant in this manner was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and others in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13987610465347808803">Clapper v. Amnesty International USA</a>. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, where the US Solicitor General, Donald B. Verrilli, Jr., persuaded a majority of the justices that the plaintiff activists and journalists lacked standing since they could not demonstrate that they had in fact been targeted and suffered a cognizable injury as a result.</p>

<p>In his <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs/11-1025_petitioner.authcheckdam.pdf">brief</a> [PDF] and at <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1025.pdf">argument</a> [PDF] Verrilli drove his point home by assuring the court that some criminal defendants could "have standing" because the US government "must provide advance notice ... to the tribunal and the person" whenever it "intends to use or disclose any information obtained or derived from its acquisition of a person's communications under section 1881a."</p>

<p>That representation <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/us/politics/us-legal-shift-may-open-door-for-challenge-to-secret-wiretaps.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1394640425-xe5I/qXHU6g9it7SKFuIFw&">turned out to be false</a>. Prosecutors in the Justice Department's National Security Division actually had not been informing defendants and courts when evidence or leads were derived from warrantless surveillance. As a result, the government announced a review of active and closed cases to identify defendants and convicts whose cases involved evidence resulting from warrantless wiretapping.</p>

<p>The notice filed in the Hasbajrami case is only the third such notice filed nationwide and the first in a post-conviction posture (remember, Hasbajrami took a guilty plea). The other two notices were filed in two active cases: the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/us/federal-prosecutors-in-a-policy-shift-cite-warrantless-wiretaps-as-evidence.html">prosecution of Jamshid Muhtorov</a> in Colorado in October 2013, and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/us/warrantless-surveillance-continues-to-cause-fallout.html">case against Mohamed Mohamud</a> in Oregon in November of that same year.</p>

<p>In its recent filings, the government tells Hasbajrami that he can revise his pending post-conviction habeas corpus petition to include this newly-discovered fact. But the government also argues that the fact makes no difference because Hasbajrami waived his right to attack his conviction or withdraw his plea when he signed the agreement to plead guilty a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>The reality, however, is that it is very much an open question. As a general rule, waivers of rights must be informed to be valid. Hasbajrami signed his plea agreement informed by an assessment of his odds of success at trial. His lawyer may well have offered a very different assessment of those odds had he known that he could have mounted an unprecedented legal challenge to the constitutionality of the evidence to be used against his client. At the very least, that lawyer could have lodged a constitutional challenge in order to improve his client's bargaining position in plea negotiations.</p>

<p>So Hasbajrami has a strong argument to reopen proceedings that he could present to a court through his pending habeas corpus challenge. The question now is whether he is in a position to take advantage of the opportunity. Hasbajrami is handling his own habeas corpus litigation pro se. Without the assistance of counsel, it remains to be seen whether he will avail himself of the novel argument he now has at his disposal.</p>

		<title>Straight to the Heart: Does Merck &#038; Co.&amp;apos;s $100 Million Dollar NuvaRing Settlement Offer Reflect Failed Corporate Governance Policies?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Kristen Swift, <a href="http://law.widener.edu">Widener University School of Law</a> Class of 2014, discusses Merck & Co.'s NuvaRing settlement and the company's corporate governance policies...</j:header>Recently, Merck & Co. made a major splash across headlines by offering NuvaRing plaintiff's a $100 million dollar <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/merck-agrees-to-100-million-nuvaring-settlement.php">settlement proposal</a>. Is this settlement offer reflective of Merck's failed corporate governance policies? One would think it is, even after the $4.5 billion dollar <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/business/09merck.html?_r=0">Vioxx settlement</a> that Merck endured.  </p>

<p>In 2004, Vioxx, a painkiller manufactured by Merck & Co., was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-and-merck-reach-settlement-agreement.php">voluntarily removed</a> from the market by Merck after the drug was linked to a potential increase in the risk for heart attack and stroke. Plaintiffs in the Vioxx suit alleged Merck improperly marketed Vioxx for off-label uses and hid the risks associated with the drug. In 2010, in response to a related derivative suit, Merck agreed to implement internal controls to improve their corporate governance &#8212; including <a href="http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/84017622.html">appointing</a> a chief medical officer responsible for overseeing safety plans for drugs in development. This appointment implicitly suggests that, prior to the Vioxx settlement, Merck's internal governance was lacking. Yet, just a few years later Merck again has to answer for another drug that allegedly poses threats to heart health. At first blush, it seems very cut and dry &#8212; Merck & Co. did not learn its lesson after Vioxx and so were doomed to repeat past mistakes. However, there are several reasons why this conclusive brush-off &#8212; that the NuvaRing settlement is continued evidence of failed corporate governance policies at Merck &#8212; is unwarranted. In fact, it seems the opposite may be true &#8212; this settlement may reflect how Merck's internal governance policies are sounder than they were a decade ago.		</p>

<p>Consider the discrepancies in the settlement amounts. Both drugs allegedly cause the same harm, increased risk for and death from heart attack or stroke &#8212; so what accounts for billions of dollars' worth of difference? </p>

<p>One reason for the difference may be the population each drug affected. Vioxx was widely prescribed to men and women for the broad purpose of pain relief. More than <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/417856/merck-pa-reach-8-25m-settlement-over-vioxx-disclosures">52 million</a> prescriptions were written for Vioxx while it was on the market. NuvaRing, an oral contraceptive prescribed to women, has a less prolific application and, unlike Vioxx, <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/12/nuvaring-birth-control-investigation">will remain available</a> for consumers. At the time the NuvaRing settlement was offered, an estimated 1.5 million women worldwide were using the contraceptive. Consider, the Vioxx settlement was paid to 3,468 claimants out of 58,022 <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-27/merck-paid-3-468-death-claims-to-resolve-vioxx-suits.html">potential claims</a>. David Voreacos and Allen Johnson wrote in <em>Bloomberg</em> that "[t]he average payment for all heart attack cases was $186,825. The payments for fatal heart attacks ranged from $18,743 to $1.79 million, with the average at $374,112. Average payments for all stroke cases was $61,165. Payments for fatal strokes ranged from $5,015 to $818,119, with the average at $119,618."  Merck said <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/07/nuvaring-settlement_n_4746201.html">3,800 cases</a> were eligible for the NuvaRing settlement at roughly $58,000 per case.  </p>

<p>However, a compelling reason the settlement offers may be so different is the differences in the alleged wrongdoings by Merck & Co. In both settlement offers, Merck & Co. denies any actual civil wrongdoing. But, in the Vioxx settlemet the plaintiffs alleged Merck promoted Vioxx for "<a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2012/04/merck-fined-322-million-for-illegal-off-label-vioxx-promotion/index.htm">off-label</a>" uses or uses outside of what Vioxx was FDA approved for. While physicians may prescribe drugs for off-label uses, pharmaceutical companies are not allowed to promote drugs based on these uses, though the advantages to doing so are obvious. NuvaRing was not allegedly promoted for off-label uses. This is a serious allegation that also got Bayer into trouble with its contraceptives, Yaz and Yazmin, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-31/bayer-s-yasmin-lawsuit-settlements-rise-to-402-6-million.html">leading them to pay</a> out over a billion dollars to settle. Does the lack of this allegation in the NuvaRing lawsuits reflect Merck's changed corporate governance policies? </p>

<p>Merck's current corporate governance policies reflect their <a href="http://www.merckresponsibility.com/corporate-responsibility/cr-governance/">goal of transparency</a>. Merck also offers a short video about what "responsibility" means at Merck. Merck posts its <a href="http://www.merckresponsibility.com/focus-areas/ethics-transparency/transparency-disclosures/">post-marketing requirements</a> on its website in an attempt to foster transparency. Notably, Merck openly states that their employees are not allowed to offer goods or services in exchange for the promotion of their products and that their employees are expected to offer truthful, <a href="http://www.merckresponsibility.com/focus-areas/ethics-transparency/sales-marketing/ethical-sales-marketing-practices/">non-misleading information</a> to the medical community. While it is difficult to prove a negative &#8212; that the absence of these allegations in this lawsuit indicates the absence of these practices by Merck employees and thus an effective governance program &#8212; the absence is telling.</p>

<p>Another indication that Merck's governance policies are achieving their desired results is the difference in settlement amounts between what Merck is offering to the NuvaRing plaintiffs in the wake of the above-mentioned Bayer settlements. The NuvaRing lawsuits are focusing on products liability and failure to warn. However, plaintiffs have had difficulty showing a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-06/merck-said-to-agree-to-100-million-nuvaring-settlement.html">causal connection</a> between the alleged harm and the contraceptive device. In other words, had the doctors known about the increased risk for harm, it would have influenced them not to prescribe the device. Bayer was accused of intentionally misleading women and prescribers about the uses and safety of Yaz and Yazmin. How did Bayer's straightforward <a href="http://www.bayer.com/en/Transparency.aspx">compliance plan</a> affect their liability? Bayer, a German company, is required to release an annual <a href="http://www.annualreport2012.bayer.com/en/declaration-on-corporate-governance.aspx">declaration of compliance</a> with the recommendations of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code pursuant to Section 161 of the <a href="http://global.sap.com/corporate-en/investors/governance/statutes/pdf/EE2013_EN.pdf">German Stock Corporation Act</a> (PDF). Bayer's website goes on to say that Bayer "expects legally and ethically impeccable conduct from all of its employees in daily business operations, as the way they carry out their duties affects the company's reputation." Bayer's website reflects governance policies that are startlingly similar to Merck's &#8212; so what went wrong?  </p>

<p>Bayer seems to exemplify a "window-dressing" approach to governance. Once you move past the façade of the warm inviting house it is empty and broken inside. The policies are in place because they're required to be, but are they successfully implemented or taken seriously by the people in charge? The answer to this question often boils down to the company's corporate culture. What is important to the company? Is the bottom line ruling the day, or are the policies put in place to balance profit-driven agendas effective? What is the company's <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/corporate-culture-social-responsibility-should-investors-care-ubs-says-yes-1392561">corporate social responsibility</a> profile? Investors and consumers alike should consider this factor when investing, purchasing or using a product from these larger-than-life corporate conglomerates. Corporate governance policies may be mere window-dressing without a strong socially responsible culture.  </p>

<p>Though Merck's corporate governance policies may have mitigated the potential losses they will suffer in the NuvaRing lawsuits, obviously the best indication that Merck's corporate governance policies are working would be a complete absence of settlement offers and negative headlines. Staying out of court should be at least one goal of governance policies. </p>

                <p>Assume that the photographer has the religious belief that God loves everybody. Should she have to take the photos for Aryan Nation? Most of us would respond, "Of course not."</p>

                <p>But the legal answer might be different. Most states prohibit discrimination against a customer because of the customer's religious beliefs. And in those states, if the members of Aryan Nation sued the photographer for discriminating against them pursuant to the state nondiscrimination law, the photographer might lose and face substantial fines as a result.</p>

                <p>At first glance, nondiscrimination ordinances seem to make sense. Most of us would not want businesses to be able to deny someone service because of things like the color of their skin, the religion they follow, or whether they are attracted to people of the same or opposite sex.</p>

                <p>But while most of us would generally agree with nondiscrimination ordinances as policy statements, these days they are of questionable value as law. Most businesses would never deny someone service based on the types of characteristics nondiscrimination ordinances protect. Business owners know that it is bad for business to be known as a place of bigotry or intolerance.</p>

                <p>But what happens in those rare cases where a business owner is asked to participate in an event that violates her deepest religious beliefs or to give voice to a message that violates her conscience?</p>

                <p>Note that the service and not the customer is at issue, contrary to how many have attempted to frame the debate.  It's not that the African-American photographer, for example, is refusing to serve someone who happens to be a member of Aryan Nation. She is willing to take his portrait or photograph his dog, for example. The problem arises when the member of Aryan Nation is asking the photographer to promote the message of Aryan Nation with her creative talents.</p>

                <p>Sadly, the nondiscrimination ordinances usually still apply. In many states, if Aryan Nation filed a discrimination lawsuit, they might win, leaving the photographer to pay crippling fines. In other states, however, a religious liberty defense is available to the photographer if providing requested services would violate her sincerely held religious beliefs.</p>

                <p>Generally known as Religious Freedom Restoration Acts, or RFRAs, these state laws are modeled after the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">RFRA</a> that Congress overwhelmingly passed in 1993. Signed by President Bill Clinton, the federal RFRA received a unanimous vote in the House and a 97 to 3 vote in the Senate. It legislatively overturned the US Supreme Court's <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10098593029363815472">Employment Division of Oregon v. Smith</a> decision. That case weakened <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> free exercise protection when it ruled that laws that are <em>neutral</em> (that is, don't target religion) and <em>generally applicable</em> (that is, apply to everyone) are constitutional, even if they cause a person to violate her religious beliefs.</p>

                <p>Prior to <span class="casename">Smith</span>, the court applied what is known as strict scrutiny review to laws that burden religious belief or practice. <em>See, e.g.,</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17526177081953259048">Sherbert v. Verner</a>; <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=519187939794619665">Wisconsin v. Yoder</a>; <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4040736983898309892">Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp't Sec. Div.</a>. Under that test, the law had to further a <em>compelling interest</em>, which was understood to be only an interest of the highest order, and had to be the <em>least restrictive means</em> of accomplishing the interest. So even if the government had a compelling interest for its law, the law could not be applied constitutionally to someone if it could accomplish its purpose without forcing the person to violate her faith.</p>

                <p><span class="casename">Smith</span> said that the strict scrutiny test no longer applied to neutral, generally applicable laws that burdened religious faith and practice. So while government could not enact a law that banned, let's say, the religious rite of circumcision while allowing medical doctors to perform circumcisions, it might be able to enact a law that banned all circumcisions, as as San Francisco <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/18/san-francisco-circumcision-ban_n_863945.html">recently contemplated</a> doing.</p>

                <p>The federal RFRA overruled the <span class="casename">Smith</span> decision by restoring the strict scrutiny test for all laws that burdened religious faith and practice, regardless of whether they were neutral and generally applicable. The Supreme Court subsequently ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/95-2074.ZS.html">City of Boerne v. Flores</a> that, while Congress could require that<em> federal</em> laws burdening religion survive strict scrutiny, it could not impose that requirement on the states. So states began passing their own RFRAs, which required that any law burdening their state constitutional free exercise clause must further a compelling interest and be the least restrictive means of accomplishing that interest.</p>

                <p>To date, eighteen states (including Arizona, where the <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/arizona-governor-vetoes-bill-allowing-businesses-to-refuse-service.php">recently vetoed SB 1062</a> was proposed) have passed a state RFRA, and the high courts of eight additional states have ruled that state laws burdening the free exercise of religion must survive strict scrutiny review. The District of Columbia also provides RFRA protection.</p>

                <p>Over the past twenty years, hundreds of lawsuits have involved federal and state RFRAs, but not a single one has involved a business owner who wanted to deny basic services like food, clothing, necessary medical care, hotel rooms or taxi cab rides to people because of their skin color, sex or sexual preferences. In fact, none has concerned skin color or sex, and only one (<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Elane+Photography+v.+Willock&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&as_vis=1&case=12439394345489594306&scilh=0">Elane Photography v. Willock</a>, discussed below), has even touched on "sexual orientation." Rather, RFRA cases typically involve things like zoning restrictions that make it impossible for religious groups to use property, as in <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/illinois/ilndce/1:2010cv02168/242213/46">Irshad Learning Center v. City of Dupage</a>, or prison regulations that make it difficult for prisoners to live consistently with their faith, as in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Muhammad+v.+Crosby&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&as_vis=1&case=6412913519522315373&scilh=0">Muhammad v. Crosby</a>.</p>

                <p>With RFRA, a litigant is at least allowed to assert a free-exercise-based claim or defense so that a court or administrative law body is required to apply the compelling interest test. RFRA does not guarantee that the litigant wins and the law cannot apply to her. Rather, RFRA means that when a law burdens free exercise of religion, it has to survive strict scrutiny in order to apply to the one whose exercise of religion is burdened. RFRA makes certain that government cannot willy-nilly enact laws that violate people's faith and so discriminate against people of faith.</p>

                <p>Since the enactment of the federal RFRA, it has always been understood that a person could assert a RFRA claim or defense any time a law or policy enacted by the government substantially burdened his or her free exercise of religion. That all changed last year with <span class="casename">Elane</span>, in which the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled that RFRA was inapplicable if the government was not the one enforcing its law.</p>

                <p><span class="casename">Elane</span> concerned Elaine Huguenin, a young photographer who wanted to run her business consistent with her religious faith. As a result, Huguenin would not accept certain jobs. For instance, she declined to take nude photos, even when some would argue that the photography would be "tasteful." And she had a strict policy against photographing any depiction of violent behavior. In sum, Huguenin would not use her artistic talent to further messages at odds with her religious beliefs.</p>

                <p>The trouble for Huguenin started when two women asked her to photograph their "commitment ceremony," as they called it. Huguenin would gladly provide other photographic services for customers who identify as homosexual, including portraits, photographs capturing political rallies, etc. It was not the fact that the two women were a same-sex couple that prevented her from photographing their ceremony. Rather, it was the event itself: her religious beliefs would not allow her to photograph what amounted to a same-sex wedding.</p>

                <p>Accepting the job would require her to attend the ceremony, which her faith teaches would amount to participating in something that is morally wrong. But more obviously, she would also have to pose the couple to get the right shots. This would require her to instruct the couple on how to kiss, where to caress, etc. A wedding photographer is entrusted with capturing the memories and creating the pictorial message that tells the story of the couple's love and their wedding as something that is beautiful.</p>

                <p>Because of her beliefs, Huguenin could not in good conscience tell that story. Nor could she do the other things required of a wedding photographer. To do so would force her to both act contrary to her faith and also use her artistic talent to create a message with which she disagreed. So, she very politely thanked the same-sex couple for their interest but declined, telling the couple that she did not photograph same-sex ceremonies.</p>

                <p>In a sane world, Huguenin's polite answer to the same-sex couple would have been the end of the story, but in this case, it wasn't. The case against her went all the way to the New Mexico Supreme Court, which said, in contrast to all twenty years of RFRA history, that it only applies when the government is enforcing its law directly. If the government delegates that responsibility to a private party, such that a private party can sue to enforce state law, then RFRA does not apply.</p>

                <p>This ruling was unprecedented. It is also probably an outlier. However, it means that, in New Mexico at least, an African-American photographer could be forced to shoot photos for Aryan Nation. Because New Mexico allows private parties to enforce its nondiscrimination law, the state RFRA would no more save this photographer than it saved Elane Photography.</p>

                <p>Because of this decision and other similar cases around the nation, Arizona's legislature passed <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1062&Session_Id=112&image.x=0&image.y=0">SB 1062</a> to clarify that Arizona's RFRA, which has been on the books since 1999, could be asserted whenever a law burdened a person's free exercise of religion&#8212;regardless of whether the government was the one enforcing the law. It did not, as has been commonly and erroneously reported, create a license to discriminate. It would not have allowed businesses to begin kicking people out of their establishments because of skin color or sexual preference.</p>

                <p>No business would have done that anyway for reasons mentioned above, and, if the state RFRA was fomenting such discrimination, then it would have been apparent already since the law has been in place for fifteen years. The fact that the opponents of SB 1062 could not point to actual examples of anyone being denied services, but rather had to raise the possibility as a shadowy boogey-man, is telling.</p>

                <p>SB 1062 was not about allowing people to discriminate. Rather, just as numerous respected legal scholars have <a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/files/SB1062LegalProfsLetter.pdf">explained</a>, the bill would have clarified that, in Arizona, the government cannot discriminate against people of faith by enacting laws that burden faith, allow private parties to enforce those laws, and so prevent the religious person from asserting RFRA as a defense. In New Mexico, the government can do that and so avoid strict scrutiny review.</p>

                <p>Religious freedom is still protected in Arizona even though Brewer vetoed SB 1062 because Arizona still has its RFRA. SB 1062 was not essential to the fight against discrimination against people of faith; it merely would have clarified what has always been understood to lessen the chances of a court getting it wrong. Still, it is troubling that some people opposed SB 1062 for imaginary reasons and seemed so ready to endorse discrimination against people because of their religious beliefs. Thankfully, this view is <a href="http://m.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/general_business/july_2013/85_think_christian_photographer_has_right_to_turn_down_same_sex_wedding_job">at odds</a> with that of most Americans.</p>

                <p><a href="http://laborandemploymentcollege.org/attorneys/Spencer%20H.%20Lewis%20Jr.aspx">Spencer Lewis Jr.</a>, district director of the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's</a> (EEOC) Philadelphia District Office, <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/philly-schools-accused-religious-beard-bias">recently said</a> that "[n]o employee should be forced to violate his religious beliefs in order to earn a living." Lewis is right.  And no business owner should be forced to, either.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/people/full-time-faculty/haider-ala-hamoudi">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law discusses the hasty and sloppy manner in which Iraq's highly controversial draft Shi'i Personal Status Law was prepared ... </p><strong>T</strong></font>here has been much controversy over the Iraqi cabinet's approval of a <a href="http://almasalah.com/ar/news/ar/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=18949">draft Shi'i Personal Status Law</a> [Arabic], applicable exclusively to the Shi'a in Iraq. The draft law purports to bring the regulation of personal status&#8212;encompassing family law, wills and inheritance&#8212;in conformity with the religious rules articulated by Shi'a Islam's premier juristic authorities. The cabinet has sent the draft law to the Iraqi legislature for its consideration and potential enactment.  </p>

<p>The criticisms of the draft law that have appeared in the press concerning women's rights are broadly correct. However, the focus of this article will be to demonstrate that the draft law is also sloppily drafted and poorly organized, so much so that the prominent Shi'a juristic authorities themselves have sharply denounced it. It is thus probably best described as a political stunt, cobbled together hastily and endorsed by Shi'a politicians on the eve of national elections merely to burnish Islamist credentials rather than actually pass meaningful legislation.  </p>

<p>Certainly&#8212;even leaving aside human rights concerns&#8212;the task of drafting a modern Personal Status Law that is based on juristic rules would be an extraordinarily complex task. The jurists are not lawyers, nor do they aspire to be. Their rules are intended to be the basis for living a pious and righteous life, as such they differ markedly from the laws of a state in its regulation of conduct and social order. A thorough legislative representation of juristic thought in any given area of law requires a sophisticated and nuanced understanding of both Islamic law and state law, a carefully considered methodology by which the translation of the religious ideas are to appear as legislation or not and a holistic appreciation of the various areas of law that might be affected. Hence, it took the exemplary Ahmed Cevdet Pasha and his law commission fully sixteen years to draft an Ottoman Civil Code, the <a href="http://www.fofweb.com/History/MainPrintPage.asp?iPin=EOE348&DataType=WorldHistory&WinType=Free">Mecelle</a>&#8212;based on Sunni, and primarily Hanafi, juristic rules.   </p>

<p>To say that the authors of this draft personal status law did not rise to the challenge is to understate the matter. They did not even try. Below, I offer a few specific examples of how the religious rules pose significant legislative obstacles and the poorly considered way that the drafters dealt with the obstacles.</p>

<p>First, the phrasing of the religious rules&#8212;developed from foundational texts using medieval techniques &#8212;traffic in arcane details and obscure hypotheticals that are difficult to incorporate into legislation. For example, below are the <a href="http://www.sistani.org/english/book/48/">rules of Grand Ayatollah Sistani</a> concerning the familiar Islamic limitation on a decedent's bequests to one-third of the decedent's estate, the remainder of which is to go to close family members&#8212;heirs who inherit specific obligatory proportions:<blockquote The bequest . . . leaving aside debts or other similar financial rights, must not exceed one-third [of the estate]. And if it does, the bequest in the excess is invalid except with the permission of the heirs. And if some of them approve, but not others, it is effective as to those who approve without the others. And if they approve as to part of the bequest but disapprove as to part, then it is valid as to the part that is approved, and invalid as to the part that is not.</p>

<p>There is no problem in dividing the permission [of the heirs] into parts after death, or during life, or not doing so. Of the two, the first is preferred.</p>

<p>If one bequeaths an item, and then bequeaths a third [of the estate] beyond it, the bequest of the third is effective and the remainder depends on the permission of the heirs. So if the bequeather says, "Two stallions to Zaid, and one third of the rest to Umru," then the bequest to Umru is valid. However, the bequest to Zaid is valid upon the approval of the heirs, and if not approved, then it is valid to one third of the horses and the two thirds are to the heirs.</blockquote>These are highly edited examples from several pages of exegesis on the one-third rule. Yet they illustrate the challenge facing any drafter translating this material into national legislation. The drafters of the Shi'i Personal Status Law did not bother with nuance but merely indicated as follows in Article 8: "The bequest is obligatory and effective to the limit of one-third of the estate. And as to what exceeds one-third, the bequest is not effective except with the permission of the heirs." Article 9&#8212;also relevant and discussed further below&#8212;does not make the permission of an heir referenced in Article 8 effective while that heir is a minor. The proposed formulation is exceedingly reductive and likely to lead to inaccurate results. It does not lay out the manner in which permission might be given by an heir, what to do when permission is given by some and not others or how to treat permission as to part of the bequest but not another part, among many other things. For a draft law whose very purpose is to permit the Shi'a to live by the rules of their sect, such sloppiness and imprecision is inexcusable.  </p>

<p>A second problem with the juristic rules is that they often adopt formulations that seem almost impossible to easily apply in modern courts. An excellent example concerns puberty, which has an important religious effect as it is the point at which a person is deemed to have reached adulthood. Under the religious rules, at puberty, a person can marry, enter into contracts, devise wills, dispose of property and be held responsible for crimes.</p>

<p>By contrast, modern Iraqi law determines the age of legal majority to be eighteen. The draft law does not seek to disturb that, except as to matters relating to personal status. This creates difficulties on its own given the overlap between matters of personal status and other areas of law. For example, if a person is entitled to inherit as an heir upon reaching puberty, may that person then dispose of the property inherited in an ordinary sale? If not, then this curtails their right to "inherit" property at puberty. Yet if so, then the general legal age of majority to conclude a contract for sale does not apply as to contracts for the sale of inherited property. Both of these results are difficult to justify.</p>

<p>The approach of the draft law is haphazard and suggests that little, if any, thought was given to the matter. Article 9 does not recognize any permission an heir might give for part of their inheritance to be bequeathed to a third-party so long as that heir is a "minor." The term used for "minor" is the same one used throughout Iraqi law and refers specifically to those under the age of eighteen. No reference is made as to puberty&#8212;which is defined later in the draft&#8212;nor does the draft anywhere suggest a different definition for "minor" as to matters of personal status.  </p>

<p>In Article 16, by contrast, the right to bequeath property exists so long as the person bequeathing it has attained puberty. Thus, a person bequeaths property based on one conception of adulthood and inherits it based on another&#8212;hardly a sensible formulation.  </p>

<p>The other problem relating to puberty is one of application. The Shi'a rules deem puberty attained at the age of nine lunar years for a girl. As for a boy, the age is fifteen lunar years unless particular signs of puberty appear&#8212;among them pubic hair or wet dreams. While it is logistically possible&#8212;if morally offensive&#8212;to deem a nine year old an adult for personal status purposes, it is hard to see how the matter of capacity to marry, inherit or devise property can depend on factual determinations concerning pubic hair or wet dreams. Moreover, if such is the intent, careful thought would have to be given as to how to amend the Law of Evidence or the Civil Procedure Code to offer a process by which such things could be proven. </p>

<p>The draft law addresses none of this in satisfactory detail. Article 16(1) reads as follows: "Puberty means the completion of nine lunar years . . .  for females, or fifteen lunar years for males, or the realization of one of the bodily signs relied upon by the Muslim jurists for the onset of puberty among males." Politically, this formulation is astute in that it replicates the juristic rules without disclosing them in the level of detail that would prove embarrassing to the drafters. Legally, however, it is an absolute nightmare. It obligates a judge to actually attempt to determine whether or not a fourteen year old boy is able to bequeath property based on whether he has ever had a wet dream or has pubic hair, without offering anything by way of procedure or evidentiary rules to assist the judge in performing this extremely unusual&#8212;and no doubt uncomfortable&#8212;task. </p>

<p>Finally, religious rules deal with virtue and sin, meaning that not all conduct needs to be described as permissible or impermissible. The goal is not thin compliance with state dictate, but rather pleasing God. Hence, some activities are "recommended," others are "disfavored" and still others are "neutral." Very few of these nuanced gradations are easily translatable into modern legislation.</p>

<p>As an example of the interplay of such religious edicts, Grand Ayatollah Sistani indicates that a wife's obligation to her husband does not include housework of any kind, but rather such activities are "recommended" for a wife to do. By contrast, she is prohibited from leaving the home without her husband's permission and is generally obligated to submit to her husband's sexual demands when made.  </p>

<p>By contrast, a husband is obligated to financially provide for his wife in all matters&#8212;including food, clothing and shelter. A husband is also obligated to divide his nights equally among his wives if he has more than one; however, it is "recommended" that he spend the first seven days of his marriage to a virgin wife with her but only the first three days of his marriage to a nonvirgin wife with her. None of these nights needs to be spent with the existing wives in compensation.</p>

<p>The drafters translated all of this material into legislation in an exceedingly simplistic fashion. They simply omitted mention of all "recommended" and "disfavored" matters, retaining only those that are "obligatory" or "prohibited." The result is a distortion of the rules upon which the law is supposed to be based. </p>

<p>Viewed in isolation, it is intellectually defensible for the law to purport to follow Shi'i marriage rules and yet not include mention of the "recommendation" that the wife perform housework. Yet, the failure to include the "recommendation" that the husband spend seven consecutive days with a virgin bride is harder to justify to the extent that one is maintaining that this law is a faithful rendition of the Shi'i rules. This is particularly so given that the husband's "obligation" to provide equal time to his wives each night is included in the legislation. What this means is that a husband under this law is prohibited from doing the very thing the jurists declare to be recommended&#8212;spend extra time with a newly married wife. Indeed, not only is this a distortion of the Shi'i rules, it is further from them than the <a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/469cdf3011.html">current Iraqi Personal Status Code</a>&#8212;which permits polygamy and contains no rules respecting how much time should or should not be spent with each wife. Hence, in this instance, a hastily drafted piece of legislation that is intended to permit the Shi'a to abide by their own sectarian rules deviates more from those rules than the existing law does.  </p>

<p>Little wonder, then, that Grand Ayatollah Bashir al-Najafi decried this law as "rife with flights of fancy in legal and juristic formulations that render it impossible that a jurist would find it acceptable." Given the sharp denunciation by a Grand Ayatollah, I assume the draft will be properly assigned to history's dustbin. Still, the effort deserves to be exposed as the exercise in demagoguery that it has proved to be.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.pepperdine.edu/academics/faculty/default.php?faculty=derek_muller">Derek Muller</a> of the Pepperdine University School of Law discusses the shaky legal foundations of the Tenth Circuit's recent decision in <span class="casename">Kerr v. Hickenlooper</span> ... </p><strong>A</strong></font> novel judicial opinion written on dubious legal grounds can serve as an empty vessel into which hopeful litigants everywhere pour hope. The Tenth Circuit's opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6286092168149401888">Kerr v. Hickenlooper</a>&#8212;authorizing legislative standing and finding the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiv">Guarantee Clause</a> justiciable&#8212;has done just that. But it is unlikely that its holdings will withstand further judicial scrutiny.</p>

<p>In 1992, the people of Colorado amended their state constitution by initiative to include a <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/Article_X,_Colorado_Constitution#Section_20">Taxpayer Bill of Rights</a> ("TABOR"). TABOR required the people to approve of any legislatively enacted tax increase before it could take effect. Critiques of Colorado's system have <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/03/can-the-us-government-declare-a-state-constitution-un-republican/284367/">called</a> this "a kind of anarchy." Some Colorado legislators&#8212;wanting to enact tax increases unencumbered by the potential disapproval of their constituents&#8212;shared this sentiment and <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-allows-colorado-taxpayers-bill-of-rights-challenge-to-proceed.php">sued</a> the governor, alleging a violation of the Guarantee Clause.</p>

<p>The Constitution provides that "the United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government." The legislators argued that a republican form of government demands that the taxing power reside in the legislature. The legislatures argued that because TABOR removed that power from its exclusive existence in the legislature, Colorado's government was no longer republican in form.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, however, the legislators had to establish standing to sue. Under the Supreme Court's test articulated in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10150124802357408838">Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife</a>, plaintiffs must have an "injury in fact" &#8212;a "concrete and particularized" injury that is "actual or imminent, not 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical.'" Otherwise, a federal court cannot hear the claim.</p>

<p>The legislators in this case suffered no actual injury: the legislature had not enacted a tax that the people refused to approve under TABOR. Nonetheless, the Tenth Circuit circumvented this requirement by recharacterizing the injury as "disempowerment."</p>

<p>The last time legislators argued to the Supreme Court that their injury was a deprivation of political power, the court rejected the argument. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3363577568877703610">Raines v. Byrd</a>, members of Congress challenged the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/104/s4/text">Line Item Veto Act</a>. The court found that they did not have standing because their claim was based on a "loss of political power," which was not an injury in fact. It is not clear that <span class="casename">Raines</span> is meaningfully distinguishable in its injury-in-fact requirement from the injury alleged by the legislators in <span class="casename">Kerr</span>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Tenth Circuit relied heavily on the 1939 case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13916201793014079286">Coleman v. Miller</a>, which permitted state legislators to sue when the governor deemed a constitutional amendment ratified that the legislators believed had not been ratified. The <span class="casename">Raines</span> Court explained that "our holding in <span class="casename">Coleman</span> stands [at most] for the proposition that legislators whose votes would have been sufficient to defeat [or enact] a specific legislative act have standing to sue if that legislative action goes into effect [or does not go into effect]."</p>

<p>Lacking a specific piece of legislation in this case, the Tenth Circuit again relied on the fact that this injury was a deprivation of the taxing power, a "core function." The court repeatedly explained that because no tax goes into effect without popular approval, it renders voting ineffective.</p>

<p>That is not&#8212;I think&#8212;entirely accurate. Not until the public actually rejects a tax are legislators' votes nullified. That is why the court has demanded a concrete injury in the form of an actually nullified vote. Given the Supreme Court's abiding skepticism of broad notions of standing&#8212;as well as its express hostility to <span class="casename">Coleman</span> in <span class="casename">Raines</span>&#8212;it is unlikely that this logic will survive higher court review. Indeed, it might serve as an opportunity to overturn <span class="casename">Coleman</span> outright.</p>

<p>Of course, the possibilities flowing from generous standing for legislators abound. Some have even <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/13/how-five-colorado-democrats-may-have-paved-the-way-for-congress-to-sue-the-administration/">anticipated</a> that the ruling might open an avenue for members of congress to sue President Obama on matters ranging from the Affordable Care Act to welfare reform. This is an important reason why standing demands a concrete injury in fact&#8212;rather than allowing disgruntled legislators to complain in court about laws that may impinge upon their previous freedom, Article III of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> demands a case or controversy exist before a federal court may hear a complaint.</p>

<p>On an interesting side-note, David Skaggs represents the plaintiff-legislators in this case who also&#8212;while serving as a member of Congress&#8212;was a plaintiff-legislator in <span class="casename">Raines</span> when the Supreme Court determined legislators did not have standing for generalized disempowerment claims. For Mr. Skaggs, two-time's the charm.</p>

<p>Getting back on track, however, passing the hurdle of standing was just the beginning. The legislators also needed to make the case that the Guarantee Clause is justiciable. That story begins almost 200 years ago in Rhode Island.<br />
Rhode Island's original <a href="http://livelyexperiment.org/read-the-charter/">Colonial Charter of 1663</a> controlled the state's government until the nineteenth century. The charter was not terribly democratic and eventually a Thomas W. Dorr led a popular convention to draft a new constitution&#8212;the supporters of which were aptly named "Dorrites"&#8212;which became law after its approval by popular referendum in 1841. Competing governments established themselves within the state but Mr. Dorr was elected governor under the newly ratified <a href="https://archive.org/details/constitutionsta00islagoog">1841 Constitution</a> the next year, upon which a mild military skirmish ensued.</p>

<p>These dueling governments prompted litigation. In 1849, the Supreme Court rendered a decision on the matter in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7884047486442944178">Luther v. Borden</a>, declining to intervene in the dispute. The court concluded that "it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a State." It explained that "the right to decide is placed there, and not in the courts."</p>

<p>It is hard to think of a more dramatic dispute over governance within a state than the Dorr rebellion. But it is precisely the situation in which the court refused to intervene. The court later explained the contours of the "political question doctrine" in the infamous 1962 decision of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6066081450900314197">Baker v. Carr</a>. Here, the court held that instances where the dispute is committed to another branch of government, there is a lack of judicially manageable standards, the case demands non-judicial discretion or other factors are met, the courts will find such cases to be "political questions" and refuse to hear the matter.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17675318889659087739">Nixon v. United States</a>, the court explained that it would not review the impeachment of a federal judge because it was left to the houses of congress to impeach and remove judges. As such, a strong argument can be made concluding that the evaluation of each state's form of government is left within the purview of non-judicial branches in each state. Indeed, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16351559639154476313">Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon</a>, the court refused to adjudicate a Guarantee Clause claim as to tax increases levied by popular initiative. In the <a href="http://originalismblog.typepad.com/the-originalism-blog/2014/03/tenth-circuit-holds-guaranty-clause-claim-justiciablemichael-ramsey.html">words</a> of Professor Michael Ramsey, "an open-ended commission to review all state governments to assure they are sufficiently 'republican'&#8212;surely an imprecise term&#8212;is a hugely important power." Appropriately, the court has expressed reluctance to enter such a political thicket.</p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Kerr</span>, however, the Tenth Circuit had little hesitation in finding the Guarantee Clause justiciable&#8212;despite 170 years of Supreme Court precedent to the contrary. It relied primarily on the 1992 case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9243582117703452379">New York v. United States</a> for the court's cursory analysis dismissing a Guarantee Clause claim on the merits when it assumed,<em>arguendo</em>, that the claim was justiciable.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is some universe of cases in which a federal court should agree to adjudicate a Guarantee Clause claim. For instance, maybe there is some set of allegations in which the court will review an impeachment proceeding&#8212;perhaps in accordance with Justice Souter's <span class="casename">Nixon</span> <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-740.ZC2.html">concurrence</a>&#8212;and the proceeding occurred by coin toss or something similarly irrational. Moreover, assume a state instituted a monarchy&#8212;and, upon appeal, Congress failed to act&#8212;the judiciary might very well undertake a Guarantee Clause analysis. Yet, even with such an extraordinary precedent, the peoples' review of the legislative taxing power through initiative is hardly the stuff of monarchy. If competing constitutions and militia intervention are insufficient for the court to inject itself into a Guarantee Clause dispute&#8212;such as during the Dorrite rebellion&#8212;it seems improbable that it will do so here.</p>

<p>For the Tenth Circuit, however, the case was readily justiciable. It went on to note that even in the face of little precedent interpreting the Guarantee Clause, courts have no difficulty interpreting the constitution. It explained that in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2739870581644084946">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>, the court interpreted the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> to include an individual right to bear arms, which it had not done in centuries.</p>

<p>This analysis is not terribly persuasive, however. <span class="casename">Heller</span> was certainly a new articulation of the Second Amendment by the court, but it was not because the court had historically <em>dismissed</em> Second Amendment claims as beyond the purview of judicial review. The Guarantee Clause, by contrast, is a political question&#8212;something essentially committed to the political branches.</p>

<p>One final procedural note: the district court judge in this case is preparing a trial, but a trial is extremely unusual for a case like this. There are only questions of law&#8212;there are no questions of fact. Yes, there are questions of legal history concerning what a "republican form of government" is, but such are inquiries into definitions of the law, which are typically reserved to briefing, not a trial. Yet, given the nature of the claims thus far, perhaps a trial on legal history would not be the most absurd part of this litigation.</p>

<p>The Tenth Circuit's analysis&#8212;if affirmed on appeal&#8212;would have extraordinary consequences. It would create many more opportunities for individual legislators in each state&#8212;and perhaps those in both houses of congress&#8212;to sue on generalized grounds of political disempowerment, or even compel the executive to act pursuant to legislative demands. Such would bring about serious judicial inquiries into the validity of the initiative and referendum processes themselves&#8212;which has been a large part of most states' governance for the past hundred years. Moreover, it would focus judicial scrutiny on the manner in which each state governs themselves&#8212;effectively ushering in a power shift away from the people&#8212;and their ability to enact policy objectives via popular vote&#8212;and towards the federal court system.</p>

<p>It might very well be that evaluating TABOR under the Guarantee Clause results in a finding of their compatibility with one another. However, I suspect we will not even see a trial, that a reviewing court will merely revisit the holdings in this case and be done with it. The consequences are not simply dramatic but unsupported by the constitutional constraints over the federal judiciary.</p>

		<title>Causal Analyses in ERISA &#167; 510 and the Affordable Care Act &#167; 1558</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Jia Li, <a href="https://www.law.indiana.edu">Indiana University Maurer School of Law</a> Class of 2014, discusses the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and how it may potentially interact with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.</j:header><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1140">ERISA &#167;510</a> is an anti-retaliation provision that prevents employers from interfering with the rights of benefit plan participants and protects whistleblowing related to ERISA violations. Similarly, <a href="http://www.whistleblowers.gov/acts/aca.html">&#167;1558</a> of the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA), through &#167;18C of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/218c">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> (FLSA), created an anti-retaliation provision that: (1) Prevents employers from interfering with an employee's right to receive federal tax credit or subsidies for enrollment in ACA exchanges and (2) protects whistleblowing related to ACA violations. Under some circumstances, an employer's conduct related to a self-insured group health plan could trigger both anti-retaliation provisions. For example, reducing an employee's work hours to avoid tax penalty under the ACA <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/4980H">"play or pay mandate"</a>, which has become a widely discussed business strategy, could, potentially, trigger both ERISA &#167;510 and ACA &#167;1558. Much like other anti-retaliation statutes, to prevail under either provision, a causal link between the illegitimate consideration and the adverse employment decision must be shown. Although the two provisions serve similar purposes and even adopt somewhat similar language, their analytical schemes for causation are different; and in the case of ERISA &#167;510, this issue is currently a moving target. </p>

<p>This commentary piece offers some observations on the causal analyses under ERISA &#167;510 and ACA &#167;1558. Part I discusses the relationship between a but-for analysis and a mixed-motives analysis. Part II observes that the recent US Supreme Court case <span class="casename">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar</span> may change the causal analysis for ERISA &#167;510 claims. Part III introduces the causal analysis applicable to ACA &#167;1558 claims and compares that to the traditional mixed-motives analysis. </p>

<p><strong>I. But-For v. Mixed-Motives <br />
</strong><br />
Case law established two general types of causal analysis in the context of various employment statutes&#8212;the "but-for" analysis and the "mixed-motives" analysis. Under a but-for analysis, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer's discriminatory conduct would not have happened absent the illegitimate consideration. Under a mixed-motives analysis, however, the plaintiff merely needs to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the illegitimate consideration was a "motivating factor" (some cases use similar language such as "contributing factor," "substantial factor" and "significant factor"); and then the burden will shift to the defendant employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same adverse decision even if the illegitimate consideration did not exist. </p>

<p>The two types of causal analysis share the same ultimate goal&#8212;to determine whether the illegitimate motive was the but-for cause for the adverse employment action. The difference lies in the burden of persuasion. Under the "but-for" standard, the plaintiff is responsible to prove the but-for causation; whereas in the "mixed-motives" analysis, the defendant must disprove the but-for causation by showing that it would have reached the same decision without the prohibited motive. Consequently, when an adverse employment decision was motivated by a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate considerations, the "but-for" standard would be more defendant-friendly, whereas the "mixed-motives" analysis would be more plaintiff-friendly. For a long period of time, federal courts diverged  on the application of these two approaches when interpreting employment statutes, even while dealing with the same provisions. </p>

<p>In 2009, the US Supreme Court, through <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11161861274984420877">Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.</a>,  introduced a new rule to guide the application of the two different approaches. While finding that the mixed-motives approach is not available in an <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/adea.cfm">Age Discrimination in Employment Act</a> (ADEA) claim, <span class="casename">Gross</span> held that absent a statutory authorization to apply the mixed-motives analysis to a particular provision, the but-for causation should be the default standard, admitting that it would be a standard less favorable for the plaintiff. </p>

<p>In the 2013 case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14391019881543634204">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar</a>, the court, citing <span class="casename">Gross</span>, held that while the mixed-motives analysis is applicable in Title VII <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-2">status-discrimination claims</a>, the but-for causation must apply to Title VII <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-3">retaliation claims</a>. This was because in 1991, Congress added a provision to Title VII that endorsed the court's position in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=780752418377134939">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</a> applying the mixed-motives approach to Title VII cases. The court held in <span class="casename">Nassar</span> that the mixed-motives provision only attached to the status-discrimination provision in Title VII, but not the retaliation provision. This case may cause federal courts to change their causal analysis in interpreting various federal statutes, especially anti-retaliation statutes. </p>

<p><strong>II. The Causal Analysis for ERISA &#167;510 <br />
</strong><br />
Whether the but-for analysis or the mixed-motives analysis should apply to ERISA &#167;510 claims is an unsettled question. Unlike the Title VII status-discrimination provision, ERISA &#167;510 does not have statutory authorization to adopt the mixed-motives analysis. Before <span class="casename">Gross</span>, when dealing with ERISA &#167;510 claims, federal courts seemed to favor the mixed-motives analysis. If <span class="casename">Gross</span> and <span class="casename">Nassar</span> are extended to ERISA &#167;510 claims, the but-for analysis should apply. Nonetheless, even after <span class="casename">Gross</span>, federal circuit courts continued to frequently apply the "motivating factor" language  to ERISA &#167;510 claims. Interestingly, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit stated in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1645579026896049721">Nauman v. Abbott Laboratories</a> that "on the strength of this case law [the Seventh Circuit followed <span class="casename">Gross</span> in interpreting a number of other employment statutes], but-for causation is properly required"; but it refrained from extending <span class="casename">Gross</span> to ERISA &#167;510 claims in that case by avoiding ruling on the causation issue. </p>

<p>Since <span class="casename">Nassar</span> was decided, the federal courts have only heard a handful of ERISA &#167;510 cases. Among the courts hearing such cases, at least the District of Kansas, the District of Arizona and the Southern District of Ohio continued to use the "motivating factor" language, while the Seventh Circuit's hesitation to rule on this issue  continued. Although cases have not been found explicitly extending <span class="casename">Gross</span> or <span class="casename">Nassar</span> to ERISA &#167;510, this landscape might soon change. In January 2014, the US Supreme Court strengthened the <span class="casename">Nassar</span> holding through the criminal case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14765886306917997340">Burrage v. United States</a>, stressing that the but-for analysis can apply to a broad range of causation language in federal statutes. Meanwhile, more new cases extended <span class="casename">Nassar</span> to other federal statues, especially employment retaliation statutes&#8212;for example, the ADA retaliation provision. Most importantly, while enacting the ACA, Congress did not amend ERISA &#167;510 to address the burden of proof, when it did amend ERISA in many other ways. The US Supreme Court stated in <span class="casename">Gross</span>, "When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally." Accordingly, courts could very well conclude that Congress intended that but-for causation&#8212;the default analysis&#8212;should apply to ERISA &#167;510. Future cases dealing with ERISA &#167;510 will likely move toward the but-for analysis, following the <span class="casename">Nassar</span> decision. </p>

<p><strong>III. The Causal Analysis for ACA &#167;1558<br />
</strong><br />
Unlike ERISA &#167; 510, the causal analysis for ACA &#167;1558 is spelled out in the statute itself. ACA &#167;1558 explicitly adopted the modified mixed-motive scheme set forth in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2087">Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act</a>. Like the traditional mixed-motives analysis, under this framework, the plaintiff first makes a <em>prima facie</em> showing that the prohibited animus was a "contributing factor" in the adverse employment decision; then the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the same adverse decision would have been reached absent the prohibited animus. </p>

<p>Unlike the traditional mixed-motives analysis, however, the ACA &#167;1558 causal analysis requires that in the second step, the employer must reach the standard of "clear and convincing evidence" to disprove the but-for causation. Given that the traditional mixed-motives analysis is already a plaintiff-friendly scheme, the ACA &#167;1558 causal analysis further elevated the employers' burden of proof. </p>

<p><strong>IV. Conclusion <br />
</strong><br />
When both ERISA &#167;510 and ACA &#167;1558 are triggered by the same underlying facts, if the success of a retaliation claim depends completely on the causation analysis, it seems that the causal analysis for ACA &#167;1558 is much more plaintiff-friendly than that for ERISA &#167;510. Moreover, if the causal analysis for ERISA &#167;510 does move toward the but-for direction, the disparity between the causal analyses under these two provisions will become even greater. No case has yet dealt with a retaliation claim involving both ERISA &#167;510 and ACA &#167;1558. As the ACA is gradually coming into full effect, such cases are likely to arise; and it will be interesting to see where the courts will take us in this area. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.gespassandjohnson.com/bios.html">David Gespass</a> of <a href="http://www.gespassandjohnson.com/">Gespass and Johnson</a> argues that the US Supreme Court should elevate substance over form and preserve freedom of speech...<<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>G</strong></font>overnment officials have learned, over many years, that the best way to restrict civil liberties is piecemeal. If one wants to take some salami without it being noticed, one takes a thin slice. Over time, with enough thin slices, the salami is gone. So, too, with our rights.<br />
                <br />
                Take the following scenario. A single individual, who has been annoying authorities with peaceful protests chooses to demonstrate on a public road. He poses no threat and does not interfere with anyone engaged in any business. However, because of past acts involving alleged trespass, he is told that he cannot even protest on the public right-of-way. Relying on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>, he does and is prosecuted. Would that not seem, on its face, to violate one of our most fundamental rights, the right to free speech via public petitioning for redress of grievances? Is it credible that, in the US, courts would permit such a restriction? Of course, they would.<br />
                <br />
                Following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, our country was introduced to a new concept, "Free Speech Zones." Those were the places&#8212;usually out of sight and hearing of officials to whom protests were being directed&#8212;that the federal government designated for protesters to exercise their rights. During the Vietnam War, not to mention the Civil Rights Movement, no one would have dreamed of holding a march or demonstration that did not directly confront its target. Back then, everywhere from Canada to Mexico and the Atlantic to the Pacific, as well as Puerto Rico, Alaska and Hawaii, was a free speech zone. There were limited exceptions to that rule. Inside libraries, public schools and university classrooms when classes were in session and the steps of the US Supreme Court, as examples, were places where protests were not permitted. Places where one <strong>can</strong> protest are now becoming the exception and often require difficult, time-consuming and expensive litigation for their preservation.<br />
                <br />
                Time was, we could picket outside grocery stores that sold grapes and lettuce picked by non-union labor. Now, they are located in shopping centers, which are deemed private property, the owners of which are free to exclude picketers. Indeed, as far back as 1946, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7287882985401537921">Marsh v. Alabama</a>, the Supreme Court held that a town, Chickasaw, Alabama, owned by a private company but otherwise just like any other town, could not limit the exercise of people's constitutional rights within its borders. Now, even public lands are becoming, as it were, free speech free zones.<br />
                <br />
                While the events of 9/11 accelerated the process, the changes did not happen all of a sudden. That day just allowed the government to slice off an unusually large piece of salami. But restrictions continue to mount up, and punishments for violating them become more severe, while too many of us are willing, as Ben Franklin feared, to sacrifice essential liberty for the illusion of security.<br />
                <br />
                Which brings us back to where we began, with <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/supreme-court-sides-with-pentagon-in-military-protest-case.php">the case</a> of one John Dennis Apel. He regularly protested at Vandenberg Air Force base in California, often getting in trouble with the base commander and, if the military is to be believed, trespassing onto secure base property. However, Vandenberg has two state roads running through it. They are maintained by the state of California for the use of the general public without restriction. There is an intersection which contains a middle school, a bus station and a visitor's center, as well as an area designated by the base commander for peaceful protest. Apel often, it would appear, left the designated area and was prosecuted for trespass. For his troubles, he eventually was completely barred from the base, including the road open to pretty much everyone else in the US.<br />
                <br />
                He thereafter protested several times within the "free speech zone" the base commander had established, was arrested, prosecuted and, eventually, the case made its way to the US Supreme Court, perhaps not for the last time. A unanimous court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-1038_6jgm.pdf">found</a> (PDF) that the base commander had jurisdiction over the entire base, including those roads made open to the public. It found Apel's argument that <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title18/html/USCODE-2010-title18-partI-chap67-sec1382.htm">18 U.S.C. &#167 1382</a>, the statute making it a crime to enter a military installation after having been ordered not to, applied even to those parts of bases over which some other authority, such as the State of California, exercises jurisdiction. This was, it must be admitted, a pretty thin slice of salami. It is not unreasonable, at first blush, to conclude that every part of a military installation is under the jurisdiction of the base commander.<br />
                <br />
                If one delves a bit deeper, however, even this restriction is troubling. The court chose to "decline Apel's invitation to require civilian judges to examine US military sites around the world, parcel by parcel," categorizing the claim as a some overwhelming task that our poor jurists are unable to undertake without giving up all hope of leisure or hearing other cases. In fact, all they were invited to do was to find that a public right-of-way is open to the public and that the members of the public who use it enjoy their constitutional rights while doing so. If there is one burden the US Supreme Court should gladly undertake, it is protecting and preserving rights guaranteed under the Constitution.<br />
                <br />
                One ray of hope shone through in Justice Ruth Ginsburg's concurring opinion, which held that First Amendment considerations <strong>might</strong> still render the exclusion of Apel unconstitutional. Justice Samuel Alito cast a bit of a shadow over that ray by stating that it was not an issue before the court and, thus, there was no reason to comment on it. The ultimate outcome remains in doubt, but the underlying concern does not. Apel was ordered to stay off a public road and a "free speech" area, traversed daily by uncounted numbers of people unconnected with the US military because that road goes through a "military installation." It is by no means certain that his prosecution for engaging in protected speech in a designated area will be found unconstitutional. The trend, certainly, is not encouraging. The willingness of the court to ignore or, at least, defer to another day, the important, substantive issue of free speech and cling to the technical issue of whether a base commander has jurisdiction over a public thoroughfare running through the base is more than troubling. It reveals a US Supreme Court that prefers form over substance and is more and more willing to restrict constitutional rights not just on private lands, but now on public ones too. The specter we face is that the entire country, except for small, isolated little plots, will be, like the steps of the US Supreme Court, barren of dissent and protest in favor of presumed security and the zombie-like silence of sheep.</p>

		<title>Title VII and the Interplay of Racial and Economic Justice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/bio/leonard-m-baynes">Leonard M. Baynes</a> and <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/bio/david-l-gregory">David L. Gregory</a>, both of the St. John's University School of Law, discuss the anniversary of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the interplay of racial and economic justice ... </p><strong>T</strong></font>his year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the enactment of <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII</a> of the Civil Rights Act. This landmark legislation outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex. Since its enactment, there has been dramatic advancement of African Americans in all areas of economic and civic life. In addition, Title VII's anti-discrimination principle has become an ingrained more in American society and taught Americans that racial discrimination is unacceptable.</p>

<p>As we celebrate this milestone year, it also important to put Title VII in the full context of the Civil Rights struggle, which embodied activism for both jobs and justice. On April 4, 2014, we also solemnly remember the forty-sixth anniversary of the martyrdom of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as he championed striking Memphis sanitation workers' rights for better working conditions and decent wages. Dr. King advocated for nondiscrimination principles; but his activism also posited economic equality and fairness for all Americans.  </p>

<p>Despite the progress that Title VII has generated, the Pew Research Center <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/key-data-points/race-in-america-key-data-points/">reports</a> that, for the last fifty years, African American unemployment has consistently outpaced that of whites, sometimes approaching three times the white unemployment rate. Largely due to the disparity in educational opportunities, many African American men are unable to find full-time employment, and instead have to work part-time jobs. This situation is measured by the "underemployment rate." According to the New York State Department of Labor, African American men have an underemployment rate exceeding <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/study-shows-depth-of-unemployment-for-blacks-in-new-york/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0">25 percent</a>.  </p>

<p>How can this be? Given how courts have heightened the evidentiary requirements necessary to prove Title VII cases, have limited the ability to bring Title VII class actions, and have allowed employers to require arbitration, not court hearings, for Title VII claims, Title VII has become more of a "paper tiger" and is not the ideal vehicle to eliminate race discrimination in the workplace. Moreover, the progress of African Americans is limited by its application solely to racial justice. Title VII does not address economic justice and inequality. Therefore, other inequities in the workplace, such as fair pay, good jobs, fair working conditions, and overall economic inequality affecting the African American community cannot be remedied under Title VII if race discrimination can't be proven.<br />
  <br />
As we think about this conundrum of Title VII and its relationship to the economic progress of African Americans, it is important to keep King's overall message of jobs and justice in mind. We should not be blinded by the formal employment equality that Title VII affords to African Americans while economic injustice remains. Like King, we need to advocate on a broader playing field championing civil, labor, and human rights, and  against the ill-gotten wealth of a few and for the poor "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." If not for the assassin's bullet, perhaps the 85-year-old Rev. Dr. King would be with us today advocating for economic fairness for all Americans.</p>

		<title>Same-Sex Marriage in Illinois:  A Conflict of Powers or A Pragmatic Choice?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.illinois.edu/faculty/profile/sarabenson">Sara Benson</a> of the University of Illinois College of Law discusses State Attorney General Lisa Madigan's interpretation of the statute recently passed by the Illinois Legislature allowing same-sex marriage ... </p><strong>L</strong></font>ast summer the US Supreme Court issued an opinion <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">striking down</a> part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/12-307.pdf">Windsor</a> [PDF] case. The <span class="casename">Windsor</span> decision struck down DOMA, but it did not tell the government how to interpret federal regulations related to marriage and the relationship between civil unions, same-sex marriage, and "traditional" marriage. These questions were answered by the Illinois legislature on November 5, 2013, when it <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/illinois-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">passed</a> Public Act Number 98-597 amending the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2086&ChapterID=59">Illinois Marriage and Dissolution Act</a> to allow same-sex couples to marry in Illinois as of the effective date of June 1, 2014. However, that was not the end of the story in Illinois. Multiple couples sought a marriage license prior to June 1 in <a href="http://llnw.wbez.org/140221%20Federal%20gay%20marriage%20ruling%20Cook%20County.pdf">Lee v. Orr</a> [PDF] due to the terminal illness of one of the marriage applicants in each coupling. Those marriage licenses were granted prior to the effective date of the statute by the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Cook County. The court noted, however, that the right to marry should not simply be extended to the parties in the case, who would be unable to wait to marry due to illness, but rather to all same-sex couples wishing to marry (at least in Cook county) because, in the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., "the time is always ripe to do right." Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman noted, however, that her opinion did not extend to other areas outside of Cook County due to the "posture of the lawsuit." </p>

<p>Nevertheless, Lisa Madigan, the State Attorney General, noted in a <a href="http://capitolfax.com/HonStephenMBeanLtr.pdf">letter</a> [PDF] to the Macon County Clerk, that every clerk would have to decide for him or herself whether to permit individuals seeking a marriage license to obtain one. She noted, however, that such couples might face costly litigation of the type faced in Lee if clerks refuse to grant marriage licenses to willing applicants. Additionally, she stated that her office would "argue that it is unconstitutional to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples" should this type of litigation indeed arise.</p>

<p>Although this issue poses a conundrum regarding the role of the local State's Attorney, the local County Clerk, and the State Attorney General, I'd like to focus primarily on the conflict between Madigan's interpretation and the effective date of the statute as set by the Illinois legislature. Is the kind of action taken by Madigan likely to be repeated frequently? I would answer no. Madigan's answer was guided by Coleman's opinion. Surely where an issue of such fundamental importance to our lives as marriage is at hand, individuals should not have to wait to marry, as they have all waited long enough. The Lee court noted, appropriately, what the legislature had already attempted to rectify:  it is unfair and unconstitutional to allow opposite sex couples to marry while preventing same sex couples from marrying. If that is true, then there is no way to enforce the old, unconstitutional law, and couples of any sex should be permitted to marry immediately throughout the entire state. This issue is such an important one and of such constitutional import that marriage was <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/125/190">recognized</a> as a fundamental right as early as 1888 by the Supreme Court. Although the Lee case involved couples where one party was seriously ill, it would be unfair to force every single couple to wait until June 1 or litigate, as Coleman pointed out. What if the couple is about to give birth to a child? What if they are on the cusp of adoption? What if they are just too poor to take time off from work to travel to Cook County to obtain a license there? All of these issues could drag individual County Clerk's to court and waste additional time and money. What is the down side of issuing the marriage licenses early?  Probably nothing. What is the downside of refusing to issue the licenses? Costly lawsuits. As such, Madigan made the appropriate choice.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Aubry Dicks, <a href="http://law.richmond.edu/">University of Richmond School of Law</a>, Class of 2014,  discusses recent decisions by the National Labor Relations Board concerning student athletes' rights to unionize...</j:header>In January, the National College Players Association (NCPA) filed a petition on behalf of Kain Colter and other Northwestern University football players asking the university to recognize them as employees. The petition was the first step in a series that would allow the players to negotiate with the school on matters such as health insurance, an optional benefit to students from each institution and stipends to cover expenses not related to tuition, books and room and board. </p>

<p>On March 26, the Chicago office for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/files/NU%20Decision%20and%20Direction%20of%20Election.pdf">ruled</a> [PDF] that football players at Northwestern University were employees under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-7/subchapter-II">National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)</a>, giving student athletes the right to vote to unionize. This case of first impression may find itself as the foundation for generated revenue sharing among college athletes and academic institutions.</p>

<p>In order to form a union under the NLRA, individuals must be employees as defined in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/152">section 2(3)</a>. Although there are specific exclusions of job functions in the definition, the general description of an employee under the NLRA is defined broadly as "any employee." Students are not listed under the exclusions; therefore, the broad definition of an employee under the NLRA has led the Board to use legal precedent and common law to define an employee. In the early 2000s there was a fluctuation between two policies that altered the designation of students under the NLRA. The two cases that sculpted these policies were <a href="http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d45800c0b35">New York University</a> [PDF] and <a href="http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d45800076ac">Brown University</a> [PDF]. <span class="casename">New York University</span> held that students were employees under the NLRA, but <span class="casename">Brown University</span> overturned that decision. </p>

<p>Using the common law definition used in <span class="casename">Brown University</span>, the NLRB in <span class="casename">Northwestern</span> defined an employee as "a person who performs services for another under a contract of hire, subject to the other's control or right of control, and in return for payment." The NLRB found that the student athletes were employees under the common law definition of employees based on two premises: the student athletes perform services for the benefit of Northwestern University in exchange for compensation; and the student athletes are subject to Northwestern University's control in the performance of their duties as football players.</p>

<p>The NLRB found that the student athletes contracted to perform services for Northwestern in exchange for compensation for the following reasons: a contract, referred to by the Board as an employee contract, was signed explaining the duration and conditions of receiving monies; in consideration for the student athletes' services Northwestern generated approximately $235 million during a nine year period, received various economic benefits including a positive reputation that led to an increase in alumni contributions and increased student applicants; student athletes were initially sought after and given compensation for their athletic services and received an economic benefit for playing football; the economic benefit received from playing football included tuition, books, food, and shelter; the fact that the income was in the form of scholarships or stipends rather than a taxable paycheck was not dispositive of whether or not it was payment; and the student athletes' scholarships could be revoked or reduced by withdrawing from the team or abusing team rules, which give students an incentive to continue to perform their athletic services.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the NLRB found that the student athletes were under Northwestern's control for the following reasons: the coaches control the "location, duration, and manner in which players carry out their football" related activities each week, including meals, practices, meetings film sessions, and workouts; the coaches control where the team will spend its nights before games, the travel itinerary and dress attire for games, and which student athletes will play in the game; the student athletes devote 40 to 50 hours per week to their football duties that are under the control of coaches; the coaches control the players by monitoring their adherence to NCAA and team rules, as well as disciplining them for violations that occur; the coaches have control over major facets of the student athletes' private lives including living arrangements, outside employment, the vehicles they drive, off-campus traveling, internet posts, media speaking engagements, alcohol and drug usage and gambling engagements; and the coaches have control over the student athletes' academic affairs including, deterring Athletes from taking courses or choosing majors that conflict with football, forcing students to miss class to travel to games and requiring students to partake in study hall and other academic programs. </p>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned remarks, the NLRB noted that <span class="casename">Brown University</span>, which refused to categorize graduate, teacher and research assistants as employees under the NLRA, was not applicable to <span class="casename">Northwestern</span> because unlike the assistants, the student athletes were primarily football players rather than students. First, the NLRB believed the amount of hours the students attributed to football in comparison to academics made them football players, rather than "primarily students." The NLRB found that the student athletes spent more hours with football related activities than most "full-time employees work at their jobs." Second, unlike the assistants in <span class="casename">Brown</span>, the student athletes do not receive academic credit for the duties they performed for their scholarships. Although students "learned life lessons" from playing football, the interaction between the student athletes and Northwestern seemed economical rather than academic. Third, the student athletes are supervised by football coaches and not members of the "academic faculty." Finally, the NLRB noted that while the assistants in <span class="casename">Brown</span> received scholarships to attend school, where no teaching or research was required, the student athletes may lose their scholarships if they do not participate in the football related activities, adding to the premise that student athletes were paid for services performed.</p>

<p>Since the initial ruling on March 26, the NCAA has not backed away from their stance on the issue. <a href="http://college-basketball.si.com/2014/04/06/ncaa-president-mark-emmert-union/">President Mark Emmert</a>, in his annual state of the NCAA address, stated that "the notion of using a union-employee model to address the challenges that do exist in intercollegiate athletics is something that strikes most people as a grossly inappropriate solution to the problem." Interesting enough, Northwestern University has taken a different approach than the NCAA. After the NCPA's filing, the <a href="http://btn.com/2014/01/28/jim-phillips-releases-statement-on-players-union/">Northwestern University Athletic Director</a> stated that the University was "proud of [their] students." He noted that the University recognized the growing concerns of student-athletes when it came to "health impacts" and other important issues, and "that [students-athletes] should have a prominent voice in those discussions."</p>

<p>It is overwhelmingly complicated to measure the overall impact <span class="casename">Northwestern</span> may have on revenue sharing among college athletes and academic institutions. If the decision passes scrutiny after its appeals and is found to be binding, unionizing under the NLRA will still only apply to private institutions. This means that it would only affect seventeen Division I institutions. While using unionization to address the problem may be "grossly inappropriate," it is safe to say that the student athletes' actions have sparked an interest in the NCAA to address the problem of revenue sharing among college athletes sooner rather than later.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/hanan-salah">Hanan Salah</a> of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> says that if the Libyan government does not take immediate steps to rectify its dysfunctional justice system it risks a complete collapse...</p>

                <p>This past week, Libya's official television station broadcasted a series of videos featuring al-Saadi Gaddafi, a son of the deposed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, from what appears to be his jail in Tripoli. Al-Saadi, who is awaiting trial and is wearing a blue prison suit, "apologizes" to Libya's people and the authorities for any "destabilization" he may have caused, asks for "forgiveness" and "confesses" to working against the current political system, while giving detailed accounts of his interactions with prominent figures in Libya before he was extradited.</p>

                <p>The last time I recall seeing "confessions" of this sort on Libyan television was in the summer of 2011, as the uprising against Gaddafi was raging and NATO carried out its air campaign against the regime. I vividly remember following the nightly show "confessions" of anti-Gaddafi fighters the government had caught and made to "confess" to serious crimes&#8212;while under visible duress. The purpose seemed to be to intimidate and frighten the opposition. </p>

                <p>So it is a macabre twist that Gaddafi's son is now the one behind prison bars, "voluntarily" confessing his "sins" on national television, raising questions about whether these statements were forced.</p>

                <p>Al-Saadi Gaddafi was reportedly extradited on March 6, 2014 to Libya from Niger, to which he had escaped after the 2011 uprising ended his father's 42-year stranglehold on the country. Upon his arrival in Tripoli at al-Hadhba prison, unknown sources leaked <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/05/world/libya-gadhafi">photos</a> to social media sites of al-Saadi kneeling in a blue prison uniform while someone shaved his hair and beard. The act of releasing such photos suggests an intention to humiliate al-Saadi and showcases a lack of full government control over the prisons. Al-Saadi is in al-Hadhba prison, which is formally under the control of the Justice Ministry, while he awaits charges for his alleged role in the 2011 government crackdown on the uprising.</p>

                <p>Since Muammar Gaddafi's removal, successive interim governments have paid little attention to building accountable institutions, while militias with regional, tribal, religious and financial objectives have gained more control and operated with an impunity that defines the new fragmented and volatile country.</p>

                <p>While myriads of militias have thrived, Libya's formal state institutions have foundered. Should Libya's core institutions, such as police, military and justice, collapse, the country would slide further into chaos. Key factors responsible for this dysfunctional justice sector include the volatile security environment, itself partly caused by the failure to prioritize justice from the start; the lack of government protection for judicial staff; the government's lack of effective control over detention facilities; continuing <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/03/07/libya-government-institutions-risk-collapse">mass arbitrary detentions</a> and torture committed mainly by militias; the passing of abusive laws; the lack of implementation of a transitional justice law and due process problems with ongoing trials.</p>

                <p>Militias and criminals have harassed, intimidated, threatened and in some cases assassinated judges, prosecutors, witnesses, lawyers and judicial staff. The government can provide little or no protection for them. At least seven judges and prosecutors have been assassinated in post-conflict Libya. Since mid-2013, the rate of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/08/libya-wave-political-assassinations">assassinations</a> of members of the armed forces, police, judges and activists has increased dramatically.</p>

                <p>As a result, judges and prosecutors have suspended the courts in major cities in the east, including Benghazi, Derna and in the south, in Sebha. The justice minister told Human Rights Watch during a meeting in March that the government was trying to transfer judges from Benghazi and Derna to Tripoli to offer them at least some kind of protection&#8212;he was powerless to protect them in their cities. Some former judges who have received death threats have opted to leave the country. Recently, one political activist told me his father, a respected judge in Benghazi, had just received his first death threat. He told me his father now dares not leave his home. </p>

                <p>There is a real risk of a complete breakdown of law and order should the judicial system in key regions in Libya remain suspended.</p>

                <p>The Justice Ministry says it holds 6,100 detainees in twenty-six prisons it administers across the country. In fact, it has only nominal control over most facilities, while militias and armed groups call the shots. According to the Justice Ministry, only about 600 of the detainees have been convicted and received prison sentences, mostly those accused of common crimes; the rest are either being held in pre-charge detention, have been charged but are awaiting trial or are under investigation by the general prosecutor. </p>

                <p>Militias and government authorities have held some of those detained in relation to the 2011 uprising for three years without affording them access to a lawyer, presenting them to a judge or charging them with any crime. Detainees, family members, local organizations and the <a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/libya/torture-and-deaths-detention-libya-enar">UN</a> report widespread ill-treatment of detainees in facilities across Libya, which has resulted in deaths in custody. The Libyan authorities have failed to end this mass arbitrary detention by releasing all those not charged by a court within a reasonable time.</p>

                <p>In December, Libya's legislative authority, the General National Congress, passed a law on transitional justice (Law 29/2013), replacing an older law on transitional justice and national reconciliation passed in 2012 by the National Transitional Council, Libya's interim governing body until July 2012 elections established the interim parliament. The new law is no more than ink on paper. Almost four months later, the parliament has failed to establish the fact-finding commission stipulated in the law. The government meanwhile failed to implement the provision of the transitional justice law calling on Defense, Interior and Justice Ministries to transfer all detainees into state custody and release those who will not be charged by March 2.</p>

                <p>The Judicial Police, the main body responsible for the protection of judges and prosecutors (but is also the body in charge of running Justice Ministry detention facilities), is weak, lacks training and is ill-equipped.</p>

                <p>Instead of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2014/01/21/priorities-legislative-reform-0">reforming</a> Gaddafi-era laws, successive interim authorities have also passed abusive new laws that violate human rights, including a controversial laws that (1) exclude from future government and public employment a large number of people who worked in public corporations and in the government under Gaddafi and (2) grant widespread immunity from prosecution for anti-Gaddafi fighters.</p>

                <p>Violence has escalated since parliament's <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/04/libya-reject-political-isolation-law">passing</a> of a "political isolation" law in May 2013, encompassing the removal from office of members of the judiciary. Militias besieged the parliament and several ministries and forced members to pass the law under threat of force. Many judges feared for their positions due to the overbroad criteria for removing judges and prosecutors from active duty who had served under the Gaddafi government, as the law stipulates. One prominent judge from Benghazi told me instead of waiting to be "isolated," he would resign and work as a lawyer. While no statistics are yet available, judges and prosecutors fear that full implementation of the law would remove a large number of active judges, risking further instability in an already volatile justice system.</p>

                <p>Selective justice in Libya's courts is also dangerous. As far as we have been able to determine, no member of a militia, and no one-time anti-Gaddafi fighter, is on trial or has been convicted and sentenced for crimes related to the 2011 conflict, including torture, rape and arbitrary detention. In fact, a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/05/11/libya-amend-new-special-procedures-law">law</a> (NTC law 38/2012 on some special measures) passed by the National Transitional Council grants widespread immunity from prosecution for acts aimed at "promoting or protecting the 2011 revolution." </p>

                <p>While few cases have gone to trial, Libyan military and civil courts have passed harsh sentences, including the death sentence, for crimes committed by Gaddafi loyalists during the 2011 conflict and for common crimes such as murder. Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/10/04/libya-suspend-death-sentences-against-gaddafi-loyalists">documented</a> at least twenty-eight death sentences&#8212;including twelve in absentia&#8212;by military and civil courts in Misrata, Benghazi and elsewhere since the end of the 2011 uprising. As far as we have been able to determine, formal state courts have not carried out any of these death sentences. Lawyers, family members and defendants have described to Human Rights Watch a lack of the most basic due process rights and fair trial standards, including violations of the right to access a lawyer before and during the proceedings and of the right to review the case file, along with the subjection of detainees to interrogations by non-state actors, and allegations of forced confessions.</p>

                <p>The general prosecutor announced plans to open a trial of 38 former officials in the Gaddafi government on April 14, 2014, including another Gaddafi son, Saif al-Islam, who is being held in the mountain town of Zintan, and the former intelligence chief Abdullah Sanussi, who is at al-Hadhba prison in Tripoli. The prosecutor's office also announced that al-Saadi Gaddafi will be included in the same trial. Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/02/13/libya-gaddafi-son-ex-officials-held-without-due-process">visited</a> several Gaddafi-era officials held in detention in Tripoli and Saif al-Islam Gaddafi in Zintan in January and found that Saif al-Islam and Abdullah Sanussi, both wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, had both been deprived of a most basic right&#8212;they had no lawyers during the entire pre-trial phase, which has already extended for years.</p>

                <p>The Libyan government should take immediate steps to make the justice system functional. The government should work toward ending mass arbitrary detentions, release all detainees who are not yet charged with any crime, provide all defendants on trial with their due process rights, including the right to a lawyer and urgently build a strong and accountable Judicial Police&#8212;or risk a total collapse of the system.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.brannlaw.com/info.php?sec=2&pid=21">Peter J. Brann</a>, <a href="http://www.brannlaw.com/info.php?sec=2&pid=7">David Swetnam-Burland</a> and <a href="http://www.brannlaw.com/info.php?sec=2&pid=9">Stacy O. Stitham</a> of <a href="http://www.brannlaw.com/info.php?info_id=1">Brann &#38; Isaacson</a> discuss the patent eligibility of computer-implemented inventions...</p>

                <p>The US Supreme Court's consideration of the patent eligibility of computer-implemented inventions in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/13-298"><spanclass="casename">Alice Corporation Pty., Ltd. v. CLS Bank International, et al</span></a>, has drawn commentary not only from the usual suspects (patent and intellectual property law organizations, software and technology vendors and tech companies), but from seemingly unlikely corners. In one such corner can be found a coalition of retailers and retail trade associations. What interest do businesses that sell clothes, electronics and other goods have in patents to computer-implemented inventions? The simple truth is that retailers with an online presence, rather than software or computer service providers, are the ones on the front lines of patent infringement lawsuits claiming infringement of computer-implemented patents by some facet or feature of retail websites they use in their efforts to sell products to the American consumer. These retailers have had enough of patent claims to nothing more than well-established sales techniques performed "on a computer" or "over the Internet."    </p>

                <p>Our firm recently filed an <em>amicus</em> brief on behalf of twenty-three retailers and retail trade associations, including the National Restaurant Association and Retail Litigation Center, Inc., seeking a clear rule of law that can be applied at the beginning of a lawsuit. That is, retailers want certainty on what the law is and a speedy method for resolving disputes over patents that should never have been issued. Whether or not a claimed invention is patentable under 35 USC &#167; 101 should be a <em>threshold</em> issue that can be addressed in many, if not most, cases on a motion to dismiss at the start of the litigation. This not only follows as a straight line from the Supreme Court's recent patent decisions, but is necessary to fulfill the mandate of section 101, which, after all, is entitled "Inventions Patentable." Notwithstanding that, in our view, clear mandate, section 101 is often treated as the redheaded stepchild of patent law&#8212;and the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's muddled opinion in <span class="casename">CLS Bank</span> left the doctrine in an even worse state than it found it. If the underlying "invention" is abstract and so not eligible to be patented, then accused infringers should not have to undertake the expense of proving at summary judgment or trial that the patent is not infringed or is anticipated or obvious in light of some prior art. As noted in our <em>amicus</em>, that is like being forced by the DMV to pay for expensive repairs on a used car in order to obtain a new inspection sticker only to be told <em>after</em> the car passes inspection that the person who sold you the car never had title to it in the first place.</p>

                <p>We argue that the threshold test emerging from <span class="casename">CLS Bank</span> should be that computer-implementation cannot create patentable subject matter. Just as a <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/putative">putative</a> inventor cannot simply recite a law of nature and then add the instruction "apply the law," a putative inventor cannot simply recite an abstract or general idea and then add the instruction "apply it on a computer." <spanclass="casename"><a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-1150.pdf">Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Labs., Inc.</a></span> (PDF).</p>

                <p>Currently, there is not a single rule of law that can be applied either at the outset or the conclusion of litigation to address this issue. The splintered six opinions of the <em>en banc</em> federal circuit opinion spanning over 125 pages, none of which represents the opinion of a majority, means that no one can be certain what is patentable until they learn the makeup of their panel on appeal. Patent eligibility should not be based on the luck of the draw. </p>

                <p>This lack of certainty has serious, real-world consequences, which are being imposed on American retailers. Computer-implemented patents are among the fastest growing category of patents, the patents most likely to be litigated and the patents least likely to be found valid and infringed if litigated to the bitter end. Further, they are more likely than others to be asserted against companies that merely use the accused software, such as retailers who sell goods over the Internet, and not the companies that wrote the accused source code. Because of the cost of litigating a patent case to judgment, in which non-infringement and invalidity will only be determined after defendants have expended enormous, usually unrecoverable, sums of money. Computer-implemented patents are also among the patents least likely to be litigated to a final judgment, particularly by companies that use, but did not create, the accused technology. So long as the plaintiff prices a settlement below the enormous costs of full-blown litigation, which is the norm in this arena, most defendants will opt for a cost-of-litigation settlement instead of litigating the patentability of even the gauziest of patents. Even if a panel of academics could agree on a definition of patentability, if it is not expressed in a clear legal rule that can be applied at the beginning of the litigation by a district court judge, that doctrine will remain academic for most defendants.</p>

                <p>The argument before the Supreme Court in <span class="casename">CLS Bank</span> suggests that the justices are prepared to consider the perspectives of all <em>amici</em>&#8212;including retailers&#8212;as Justice Elena Kagan <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-298_869d.pdf">asked</a>  (PDF):</p>

                <blockquote>"Can I give you a hypothetical, Mr. Phillips, and you tell me how it's different or the same. Let's say, you know, 30 years ago somebody took a look around the world and said, a lot of people seem to order product by mail. They get the catalogues in the mail and then they send back their return forms. And let's say that one of the founders of the Internet said, wouldn't this be an amazing system, we could actually do this by computer, and they had patented that. Is that the same?"</blockquote>

                <p>After years of uncertainty and divergent opinions, the trial judges, parties and attorneys on the front lines of patent infringement litigation deserve a clear standard, <em>whatever</em> that might be, that can be applied and tested at the outset of any patent case. Not only would this fulfill the mandate that section 101 is a threshold test of eligibility, it would provide a practical solution to the real-world problem that the examination of a patent's validity is frequently delayed until after cost considerations make pursuing that challenge impractical and unsound. The American legal system should be invested in weeding out the worst patents at the earliest opportunity and the least cost to courts and litigants. The present system virtually ensures that the viability of such patents are rarely, if ever, tested and only then after the maximum expenditure of time and money. We hope the Supreme Court seizes the opportunity of <span class="casename">CLS Bank</span> to reverse this unfortunate trend. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.illinois.edu/faculty/profile/sarabenson">Sara Benson</a> of the University of Illinois College of Law discusses how the best argument for same-sex marriage is that same-sex partners should be treated equally under the law ... </p><strong>A</strong></font>s you likely have heard, the US Supreme Court issued an opinion striking down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) last summer in the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdf">Windsor</a> [PDF] case. What you may not have heard as much about is how the aftermath of this decision will change the tenor of the legal arguments advocates make in favor of same sex marriage, especially in light of <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-13-17.pdf">IRS interpretations</a> [PDF] of the decision. The <span class="casename">Windsor</span> <br />
 decision struck down DOMA, but it did not tell the government how to interpret federal regulations related to marriage and the relationship between civil unions, same-sex marriage, and "traditional" marriage. In other words, the <span class="casename">Windsor</span> decision left open much room for interpretation by the government. </p>

<p>The single largest issue related to DOMA is whether same-sex couples have the right to receive the same treatment under the federal tax code as "traditionally" married couples. Indeed, the purpose of DOMA was to deprive same-sex couples of any benefits from federal law related to marriage by limiting federal recognition of marriage to a "legal union between one man and one woman ... " It was safe to presume, after the <span class="casename">Windsor</span> decision declared DOMA to be unconstitutional, that same sex couples would now be able to file taxes as "married" under federal tax laws and receive inheritance tax exclusions on the death of a spouse. In fact, the exact issue in the <span class="casename">Windsor</span> case was whether Edith (Edie) WIndsor could be refunded the $363,053 in estate taxes that she paid after the death of her legal (under New York law) same-sex spouse. However, the issue remained as to whether civil unions equated to marriages under the tax code. The government has emphatically said "no" and that answer has huge implications for same-sex marriage advocates going forward. Indeed, in my opinion, the government recognized the difference between marriage and civil unions in an effort to help gay rights advocates make more effective arguments going forward. It is no secret that President Obama outwardly<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/09/politics/obama-same-sex-marriage/"> supports</a> gay marriage rights. </p>

<p>Now, the best argument (or at least the easiest one) in favor of same-sex marriage, in states where civil unions are legal, is that a coupling other than marriage is a separate, but unequal status. Formerly, when neither same-sex married couples nor same-sex couples with civil unions could obtain federal benefits because of DOMA, the argument that had to be made was that civil unions are inherently inferior to marriage and subject couples to second-class status. Of course, that type of argument still applies, as marriage is a fundamental right and has been recognized as one from as far back as <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4952619509602282484">1888</a>, but there is a far easier argument to make now. Now, advocates in states without same-sex marriage rights need not go that far. The construct of a civil union or a domestic partnership, even if granted the exact same rights under state laws, is separate, but unequal under the federal tax laws. Indeed, this argument has already been successful in New Jersey, where the state supreme court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/new-jersey-supreme-court-rules-state-must-allow-same-sex-marriages.php#.U0gmfChLrdl">refused</a> to stay same-sex marriages during an appeal for that very reason. There has been a flurry of movement in the same-sex marriage movement since the <span class="casename">Windsor</span> decision. My home state of Illinois, for instance, passed an amendment to state law to recognize same-sex marriages as of June 1, 2014. Usually, when one listens to the floor debates regarding these types of proposed amendments, one hears themes of fundamental rights, equal treatment of gay and lesbian citizens and their children, and the like. But, the easiest and best argument is often left out. In my opinion, the best argument post-<span class="casename">Windsor</span> for same-sex marriage in states like Illinois is not about the right for individuals to love whomever they choose, but rather for same sex partners to be treated equally under the law&#8212;in particular, federal tax law.</p>

		<title>Court Backs IRS in Fight Over the Tax Treatment of Severance</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2014/04/william-weissman-irs-refunds/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.littler.com/people/william-hays-weissman">William Hays Weissman</a> of <a href="http://www.littler.com/">Littler Mendelson</a> analyses the Supreme Court's recent ruling that tax refunds were unavailable for severance packages...</p>

                <p>In <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/supreme-court-rules-tax-unavailaable-for-severance-packages.php">US v. Quality Stores, Inc.</a>, the Supreme Court once again backed the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) interpretation of tax law, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-1408_6468.pdf">holding</a> (PDF) that severance payments were taxable for Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) purposes. The case was closely watched because a decision in favor of the taxpayer could have resulted in over $1 billion in refund claims. While holding in favor of the IRS, the court still acknowledged that certain supplemental unemployment compensation benefits ("SUB pay") may be exempt from FICA if properly structured.</p>

                <p><strong>Background</strong></p>

                <p>Quality Stores, Inc. (Quality) operated a chain of retail stores. Falling on hard times, it entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 2001. As a result, Quality initially closed many of its retail stores and laid off numerous employees before eventually closing all stores and laying off all employees. When Quality terminated employees, it made severance payments to them under its severance plans. The severance was paid as a direct result of the employees' involuntary separation from employment. The severance payments were not tied to the receipt of state unemployment compensation and were not attributable to the rendering of any particular past or future employment. Quality reported the severance payments as wages on employees' W-2 forms and withheld federal income tax and the employees' share of FICA taxes. It also paid the employer's share of FICA taxes on the severance payments.</p>

                <p>In 2002, Quality filed refund claims with the IRS for overpaid FICA on the severance payments (plus interest on the overpayment). The claims included both the employer's and the employees' share of FICA (for those employees who consented to Quality making the refund request for them).</p>

                <p>The bankruptcy court ruled in favor of Quality, finding that the severance payments were not "wages" for purposes of FICA taxes. The IRS appealed to the federal district court, which affirmed the bankruptcy court, concluding that, because the severance payments met the definition of "SUB pay" under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title26/html/USCODE-2010-title26-subtitleC-chap24-sec3402.htm">&#167; 3402(o)(2)</a>, they were not "wages" for purposes of income tax or FICA withholding.<br />
                    The IRS then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which also <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8510778734638060381">held</a> for the taxpayer. The court began by defining the two issues before it as: (1) whether the payments by Quality constituted SUB payments under federal law; and (2) if so, whether the payments were taxable under FICA. Utilizing the definition in IRC &#167; 3402(o), the court quickly determined that the payments qualified as SUB payments because they had been: (1) made to employees; (2) pursuant to company plans; (3) due to the employees' permanent separation of employment; (4) resulting directly from a reduction in force or discontinuance of a plant or operation; and (5) were included in the employees' gross incomes. It then concluded, based on the heading to the section covering IRC &#167; 3402(o) and the legislative history of the statute, that SUB payments "do not constitute wages or remunerations for services."</p>

                <p>The Sixth Circuit acknowledged its holding was in direct contrast to the holding in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4414885152114764008">CSX Corp. v. United States</a>, which held that SUB pay was wages subject to FICA, and made a thinly veiled plea to the US Supreme Court to "provide us with the current resolution of these difficult issues under the law as it currently stands" or for Congress to "clarify the statutes concerning the imposition of FICA taxes on SUB payments."</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court granted the IRS' petition for <em>certiorari</em>. In a short 8-0 decision, the court appeared to have little problem finding SUB pay to be wages. Relying solely on the "plain meaning" of the IRC, the court held that severance was paid to employees for services in employment, and thus constitutes wages for purposes of FICA. The court also noted that, under IRC <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title26/html/USCODE-2011-title26-subtitleC-chap21-subchapC-sec3121.htm">&#167; 3121(a)(13)(A)</a>, the specific exemption for severance payments based on disability would not have been necessary if severance payments generally were not wages.</p>

                <p>The court then turned to whether &#167; 3402(o), relating to income-tax withholding, was a limitation on the meaning of "wages" for FICA purposes. At issue was the language "as if wages" contained in the section, with Quality arguing that it must mean that SUB pay was not wages, or else the language "as if" would be superfluous. But the court found such language was not as limiting as Quality argued, citing to the explanation used by the Federal Circuit in <span class="casename">CSX Corp.</span>: "all men shall be treated as if they were six feet tall does not imply that no men are six feet tall."</p>

                <p>After reviewing the purpose of the treatment of SUB pay as exempt from FICA and the problem Congress sought to resolve relating to income tax withholding, the court held that the Sixth Circuit's rationale&#8212;a larger set of SUB pay arrangements than was already exempt from withholding under IRS revenue rulings meaning that all SUB pay arrangements were excluded from the definition of wages&#8212;was not sustainable, even if not entirely illogical. The court concluded: "The better reading is that Congress determined that, whatever position the IRS took with respect to certain categories of severance payments, the problem with withholding should be solved by treating all severance payments as wages requiring withholding." Finally, citing IRS <a href="http://www.charitableplanning.com/document/673232">Revenue Ruling 90-72</a>, the court acknowledged that SUB pay can still be excluded from FICA, although Quality's severance plans did not meet the requirements of the Revenue Ruling, and was thus not at issue.</p>

                <p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>

                <p>For the second time in two years, the court has addressed specific exemptions from FICA potentially worth billions of dollars to taxpayers. In 2011, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3055490070969307951">Mayo Foundation v. United States</a>, the court held that the Treasury Department's regulation defining medical residents for purposes of the FICA student exemption was reasonable. In <span class="casename">Quality Stores</span> the court implicitly endorsed the IRS's interpretation of &#167; 3402(o), while passing the question of whether IRS revenue rulings defining exempt SUB pay were themselves reasonable.<br />
                    In light of <span class="casename">CSX Corp.</span>, and the IRS' long-standing interpretation of FICA, the court's decision is not really a dramatic departure of any kind. Rather, it appears to continue the court's deference to the IRS' interpretation of tax law&#8212;whether it is interpreting its own regulations or the plain meaning of the IRC. Much of the court's decision in <span class="casename">Quality Stores</span> appears grounded in a common sense approach to reading the IRC, rather than being overly technical about the meaning of the law. That taxpayer only took the position as a claim for refund, rather than a filing position, possibly suggesting that it was being cautious about the legal underpinnings of the position.</p>

                <p>In Revenue Ruling 90-72 the IRS set forth eight criteria for creating exempt SUB pay:<blockquote>(1) Benefits are paid only to unemployed former employees who are laid off by the employer;<br />
                    (2) Eligibility for benefits depends upon meeting prescribed conditions after terminating employment with the employer;<br />
                    (3) Benefits are paid by trustees of independent trusts;<br />
                    (4) The amount of weekly benefits payable is based upon state unemployment benefits, other compensation allowable under state laws, and the amount of straight-time weekly pay;<br />
                    (5) The duration of the benefits is affected by the fund level and the employee's seniority;<br />
                    (6) The right to benefits does not accrue until a prescribed period after termination of employment;<br />
                    (7) The benefits are not attributable to the rendering of particular services; and<br />
                    (8) No employee has any right, title, or interest in the fund until such employee is qualified and eligible to receive benefits.</blockquote></p>

                <p>These requirements, which derive from <a href="https://www.charitableplanning.com/document/665330">Revenue Ruling 56-249</a>, mean that employers need to fund a trust out of which benefits are paid to employees, with the amount paid being tied to the employees' receipt of state unemployment benefits. As originally conceived in the 1950s, the idea of SUB pay was that if an employee earned $100 per week in wages, but only received $60 in state unemployment benefits, the SUB pay would be $40, so that the employee was essentially "whole." But severance plans today do not typically work that way. Rather, severance plans may pay a lump sum upon termination, often in exchange for a release by the employee of any employment-related claim the employee might otherwise bring. The amounts are not paid out of a trust, nor are they tied to the employee's receipt of state unemployment benefits. An employee who obtains other employment immediately following his or her termination would still receive severance even though never receiving unemployment benefits. This appears to be very different from the concept of SUB pay as originally designed.<br />
                    <br />
                    The court's decision does not hold that SUB pay cannot be exempt from FICA; only that severance paid under plans that are commonly in place now&#8212;both lump sums paid directly by the employer to employees or salary continuation payments that are essentially the same as regular wages&#8212;are not exempt from FICA. Employers still could comply with Revenue Ruling 90-72 so as to be in a position to have SUB pay plans where the payments are exempt from FICA.<br />
                    <br />
                    Taxpayers could also challenge the IRS's requirements set forth in Revenue Ruling 90-72 as not being a reasonable interpretation of the definition of SUB pay. For example, taxpayers could take the position that the trust requirement to qualify as exempt SUB pay is an unreasonable extension of the IRC. Employers could also try working with either the IRS or Congress to create a more usable definition of SUB pay. Moreover, employers could fashion both exempt SUB pay and non-exempt SUB pay plans in combination, although it is questionable whether the tax savings would be worth the effort.<br />
                    <br />
                    The <span class="casename">Quality Stores</span> case is another example of creative practitioners seeking to exploit ambiguities in tax law. There is no reason not to try, but the court's decision upholding the government's interpretation suggests taxpayers face an uphill battle in their attempts to do so.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://inilak.ac.rw/bkp/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=249&Itemid=261">Fred K. Nkusi</a> of the Independent Institute of Lay Adventists of Kigali and Mount Kenya University in Rwanda argues that the twentieth anniversary of the Rwandan genocide is a period of mourning for those lost as well as remembrance of the international community's failure to comply with its international obligations ... </p><strong>O</strong></font>n April 7, 2014, Rwanda held commemorative events for the twentieth anniversary of the 1994 Rwandan genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. As President Paul Kagame remarked in his <a href="http://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/index.php?i=15686&a=75924">speech</a>: "we are gathered here to remember those who lost their lives in the genocide and comfort those who survived." The mourning week reminds Rwandans and the international community of the tragic events in 1994 in which a million Tutsi Rwandans&#8212;the minority ethnic group&#8212;were largely exterminated. While the brutal killings were occurring, the global community stood by idly and essentially spectated the mass slaughter, something Ban Ki-Moon&#8212;the UN Secretary-General&#8212; recently <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-sg-expresses-regret-for-inaction-during-rwanda-genocide.php#.U0jro-ZdU8w">apologized</a> for on behalf of the international community. As well known, the genocide lasted for 100 days, until the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)&#8212;an opposition movement descended from Uganda&#8212;was able to fully liberate the country. </p>

<p>What has Rwanda done to prevent and <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/hrw-progress-has-been-made-towards-justice-in-rwanda.php#.U0kjVuZdU8x">punish</a> the crime of genocide and ensure that it never happens again? What role does the international community play in preventing and punishing the crime of genocide? Why have some of the genocide perpetrators not yet been brought to justice?</p>

<p>In July of 1994, the RPF&#8212;the dominant political party currently&#8212;ended the genocide after the liberation war. This happened when the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (NAMIR)&#8212;supposedly established to bring Rwanda security&#8212;failed to live up to its mandate. The first remarkable victory by the RPF was to halt the widespread killings of the Tutsi by Hutus militias. Secondly, the newly installed RPF government designed, <em>inter alia</em>, legal and institutional mechanisms in response to the perpetration of genocide. This was empathized in President Kagame's speech: "we have pursued justice and reconciliation as best as we could. But it does not restore what we lost."</p>

<p>In response to the genocide, Rwanda adopted <a href="http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/domestic/rwanda.htm">Organic Law No. 08/96 of August 30, 1996</a>, organizing criminal proceedings against persons accused of committing acts of genocide or other crimes against humanity from October 1, 1990 through December 31, 1994, and established special benches of ordinary and military courts to hear the cases. Five years later, the government enacted <a href="http://jurisafrica.org/docs/statutes/ORGANIC%20LAW%20N0%2040.pdf">Organic Law No. 40/2000 of January 26, 2001</a> [PDF], governing the creation of a new court system&#8212;the Gacaca Courts&#8212;to expedite the administration and reduce the costs of the proceedings. This law created a Gacaca Court at every administrative level of local government, particularly at the Cell level&#8212;the second lowest administrative unit. Both of these laws served as a lodestar to a legal and institutional framework in which justice could be brought against the perpetrators of genocide and other human rights violations.  </p>

<p>At the <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/rwanda-genocide-community-courts-officially-conclude-operations.php#.U0j61-ZdU8w">closing</a> of the Gacaca Courts in 2012, it is <a href="http://www.minijust.gov.rw/uploads/media/GACACA_COURTS_IN_RWANDA.pdf">estimated</a> [PDF] that the Gacaca Courts had tried nearly two million cases. However, not all genocide perpetrators were identified and punished for their crimes. </p>

<p>Currently, the <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.rw/fileadmin/Images2013/Rwandan_Constitution.pdf">Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda of June 4, 2003</a> [PDF], as amended to date, envisages in its Preamble that Rwanda is "[r]esolved to fight the ideology of genocide and all its manifestations and to eradicate ethnic, regional and any other form of divisions."</p>

<p>The existing Rwandan Penal Code punishes the crime of genocide and other serious international crimes. It not only punishes the crime of genocide, but also the denial of genocide. <a href="http://www.police.gov.rw/uploads/tx_download/Official_Gazette_no_Special_of_14.06.2012-4.pdf">Organic law n° 01/2012/OL of 02/05/2012</a> [PDF] &#8212;instituting the penal code&#8212;describes the Rwandan crime of genocide in Article 114, which perfectly mirrors Article 2 of the <a href="http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/convention/text.htm">UN Genocide Convention of 1948</a>. Accordingly, Article 115 of the same penal code provides: "Any person, who commits, in time of peace or in time of war, the crime of genocide as provided in the preceding Article, shall be liable to life imprisonment with special provisions." Furthermore, Article 116 states: <blockquote>Any person who publicly shows, by his/her words, writings, images, or by any other means, that he/she negates the genocide against the Tutsi, rudely minimizes it or attempts to justify or approve its grounds, or any person who hides or destroys its evidence shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of more than five (5) years to nine (9) years."</blockquote></p>

<p>In view of the existing legal framework, can one say "never again" regarding genocide in Rwanda? The answer to the question transcends a mere declaration of words on paper, and a number of conditions will likely have to be met. First, there is a need for greater political will and support of the populace to live up to notion of 'never again genocide'&#8212;to prods us into action and awakens us from passivity, indifference or ignorance in order to defeat genocide once and for all. Second, law enforcement needs greater empowerment to act as a deterrent to genocide&#8212;to ensure a strict observance and promotion of human rights and the rule of law. Third, there must be an improvement in our awareness&#8212;by promoting the general and civil education of our children in schools and institutions of higher learning&#8212;that advance the understanding that the commission of genocide, or denial of a group's right to life, is the vilest encroachment upon human rights.   </p>

<p>What is the role of the international community in preventing and punishing the crime of genocide? Without mincing my words, when I talk of the international community I specifically refer to the UN Security Council, whose primary responsibility&#8212;as enshrined in the first paragraph of <a href="https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter5.shtml">Chapter V</a>, Article 24, of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a>&#8212;is to maintain or restore international peace and security. On October 5, 1993, while Rwanda's crisis was underway, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted <a href="http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB452/docs/doc01.pdf">Resolution 872</a> [PDF], establishing the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) with explicit instructions of contributing to the security of the city of Kigali and monitoring the observance of the cease-fire agreement&#8212;during the transitional government's mandate&#8212;leading up to the elections. But UNAMIR lacked the precise authorization to halt the killing, along with enough contingent force to accomplish such a mission. On both issues the UN reneged to fulfill its directive until the volatile situation culminated into full-blown genocide. The failure of the international community to avert such a humanitarian catastrophe was an unforgivable betrayal in the eyes of many Rwandans.</p>

<p>Article 1 of the UN Genocide Convention requires signatory "[p]arties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish." The provision expressly places a legal and moral obligation on the international community to prevent and punish the crime of genocide. </p>

<p>According to Jacob Schiff's 2008 paper <a href="http://mil.sagepub.com/content/36/2/217.short">The Trouble with "Never Again!"</a>, after the Holocaust&#8212;when the Nazis conducted an exterminatory campaign against the Jews and other minority groups in Germany&#8212;the international community declared "never again," but there have been genocides and other mass atrocities in various countries since, most notably in Cambodia, <a href="/feature/featured/icty/">Srebrenica</a>, Rwanda, Kosovo, East Timor, Darfur and the current situation in Syria. Likewise, after the horrific episode in Rwanda, the international community was quick to declare 'genocide never again', but 'never again' persists throughout the world time and time again. Of course, it goes without saying that it is easier said than done. In fact, the international community's inaction portrays cynicism and indifference as opposed to hierocracy. The international community must stop merely paying lip service where urgent action is desperately needed.</p>

<p>In utter shame, the UN Security Council adopted <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N95/140/97/PDF/N9514097.pdf?OpenElement">Resolution 955</a> [PDF] as a response to the 1994 genocide and their subsequent inaction, which called for: <blockquote>An international tribunal for the sole purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for genocide and other serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of Rwanda and Rwandan citizens responsible for genocide and other such violations committed in the territory of neighboring States, between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1994.</blockquote>The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ("ICTR") had jurisdiction over genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Rwanda and neighboring countries by Rwandans within the preceding specific time frame&#8212;<em>ratione temporis</em>. The establishment of the ICTR was a measure to restore peace and security by forging a sense of justice; nevertheless, the UN deserves little&#8212;if any&#8212;credit precisely because it was a measure taken after failing to discharge its responsibilities in the first place. At this juncture, some of the genocide perpetrators are still shuttling around the world and have never been brought to justice. As ever disappointing Rwandans, no measures have been taken against countries harboring them. It is very likely that some of the perpetrators may go unpunished throughout the remainder of their lives. There is a general lack of genuineness by some countries to arrest the suspects or extradite them to Rwanda. Despite their dismal response to Rwanda's situation during the genocide's occurrence, today, one would laud the international community for their swift response in <a href="/feature/featured/south-sudan/">South Sudan</a>, Mali and the Central African Republic (CAR), where the situations are approaching a restoration of peace and security. However, the Syrian crisis is yet another shift of the blame to the UN Security Council&#8212;which has become a dead end&#8212;where the P-5 members are safeguarding their subjective interests instead of actively resolving a dire situation. </p>

<p>At this particular juncture in time&#8212;as Rwandans reflect on the horrific events that occurred during the 1994 genocide&#8212;one would opine that the UN ought to revisit its legal and moral obligation outlined in its legal framework as well as the Genocide Convention of 1948. </p>

		<title>The Federal Bank Fraud Statute: Loughrin v. United States</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.mto.com/lawyers/Daniel-B-Levin">Daniel B. Levin</a> and <a href="http://www.mto.com/lawyers/Victoria-A-Degtyareva">Victoria A. Degtyareva</a> of <a href="http://www.mto.com/">Munger, Tolles &#38; Olson LLP</a> discuss the federal bank fraud statute and <span class="casename">Loughrin v. United States</span>...</p>

                <p>Kevin Loughrin and an accomplice used six stolen and altered checks to steal just over $1,000 from a local Target store. They stole checks from mailboxes, crossed out the payees' names and payment amounts and wrote in "Target" and new amounts next to the original text. They used the altered checks to purchase food and merchandise, which they then returned often without even leaving the store. <br />
                    <br />
                    There was no evidence that Loughrin intended to defraud a bank. On the contrary, the evidence at trial showed that most of the checks were intercepted by Target's staff and were never even submitted to a bank. </p>

                <p>Despite the tenuous connection between Loughrin's conduct and any federally regulated bank, the government charged Loughrin with six counts of federal bank fraud under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1344">18 USC &#167; 1344(2)</a> and two counts of aggravated identity theft under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1028A">18 USC &#167; 1028A</a> . He was convicted and sentenced to thirty-six months in prison&#8212;twelve months on the bank fraud charges and a mandatory consecutive term of two years for identify theft. If he been convicted of forging checks under state law in Utah, where the crime occurred, he would have likely been sentenced to less than a year.</p>

                <p>The question presented in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/loughrin-v-united-states/">Loughrin v. United States</a>, which was argued before the Supreme Court on April 1, 2014, was whether the federal bank fraud statute could be interpreted so broadly that it covers any fraudulent scheme to obtain funds from a bank, even when the defendant had no intent to defraud a bank. <br />
                    <br />
                    The bank fraud statute contains two clauses: the first clause prohibits schemes intended to defraud a financial institution; the second clause prohibits schemes to obtain money or property that is owned or controlled by a financial institution through false representations. The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that, under the second clause, the government is not required to prove that a defendant intended to defraud a bank and expose it to a risk of loss. As long as the defendant intended to defraud someone and funds stored in a bank were involved, the defendant can be convicted of federal bank fraud. </p>

                <p>The justices repeatedly questioned the breadth of the government's and the Tenth Circuit's reading. Justice Kagan asked whether a defendant who passed off a painting she made in her kitchen as the work of a famous artist would be guilty of bank fraud if the unwitting buyer paid with a check. The government's answer was "yes." Justices Sotomayor and Scalia asked whether a defendant who falsely promised to paint someone's house and took a $100 check as payment would be guilty of bank fraud. Again, the government's answer was "yes," as long as the painter intended to obtain money he understood might come from a bank. Scalia told the government that its position "extend[s] federal law enormously into the kind of stuff that we've usually left to the states." Hearing these examples, Justice Kennedy commented: "you have federalized every fraudulent transaction in the economy whenever a check is involved." </p>

                <p>The justices' concerns are well founded. The court should not broadly interpret federal criminal statutes to cover petty offenses that have traditionally been handled by the states absent some clear indication that Congress intended to expand the reach of federal criminal law. </p>

                <p>Significant problems arise when identical conduct may be prosecuted in either state or federal court. When dual jurisdiction exists, the decision to file charges in federal rather than state court can have major consequences. Federal law often provides fewer procedural protections to defendants, including more powerful grand juries, lower standards for the approval of search warrants, lower burdens of proof to justify wiretaps and more restricted discovery of the government's case. And federal offenses often carry more severe penalties than their state law equivalents. Federal criminal statutes use more mandatory minimum sentences than many state laws and the federal sentencing guidelines generally recommend harsher penalties than many states' guidelines. </p>

                <p>Loughrin's case shows that the consequences of federal prosecution are real. He faced a relatively minor sentence on the state side. Once the federal government decided to bring charges, he faced not only a thirty-year statutory maximum under the bank fraud statute, but because bank fraud is a predicate for aggravated identity theft, he also faced a mandatory minimum, consecutive sentence of two years. Loughrin challenged the government's interpretation of the statute and went to trial, which left him with a three-year sentence, but the threat of a mandatory minimum sentence compels many defendants to accept plea deals.</p>

                <p>The Tenth Circuit's interpretation of federal bank fraud is just one example of a major trend toward the federalization of criminal law. A 2010 <a href="https://www.nacdl.org/withoutintent/">study</a> by the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/">Heritage Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.nacdl.org/">National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers</a> found that the number of criminal offenses in the US Code has increased from 3,000 in the early 1980s to over 4,450 by 2008. And the number of defendants prosecuted in federal courts has grown from 67,000 in 1996 to 102,931 in 2011. </p>

                <p>Federal criminal statutes were historically limited to a small subset of crimes that affected uniquely federal interests such as treason or bribery of a federal official, but federal law now reaches many purely local crimes that are already covered by state law. The result is an overlapping and largely redundant system in which similarly situated defendants receive substantially different treatment depending only on where they are prosecuted.</p>

                <p>In addition to the effects on individual defendants, unnecessarily expanding federal criminal law also negatively impacts the overall administration of criminal justice. It burdens the relatively limited resources of federal courts by making them a venue for the prosecution of minor local crimes. It creates counterproductive competition between state and federal authorities and leads to the ineffective duplication of  investigative, prosecutorial and judicial resources. And it undermines the vital role of the states in prosecuting crime by creating the perception that state prosecutors and state courts are not capable of handling these types of cases. </p>

                <p>Admittedly, the federalization of criminal law is often based on legislation that explicitly federalizes crimes that had previously been within the province of state courts. But whatever the wisdom of Congress' decision to expand federal criminal law, the court need not consider the extent of Congress' power to do so in this case. Loughrin was convicted for federal bank fraud and received a much harsher penalty than similar defendants in state court without any clear indication from Congress, either in the text of the bank fraud statute or in the legislative history, that it intended to subject people accused of this type of petty fraud to federal prosecution.</p>

                <p>In the absence of a clear Congressional statement and in light of the dangers of bringing minor local crimes within the scope of federal criminal jurisdiction, the court should reject the government's broad interpretation of the federal bank fraud statute and use this case as an opportunity to limit the over-federalization of criminal law.   </p>

                <p><br />

Hommel discusses false identification of military personnel who have engaged in acts of valor and the Stolen Valor Act, which criminalizes these claims...</j:header>Meet Xavier Alvarez. He stated that he played hockey for the Detroit Red Wings,<br />
served as a police officer and even married a Mexican starlet. Then on July 23, 2007, Alvarez attended his first public meeting as a newly elected director of the Three Valley Water District Board in Claremont, California. He introduced himself as a retired marine for twenty-five years and a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor. However, Alvarez never played hockey, never served as a police officer, never married a Mexican starlet and never served in any branch of the US armed forces. Unfortunately, Alvarez's lies about military service are not unique. Since the advent of military decorations, individuals have falsely claimed awards and honors reserved for those men and women who have actually engaged in acts of valor and heroism.</p>

<p>In 2006, Congress adopted the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/704">Stolen Valor Act &#167; 704</a>, which criminalizes false claims of military awards&#8212;verbal or written. In passing the law, Congress stated that fraudulent claims surrounding the receipt of military medals damages the awards' reputation and meaning. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2853347803518998660">United States v. Alvarez</a>, the US Supreme Court found that the Stolen Valor Act was unconstitutional under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment's</a> free speech protections. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, was of the opinion that lying alone without an accompanying action is insufficient to trigger a criminal penalty. For example, federal impersonation laws punish false claims when a person not only assumes the identity of an officer but also acts like one specifically within the jurisdiction of the three branches of the government. Without that caveat, it bears emphasizing that there could be a nearly limitless prohibition of false statements to any person, at any time and in any context. Accordingly, this limitation narrows the conduct to when the liar involves himself or herself in affairs directly within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative or judicial branches and then makes a false statement or representation.</p>

<p>In light of the Supreme Court's concerns, Congress <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/06/obama-signs-stolen-valor-act-into-law/">amended</a> the Stolen Valor Act in 2012 to target military imposters who intentionally obtain money, property or "tangible benefits" by falsely claiming to be recipients of military honors, including the Congressional Medal of Honor. Even under the revisions, the Stolen Valor Act remains problematic because the statute is still overly broad. Specifically, while the "money" and "property" provisions are clear, the "tangible benefit" language is particularly prone to conflicting interpretations because the statute fails to define "tangible benefit."</p>

<p>A balancing test is necessary to determine what exactly qualifies as "tangible benefits." In determining what constitutes "tangible benefits" under a Stolen Valor Act claim, the Attorney General, or a court, should consider: (1) The amount of financial or material gain; (2) how, if any, individuals were harmed to the extent that it is quantifiable; (3) if there is direct harm to an actual medal recipient; (4) whether the lie resulted in substantial injustice; or (5) the nature of the liar and the magnitude of the lie. Every one of these factors need not be established, and no one factor is dispositive. Let's take each of these factors one at a time.</p>

<p><strong>Financial or Material Gain<br />
</strong>Of course, the more of a benefit you get, the more likely the results of the lie become a "tangible benefit." In that regard, getting a few drinks at a bar is not substantial enough to rise to the level of a "tangible benefit" which would result in criminal conviction; however, if you are able to put that honor on a resume and secure a job, that should be actionable under the Stolen Valor Act.</p>

<p><strong>Quantifiable Harm<br />
</strong>The analysis must also consider what, if any, harm is posed by the lie&#8212;in other words, if there are any individuals who have suffered because of the lie. If we can pinpoint the harm and quantify it like in the <span class="casename">Alvarez</span> case, we can target the most reprehensible actors.</p>

<p><strong>Direct Harm to an Actual Medal Recipient<br />
</strong>If the true medal recipient was in the pool of possible recipients for the benefit and denied the possibility of receiving it because of an imposter's actions, this determination might be a highly dispositive factor. For instance, a 10-year Marine Corps sergeant secured $66 million in security contracts <a href="http://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt84/CRPT-113hrpt84.pdf">under false pretenses</a> (PDF).</p>

<p><strong>Substantial Injustice<br />
</strong>The presence of substantial injustice is highly probative when gauging whether something qualifies as a "tangible benefit." You do not need "intent to defraud" under this formulation. Instead, this factor focuses on whether the receipt of the "tangible benefit" was directly related to an actual recipient's failure to get the "tangible benefit." </p>

<p><strong>Nature of the Liar and Magnitude of the Lie<br />
</strong>The analysis also turns on the magnitude of the lie and the proclivity of the particular individual to make false assertions. Without question, some lies are worse than others. Some may falsely claim military honors to gain credibility for a political campaign or just to brag at a bar and gain the attention of women. Moreover, if these individuals continue to make these false claims, they appear to be the most reprehensible actors who should be punished.</p>

<p>In sum, these factors should square with the legislative purpose of the statute&#8212;that is, to ferret out the worst actors and punish them. This test should provide a blueprint for the courts and the Attorney General to assess what qualifies as a "tangible benefit." As discussed above, the analysis can focus on: (1) The amount of financial or material gain; (2) how, if any, individuals were harmed to the extent that it is quantifiable; (3) if there is direct harm to an actual medal recipient; (4) whether the lie resulted in substantial injustice; or (5) the nature of the liar and the magnitude of the lie. Therefore, it will be identifiable alongside the already-established "money" and "property" provisions of the statute.</p>

		<title>A New Approach to Marijuana Regulation: In Support of a Potency Tax</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/ball-w-david/">W. David Ball</a> of Santa Clara School of Law argues that the recent trend of states and cities&#8212;most recently in Washington, DC&#8212;to pass legislation decriminalizing marijuana is a step in the right direction, but does not go far enough towards elevating the problems and costs of prohibition. Professor Ball instead argues that governments should consider regulating marijuana through a potency tax ... </p><strong>T</strong></font>he District of Columbia recently <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/dc-mayor-signs-bill-to-decriminalize-marijuana.php#.U0EN461dWuo">enacted</a> a bill that decriminalized the possession of up to an ounce of marijuana. The move will undoubtedly address some of the harms of prohibition. Racial disparities in the criminal enforcement of marijuana possession laws are <a href="https://www.aclu.org/billions-dollars-wasted-racially-biased-arrests">stark</a> throughout the country&#8212;particularly in <a href="http://www.washlaw.org/pdf/wlc_report_racial_disparities.pdf">Washington, DC</a> [PDF]. While it is true that most states in the US do not incarcerate someone for mere possession&#8212;although not in, say, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/crime/article/Bill-easing-Louisiana-marijuana-penalties-derailed-5374211.php">Louisiana</a>&#8212;people are still arrested for marijuana possession with astounding <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/persons-arrested/persons-arrested">frequency</a>. These arrests can consume officer time; lead to incarceration in a number of other ways&#8212;sentencing, failing to make bail, just waiting for the case to be processed&#8212;and even <a href="http://cad.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/05/23/0011128713492496.abstract">amplify</a> criminal behavior. Given that the criminalization of marijuana possession has done little to decrease usage and requires significant law enforcement resources that could be directed elsewhere, decriminalization is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>My problem with DC's new policy is that it does not go far enough. Decriminalization only addresses some of the harms brought about by marijuana prohibition&#8212;those stemming from criminalizing use. It does nothing to address the harms resulting from its production and distribution. Decriminalization does nothing to take criminal cartels out of the market and, more importantly, it does nothing to stop the flow of pot to kids. Regulated drug markets&#8212;like those for alcohol and tobacco&#8212;draw the line between selling to adults and selling to children. One is legal, while the other is not. Retailers of these drugs have something to lose by selling to kids&#8212;their profits from sales and their ability to stay out of prison&#8212;whereas drug dealers have little to lose relative to the risks they undertake just to operate. It is still illegal to sell pot to anyone, adults or kids.  </p>

<p>We need not choose between a completely unregulated black market and a completely unregulated legal market&#8212;one where public health takes a back seat. The rest of this essay will discuss the more nuanced ways in which policies can shift consumption and production of marijuana to minimize effects on public health, with a particular focus on the issue of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) potency&#8212;the active ingredient in marijuana.  </p>

<p>The fact that the percentage of THC in marijuana has steadily increased since the 1970s is often cited as a reason not to regulate the market. Opponents of regulation say that because marijuana is more potent, more people will be exposed to its harms. Actually, the issue of potency is one of the best reasons to legalize and regulate the market. There is no safety testing on the black market, no labeling requirement, no guarantees or warranties. Black market buyers have to trust that what sellers say they are buying is, in fact, what they are buying&#8212;but buyers cannot regulate their own usage without some idea of the potency of what they are using.</p>

<p>More than that though, potency is a product of prohibition, not a reason to keep it. Drug crimes are charged on the basis of weight, yet consumers&#8212;at least those trusting of their dealers' claims&#8212;are willing to pay more for more potent marijuana. So&#8212;all other things being equal&#8212;marijuana suppliers can make more money for the same amount of risk by increasing the potency of their product. Given that the costs of production are the same, the move to more potent strains is entirely rational. In other words, the drive to potency might be a function of the structure of the suppliers' market, not a response to demand.</p>

<p>Aside from labeling, policymakers can address potency through other tools&#8212;particularly tax policy. Pigouvian taxation theory describes tax regimes that aim to "internalize"&#8212;include within the price&#8212;the actual societal costs of a given product&#8212;its negative externalities. In other words, if there are social costs incurred by greater THC consumption, then&#8212;as we do with our other regulated drugs like tobacco and alcohol&#8212;we should tax them accordingly. This will decrease usage&#8212;assuming marijuana users are price-sensitive and marijuana is an "elastic" good&#8212;as well as provide resources for combating potential harms created by usage. For example, we want cigarettes to be as expensive to individuals as they are to society on average&#8212;maybe even a little more&#8212;so we can get people to use less of the things that create greater social costs.</p>

<p>Much of my thinking on this subject comes from <a href="http://www.centerforalcoholpolicy.org/toward-liquor-control/">Towards Liquor Control</a>, a book commissioned at the end of alcohol prohibition by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Rather than put his head in the sand about a social movement he disagreed with, he instead chose to engage with it in order to ensure that whatever regime ended up replacing prohibition minimized the social costs of alcohol consumption. Full disclosure: I too think marijuana legalization and decriminalization is coming, like it or not, and want to make sure that we minimize the harms of marijuana consumption. The authors of <em>Towards Liquor Control</em>&#8212;Raymond Fosdick and Allen Scott&#8212;essentially laid out the systems of alcohol regulation we have today: where beer, wine and liquor are subject to different regulatory regimes, with beer being most available and liquor the least. Easier access to beer was meant to soak up the demand for alcohol and prevent people from moving onto the more harmful form of alcohol: liquor. Tax policy reinforces this: beer and liquor are roughly the same price per the amount of alcohol in them, despite differences in the total volume of liquid.  </p>

<p>Ideally, we would tax both marijuana and marijuana-derived products&#8212;like concentrates or foods&#8212;on the basis of THC content. This is problematic in the absence of a standardized method for testing THC content. We all know what THC is and what it is made of, but we do not all agree on how to measure the plant's chemical composition in the same way. We need to standardize the <a href="http://liq.wa.gov/publications/Marijuana/BOTEC%20reports/1c-Testing-for-Psychoactive-Agents-Final.pdf">process</a> [PDF]. But this problem should assuredly not encourage us to structure tax policy on the basis of either price or weight. Prices in a legal market will likely plummet&#8212;as Jonathan Caulkins has convincingly <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/working_papers/WR764.html">argued</a>&#8212;and weight will merely embed the potency incentives of the black market&#8212;the same way charging by volume would equalize the prices of a pint of liquor and a pint of beer, setting aside differences in production costs.</p>

<p>Until there is a uniform testing regime, I would like to suggest an interim solution: requiring sellers to label the amount of THC on products that contain it and taxing them on that basis. This balances the incentives producers have, as low-THC strains would be cheaper but less attractive&#8212;at least to some consumers&#8212;while high-THC strains would be more expensive yet more attractive. In other words, the incentives to undersell the "real" amount of THC you have in order to avoid taxation would presumably hit producers' revenues an offsetting amount. Producers could thus make rational decisions about what part of the market they want to attract. Some might go for high cost, high potency products; while others might go for lower cost, lower potency products. But there would be no uniform drive toward high potency.</p>

<p>This would encourage differentiation on the basis of factors other than THC content&#8212;the same way wine is made for a variety of reasons, not just how wasted it makes you. It is difficult to tell what factors matter in the marijuana market since it is entirely underground, but it might be that a regulated market structured to avoid a THC potency race could result in product differentiation on the basis of taste, methods of production&#8212;such as indoor as opposed to outdoor or organic as opposed to conventional&#8212;and other factors. Marijuana contains a number of compounds besides THC that have shown promising&#8212;if anecdotal&#8212;potential to treat a range of diseases, particularly an extreme form of epilepsy known as <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/07/health/charlotte-child-medical-marijuana/">Dravet's Syndrome</a>. Given the harms of overusing any drug, creating space to compete on something besides potency makes good sense.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that it is time we started having more nuanced discussions about the manner in which we might want to regulate marijuana&#8212;assuming one can accept that regulation through an exclusively criminal regime has failed. Legal regulatory regimes can and will take a variety of forms. We must be careful to ensure that we articulate the goals of a new regime so that we can design policies to further those goals. We cannot, for example, simultaneously drive out the black market via lower prices and also raise exorbitant sums in taxes. We have to decide which is more important. Rockefeller himself understood this and noted in the introduction of <em>Toward Liquor Control</em> that he would be willing to trade higher alcohol consumption&#8212;via lower prices and taxes&#8212;if it meant getting rid of the criminal black market and all of its attendant social ills.  </p>

<p>DC has done something about marijuana, but not all it could have done. Decriminalization solves only those problems that come from criminally penalizing marijuana's use. The real missed opportunity here is the opportunity to engage with the marijuana market and structure it in a way that also reduces harms derived from its sale and production. Only a regime that legalizes and regulates production and sales can do that.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.pacificlegal.org/staff/Brian-Hodges">Brian T. Hodges</a> of the <a href="http://www.pacificlegal.org/">Pacific Legal Foundation</a> discusses the US Supreme Court's troubling decision in <span class=casename">Brandt v. US</span>...</p>

                <p>On March 10, 2014, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/supreme-court-rules-right-of-ways-abandoned-by-railroads-return-to-private-property-owners.php#.U07BhPSwKvk">issued</a> its decision in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/quiet_title_action">quiet title case</a>, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-1173_nlio.pdf">Marvin M. Brandt Revocable Trust v. US</a> (PDF). In an 8-1 decision, the court sided with a Wyoming property owner in a dispute over a proposed bicycle trail that would follow the route of an abandoned railroad line bisecting Brandts' land. The issue decided was a narrow&#8212;but extremely important&#8212;question of property law: who owns the land underlying a railroad right-of-way after it stops being used as a railway? </p>

                <p>On that question, the court ruled that railroad rights-of-way are subject to the same common law rules as any other easement. In so ruling, the court rejected the government's argument that federal land grants operate under an entirely different set of rules from other property. The government had asked the court to rule that it retained an "implied reversionary interest" in the railroad easement, such that, when the railway was abandoned, ownership would vest in the federal government, not the underlying property owner. There were many problems with the government's argument, not the least of which was that it had successfully argued the opposite position, that railroad rights-of-way are common law easements, more than 70 years ago, in the case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7805902297301602875&q=+315+U.+S.+262&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Great Northern Railway Co. v. US</a>. And an "implied reversionary interest" simply cannot exist under the common law of estates and servitudes. Thus, applying the common law of property, the court explained that the right-of-way crossing Brandts' land was extinguished upon abandonment, and, by operation of law, <span class="casename">Brandt</span> holds the property free of any servitudes. </p>

                <p>The decision, with its discussion of estates and servitudes, is destined to grace many a Property Law textbook in the coming years. But another aspect of the decision has drawn much public attention and criticism. Many commentators immediately jumped to the conclusion that the decision was a referendum on the federal government's <a href="http://www.railstotrails.org/resources/documents/resource_docs/RailstoTrailsConversionCommentary.pdf">"Rails-to-Trails" Act</a>, which seeks to convert old, abandoned railroad tracks into a nationwide system of recreational trails&#8212;several <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/opinion/greenhouse-what-lies-beneath.html?_r=1">proclaiming</a> that the sky was falling on the trails program. </p>

                <p>That reaction is not entirely unwarranted. Although the majority opinion did not make a single reference to "takings" or "rails-to-trails," those two issues provided the policy underpinnings for Justice Sonia Sotomayor's sole dissent (which drew insightful <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/03/10/sotomayor-earns-another-scolding-as-she-breaks-from-majority-in-railroad-case/">criticism</a>), in which she cautioned that, by treating railroad rights-of-way as common law easements, the court undermines the legality of thousands of miles of former rights of way that the public now enjoys as means of transportation and recreation. And lawsuits challenging the conversion of former rails to recreational trails alone may well cost American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. </p>

                <p>Sotomayor wrote that, to avoid this public financial impact, she would suspend common law understandings of property ownership when the federal government transfers land to private ownership. According to her, words like "fee" and "easement"$#151;which establish the precise ownership interest conveyed and all legal rights and expectations arising therefrom&#8212;"do not neatly track common-law definition[s]" when the government is involved. Thus, she concluded that the federal government should be allowed to convey an easement that doesn't operate like an easement in order to advance public policies like the Rails-to-Trails Act. </p>

                <p>The problem with her argument is that the takings clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> mandates that government pay just compensation when it seeks to take private property for public use. Indeed, a unanimous court made that precise point almost twenty-five years ago in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=219035289030989806&q=494+U.S.+1&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Preseault v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n</a> when it upheld the Rails-to-Trails Act against a facial challenge. In that case, the court cautioned that some of the abandoned railroad rights-of-way may be held in private ownership, which will require just compensation before converting the land into public recreational trails. Sotomayor's dissent in <span class="casename">Brandt</span>&#8212;and all of the commentary it inspired&#8212;forgets Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' famous warning in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15307284477438038942&q=260+U.S.+393&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon</a> "that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change." Thus, even though bike paths on former railroad easements may be good and desirable, it doesn't mean that the public should get the land for free.</p>

                <p>That point being made, it is important to refocus on what actually occurred in <span class="casename">Brandt</span>. The federal government tried to circumvent adverse US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit precedent&#8212;which viewed railway rights-of-way as common law easements&#8212;by filing a quiet title action in a jurisdiction that disagreed with the Federal Circuit. It was a litigation strategy to convince the US Supreme Court to overrule <span class="casename">Great Northern Railway</span> and numerous Federal Circuit cases to recognize an "implied reversionary interest" in thousands of miles of abandoned railway easements across the western states. If successful, that strategy would have redefined the very words that establish ownership of property, allowing the government to seize hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of private land without paying any compensation. Simply put, it was an attempted end-run around the takings clause. </p>

                <p>The failed strategy does not by any stretch of the imagination doom the Rails-to-Trails program. Indeed, national rail-trail advocates, the Rails to Trails Conservancy, immediately issued a press release refuting commentary predicting the demise of the trail program. The only impact that <span class="casename">Brandt</span> will have on the government's rails-to-trails policy is that, where the railway right-of-way was acquired as an easement, the government will have to condemn the land and pay the owner just compensation.</p>

                <p>To property owners, however, the ramifications of redefining the words that establish property owners would have been disastrous. Landowners rely on titles to establish ownership of property. If courts were unwilling to give effect to titles, the owners' interests and expectations in their property become potentially worthless. Indeed, if the words of conveyance were not conclusive of ownership and could be altered by implied reservations, all property traceable to a federal land grant would have a cloud on its title. In that light, <span class="casename">Brandt</span> follows the Supreme Court's longstanding policy of upholding certainty and predictability in land titles.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Senior Editor <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Leigh+Argentieri">Leigh Argentieri Coogan</a>, <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a>, Class of 2014, discusses the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Governor Corbett's implementation of Healthy PA ...</j:header><strong>A</strong>fter the US Supreme Court ruled the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3590enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr3590enr.pdf">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's</a> (ACA) (PDF) requirement for all states to expand Medicaid unconstitutional, states faced the choice of whether to expand Medicaid. Currently in Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Corbett decided that Pennsylvania will not expand Medicaid, but rather will attempt to implement <a href="http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/document/1365517/healthy-pa-doc_9_16_pdf">Healthy PA</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>The ACA <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/what-if-my-state-is-not-expanding-medicaid/">required</a> that all states expand Medicaid programs "to cover adults under 65 who make up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level." Additionally, the ACA requires coverage for those who previously fell into the <a href="http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/the-coverage-gap-uninsured-poor-adults-in-states-that-do-not-expand-medicaid/.">gaps for Medicaid coverage</a>. In the past, Medicaid only covered "low income individuals in a specified category, such as children, their parents, the aged or individuals with disabilities." However, the Supreme Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11973730494168859869">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a> ruled the ACA's requirement that all states must expand Medicaid or risk losing federal funding for Medicaid unconstitutionally coercive. Chief Justice Roberts held that what "Congress is not free to do is to penalize [s]tates that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding." The majority opinion found that altering Medicaid to include all people up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level to be such a substantial change to Medicaid as to constitute medicaid expansion as an entirely new program, rather than to consider medicaid expansion as an alteration of the existing Medicaid program.</p>

<p>Therefore, holding medicaid expansion unconstitutional allowed each state to choose whether it would implement it. For the states that decided to expand Medicaid, people who make up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level will be eligible for Medicaid. However, if a person exceeds this, she will be eligible for tax credits that lower the cost of a health plan's monthly premium purchased through the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov">Health Insurance Exchange Marketplace</a>. In a state that expanded Medicaid, the individual will find out if she is eligible for Medicaid when she fills out a Marketplace application.</p>

<p>A huge problem exists, however, for individuals who live in states that did not expand Medicaid and fall below 100 percent of the federal poverty level, because "[m]any adults in those states with incomes below 100 percent of the federal poverty level fall into a gap. Their incomes are too high to get Medicaid under their state's current rules. But their incomes are too low to qualify for help buying private coverage in the Marketplace." Medicaid expansion as originally contemplated and passed into law "required states to provide Medicaid coverage for adults between ages 18 and 65 with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, regardless of their age, family status or health. It also provides tax credits for people with incomes between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level to buy private insurance plans in the Marketplace." Therefore, for people who live in states, such as Pennsylvania, which do not cover certain individuals below the 100 percent poverty line, will not be qualified for any type of assistance with paying for the cost of health insurance. Thus, the Supreme Court's decision thwarted the entire purpose of Medicaid Expansion to provide affordable heath care coverage to our nation's poorest people, who cannot afford to pay for health insurance. </p>

<p>As of January 1, 2014, Corbett <a href="http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-State/pennsylvania.html">decided</a> not to expand Medicaid in Pennsylvania. However, Corbett created Healthy PA as a <a href="http://www.dpw.state.pa.us/healthypa/index.htm">quasi-alternative</a> for Medicaid Expansion. Corbett does not seek to expand Medicaid, but rather he submitted an application to Health and Human Services (HHS) for a &#167; 1115 waiver to restructure Pennsylvania's Medicaid program. According to Medicare.gov, "[w]aivers are <a href="http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Waivers/Waivers.html?filterBy=1115#waivers">vehicles states can use</a> to test new or existing ways to deliver and pay for health care services in Medicaid." A &#167; 1115 Research & Demonstration Projects Waiver provides states the opportunity to "apply for program flexibility to test new or existing approaches to financing and delivering Medicaid." The <a href="http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Waivers/1115/Section-1115-Demonstrations.html">purpose</a> of a &#167; 1115 waiver includes allowing states to "[e]xpand eligibility to individuals who are not otherwise Medicaid or CHIP eligible, [p]rovide services not typically covered by Medicaid, [and] [u]se innovative service delivery systems that improve care, increase efficiency and reduce costs." While Corbett appears to be expanding the number of people in Pennsylvania eligible for assistance with paying for health insurance, reducing costs to the state appears to be the only aspect of Healthy PA that truly aligns with the purpose of a &#167; 1115 waiver.</p>

<p>On February 19, 2014, Corbett <a href="http://www.dpw.state.pa.us/healthypa/index.htm">submitted</a> Pennsylvania's &#167; 1115 Waiver to HHS. The waiver consists of over 200 pages, but the most significant changes to Medicaid under Healthy PA involve new cost sharing obligations. Healthy PA will not expand the eligibility for Medicaid, but will create a new <a href="http://www.dpw.state.pa.us/cs/groups/webcontent/documents/document/c_071203.pdf">private insurance program</a> (PDF) allowing people up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level to have access to state-subsidized health insurance. Everyone applying to either Medicaid or the private insurance program will be screened to determine the status of the individual's health. Those eligible for Medicaid will be placed in either a low-risk health plan or a high-risk health plan. The individuals placed in the low-risk plan will have limited access to certain medical procedures, because those individuals have been determined healthy. Additionally, under Healthy PA, people on Medicaid will now be required to pay copayments for certain medical visits and procedures.</p>

<p>For those who do not qualify for Medicaid, but do qualify for the private insurance program, they will be able to go to the private marketplace to choose between two health plans. There will be a copayment obligation during the first year of Healthy PA. After the first year, those who make above 100 percent of the federal poverty level will have to pay monthly premiums, but no copayments. For those who make below 100 percent of the federal poverty level, but do not qualify for Medicaid, they will have to continue to pay copayments and the state will "consider changes to support incentives and personal responsibility." Therefore, those individuals may also have to pay a premium after the first year, too. Participants in both Medicaid and the private insurance program will be required to pay a $10 copay for each emergency room visit.</p>

<p>On March 5, 2014, Corbett did <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/attachment/2014/03/06/Gov-Corbett-s-letter-to-U-S-HHS-Secretary-Kathleen-Sebelius">submit an amendment</a> (PDF) to the &#167; 1115 waiver. The amendment to Healthy PA changes the encouraging employment program, an extremely contentious component of Healthy PA, from being mandatory to being optional for participating in either Medicaid or the private insurance program. Corbett alleges that this one year program would incentivize people with income below 100 percent of the federal poverty line to work in order to have reduced premiums on their health insurance. </p>

<p>Likely, HHS will reject Corbett's waiver to change Medicaid, because of the fundamental changes to Medicaid regarding cost-sharing obligations for those who truly cannot afford it. Healthy PA's cost-sharing obligations will be prohibitive for people to participate in the program, and thus, those people will not be able to access affordable health care coverage. The ACA sought to increase access to health care coverage to our nation's poorest people through eliminating special groups to be eligible for Medicaid and expanding those eligible for Medicaid to up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Healthy PA not only does not expand who may be covered under Medicaid, but requires people in Medicaid to contribute to the cost of health insurance, which does not encourage participation in Medicaid for those who make very little income.</p>

		<title>The US Says Landmines are Horrific—So Why Won&#039;t It Ban Them?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/mary-wareham">Mary Wareham</a> of <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> discusses the US use of landmines and the possibility of the US joining the Mine Ban Treaty...</p>

                <p>Since antipersonnel landmines were banned by a majority of nations 15 years ago via an international treaty, their use even by those outside the treaty has become rare, as it has become widely stigmatized. Even officials from the US, which has not banned landmines, have often expressed concern at new mine use. In 2012, for example, Susan Rice, then US ambassador to the UN, described reports that the Syrian government had used antipersonnel mines on its borders with Lebanon and Turkey as "horrific."</p>

                <p>Yet the US remains one of three-dozen countries that have yet to join the <a href="http://www.icbl.org/index.php/icbl/content/download/7050/165094/file/treatyenglish.pdf">Mine Ban Treaty</a> [PDF]. It is baffling: the US, which has not used antipersonnel mines in more than two decades, is the only member of NATO that has not banned them. </p>

                <p>In December 2009, a State Department official <a href="http://www.cartagenasummit.org/fileadmin/pdf/review-conference-2nd/tuesday/2RC-Item9c-1Dec2009-USA.pdf">informed</a> [PDF] the Second Review Conference of the Mine Ban Treaty that a comprehensive review of US landmine policy had been "initiated at the direction of President Obama." The review is examining whether the US should relinquish antipersonnel landmines and accede to the treaty. </p>

                <p>As commander in chief of the US armed forces, President Barack Obama is the ultimate decision-maker on landmine policy and will rely on the advice of his team of principal advisors. As has been the case in other countries, the president must determine whether the severe and long-lasting negative consequences of antipersonnel landmines outweigh any military benefits that could be derived from their use. That determination will go a long way in defining President Obama's legacy on disarmament, multilateralism and the rule of law.</p>

                <p>Proponents of a ban on antipersonnel mines include the 161 nations that have given up these weapons by joining the Mine Ban Treaty. They include civil society groups working under the umbrella coalition of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, co-recipient of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, including Human Rights Watch and other non-governmental organizations. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont is the principal congressional champion, having dedicated efforts over the past 20 years to eradicate these weapons through legislative initiatives such as the 1992 moratorium on US exports of antipersonnel mines and through the funding of initiatives to assist landmine victims and to clear mines. </p>

                <p>Ban proponents point to the successes of the treaty and the degree to which it has stigmatized use of the weapon while creating a new international standard of behaviour. Since the Mine Ban Treaty became binding international law on March 1, 1999, more than 47 million antipersonnel mines have been destroyed from stockpiles, large tracts of mine-affected land have been cleared and returned to productive use, the number of new landmine victims has fallen dramatically and use of the weapon is largely limited to pariah regimes. As a major contributor to the funding of mine action, the US has played an important role in some of these achievements despite not joining the Mine Ban Treaty. </p>

                <p>Few US officials have spoken on the matter while the policy review is underway, but examples can be found. On March 6, 2014, during a <a href="http://armedservices.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php%3Fview_id=2%26clip_id=303">hearing</a>  [video] of the House Armed Services Committee, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin E. Dempsey, stated he considers antipersonnel mines "to be an important tool in the arsenal of the armed forces of the United States." <br />
                    Dempsey noted that the US forces are now only allowed to use antipersonnel mines with a feature that can be set to self-destruct after a number of hours or days. These so-called smart antipersonnel mines are remotely delivered; scattered over wide areas by aircraft, artillery or rockets; and equipped with a self-destruct feature designed to blow the mine up after a pre-set period of time. </p>

                <p>The US sought unsuccessfully to exempt "self-destruct" mines from the definition of landmines covered by the ban during the 1997 negotiations of the Mine Ban Treaty but was rebuffed by its closet military allies, who concluded that the humanitarian dangers of such mines outweighed any military utility.</p>

                <p>Dempsey's defense of self-destruct mines was puzzling, as the last time the US used antipersonnel mines of any kind&#8212;self-destruct or not&#8212;was back in 1991, during the First Gulf War. Over the past 20 years the US has fought a range of conflicts&#8212;both high and low intensity&#8212;in a variety of environments and has demonstrated that it can employ alternative strategies, tactics and weaponry without resorting to antipersonnel mines. It has also spent more than $1 billion on the development and production of systems that could be considered alternatives to antipersonnel mines.</p>

                <p>Dempsey also told the House Armed Services Committee that antipersonnel landmines form part of the US capability to deter aggression and defend South Korea from an invasion by North Korea.</p>

                <p>There are two specific considerations regarding Korea for the US landmine policy review. One is the arrangement for a joint command structure that would put a US general in charge of South Korean military forces in the event of active hostilities and the potential problems that might cause if the US was party to the Mine Ban Treaty but South Korea was not. The decision taken several years ago to put South Koreans in charge of their own forces during wartime still has not been implemented, but the future command structure has been agreed so the implementation delay should not be an obstacle to the US joining the Mine Ban Treaty.</p>

                <p>A second concern is the possible need for the US to use antipersonnel mines in the event of an invasion by North Korea. The landmines already laid in and near the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea are the responsibility of South Korean forces and not the US. As a result of the 2004 policy decision by President George W. Bush, the US has already prohibited the use by its forces in Korea and throughout the world of non self-destruct antipersonnel mines. But some still maintain that the US may need to use self-destructing landmines in Korea. </p>

                <p>Numerous retired military officers have questioned the utility of antipersonnel mines in Korea, citing the overwhelming technological superiority of other weapons in the US-South Korean arsenal compared to North Korea as sufficient to compensate for not using mines. In 1997, a former commander of US forces in Korea, Lt. General James Hollingsworth, said that antipersonnel landmines' "minimal" utility to US forces is "offset by the difficulty ... [they] pose to our brand of mobile warfare...not only civilians, but US armed forces, will benefit from a ban on landmines. US forces in Korea are no exception."</p>

                <p>Dempsey's defense of antipersonnel mines was not surprising, as any military's inclination is to retain rather than relinquish every weapon at its disposal. But giving up antipersonnel mines is a political decision that must be taken at the highest level. It is not a decision to be left to the military.  </p>

                <p>President Bill Clinton was the first world leader to call for the eventual elimination of all antipersonnel landmines almost two decades ago, in September 1994. While the Clinton Administration did not sign the Mine Ban Treaty after it was negotiated in 1997, Clinton set the goal to join in 2006. That approach was abandoned by President Bush, who issued a policy in February 2004 affirming that the US would never join the treaty.</p>

                <p>The US Campaign to Ban Landmines is urging that the outcome of the review be a decision to join the Mine Ban Treaty as soon as possible, to prohibit the use of antipersonnel mines immediately and to begin destruction of all stocks of antipersonnel mines. US accession to the treaty would help to convince the other countries to join, strengthening the norm against antipersonnel mines and ensuring they are not used in the future and create no additional humanitarian and socio-economic harm.</p>

                <p>Expectations are running high that the Obama Administration will conclude the landmine policy review by the time of the Mine Ban Treaty's Third Review Conference, to be held in Mozambique in June 2014. The US has already indicated it will attend the Maputo review conference, but in what capacity remains to be determined by the still to be concluded landmine policy review.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.gsu.edu/directory/heled">Yaniv Heled</a> of Georgia State University College of Law argues that patent trolls may be better understood when viewed as analogous to biological parasites, as both are naturally occurring phenomena that thrive by syphoning resources from hosts. Viewing patent trolls as parasites can help in setting realistic expectations in the fight against patent trolls, and explain why our inability to design perfect solutions against them should not deter us from continuing our efforts to reduce the negative impact they exact on society ... </p><strong>P</strong></font>atent trolls were all the rage in PatCon 4, which was held at San Diego University earlier this month. This is not to say that they were in vogue, but rather that there was hardly a panel&#8212;at least of those that I attended&#8212;in which the topic of patent trolls did not come up in one-way or another. There was even a good old-fashioned <a href="http://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/04/patcon-patent-debate.html">debate</a> dedicated exclusively to the topic of patent trolls.<br />
 <br />
The ongoing challenges involving patent trolls revolve mostly around two main issues. First, there is much disagreement about what patent trolls are. This is evident in the variety of names that people use to describe these entities, including, the colloquial "trolls," "non-practicing entities" (NPEs), "patent assertion entities" (PAEs) and more. Similarly, there is a heated debate going on regarding what should be done about patent trolls and how to minimize the negative toll that they exact on the innovation economy. As can be expected, the debate surrounding what to do about patent trolls is greatly influenced by the disagreement about the definition of patent trolls and vice versa. </p>

<p>In this op-ed piece, however, I would like to weigh in on neither of these issues, but rather make a general observation about patent trolls that could provide the debate with another perspective. That is that patent trolls are a lot like parasites. To clarify: I do not mean to use the term "parasite" derogatorily, but rather in the neutral way it has been <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/443191/parasitism">used</a> in the biological sciences to describe the relationship between two types of creatures where one is deriving benefits at the expense of the other, mostly without necessarily killing it. </p>

<p>When a biological species is successful enough to thrive&#8212;i.e. not merely survive&#8212;there is often a margin of resources available to members of that species that becomes a potential target for exploitation by free-riders. This is the "niche" to which parasites are able to insert themselves. In most cases parasites do not kill their host, leaving it alive so that future generations of parasites may continue to extract resources from it and its progeny. Hosts, however, are not, evolutionarily speaking, "indifferent" to their targeting by parasites and tend to develop&#8212;actually acquire, if we insist on scientific accuracy&#8212;mechanisms that fight parasites and make it difficult for parasites to extract resources from their hosts. One example of a highly elaborate mechanism like this that we are all familiar with is our immune system, the primary purpose of which is to rid our bodies of parasites. Parasites, of course, do not remain idle but develop their own mechanisms in response to address their hosts' countermeasures. So ensues an "arms race" between parasite and host, a struggle that has been a staple of the evolution of biological species. </p>

<p>Much like parasites, patent trolls emerged as a prevalent phenomenon when a sufficiently successful class of "corporate creatures" came to prominence: the high-tech company. Patent trolls exploit the various vulnerabilities of these companies as well as those of the "IP ecosystem"&#8212;the area in which these high-tech companies thrive&#8212;in order to extract resources from them. A single patent troll usually poses no existential danger to any given company&#8212;as trolls are typically only after settlement fees and not their host's entire cache of resources. Too many patent trolls, however, could eventually bring down even highly successful companies. Similarly, like most species of parasites, patent trolls tend to mount numerous attempts on their hosts with the expectation that only a few of these attempts will be successful, which still guarantees enough resources extracted from hosts to keep the trolls alive and, in many cases, thriving. Interestingly, the success of trolls starting the early 2000s has allowed them to expand and diversify their business models in such a way that it is now difficult to talk about patent trolls as a unitary phenomenon. Hence, like with biological parasites, it may be useful to consider patent trolls as a "genus" or even a "family" of entities that includes different "species," each with its own specialty and preferred class of hosts, which may exceed high tech companies and include their licensees and end-users. Recently, commentators have <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2395987">suggested</a> that trolls might even expand beyond the "ecosystem" of high-tech into the biotech area, while others have <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2404950">reported</a> the emergence of trolls who specialize in exploiting vulnerabilities of copyrights rather than patents.</p>

<p>There are a couple of other interesting aspects of parasitism that are worth considering in this context. First, it is very rare that parasitism is completely eradicated and, second, parasitism, as a biological phenomenon, is extremely prevalent. Indeed, even with tremendous strides made in antibiotics and vaccine science, parasites we once thought were gone continue to make a "comeback"&#8212;e.g., tuberculosis and polio&#8212;while others remain barely scathed by even the most advanced technological countermeasures&#8212;e.g., malaria. Yet, it is important to remember that these and many other parasites have lived along side us for as long as humans have been around. The same is true for virtually any other biological species, exclusive of viruses perhaps. Thus, despite its negative social connotations, from a purely biological standpoint, parasitism is seemingly as natural as life itself. Once a certain species becomes sufficiently successful, it will inevitably be targeted by parasites. As such, value judgments of parasitism as "good" or "bad" are both meaningless and unhelpful; the only thing that should concern us with regard to parasitism is how successful and prevalent the parasitic activity is. </p>

<p>The patent-trolls-as-parasites analogy thus has several implications. As with biological parasites, trolls are more a symptom of the success of the high-tech patent economy than a sign of its vulnerabilities. Hence, for as long as we have prosperous sectors relying on patents as a means of ensuring their success, there will be trolls exploiting such patents to exact a toll on this success. This reinforces a conclusion previously reached by others: there is likely no panacea for patent trolls. Just like attempts to eradicate any single parasite with one fell swoop are likely to fail, seeking to outlaw patent trolls as such is unlikely to succeed and&#8212;like taking too much antibiotics&#8212;might backfire. </p>

<p>At the same time, this does not mean that we should leave patent trolls unchecked to extract as much as they can from their hosts. Nor should we abandon hosts to develop mechanisms to fight patent trolls by way of natural selection, as this would be too wasteful. Where inoculation or antibiotics are useful in diminishing the prevalence of a parasite and the severity of its attacks, it is broadly accepted that we ought not to avoid using similar means just because parasites are "natural" and may play a role in natural selection. By the same token, just because patent trolls do something that is "natural" to the patent system does not mean that we should allow them to freely exact their toll on innovative companies, let alone consider parasitism as somehow beneficial to the innovation "ecosystem." Further, our inability to design perfect tools for fighting patent trolls should not deter us from taking action to thwart at least some of their harmful behavior and minimize its effects. Indeed, as the debate in the Senate's Judiciary Committee regarding legislative measures to curb patent trolls continues, it may be helpful to consider the fact that even the most benign drugs have side effects. We all&#8212;legislators, judges and attorneys in various settings&#8212;should strive to inhibit patent trolls in order to make sure that they are not successful enough to exact an unacceptable toll on our innovation economy or, worse yet, overwhelm their hosts. </p>

		<title>City of New York v. Exxon Mobil Corp: Damages Without Injury</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hollingsworthllp.com/people.php?PeopleID=47">Eric Lasker</a> of <a href="http://www.hollingsworthllp.com/contact.php">Hollingsworth LLP</a> discusses standing and City of New York v. Exxon Mobil Corp....</p>

                <p>It is a fundamental tenet of our constitutional system of justice that courts are limited in jurisdiction to cases or controversies involving injuries that are "concrete, particularized and actual or imminent." In <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/504/555">Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife</a>, the US Supreme Court held that this injury-in-fact requirement was an "irreducible minimum of constitutional standing," essential to the proper balance of power between the three branches of government. But in a now-final ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, a defendant has been held liable for more than $100 million for conduct that is causing no current injury and that a jury concluded would not cause cognizable injury even assuming a series of speculative actions over the next 25 years.</p>

                <p>The case is <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/exxon-mobil-corporation-v-city-of-new-york/">City of New York v. Exxon Mobil Corp</a>. The case arose from Exxon Mobil's oxygenation of gasoline with a chemical compound called <a href="http://www.epa.gov/mtbe/">methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether</a> (MTBE). MTBE was added to gasoline in compliance with a federal mandate under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/">Clean Air Act</a> because it helps gasoline burn more cleanly, thus reducing air pollution. At the time, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") believed this environmental benefit outweighed a recognized risk that MTBE spreads more easily in groundwater than other gasoline components. However, reports of MTBE groundwater contamination in the 1990s led to a phasing out of MTBE in gasoline in the 2000s and MTBE's undisputed benefit of cleaner air has now taken a back seat to legal disputes over alleged injuries to groundwater supplies.</p>

                <p>In 2004, the City of New York brought suit against Exxon Mobil for claimed injuries to the city's drinking water supplies. As ultimately demonstrated at trial, the city's damages claim faced a number of real world "fact checks" that should have prevented the case from proceeding. <u>First</u>, the city obtains its drinking water from upstate reservoirs, not the allegedly impacted groundwater. <u>Second</u>, the city was precluded from using the groundwater at issue because it was heavily polluted with other contaminants having nothing to do with Exxon Mobil or MTBE. Thus, the groundwater could only provide a future source of drinking water if the city builds a treatment facility to treat these other contaminants, a facility that is not even in construction and, accepting the city's expressed good faith intent, would not be in place for another 10-15 years. <u>Third</u>, the groundwater is not currently contaminated with MTBE above drinking water standards. Instead, the city's claim rests upon the premise that currently inactive wells would begin pumping drinking water after the construction of the separately required treatment facility and would draw more MTBE in from more distant groundwater supplies. <u>Fourth</u>, assuming the treatment facility was built and the wells were put in service, MTBE levels in the groundwater at their projected peak still would not exceed safe drinking water standards. </p>

                <p>In holding that the city's claim nonetheless presented a ripe case or controversy, the Second Circuit relied upon two legal predicates: (1) that a projected future injury is sufficient to provide standing so long as there is evidence of some current, measurable impact (even if not sufficient to demonstrate present damage) and (2) that groundwater is damaged by the presence of a chemical compound even at levels within safe drinking water standards. Each of these findings raise significant questions about the vitality of standing jurisprudence in environmental cases and each open the door to new theories of liability without injury-in-fact that disregard the irreducible minimum protection against judicial overreach and unfounded plaintiff-counsel-driven litigation.</p>

                <p>The Second Circuit's theory of standing based on potential future groundwater damage is analogous to legal theories of medical monitoring in personal injury litigation. In both cases, plaintiffs are bringing suit not for any present injury but for alleged current costs to address the possibility of some manifest injury in the future. The viability of medical monitoring as a proper basis for damages has been hotly contested for decades, with most states rejecting such claims absent evidence of a present injury, but a significant minority of states allowing such claims to proceed. Somewhat ironically, in a recent opinion issued after the Second Circuit's ruling in the MTBE litigation, the New York Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/Decisions/2013/Dec13/227opn13-Decision.pdf">Caronia v. Philip Morris USA</a>  [PDF] answered a certified question from the Second Circuit and rejected a medical monitoring claim brought by a putative class of cigarette smokers. The New York Supreme Court explained that "a threat of future harm is insufficient to impose liability against a defendant in a tort context." Thus, New York law arguably now extends broader protections against speculative future harm to land than it does to speculative future harm to human health.</p>

                <p>The New York Supreme Court's ruling in <span class="casename">Caronia</span> does suggest that a medical monitoring claim would be viable if plaintiffs can demonstrate some current physical injury. The Second Circuit's reliance on alleged current low level MTBE detections in the New York City groundwater as a basis for standing could thus be argued as being consistent with the <span class="casename">Caronia</span> medical monitoring holding. But there is one very important difference. While medical monitoring plaintiffs seek the costs for screening tests that they allege might detect future cancers at an early stage (which only then would allow for a possible future legal action for damages caused by the cancer), the City of New York was awarded the full cost of "curing" a potential future damage to groundwater before it occurs (if it ever does).</p>

                <p>The Second Circuit's conclusion that a plaintiff can bring suit based upon the presence in groundwater of within-safe drinking levels of a chemical gives rise to a separate set of problems. While almost always within regulatory limits and not posing any risk to human health, the presence of trace amounts of chemicals and other foreign substances in public drinking water supplies is ubiquitous. In one <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2008/5208/">study</a>, for example, the US Department of Interior Geologic Survey (USGS) sampled source water from nine community water systems for analysis of 258 man-made organic compounds and detected trace levels of more than half of the compounds in at least one source water sample, with six compounds detected in more than half the samples. The USGS identified over a dozen different business sources of such trace detections: (1) disinfection by-products, (2) fungicide-related compounds, (3) fungicides, (4) gasoline hydrocarbons, oxygenates and oxygenate degradates, (5) herbicides and herbicide degradates, (6) insecticide and insecticide degradates, (7) manufacturing additives, (8) organic synthesis compounds, (9) pavement- and combustion-derived compounds, (10) personal care and domestic-use products, (11) plant- or animal-derived biochemicals, (12) refrigerants and propellants and (13) solvents. By decoupling legal standing from safe drinking water standards, the Second Circuit thus has set precedent for an endless grab bag of potential lawsuits against broad sectors of the economy, subject solely to the whim of plaintiff's counsel and the sound discretion of trial courts to screen out such claims on non-standing grounds. </p>

                <p>On April 18, 2014, the US Supreme Court denied Exxon Mobil's petition for writ of certiorari, cementing the Second Circuit's flawed standing analysis into law in that circuit. However, with MTBE litigation pending in other courts across the country and with the prospect of new future groundwater non-injury litigation following the Second Circuit model, the standing issues raised in the Exxon Mobil case are likely to emerge again. Now that the irreducible minimum of constitutional standing has been breached, defendants must focus their efforts on the hard task of shepherding the law back into the proper boundaries of judicial authority.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Joseph La Rue of <a href="http://www.alliancedefendingfreedom.org/">Alliance Defending Freedom</a> discusses the significance of the Supreme Court's future ruling in the birth control mandate contained with the Affordable Care Act</p>

                <p>Imagine that you are a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and opposed to the slaughtering of animals for food. You are committed to the principle that animals must be respected, not used for human consumption. The thought of supporting the meat industry is anathema.</p>

                <p>Now suppose you start a business selling craft products. You stock quality products that people enjoy. Soon, you are opening stores across the nation. You strive to treat your customers and your employees well. Your full-time employees start at 80 percent above minimum wage, and you provide them quality health insurance. You also open an on-site comprehensive health care clinic at your corporate headquarters with no co-pays. You are committed to your employees.</p>

                <p>You are also committed to PETA. Every year you donate 10 percent of your income to animal-rights organizations. You are making a difference&#8212;for people and for the cause in which you believe.</p>

                <p>Now suppose that President Barack Obama calls for Congress to help people eat better. Congress determines that many people eat poorly because junk food is cheaper than nutritious food. So it creates a law, commonly called "Obamafood," requiring employers with 50 or more employees to provide them a weekly allowance of high-quality food, which must include lean meat such as chicken or turkey.</p>

                <p>You employ well over 50 employees. You have no problem providing most of the food choices Obamafood mandates. But chicken or turkey? Impossible. You cannot provide meat without compromising everything in which you believe. You simply cannot comply with the chicken mandate.</p>

                <p>Change PETA to the Mennonite or Southern Baptist church, and the chicken mandate to the abortion pill mandate, and this describes the crisis faced by the owners of Conestoga Wood Specialties and Hobby Lobby. Both families, the Hahns and the Greens, treat their employees well. The Green family, for example, starts employees at $14 an hour, provides health insurance, and has an employee clinic. And the Greens are very generous with their money, giving more than 10 percent of their earnings each year to charity. It is believed that the Greens have <a href="http://www.hobbylobby.com/assets/pdf/40years/40years.pdf">given away</a> (PDF) some $500 million dollars to various charities. The Hahns, likewise, contributed more than a million dollars to various charities between 2010 and 2012.</p>

                <p>Obamacare's abortion pill mandate requires that the Hahns and the Greens provide their employees with health insurance that includes preventive care. Like our imaginary PETA business owner, the Hahns and the Greens are happy to provide most of what is required. They have no qualms with providing generous insurance benefits; they already do that and believe it is part of their Christian duty to do so.</p>

                <p>But some of the items that Obamacare bureaucrats define as "preventive services" and that Obamacare requires&#8212;such as various intrauterine devices and "morning after pills"&#8212;are actually abortifacients, capable of preventing a newly fertilized embryo from implanting in the uterus. And this is something the two families cannot provide. They are committed Christians and hold certain beliefs inviolable. Among those is the conviction, based on the Bible and their basic morality, that human life and dignity begin at conception. The majority of Americans <a href="http://www.kofc.org/un/en/resources/communications/marist-poll-abortion-restrictions2014.pdf">agree</a> (PDF), as do many <a href="http://liveactionnews.org/life-begins-at-conception-science-teaches/">leading</a> scientists and textbooks.</p>

                <p>Requiring the Hahns and the Greens to fund coverage for abortifacients is comparable to requiring a PETA member to fund food that contains meat. Obamacare's abortion pill mandate is anathema to them. Complying with it would require them to violate their conscience and their religious beliefs. More than 500 scholars, religious leaders, and health care professionals have called this mandate <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Unacceptable-4-11.pdf">unacceptable</a> (PDF).</p>

                <p>So both families filed suit to challenge the mandate as applied to their businesses. The lawsuits have been <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-contraceptives-mandate.php#.U1kjYOZdVek">heard</a> by the Supreme Court, and a decision is expected in late June. (Alliance Defending Freedom represents the Hahns and Conestoga Wood Specialties, and the Becket Fund represents the Greens and Hobby Lobby).</p>

                <p>In challenging Obamacare's requirement that they fund coverage for abortifacients, both the Hahns and the Greens rely on the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a>. Congress designed this law to protect religious faith from government overreach. It passed overwhelmingly in 1993 with a unanimous vote in the House and a vote of 97 to 3 in the Senate. A broad coalition that included liberal stalwarts like Charles Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and Barney Frank, along with conservative icons like Newt Gingrich, Lamar Smith, and Peter King sponsored the bill in the House. In the Senate, meanwhile, such notables as Joe Biden, John McCain, Barbara Boxer, Barbara Feinstein, Mitch McConnell, and the 'Lion of the Senate,' Ted Kennedy, voted in favor of passage.</p>

                <p>When President Bill Clinton signed RFRA into law, he reportedly <a href="http://www.gopusa.com/commentary/2014/04/01/obamacare-a-tangled-web-of-lies-and-loss/">quipped</a>, "The power of God is such that even in the legislative process, miracles can happen." And indeed, it did seem that a miracle had occurred. Not only did RFRA receive a near-unanimous vote from both sides of the aisle in Congress, it had overwhelming support from policy organizations on both the left and the right. Those calling for its passage included such diverse groups as the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association of Evangelicals, People for the American Way, and Concerned Women for America. Citizens&#8212;as well Congress and the president&#8212;overwhelmingly agreed that religious freedom was important and must be protected.</p>

                <p>As Clinton <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-11-19/news/9311190272_1_religious-freedom-restoration-act-coalition-of-religious-groups-supreme-court">explained</a>, "What this law basically says is that the government should be held to a very high level of proof before it interferes with someone's freedom of religion." In legal terms, RFRA requires that, if a law burdens someone's free exercise rights, the government must demonstrate that the law serves a "compelling interest" and is the "least restrictive means" for achieving that interest.</p>

                <p>As the Supreme Court explained in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8746804851760570747&q=521+U.S.+507&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">City of Boerne v. Flores</a>, this is "the most demanding test known to constitutional law." It requires the government to have an "interest[] of the highest order ... And the law must impose on the protected freedom no more than absolutely necessary to accomplish its purpose ..."</p>

                <p>When this standard is used to evaluate the abortion pill mandate as applied to Conestoga Wood Specialties and Hobby Lobby, it becomes clear that they should prevail. As a <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7036734975431570669&q=546+U.S.+418&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">foundational matter</a>, courts are not to find a compelling interest where the government has granted broad exceptions to the requirements of the law. This is <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=975414503455261754&q=508+U.S.+at+547.&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">because</a> "a law cannot be regarded as protecting an interest of the highest order ... when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited."</p>

                <p>Yet the abortion pill mandate does not apply to tens of millions of people. For example, many employers are not required comply with the underlying preventive services mandate at all, including those offering "<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/18011">grandfathered</a>" plans. Obamacare <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/4980H">does not fine</a> those with fewer than 50 employees if they drop their employees' insurance plans. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/147.130">granted</a> exemptions from the mandate for some religious entities&#8212;but not for religious families in business.</p>

                <p>The massive exemption of people from the mandate's required contraception coverage belies the government's claim that it has a compelling interest in requiring employers to provide their employees contraception and abortifacient coverage. Without a compelling interest, the mandate cannot legally be used to force the Hahn and Green families to act contrary to their sincerely held religious beliefs.</p>

                <p>In addition, the requirement that employers provide objectionable coverage is not the "least restrictive means" of accomplishing the government's proffered compelling interest. This test <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17526177081953259048&q=374+U.S.+398&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">requires</a> the government to "demonstrate that no alternative forms of regulation" that would "infring[e fewer] First Amendment rights" would accomplish the government's goals. If a less restrictive alternative would serve its purpose, the government <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11989907166283121695&q=529+U.S.+803&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">must</a> use it.</p>

                <p>There are many ways for the government to advance its interest in healthcare besides requiring a religious family to pay for religiously objectionable drugs and devices. For instance, the government could pay for this coverage itself or let employees get subsidies for it on Obamacare's "exchanges." The government already funds contraception extensively and is content to subsidize insurance that includes contraception when small employers do not offer insurance. Also, employees who want objectionable coverages could purchase them themselves. Forcing the Hahns and the Greens to violate their conscience is not "the least restrictive means."</p>

                <p>Under RFRA, both Conestoga Wood Specialties and Hobby Lobby should win their lawsuits. And that is a good thing. As Clinton <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-11-19/news/9311190272_1_religious-freedom-restoration-act-coalition-of-religious-groups-supreme-court">said</a>, "[W]e can never be too vigilant in this work" of protecting religious freedom&#8212;the "first freedom" the Founders enshrined in the Bill of Rights.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Columnist <a href="http://www.oklahomalegalgroup.com/attorney-profile">Adam R. Banner</a> discusses the recent controversies surrounding the executions in Oklahoma...</p>

                <p>"They say lethal injection causes no pain. How do they know? Did someone come back from the dead and say they didn't feel anything?" These prolific words, uttered by inmate Groves in the first season of HBO's series OZ, had always resonated with me. Even before I became a criminal defense attorney in Oklahoma, I realized there was something slightly questionable about our government touting a method of execution as painless, or somewhere near that, when there is no actual data regarding the effects of the process; one can't imagine there are many folks lining up to volunteer to test these cocktails. Consequently, our society ends up testing them on the inmates.</p>

                <p>"There's a chemical taste in my mouth," Kenneth Eugene Hogan <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-01-23/news/sns-rt-us-usa-execution-oklahoma-20140123_1_oklahoma-executes-man-heide-brandes-jerry-massie">announced</a> seconds after a lethal mixture of pentobarbital, vecuronium bromide, and potassium chloride was injected into his veins on Death Row at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma, on January 23, 2014. Just two weeks before, on January 9, 2014, Michael Lee Wilson, who was the first inmate to be executed in Oklahoma this year, <a href="http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/wilson1361.htm">said</a>, "I can feel my whole body burning," within twenty seconds of being injected with the state's three-drug protocol.</p>

                <p>These executions bookend the Ohio execution of Dennis McGuire, who took up to twenty-six minutes to die, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/22/ohio-mcguire-execution-untested-lethal-injection-inhumane">according</a> to one eyewitness, and who spent fourteen minutes of that time convulsing and gasping for air. McGuire's execution was the result of a previously untested drug protocol using midazolam and hydromorphone. Although the state said that the execution went "very well" and that there were no plans to review the protocol, Louisiana <a href="http://theadvocate.com/home/8254575-125/injection-drug-questions-halt-sepulvado">postponed</a> the use of the same two-drug protocol until its courts could rule on the constitutionality of the lethal-injection cocktail. </p>

                <p>The slow and seemingly agonizing death of McGuire has prompted close inspection of lethal injection protocols across the nation, and death row inmates in Oklahoma have taken notice. Clayton D. Lockett, 38, and Charles F. Warner, 46, were originally scheduled to be put to death at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary on March 20 and March 27, respectively. However, they both <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/oklahoma-court-delays-executions-due-to-lethal-injection-drug-shortage.php#.U1ksI-ZdVek">filed</a> a lawsuit against the state claiming that a <a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=70842">secrecy clause</a> in the Oklahoma statutes protecting the source and nature of the drugs used in Oklahoma executions leaves significant questions about the constitutionality of the execution procedure Oklahoma intends to employ.</p>

                <p>Pentobarbital may be mixed with other substances, depending on its purpose, and the inmates allege that without full disclosure of the drug's source, the mixture may not be effective for preventing pain and suffering during the execution. They say that the state's "secrecy" means that any drug protocol may carry "a substantial risk of inflicting severe pain," according to the petition. Pentobarbital, along with other drugs used in execution protocols, are now being procured from compounding pharmacies, which are not always regulated by the US Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </p>

                <p>When Oklahoma <a href="http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/duty1234.htm">executed</a> John David Duty in 2010, the first time pentobarbital was used for lethal injection in the US, an anesthesiologist <a href="http://newsok.com/two-oklahoma-death-row-inmates-sue-state-corrections-department-over-lethal-injection-secrecy/article/3937556">testifying</a> for the state told a federal judge that the five grams of pentobarbital used in Oklahoma's execution protocol "is an enormous overdose in all cases," and that "five grams of pentobarbital will cause a person to stop breathing." However, that testimony refers to pure pentobarbital, and if the compounding pharmacy provides a different or weaker mixture, attorneys for Lockett and Warner say, their clients' deaths may be agonizing and a violation of their <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.</p>

                <p>A hearing for the Oklahoma execution drug lawsuit was moved to federal court at the request of the state, but ultimately moved back to Oklahoma District Court due to attorneys for the inmates filing an amended complaint removing all claims pertaining to federal law. The resulting state-level lawsuit has actually gained a great deal of traction in the Oklahoma legal landscape. Oklahoma County District Judge Patricia Parrish initially denied any relief on the basis that she did not have jurisdiction to stay the executions nor determine whether Oklahoma's secrecy clause was an unconstitutional denial of due process. The inmates filed an appeal to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, arguing that the District Court did have jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of the secrecy clause, and also requested an emergency stay of their impending executions until the litigation was finalized. </p>

                <p>The Oklahoma Supreme Court transferred the issue of the emergency stay to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, which was denied. The Oklahoma Supreme Court remanded the secrecy clause issue to the Oklahoma County District Court, where Parrish ultimately <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/oklahoma-judge-tosses-state-execution-law-154726192.html">ruled</a> that the secrecy clause in Oklahoma's death penalty statutory scheme is an unconstitutional denial of due process. As a result, the inmates once again petitioned the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals for a stay of their executions pending the appellate litigation regarding the District Court's holding regarding the secrecy clause. The Court of Criminal Appeals yet again denied the stay, ordering that it had no jurisdiction, pursuant to statutory construction of <a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=70829">Section 1001.1(C) of Title 22</a> of the Oklahoma statutes, to issue a stay unless there is a pending action before that court challenging the conviction or sentence of death.</p>

                <p>In a bit of a preemptive move, the state of Oklahoma increased the number or methods for lethal injection from its originally prescribed process to five individual cocktails that could be used based on the availability of the necessary drugs. After all, as states scramble to get their hands on drugs used in the lethal injection process, they really have no idea what will be available, or who they will be able to obtain it from for that matter.<br />
                    Consequently, the inmates filed another appeal in the Oklahoma Supreme Court, challenging certain other civil rulings by the Oklahoma County District Court and once again requesting an emergency stay of their execution pending the outcome of the litigation. The Oklahoma Supreme Court retained the civil issues while once again <a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=472857">transferring</a> the issue of the application for emergency stay to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, relying on the Supreme Court's constitutional power to determine jurisdiction. In essence, the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that it did not have jurisdiction to decide the issue of an emergency stay, and that it was the Court of Criminal Appeals job to do so. The Supreme Court made sure to emphasis that its "determination shall be final."</p>

                <p>However, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals once again <a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=472859">disagreed</a>. In its decision, the Court of Criminal Appeals held that it did not have jurisdiction pursuant to its previous statutory construction argument. Moreover, the court went even further than merely denying the stay on jurisdictional grounds. As if it were not enough to defy the Oklahoma Supreme Court's supposed "final" determination of jurisdiction, the Court of Criminal Appeals held that the Supreme Court did "not have the power to supersede a statute and manufacture jurisdiction." Talk about a power struggle.</p>

                <p>In return, the Oklahoma Supreme Court backtracked on its previous holding that it did not have jurisdiction and ultimately <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/oklahoma-high-court-stays-executions-over-lethal-injection-drug-challenge.php">entered</a> a stay of execution on its own. The court confirmed that it was "in an awkward position." However, the Supreme Court decided to take the high road and refrain from denying the inmates access to the courts. Oklahoma's Governor has now <a href="http://kfor.com/2014/04/22/governor-issues-stay-in-scheduled-execution/">stepped in</a> and issued her own stay, acknowledging that the Supreme Court did not have authority to do so on it's own.</p>

                <p>Presently, the state of Oklahoma has done its best to work-around the rulings of the Oklahoma County District Court. The state planned to use one of its five alternatives to execute both Lockett and Warner, and many other individuals currently setting on death row. The cocktail that Oklahoma planned to use has only been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/us/wrangle-over-oklahoma-executions-bounces-from-court-to-court.html?_r=2">employed</a> by one other state. Moreover, it appears that the amounts that Oklahoma intends to employ are not even as large as amounts previously used. Those who oppose the process argue that the quantitative amounts contemplated by Oklahoma are not large enough to insure the inmates are protected from cruel and unusual punishment. </p>

                <p>Consequently, Oklahoma's method of execution could violate the US Supreme Court's ruling in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10752510346595419167">Baze v. Rees</a>. Pursuant to <span class="casename">Baze</span>, Oklahoma (and every other state) may execute prisoners through lethal injection. However, the specific cocktail used could be a violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment if the states refuse to adopt alternative procedures that significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain when they are feasible and readily implemented.</p>

                <p>In the end, the real question here is a simple "Why?". Why is the state of Oklahoma and ODOC so intent on protecting the source and nature of its execution drugs? ODOC argues that the secrecy clause helps shield companies which produce the drugs from public pressure and threat. However, the death-penalty debate is a nation-wide dialogue with two very devoted sides, and all available information should be accessible. At the very least, inmates should not be made human guinea pigs all in the name of retribution.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/sophie-richardson">Sophie Richardson</a> of <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> discusses the EU and human rights issues in China...</p>

                <p>This year will see a pair of quarter-century anniversaries of key political events in China and Europe: the remembrance in June of those who died in the Tiananmen Square <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/node/83112">massacre</a>  in Beijing in 1989, commemorations in Europe of uprisings, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet bloc. </p>

                <p>In China, the very human rights that thousands protested for remain off-limits <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/china">today</a>. Those whose family members or friends died at Tiananmen will once again be prevented from marking the occasion&#8212;and are no closer to state accountability for the events of June 4 than they were two decades ago. In Europe, the same period has seen the expansion of the European Union (EU) and a huge jump in membership of the Council of Europe, Europe's regional body for promoting human rights, democracy and rule of law, and with it the greater reach of regional human rights treaties guaranteeing respect for fundamental rights and access to justice. </p>

                <p>But as the EU seeks deeper ties with China, particularly at a time of economic stagnation, the former's commitment to promoting greater respect for human rights in the latter has faltered <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/03/27/china-eu-leaders-should-confront-xi-rights">badly</a>, so much so that the March 22-April 1 visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Brussels and to several EU member states seemed to induce a sense that European policy makers should adopt Beijing's stance on the freedom of expression. EU authorities once again capitulated to Chinese demands not to have a press conference following Xi's meetings with Commission President Barroso and Council President Van Rompuy and no senior EU official would publicly mention the need to release 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/02/27/china-new-global-effort-free-liu-xiaobo">Liu Xiaobo</a>  or any of the dozens of activists languishing in Chinese prisons on charges ranging from subversion to "stirring up quarrels and provoking troubles." Nor was there evidence that the findings or concerns of EU Special Representative for Human Rights Stavros Lambrinidis, who was given access to many senior Chinese officials and regions such as Tibet in September 2013, informed the March 2014 discussions.</p>

                <p>Why does it matter that from its senior-most levels the EU is unwilling to confront serious human rights abuses in China? First, this failure lays bare the frailty of the EU as an institution. If the EU wants to make a real difference for those struggling for human rights progress in China, it should use its combined leverage and raise those concerns <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/04/17/human-rights-watch-evidence-submitted-consideration-inquiry-european-union-and-china">collectively</a>. The EU's greatest leverage is the sum of its parts: 28 member states and EU institutions. For the purposes of advancing trade the EU remembers that it collectively is China's single biggest trading partner&#8212;but for the purposes of advancing rights it does not.</p>

                <p>The Chinese government has for years successfully played individual EU member states off one another on issues like whether to meet the Dalai Lama or when and how to raise cases of individuals imprisoned or otherwise abused for peacefully exercising their human rights in China.  </p>

                <p>The EU's propensity for inconsistency makes it easy for Beijing to dismiss its efforts: when the EU was awarded the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize, senior EU officials in Brussels and Beijing could not bring themselves to utter Liu Xiaobo's name, despite their having lauded his award two years earlier. For reasons that remain unclear, the EU opted recently not to publicly rebut a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' article essentially telling the EU it had no role to play in discussions of human rights in China. Each of these gestures is seen by Beijing as the diplomatic equivalent of waving a white flag of surrender.  </p>

                <p><u>Not a strategic framework</u></p>

                <p>The EU's June 2012 adoption of the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/06/25/eu-turn-rights-promises-actions">EU Strategic Framework</a>  on human rights and democracy was meant to establish an institutional approach to human rights obligations in part to minimize the possibility of member states diverging from an EU-wide global policy. The framework commits the EU institutions and the 28 member states to placing "human rights at the center of its relations with all third countries including strategic partners" and also raising "human rights issues vigorously in all appropriate forms of bilateral dialogue, including at the highest level." The EU recently published an updated "plan of action," an elaborate table articulating the activities undertaken&#8212;some even completed&#8212;in the dozens of areas the Strategic Framework points out. In principle, it has never been easier for the EU and member states to point to this global initiative as a way of pushing back against Chinese government criticisms over human rights-related interventions.</p>

                <p>But virtually none of the Strategic Framework goals or obligations are being pursued with respect to China and the EU has not provided an explanation as to why. Yet the near total-failure to do so suggests that the EU as a whole is simply unwilling to push these issues in China. The lack of political courage to address in a serious and ambitious way systemic human rights abuses profoundly undermines human rights defenders and vitiates the EU's claim to being a global champion of human rights.  </p>

                <p>That the EU is sacrificing human rights apparently to secure trade gains with this authoritarian regime also reflects an alarming rigidity in EU and member states' thinking about China. There is little indication that the EU and member states at the highest levels of government are aware of, let alone incorporating into policy responses, the dynamism or views of independent voices in China, particularly elements that present challenges of legitimacy to the Chinese Communist Party.  </p>

                <p>How can the EU construct viable environmental, rule of law or anti-corruption policies with China when it fails to incorporate independent views that may have considerably more credence than those advanced by an unelected government? Are the many proponents of putting trade ahead of human rights thinking about whether the increased Chinese economic footprint&#8212;given its implications in terms of technology transfer, financial opacity and corrupt business practices&#8212;in the Eurozone will truly benefit the European economy in the long term?</p>

                <p>One lesson the EU should draw from the crisis in Ukraine is that underestimating popular sentiment&#8212;whether pro- or anti-human rights, whether pro- or anti-government&#8212;can mean radically misjudging the very reality with which they are dealing. With respect to China, the EU and member states remain far more interested in the information and opinions of those inside the government and Party than they are on the information or opinions of those trying to make change from outside. Yet doing so leaves the EU with an incomplete grasp on the reality of any given issue and determines the appropriate policy response. Reaching out to independent voices also provides a level of recognition to individuals and organizations in China that can help buy them some protection. </p>

                <p><u>Weak support for rights has consequences</u></p>

                <p>Finally, the EU's weak support for human rights in China reflects a disturbing negotiability of its principles. People all across China struggle daily, and often face serious reprisals, to ensure for themselves and others the very same human rights most Europeans now take for granted. Europe is recognized as a global leader in its rejection of the death penalty, its respect for labor rights, its defense of the freedom of expression&#8212;so much so that its failure to engage at every opportunity with Chinese leaders on these subjects erodes its claims to that leadership.</p>

                <p>What can the EU do to promote human rights in China so that its foreign policy reflects its domestic achievements?  </p>

                <p>Rather than press ahead with its profoundly irrelevant human rights dialogue with the Chinese government alone, Brussels should take advantage of Beijing's insistence to gather only once a year and devote its second annual dialogue instead to engagement with civil society actors.  </p>

                <p>Starting with the upcoming anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, senior EU officials should issue a statement publicly reminding Europeans and Chinese why the EU arms embargo imposed on China in the wake of the killings endures and articulate and uphold clear criteria&#8212;including accountability for those responsible for abuses and amnesty or new trials for any who remain in prison&#8212;for lifting that embargo.  </p>

                <p>Finally, the EU and its member states should immediately, vigorously and publicly apply the Strategic Framework to China, starting with its most basic obligations: to promote human rights "in all areas of the EU's external actions without exception" and to put its "full weight behind advocates of liberty, democracy and human rights throughout the world." Then&#8212;and only then&#8212;will we know that Europe is truly united in support for the human rights of everyone in China.</p>

		<title>Evaluating Florida Supreme Court&amp;apos;s Anti-Discrimination Decision</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.fsu.edu/faculty/mziegler.html">Mary Ziegler</a> of the Florida State University College of Law discusses the Florida Supreme Court's recent decision recognizing that employers cannot discriminate against pregnant women ... </p><strong>A</strong></font>s JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/florida-supreme-court-rules-discrimination-against-pregnant-women-violates-state-law.php#.U1KWayhLrdk">reported</a>, Florida recently joined a handful of states that recognize pregnancy-based bias as sex discrimination when the relevant state civil-rights law does not directly speak to the issue. The Florida Supreme Court considered the case of Peggy Delva, a front desk manager who complained of biased treatment at work during her pregnancy, including extra scrutiny of her work, denials of her requests to work extra shifts or cover those of other workers and refusals of her request to return to work after maternity leave. Resolving a conflict in the lower courts, the Florida Supreme Court held that the <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0760/Sections/0760.01.html">Florida Civil Rights Act</a>, which reaches sex discrimination, prohibits pregnancy bias, since pregnancy is "a natural condition and primary characteristic unique to the female sex."</p>

<p>First, <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2014/sc12-2315.pdf">Delva v. the Continental Group, Inc</a>. [PDF] reminds us that the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11606200352274499710">General Electric Co. v. Gilbert</a> still matters, even if the federal <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/pregnancy.cfm">Pregnancy Discrimination Act</a> (PDA) seems to have transformed the law. In the pair of cases, the Supreme Court held that pregnancy discrimination violated neither the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> nor <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>. </p>

<p>Even after Congress rejected the holding of <span class="casename">Gilbert</span>, the case continues to cast its shadow over state law. The employer in <span class="casename">Delva</span> argued that in light of <span class="casename">Gilbert</span>, Florida's silence on the question of pregnancy disability meant something. <span class="casename">Gilbert</span> set the baseline: sex discrimination and pregnancy bias were two different things. <span class="casename">Delva's</span> employer assumed that state lawmakers would have acted if they wanted to change the status quo that <span class="casename">Gilbert</span> had created. In other words, if Florida legislators wanted to ban pregnancy discrimination, they would have said so.</p>

<p>That the Florida Supreme Court rejected this argument raises just as many questions as it answers. If Florida law prohibits pregnancy discrimination, what does that mean? For the most part, federal courts interpreting the PDA have carved out a narrow and sometimes contradictory set of protections for pregnant workers. These employees enjoy what amounts to a right to an individualized assessment of their capacity to work, free from stereotypical judgments about childbearing, childrearing and gender. What pregnant workers don't get is more striking. If employers choose not to accommodate any workers, they have no obligation to help pregnant employees. </p>

<p>More surprisingly, many federal courts have signed off on pregnancy-blind policies&#8212;employer rules that make no mention of pregnancy but effectively exclude all workers seeking accommodation on that basis. Consider a policy that requires employers to step up for workers injured on the job. Since women rarely conceive children at the office, such a policy would leave out pregnant workers, regardless of whether they had the same capacity to work as other employees offered accommodation. </p>

<p>Commentators have questioned whether pregnancy blindness is compatible with the original intent of the PDA, and members of Congress have proposed a bill, the <a href="http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1975">Pregnant Workers Fairness Act</a>, that would require employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers unless doing so would impose an undue hardship. As <span class="casename">Delva</span> makes clear, however, state and local governments will likely have their own say about the future of pregnancy-discrimination law.</p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Delva</span>, the Florida Supreme Court chose a different path from the one followed by the federal courts. For better or worse, state courts rarely do so. In Florida, for example, judges often fall back on cases interpreting the federal Civil Rights Act when resolving problems at the state level. Even when it comes to pregnancy discrimination, state courts in Massachusetts and Minnesota that have taken the same approach as <span class="casename">Delva</span>&#8212;holding that state civil rights law implicitly includes pregnancy under the umbrella of sex discrimination&#8212;have cut short any experimentation with a different vision of civil rights law. Often absent legislation to the contrary, states treat the PDA as the ceiling for pregnant workers rather than the floor.</p>

<p>If the legislative arena is the best bet for pregnant workers, that might not be any reason to despair. Pregnancy-discrimination legislation has long created strange alliances&#8212;pro-lifers and feminists, Republicans and Democrats, social conservatives and progressives. Just look at the history of the PDA. Abortion opponents backed the law, arguing that poverty, sex discrimination at work, and a lack of adequate child care and healthcare all but forced women to terminate pregnancies rather than bring them to term. Feminists viewed pregnancy disability statutes as a way to dislodge longstanding stereotypes linking women's reproductive capacity and parenting roles. Broader pregnancy-discrimination protections do many things for a variety of constituencies: they redistribute the costs of reproduction, reflect social respect for family and care-taking and help put an end to a reality where women choose between childbearing and career.</p>

<p>A similar group of strange bedfellows seems to support contemporary efforts to expand protections for pregnant workers. Those supporting the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act include a pro-life Democrat and a prominent feminist. More importantly, at the state and local level, lawmakers have already gravitated toward the solution proposed in Congress. Twelve states and two cities have already introduced laws requiring employers to offer reasonable accommodations to pregnant workers, and more seem to be on the way. </p>

<p>Of course, accommodation laws may not be a perfect solution. Scholars studying the <a href="http://www.ada.gov/2010_regs.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> have questioned whether employers offset the costs of special protections for one class of workers by cutting pay or reducing hiring. And a duty to accommodate only goes so far. Employers can defend themselves by pleading ignorance of a pregnant worker's limitations or by proving that any accommodation would create an undue hardship. As is often the case with anti-discrimination law, protections leave some workers out altogether&#8212;including the undocumented, workers at businesses with too few employees, and those who count as independent contractors rather than employees.</p>

<p>Whether or not accommodations will solve pregnant workers' problems, the states still have reason to try out solutions rejected by the federal courts. Without experimenting, state and local lawmakers will never know if there are better ways to balance the needs of workers and their employers. <span class="casename">Delva</span> is a step in the right direction. Pregnancy discrimination can mean many things, regardless of the views articulated by the federal courts. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Thomas Warns, <a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/">New York University School of Law</a>, Class of 2015, discusses Georgia's Safe Carry Protection Act and the balance it strikes between rights to private property and self-defense...</j:header>Georgia Governor Nathan Deal recently signed into law a <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/display/20132014/HB/60">bill</a> which expanded the rights of licensed gun owners to carry their firearms into certain public places. The name of the bill was the Safe Carry Protection Act, though critics have charged that it should be better known as the "Guns Everywhere Act." The basic moving parts of the bill are that it creates an opt-in standard for places such as schools and churches by allowing them to permit certain individuals to carry firearms onto their premises, while creating an opt-out standard for shops and restaurants, in which licensed concealed carry permit holders are presumed to be allowed on the premises unless the property owner signals his intention to deny them entry.</p>

<p>This bill should be heralded as a success due to the fact that it optimally blends a robust interpretation of private property rights with an appreciation for the wisdom the Founders embodied in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a>. <br />
In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2739870581644084946">D.C. v. Heller</a>, Justice Scalia echoed established precedent that the right to keep and bear arms was an individual right, but that like any other Constitutional right, it was not unlimited. The text of the Second Amendment does not explicitly permit or deny the right to carry a concealed weapon. Justice Scalia clarified that "At the time of the founding, as now, to 'bear' meant 'to carry'," with the particular purpose of preparing oneself for confrontation. Allowing licensed gun owners to carry guns into public places furthers the Second Amendment's right of citizens to carry firearms for offensive or defensive purposes. </p>

<p>Many state and federal courts that have reviewed concealed carry bans prior to 2008 have allowed them to stand, but this outcome seems less likely following <span class="casename">Heller</span>. Chicago did not allow concealed carry permits until the Seventh Circuit reversed the ban in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10665754353092136977">Moore v. Madigan</a>. In that case, Justice Posner wrote the majority opinion which agreed with <span class="casename">Heller</span> in the context of the Second Amendment right to a concealed firearm. However, the dissent questioned the originalist evidence, arguing that the historical record was ambiguous at best in regards to a right to carry a weapon outside the home and pointed out that Justice Scalia went to pains in <span class="casename">Heller</span> to make clear that legislatures may still ban guns in schools or government buildings.</p>

<p>The dissent in <span class="casename">Madigan</span> then described how the legislature sought to limit the concealed carry of firearms because a concealed weapon could cause an escalation of criminal conduct where criminal intent doesn't necessarily exist, with the example of a minor disagreement that escalates into bloodshed because a pistol was available to one of the parties. But concealed carry laws have been passed in all fifty states and the much feared return to the "Wild West," where every dispute ends at the barrel of the gun, has failed to materialize. Actually, over the past two decades, as gun ownership has soared, national violent crime has dropped. While it would be a mistake to imply that correlation implies causation, an overwhelming amount of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/do-concealed-weapon-laws-result-in-less-crime/2012/12/16/e80a5d7e-47c9-11e2-ad54-580638ede391_blog.html">data</a> suggests that violent crime rates do not rise when concealed carry laws are passed. Thus, a default which allows law abiding citizens to carry firearms for self-defense purposes should be supported. There are simply too many tales of people using guns in self-defense to save their own lives to ignore.</p>

<p>The likely fact is that legislatures may ban concealed firearms in certain sensitive places such as schools and churches, but that does not mean they must. While the dissent in <span class="casename">Madigan</span> points out that the legislature may restrict concealed carry in order to prevent gun violence, the majority opinion counters that legislatures may also allow concealed carry because it will make criminals timid knowing other people may be armed, thus improving social welfare. With competing rational explanations for a particular regulatory policy, the will of the people, expressed via the legislature, should prevail. If the dissent wanted to defer to Chicago's government in prohibiting the concealed carry of firearms, it would also have to defer to Georgia's legislature in this instance. </p>

<p>By easing access to concealed carry permits, the law also avoids inequities that should give rise to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Equal Protection</a> concerns in other jurisdictions. For example, New York City has some of the most restrictive gun control laws in the country. Although former Mayor Michael Bloomberg was protected by armed bodyguards, he made it tougher for New Yorkers to receive concealed carry permits. Fees run into the hundreds of dollars and the barriers are notoriously high and time consuming to hurdle. While the rich and well-connected <a href="http://nypost.com/2012/04/22/nycs-1-percent-totally-gun-ho/">politicians</a> have no trouble accessing firearms, the poor are left defenseless. Wealth is not a suspect class earning heightened scrutiny from the courts, but it could be a proxy and create a disparate impact on certain minority groups that tend to be less wealthy.</p>

<p>The law should also be applauded on the grounds that it protects traditional property rights and in particular the fundamental right to exclude. The law involves two default positions: an opt-out for many businesses; and an opt-in for churches and schools. This strikes the correct balance of default preferences. Research has revealed that default preferences tend to be sticky and an excellent example of this phenomenon is revealed by the landmark <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/business/economy/27view.html?_r=0">study</a> looking at organ donation rates. Neighboring nations had wildly different organ donation rates and it turned out that the key variable was whether the standard was opt-out or opt-in; most people didn't care enough to change from the default.</p>

<p>A default that allows concealed weapons inside of businesses that are normally open to the public allows the public to exercise their ability to carry a concealed weapon in a meaningful way. A concealed weapon is more helpful when one is confronted in public on foot whereas it would not be as important if you were at home or in a car where one could take shelter or escape more easily. Also, the opt-out ability gives owners of certain properties like bars control if they believe that allowing concealed weapons is not in their best interests. Customers can take note of the owner's intentions and act accordingly.</p>

<p>The opt-in standard for churches and schools makes a great deal of sense as well. Churches and schools are institutions which serve a limited portion of the population. They are also less likely to be the scenes of violent attacks by gunmen. They are well-suited to adapt to an opt-in standard because they have an internal governing structure that can debate and reach a consensus on whether allowing or banning guns is right in their particular circumstances. In the case of schools, the law further advances its goals of protecting children by limiting concealed gun possession on school grounds to teachers and administrators who have been through proper training.</p>

<p>Devolving power to local authorities is a smart decision and the wisdom of local and state control instead of federal control is evidenced by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution's</a> preservation of the key notions of federalism. Rather than a blanket federal or state rule, this law allows local leaders to make key decisions about safety. If a church or school is located next to the police station, it would seem largely unnecessary to allow concealed carry permit holders to bring their weapons onto the premises. However, if one lives in a small town with only one sheriff whose office is miles away, it may be prudent to respond differently. </p>

<p>The Georgia Safe Carry Protection Act strikes the right balance in respecting private property rights while granting people the ability to defend themselves. The law reflects the values imbued in the Second Amendment by our Founding Fathers and echoed in <span class="casename">Heller</span> and <span class="casename">Madigan</span>, while also maintaining a property owner's ultimate ability to exclude those whom he or she does not want on the premises. Though objectors could potentially challenge the law on the grounds that it sets the incorrect default, they will ultimately fail because it empowers local business owners, schools and churches to balance their own safety considerations independent of outside interference.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Aaron Spencer, <a href="http://www.law.temple.edu/Pages/homepage.aspx">Temple University Beasley School of Law</a> Class of 2015, discusses Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's Veto of SB 236, which would have codified the rights of students to pray voluntarily in school and at school events . . .</j:header>The<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment"> First Amendment</a> begins, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . ." The first clause, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a>, has been interpreted as a prohibition. It mandates that neither the federal nor state governments may pass any law establishing, or even favoring, one religion over another. However, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/free_exercise_clause">Free Exercise Clause</a> has been interpreted more as a right. It is the right of a person to be free of laws inhibiting her from freely exercising her religion. And like all First Amendment rights, it is subject to certain limitations based on public policy, frequently found when it comes into conflict with the Establishment Clause. </p>

<p>The most <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/virginia-governor-vetoes-school-prayer-bill.php#.U2KdI16aLwI">recent</a> of these conflicts was on April 4, 2014, when Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?141+ful+SB236ER">SB 236</a>. This bill was an amendment of two existing Virginia statutes, <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+22.1-203.1">VA Code § 22.1-203.1</a> passed in 1994 and <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+22.1-203.3">VA Code § 22.1-203.3</a> passed in 2008. The 1994 law, which codifies the students' right to voluntarily engage in student-initiated prayer, is amended to add: <blockquote>"Students in public schools may voluntarily pray or engage in religious activities or religious expression before, during and after the school day in the same manner and to the same extent that students may engage in nonreligious activities or expression . . . [and] shall have the same access to school facilities . . . the same opportunity to announce or advertise meetings . . . without discrimination based on the religious content of the students' expression."</blockquote></p>

<p>There is also an allowance that the school may, ". . . disclaim school sponsorship of student-organized groups and events in a manner that neither favors nor disfavors groups that meet to engage in prayer or religious speech."</p>

<p>The 2008 law, which codifies the students' right to express religious beliefs through homework, artwork and other assignments, is amended to add, "Students may wear clothing, accessories or jewelry that display religious messages or religious symbols in the same manner and to the same extent that other types of clothing, accessories and jewelry are permitted." However, there's more. As stated in the <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?141+sum+SB236">legislative summary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The bill also requires each school division to adopt a policy to permit a student speaker to express a religious viewpoint at any school event at which a student is permitted to publicly speak. The policy shall declare each such school event to be a limited public forum, provide a neutral method for the selection of student speakers and require each school principal to provide a disclaimer in advance of each such school event that the school division does not endorse any religious viewpoint that may be expressed by student speakers.</blockquote>

<p>The interaction between the public sphere and religion is an area of contention that has existed since the inception of the union. Nowhere is this fight more keenly felt than in the issue of prayer in public schools. The US Supreme Court waded into it in a big way in 1962 with <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14815219471388213647">Engel v. Vitale</a>, in which the court forbade government-written prayers in schools as a violation of the Establishment Clause. The New York prayer at issue read, "Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country." </p>

<p>The court's decision in <span class="casename">Engel</span> formed the basis for finding unconstitutional clergy-led nondenominational prayer at <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=140480915250262562">graduation ceremonies</a>, school-permitted but student-led prayer before <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12285358800364238714">football games</a> and even a school-wide mandated <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2471425569650729212">moment of silence</a>.</p>

<p>Two major legal provisions are at work in the issue of prayer in schools; the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/4071">Equal Access Act</a> and the test established in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6993086659963510613">Lemon v. Kurtzman</a> governing legislation dealing with religion.</p>

<p>The Equal Access Act prohibits a public secondary school from denying equal access and fair opportunity to "any students who wish to conduct a meeting within that limited open forum on the basis of the religious, political, philosophical or other content of the speech at such meetings." Important here is that a public, secondary school has a limited open forum when it has at least one student-led, non-curriculum club that meets outside of class time.</p>

<p>The <span class="casename">Lemon</span> test is a three-pronged test mandating that any laws dealing with religion must:<br />
<ol><li>Have a secular legislative purpose;</li><li>Not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion; or</li><li>Not result in an "excessive government entanglement" with religion.</li></ol></p>

<p>Most often, when a law fails the <span class="casename">Lemon</span> test, it fails the first prong, but failure of any prong is enough to make a law unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause. The Alabama statute in <span class="casename">Wallace v. Jaffree</span>, for instance, failed both the first and second prongs largely because the man who introduced the bill said during the legislative session that he was only trying to use it get prayer back into schools. After that case, however, many circuits (<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6607106080228881839">Eleventh Circuit</a>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5814971502558683890">Fifth Circuit</a>, and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6885857707859086917">Seventh Circuit</a>) have upheld various state "moment of silence" statutes which could be proven to have a legitimate secular purpose and no underlying religious motivation, including the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which upheld a Virginia statute in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4267669556731810535">Brown v. Gilmore</a>.</p>

<p>Governor McAuliffe rightly vetoed Virginia SB 236 because it: (1) Mandates a "limited public forum" at every school gathering in which a student is permitted to speak; (2) mandates refrainment from regulating student's voluntary expression of a religious viewpoint in that setting; (3) infringes on students' right to be free from coercive prayer and religious messaging at both voluntary and required school events; (4) is unnecessary because students' right to voluntarily express religious views are already protected through the Equal Access Act and the Virginia <a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/boe/guidance/support/religious_activity.pdf">Guidelines</a> (PDF) Concerning Religious Activity in the Public Schools; and (5) would expose school divisions to extensive and costly litigation.</p>

<p>By making each school division declare every school gathering at which a student is permitted to speak a "limited public forum," the legislature is trying to tie in to the Equal Access Act. However, this smacks of promotion of religion, which will lead to failure of the second prong of the <span class="casename">Lemon</span> test, because the definition of "limited public forums" focuses on clubs that meet outside of class time at which outsiders and school administration have no organizational oversight. The Virginia legislature is attempting to expand that to any school gathering, regardless of official school involvement, including graduation ceremonies. The mandated disclaimer will not dispel the patina of school sponsored religious speech that everyone at the event will be forced to listen to, in a near exact echo of the situation in <span class="casename">Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe</span>.</p>

<p>Finally, the rights of Virginia students to pray or express religion on their own are well-established and well-protected. The Fourth Circuit has upheld a moment of silence during which each student is free to pray, meditate or reflect to herself. The Equal Access Act, quite without help from the Virginia legislature, provides wide latitude for student-initiated groups, even ones funded by the school district. And the Virginia Guidelines Concerning Religious Activity in the Public Schools, clearly outline the students' freedoms, "in choice of religious literature, discussion of religious themes with other willing students, voluntary student prayer and other non-disruptive expressions of belief, both verbal and as expressed through attire or other personal effects."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.columbia.edu/fac/William_Partlett">William Partlett</a> of Columbia University School of Law discusses the current state of the controversy in Ukraine ...</p>

<p>Constitution-making has rapidly moved to the forefront of the East-West standoff in the Ukraine. Prime Minister Arsenii Yatsenyuk recently announced an ambitious schedule for Ukrainian constitution-making that promises a final draft by September of this year. Meanwhile, Russia has made headlines by moving aggressively to shape the outcome of this constitution-making process&#8212;calling for Ukraine to adopt a highly decentralized federal structure and adopt a "neutrality clause" keeping it out of NATO. To press this point, Russia has massed troops on the Ukrainian border.</p>

<p>Russia's push for influence over Ukrainian constitution-making at first might seem anomalous&#8212;shouldn't the Ukrainians themselves decide the content of their own constitution? Constitution-making experience clearly shows, however, that constitution-making moments rarely occur without some sort of outside influence. This short piece will consider the differing roles of constitutional outsiders in constitution-making and where Ukraine fits on this spectrum of outsider influence.</p>

<p>This article will argue that Ukraine presents a case where constitution-makers voluntarily cede some control to outsiders in order to counter the influence of other outsiders. Ukraine's voluntary transfer of constitution-making decisions to outsiders will move key constitutional bargaining to the international level.  This internationalization of constitution-making in Ukraine has advantages and disadvantages: on one hand, it could help provide more room for compromise but, on the other, it could also potentially cut out key domestic Ukrainian groups who will refuse to recognize the new constitution. </p>

<p><em>The Reality of Outsider Constitution-making</em></p>

<p>Constitutional foundation is generally thought to be a "moment" of popular self-determination. Conventional normative legal theory tells us that a new democratic constitution is the product of "We the People's" constituent power&#8212;a popular force that creates the popular legitimacy for the constitution as a form of higher law. Without such popular constitution-making, a constitution cannot be a form of higher law that is binding on majoritarian politics. The classic example of this constitution-making moment is the founding of the US Constitution in the extraordinary Philadelphia Convention.</p>

<p>Comparative constitution-making experience suggests, however, that constitution-making is not always a fully autonomous moment of popular expression. The paradigmatical example of "We the People" acting to create the US Constitution might be the exception rather than the rule. Instead, constitution-making frequently takes place within a context where powerful outsiders play an important role in the process. This kind of outsider constitution-making takes a number of different forms.</p>

<p>On one end of the spectrum is the "imposed constitution-making" model where an outside force dictates constitutional outcomes on the country. This type of imposition can take varying forms. Perhaps the best example of this kind of constitution-making involvement can be found in Japan, where the Constitution was drafted entirely by the American military. The "imposed" model is clearly problematic from the viewpoint of democratic legitimacy, as there is no role for popular self-determination.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum are examples where an outside force plays a stabilizing or advisory role. In this type of "supervised constitution-making," an outsider plays the role of a referee, largely staying out of complex negotiations but ensuring a framework for the negotiations. The <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Constitution">Constitution of Australia</a> is a good example of this role. Although supervised by an outside country (the United Kingdom), the Constitution was the product of domestic bargaining in an elected convention followed by a referendum. This kind of outsider role is far less problematic from the viewpoint of democratic legitimacy as the outsider's role is largely to help ensure a national level process of constitutional bargaining. </p>

<p><em>Lessons for Ukraine</em></p>

<p>Where does Ukraine's constitution-making process fit on this spectrum?  It is clear that Russia is not playing a "supervisory" role. The Russians have made clear demands about the precise content of the new Ukrainian Constitution&#8212;and are massing troops on the border to back up these demands. In a recent document, the Russians "advise" the Ukrainians to convene a constitutional assembly "with equal representation of all regions."  This assembly, they argue, should include key things in the Constitution: 1) give Russian the status of a "state language," 2) specify that Ukraine will be militarily neutral (keep Ukraine out of NATO), and 3) allow the <a href="http://newsru.com/pict/big/1638518.html">direct election</a> of legislative and executive bodies in the regions. It is very unlikely that these demands have any relation to better governance in Ukraine&#8212;since 2000, the Kremlin has engaged in a project of centralizing power in Russia. It is therefore clear that Russia wants a decentralized Ukraine to help ensure that Ukraine does not move to closer to the West.</p>

<p>The "imposed constitution-making", however, model also does not fit.  The Ukrainian foreign ministry has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303847804579477570338512680?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303847804579477570338512680.html">rejected</a> Russian proposals for Ukrainian constitution-making as demanding "the complete capitulation of Ukraine, its dismemberment, and the destruction of Ukrainian statehood." Petro Poroshenko, the leading Presidential candidate, <a href="http://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/politics/okonchatelnaya-redaktsiya-novoy-konstitutsii-ukrainy-budet-01042014142300">said</a> that "[t]here's no basis" for federalization and that federalization would lead to "Crimea number two, three and four." In order to resist Russian influence, the Ukrainian government has relied on support from additional constitutional outsiders: the US and the European Union. Most notably, the Ukrainians have signaled that they will work closely with Europe's key public law advisory body: The Venice Commission.   </p>

<p><em>Voluntary Transfer of Control to Outsiders</em></p>

<p>The Ukrainian government's voluntary transfer of constitution-making decisions to the international level in order to counter Russian pressure suggests a scenario of outsider influence in constitution-making that lies somewhere between the imposed and supervised models of the spectrum of outsider influence. In this scenario, constitutional bargaining takes place at both the domestic and the international level.  </p>

<p>We are seeing this already. On March 30, after a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Barack Obama, the US Secretary of State met with Russian Foreign Minister to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/31/world/europe/kerry-and-russian-counterpart-meet-on-ukraine-crisis.html">find</a> a "political solution" to Ukraine. This political solution was primarily focused on discussions of Ukrainian constitution-making, including the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/31/world/europe/kerry-and-russian-counterpart-meet-on-ukraine-crisis.html">transfer</a> of an American document that was a "response to the Russian plan." More recently, in response to the capture of government buildings by pro-Russian militias, Russia, Ukraine, the European Union, and the United States met and agreed to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/world/europe/text-of-joint-diplomatic-statement-on-ukraine.html?ref=world">de-escalate</a> the process by supervising the "constitutional process."</p>

<p>This shift to international bargaining in Ukrainian constitution-making poses some dangers. In particular, it could lead the outsiders to decide key issues without important domestic input. This could lead to a dangerous disconnect between constitutional negotiations and actual events on the grounds.  Claims by pro-Russian groups that they will not recognize a recent deal between Russia and the West <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pro-russian-separatists-ignore-ukraine-peace-deal-2014-4">suggest</a> that this is a real danger. More importantly, the dangers of a disconnect between international negotiations and domestic events could lead to key groups rejecting the final Ukrainian Constitution outright&#8212;an outcome that could undermine the constitution-making process altogether. </p>

<p>The internationalization of Ukrainian constitution-making also, however, has some advantages. In particular, it could make it politically easier for the Ukrainian government to compromise with Russia. On the issue of federalization this might be already happening, as the US and Europe have pushed Ukraine to compromise with the Russians. The Ukrainian Prime Minister has <a href="http://www.interfax.com/newsinf.asp?id=492320">said</a> that Ukraine "need[s] to immediately implement constitutional reform and give people what rightfully belongs to them - power in the regions." Ukrainian authorities have then described this de-centralization project not as a way to compromise with Russia, but as a proposal that conforms with the European Charter of Local Self Government. And this Charter accords with at least one of the Russian demands: It calls for localities to have the ability to elect "councils or assemblies composed of members freely elected by secret ballot on the basis of direct, equal, universal suffrage." While the devil will be in the details of Ukrainian federalization, there does seem to be some room for negotiation on this point.  </p>

<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>

<p>What can we expect from future negotiations? Will the internationalization of the process further allow Ukraine to compromise with Russia on other demands&#8212;including potential NATO membership and the precise details of decentralization? And will Russia accept the decentralization plan that the Ukrainians adopt? And will this internationalized process become too divorced from key players on the ground in the rapidly changing crisis in Ukraine? The answers to these questions remain unclear.  </p>

<p>Two things are clear, however. First, the success of constitution-making in Ukraine will hinge on how effectively the different players are in balancing between international and domestic demands. Second, Ukraine's new constitution will be internationalized: The "framers" of the new Ukrainian constitution therefore are likely not to just be Ukrainians&#8212;and the bargaining is just as likely to take place in Geneva rather than Kiev.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.psu.edu/faculty/purvis">Dara Purvis</a> of the Pennsylvania State University Dickinson School of Law discusses how salary negotiation presents itself within a marriage and is not only between employer and employee ... </p><strong>A</strong></font>pril 8 was Equal Pay Day: on average, American women would have to work all of 2013 plus January 1 - April 8, 2014 to make the same earnings as American men did in 2013. President Obama marked the occasion by <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/obama-to-sign-executive-actions-targeting-gender-wage-gap.php#.U0hvZihLrdk">calling upon the Senate </a>to vote in favor of the <a href="http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/84">Paycheck Fairness Act</a> and by taking two small scale, concrete efforts in the form of an executive order and a Presidential memorandum. His actions illustrate not only the potential work that the law could do to eradicate the gender pay gap, but also the more entrenched societal and cultural stereotypes that root unequal pay not in the workforce, but in the home.</p>

<p>The low hanging fruit of gender pay inequality is making it easier&#8212;or in some cases, possible&#8212;for women who are paid less than their male colleagues to bring a discrimination claim against their employer. It seems like an obvious point, but in practice women rarely know how their salaries compare to their coworkers. </p>

<p>This lack of information proved fatal to the claims of Lilly Ledbetter, who was hired in 1979 as an area manager by Goodyear Tire &#38 Rubber Co. Ledbetter began work at the same salary as her male coworkers, but after nineteen years at Goodyear, she received an anonymous note telling her that she was paid 87 percent of the salary of the lowest paid male area manager and 71 percent of the highest paid male area manager. Ledbetter might have argued that her pay was lower because her managers discriminated against her as the only female area manager, but the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-1074.pdf">held</a> [PDF] that the initial alleged discrimination took place at the beginning of her employment with Goodyear. Because she didn't file within 180 days of that first allegedly discriminatory decision, her claim had expired. Even though she felt the effects of that discrimination for two decades of employment, the Supreme Court said that she had missed her moment to challenge her employer's illegal discrimination. </p>

<p>The first bill that President Obama signed into law was the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111s181enr/pdf/BILLS-111s181enr.pdf">Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009</a> [PDF], declaring that the statute of limitations for lawsuits challenging discriminatory wages is reset with each paycheck. Five years later, the administration's focus is still on the preliminary steps of simply gathering and exchanging information about paychecks, so that fewer women discover they have spent years receiving a lower paycheck. The Paycheck Fairness Act, for example, would amend the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> [PDF] to prohibit employers from punishing employees who share information about their salaries, require the Department of Labor to gather data about wages in order to allow further analysis of disparities along genderand racial lines, and establish civil liability for discriminatory employers. Despite Obama's call to consider the bill, Senate Republicans did not allow it to even come up for debate. That left Obama's two executive actions as the only tangible moves toward gender pay equality, effectively establishing for federal contractors what the Paycheck Fairness Act would do for all employers.</p>

<p>The president's proposals would help to eliminate the gender pay gap, and the ability of female employees to fight discrimination through legal means is a key component of any broader equality movement. But gender pay inequality is also the product of more complex and more deeply rooted issues that stretch far beyond traditional employment discrimination claims. The gender pay gap, as with so many problems of inequality, begins at home.</p>

<p>A common refrain in arguments against attempts to address pay inequality through legal means is that to the extent a gender pay gap exists, it is because women choose to earn less money: they choose to enter lower-paid professions and they take time off from the workplace to have children. As the Republican National Committee put it, "There's a disparity not because female engineers are making less than male engineers at the same company with comparable experience. The disparity <a href="http://www.gop.com/general/misleading-paycheck-fairness-act/">exists</a> because a female social worker makes less than a male engineer." As an initial matter, even controlling for virtually every variable such as children never actually eliminates the chasm between male and female earnings&#8212;it merely narrows it. But it is undoubtedly true that women are concentrated in lower-paid jobs&#8212;a recent White House <a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/whitehouseminimumwage.pdf">report</a> [PDF] found that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10, as President Obama has proposed, would instantly eliminate about 5 percent of the gender pay gap.</p>

<p>But what about the higher paid jobs? Rather than the RNC's example of an engineer, why not look at the legal industry. One recent study <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/upshot/the-pay-gap-is-because-of-gender-not-jobs.html?_r=0">found</a> that female lawyers make 82 percent of the salary of their male colleagues. The famed face time requirement in law firms exacerbates the problem. The first year out of law school, male and female attorneys are paid almost the same amount. But as the years go on, the women's wages <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_aeapress_2014_1.pdf">grow at a much slower rate</a> than their male colleagues. Some women may take time off to start a family, or request more flexible work hours to accommodate family responsibilities. But as many female law students are warned, this truly places them on the mommy track. The more hours a lawyer works, the higher his hourly salary&#8212;so an attorney working a 40-hour week is not paid half of what an attorney working an 80-hour week gets. This means every second a female attorney takes away from work, even if she is simply using the paltry maternity leave most legal employers give, causes exponential damage to her paycheck. </p>

<p>One could argue, of course, that this simply proves that women choose to earn less.  Women have children, they take on more household responsibilities and they prioritize private duty over wage-earning in a way that demonstrates it is simply female preferences at work. The larger problem with this argument, however, is that it assumes that women have free agency in allocating public and private responsibilities, particularly if they share their life with another person.</p>

<p>The lesson of gender pay inequality, in other words, for some is to choose a better husband. Phyllis Schlafly <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/facts-and-fallacies-about-paycheck-fairness-117959/">argued</a> recently that "The best way to improve economic prospects for women is to improve job prospects for the men in their lives, even if that means increasing the so-called pay gap." Both she and the notorious Princeton Mom lecture women that they should choose a husband who will make more money than their wife&#8212;as Schlafly put it, women prefer to have a higher-earning partner, men prefer to be the higher earning partner. (Needless to say, in Schlafly's vision of the world, LGBTQ people have either disappeared or don't care how much money they make.)</p>

<p>Most people think of salary negotiation as taking place between employee and employer. Schlafly is right, however, that some of the most important negotiation takes place within marriage. A first-level negotiation is whether to have children: male and female married lawyers without children have almost equal salaries. Once a female attorney decides to have children, the magnitude of harm it will cause to her salary depends on her husband. If she makes more money than her husband, the injury to her paycheck is minimized. If her husband's income is in the top 30 percent of national earnings distributions, her salary never recovers. Economic power, in other words, is not simply measured in the marketplace. Gender pay inequality is circular: a woman with less economic power in household bargaining will be more likely to take time off from work to fulfill household responsibilities, and will consequently earn even less. While Obama's marking of Equal Pay Day proposed a few small steps toward gender equality, the law has not yet begun to acknowledge, much less address, the force of the family and the laws, norms and stereotypes that affect it.</p>

		<title>A Definite Problem of Patent Law: Nautilus v. Biosig Instruments</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/about-us/staff/">Charles Duan</a> of <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/issues/detail/patent-reform">The Patent Reform Project at Public Knowledge</a> discusses problems in Patent Law and Nautilus v. Biosig Instruments...</p>

                <p>The patent system is intended to incentivize invention and the spread of knowledge. As part of dispatching this task, patent laws require that patents be described clearly&#8212;the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/112">statutory term</a> is "definiteness"&#8212;to ensure that later inventors can read those patents and build upon them. How strongly the law will adhere to the demand for definiteness and how strongly the patent system will protect those later inventors, are the central issues in the case  <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/nautilus-inc-v-biosig-instruments-inc/">Nautilus v. Biosig Instruments</a>, heard before the Supreme Court  on April 28, 2014.</p>

                <p>A patent, seen simply, is a legal instrument that encircles a portion of the space of human activities, placing a fence defining what infringes the patent. Throughout history, one point has been made central: that fence, called a "patent claim," must be clearly drawn to serve a public notice function informing future inventors of what is within the boundaries and what is not.</p>

                <p>Historical developments in patent law dating back a hundred years lend strong support to the rigorous demand for public notice in patent claims. In its original inception, patent law used a "<a href="https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/sites/lawreview.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/76.2/76_2_Fromer.pdf">central claiming</a>" [PDF] mechanism, where the inventor simply described the invention and the courts decided how widely the fence of infringement was to be drawn. However, toward the late nineteenth century, the US moved toward what is known as a "<a href="https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/sites/lawreview.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/76.2/76_2_Fromer.pdf">peripheral claiming</a>" [PDF] system, in which the patent applicant, at the time of applying for the patent, specified the boundaries of that fence, in the form of a patent claim.</p>

                <p>Permitting patent applicants to name the size of their own patent monopoly was a significant power, and with great power came great responsibility to clearly delineate that size. As the Supreme Court said in the 1876 case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5651162476633317567&q=%2522deprived%20of%20rights%2522">Merrill v. Yeomans</a>:</p>

                <blockquote>The public should not be deprived of rights supposed to belong to it without being clearly told what it is that limits these rights. The genius of the inventor, constantly making improvements in existing patents&#8212;a process which gives to the patent system its greatest value&#8212;should not be restrained by vague and indefinite descriptions of claims in existing patents from the salutary and necessary right of improving on that which has already been invented.</blockquote>

                <p>Thus, <span class="casename">Merrill</span> recognized three important points: first, the "greatest value" in the patent system is that it permits inventors to build off of the work of other inventors; second, this value belongs to the public; and third, to account for this public interest, patents must at a minimum use clear, definite language to define what infringes and what does not. </p>

                <p>This public interest in patent clarity has been reiterated by numerous cases. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3902403505024045637&q=%22nose+of+wax%22">White v. Dunbar</a> held that a patent claim should not be "a nose of wax, which may be turned and twisted in any direction." <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10342681730726503711&q=%2522unreasonable%20advantages%2522">United Carbon v. Binney</a> reiterated that claim definiteness "seeks to guard against unreasonable advantages to the patentee and disadvantages to others arising from uncertainty as to their rights." The list of precedents goes on and on.</p>

                <p>It is in this backdrop of law that the Supreme Court considered <span class="casename">Nautilus</span>.</p>

                <p>In <span class="casename">Nautilus</span>, the patent at issue involved the metal electrodes for measuring heart rates, as commonly found on handlebars of exercise machines. Generally each handlebar has two electrodes that, when grasped by a person's hand, complete an electrical circuit used to measure the person's heart rate.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US5337753">patent claims</a> specified that an exercise machine would infringe the patent if the two electrodes to be held by one hand were in a "spaced relationship" with each other. Based on rules of construing patent claims, there were at least two ways to understand that term "spaced relationship": either the electrodes had to be spaced in such a way that they performed particularly well at measuring heart rates or they could be spaced at any distance within the grasp of a human hand. The text of the patent offered very little guidance as to which of these two constructions was correct and so the accused infringer, Nautilus, argued that the claim was impermissibly indefinite.</p>

                <p>The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Biosig+Instruments,+Inc.+v.+Nautilus,+Inc.,+715+F.3d+891&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&as_vis=1&case=15342240687328083822&scilh=0">disagreed</a>. According to that appellate court, a claim is only indefinite if it is "insolubly ambiguous" or "not amenable to construction." The court then applied twenty-one paragraphs of analysis spanning ten pages of its opinion, citing to a great deal of expert testimony from the district court, to determine that construction number one was correct. Accordingly, and in spite of a concurrence finding construction number two to be more appropriate, a majority of the court concluded that the claim was not "insolubly ambiguous" and accordingly was sufficiently definite.</p>

                <p>It may seem strange to call something "definite" when it takes expert testimony and twenty-one paragraphs of analysis to decide its meaning, but the Federal Circuit laid out several justifications for its stringent "insolubly ambiguous" test for definiteness. According to the court, a patent claim may be acceptably definite even when the task of discerning the claim's meaning "may be formidable and the conclusion may be one over which reasonable persons will disagree." Such a rule is necessary, according to the court, to "accord respect to the statutory presumption of validity" and to "protect the inventive contribution of patentees, even when the drafting is less than ideal."</p>

                <p>But does the Federal Circuit's rationale of protecting patentees comport with the Supreme Court's understanding of the purpose of definiteness of patent claims? Protecting patentees "even when the drafting is less than ideal" would seem to be in direct conflict with the Supreme Court's mandate that the patentee is responsible for ensuring that the public is "clearly told what it is that limits these rights." And it would seem that a "formidable" claim would cause later inventors to be "restrained ... from the salutary and necessary right of improving on that which has already been invented."</p>

                <p>This conflict between the "insolubly ambiguous" test and the interest of protecting later inventors was a concern at the oral argument in <span class="casename">Nautilus</span>. Justice Sotomayor observed this discrepancy immediately. "There is a big difference between 'can I read this and give it a construction,' and whether or not a construction is definite enough so someone skilled in the art could understand it," <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-369_4oc4.pdf">she said</a>  [PDF], implicitly recognizing that the Patent Act demands the latter and not the former. She later reiterated, in questioning counsel for the patent owner Biosig, that "it seems logical, that you're going to stifle inventiveness if people can't, once the patent is issued, know how to get around it." Indeed, no Justice and no attorney in the Court, was willing to support the "insolubly ambiguous" test&#8212;Justice Scalia called it "extravagant language."</p>

                <p>It may be tempting to think of <span class="casename">Nautilus</span>, as with many other patent cases, as a private case between two companies over an obscure area of law. But, as I argued in my <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/13-369-BRIEF-OF-EFF-AND-PK-IN-NAUTILUS-v-BIOSIG.pdf">amicus brief</a> in the case, the problems of this dispute extend well beyond the individual parties, to an important concern about a very public interest in ensuring that all inventors continue to be free to exercise the "salutary and necessary right" of learning about and improving upon existing knowledge. "The future of patents will shape the future of innovation," I have <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/documents/a-five-part-plan-for-patent-reform">written before</a>, and <span class="casename">Nautilus</span> will play an important role in shaping both.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.faulkner.edu/jsl/faculty/deboer_michael.aspx">Michael J. DeBoer</a> of the Faulkner University Thomas Goode Jones School of Law discusses the recently passed Women's Health and Safety Act and the challenges facing this legislation... </p><strong>O</strong></font>n April 9, 2013, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley signed into law the <a href="http://alhousegop.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/01/Agenda_One-Sheet_Womens-Health-and-Safety.pdf">Women's Health and Safety Act</a> [PDF]. Two months later, two abortion providers filed a lawsuit challenging a provision of this legislation. A trial in this case is set to begin on May 19, 2014, before Senior U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson of the Middle District of Alabama.</p>

<p><strong>The Legislation in a Larger Context</strong></p>

<p>To understand why the Alabama legislature acted when and as it did in passing this Act, it is important to place it in a larger context. The Act originated in the Alabama House of Representatives. Mary Sue McClurkin, a seasoned legislator and businesswoman, sponsored the bill. It was introduced on February 5, 2013, and was passed by the House on February 19 and the Senate on April 2. Governor Bentley, who signed the bill a week later, is a medical doctor and board-certified dermatologist with more than four decades of experience in medical practice. The effective date was July 1, 2013.</p>

<p>The bill was introduced on the eve of the criminal trial of Kermit B. Gosnell, M.D., who owned and operated an abortion clinic in Philadelphia for decades. His trial began on March 18, 2013, but his case had been in the national news for over two years. In addition to other counts, Gosnell was charged with 8 counts of murder for killing 1 woman under his care and 7 babies. His adult patient had died when Gosnell's staff administered a lethal dose of anesthesia and painkillers, and the babies, who had been born alive, were killed when their spinal cords were cut with scissors. On May 13, 2013, the jury found him guilty of 3 counts of murder, 1 count of involuntary manslaughter, 2 dozen counts of performing illegal abortions, and more than 200 counts of violating Pennsylvania's 24-hour informed consent law. He was separately convicted of federal drug offenses for trafficking in prescription drugs.</p>

<p>The state charges against Gosnell stemmed from a grand jury's 281-page <a href="http://www.phila.gov/districtattorney/pdfs/grandjurywomensmedical.pdf">report</a> [PDF], which was issued on January 14, 2011. (Gosnell was arrested on January 19, 2011.) The grand jury report chronicled the acts and practices of Gosnell and his employees over many years. It detailed the unsafe conditions such as padlocked exit doors, broken equipment and unsanitary rooms and instruments. Sedating drugs had been administered without any licensed medical professional on the premises, and the necks and spinal cords of babies were "snipped" by one of his "fake doctors" and even administrative staff. When investigators searched the clinic, they discovered babies' body parts in various places in the clinic. The grand jury concluded that Gosnell committed hundreds of acts of infanticide, but that he got away with them because they occurred in his abortion clinic where he could hide behind a cloak of privacy. Furthermore, Gosnell destroyed patients' files, and he avoided seeking emergency care for patients when they experienced complications.</p>

<p>The report noted that illegal abortion procedures performed at his clinic were "a huge moneymaker." By day, his clinic was "a prescription mill," and by night, it was "an abortion mill." He and his wife killed the bigger babies on Sundays when clinic employees were not present. The grand jury estimated that he was making nearly $1.8 million per year, with late term abortions being among his more profitable procedures. Almost all of this money came from cash payments, but he also defrauded insurance companies. </p>

<p>In its report, the grand jury proposed various institutional and legal reforms. Statutes of limitations should be removed, or extended, to permit prosecutions for infanticide and illegal abortions that go undiscovered for years. Abortion clinics should be regulated, licensed and monitored as ambulatory surgical centers to provide comprehensive rules to ensure quality of care, and the regulations governing abortion providers should be updated to require regular inspections of facilities, files, certifications and licenses to protect women and premature babies. All abortions past 18 weeks should be performed or supervised by a board-certified obstetrician/gynecologist, and the name of the supervising obstetrician/gynecologist should be on the paperwork for every abortion the doctor supervises or performs. </p>

<p>The grand jury was also critical of lax governmental enforcement. Although authorities had received some reports about what was occurring at Gosnell's clinic, those who were responsible for overseeing him and his clinic failed to protect the women and children harmed there. (Apparently, no regulatory authorities inspected Gosnell's facility from 1993 to 2010, due at least in part to political concerns&#8212;abortion facilities would be unable to meet regulatory standards, resulting in a small number of abortion providers and limited access.) </p>

<p><strong>The Legislation Itself</strong></p>

<p>The Alabama legislature determined that a gap existed in Alabama law that needed to be filled with comprehensive standards of medical care for abortion and reproductive health centers. In the Act, the legislature made specific findings. Abortion and reproductive health centers in Alabama are the subjects of adverse licensure actions at a higher rate than facilities in other categories, and their regulatory non-compliance puts patients at unreasonable risk. Abortion providers profit from the procedures they perform, but these facilities treat their patients in a manner inconsistent with the treatment provided through the standard physician-patient relationship. At these facilities, surgical procedures are performed, but these facilities do not operate in the same manner as ambulatory surgical treatment centers and physician offices. Consequently, many of the safeguards found and the personal contact provided in traditional physician-patient relationships and other medical settings are not afforded at abortion-providing facilities, especially stand-alone clinics. Additionally, abortion procedures have attendant risks, cause unique stresses and concerns for patients, and take human lives, but abortion-providing facilities have often failed to meet acceptable standards of medical care. </p>

<p>Based upon these findings, the legislature acted to establish reasonable, medically appropriate health and safety standards. The Act requires that all patient care in abortion-providing facilities be rendered in accordance with all applicable laws, Alabama Board of Health and Alabama Board of Medical Examiners rules, and current standards of care, including all professional standards of practice. The Act places abortion and reproductive health centers in the ambulatory health care occupancy classification and requires that facilities comply with particular safety standards.</p>

<p>In establishing health and safety standards, the law mandates the personal presence and participation of physicians in abortion procedures&#8212;only physicians may perform abortions, and physicians must remain on the premises during and after performing abortion procedures until all patients are discharged. The Act imposes specific requirements related to nursing care, and personal examination requirements related to the prescribing of abortion-inducing drugs. Prior to discharge, patients must be provided the names and the telephone numbers of the physicians who will provide care in the event of complications. Additionally, each physician must comply with the regulations that govern office-based surgery, meet the standards prescribed in the administrative rules for "office-based procedures&#8212;moderate sedation/analgesic," and adhere to all other requirements in those rules, including guidelines related to follow-up care and standards regarding recovery area and assessment for discharge. </p>

<p>Additionally, the Act requires that each physician performing abortions have staff privileges at an acute care hospital within the same metropolitan statistical area as the abortion-providing facility to perform dilation and curettage, laparotomy procedures, hysterectomy and other procedures reasonably necessary to treat abortion-related complications. Through credentialing processes, hospital medical staffs determine which physicians may admit or treat patients in particular hospitals based upon professional licensure, experience, competence, ability and judgment. Staff privileges are often crucial to a physician's successful practice, giving the physician and patients ready access to a local hospital in the event that such care is needed and allowing continuity of care.</p>

<p>Because the legislature was concerned about abortion providers who were unable or unwilling to conform to the standards of care, it provided for enforcement mechanisms. These range from criminal penalties to civil actions and adverse licensure actions.</p>

<p><strong>The Legal Challenge</strong></p>

<p>In the pending federal lawsuit, the plaintiffs are <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppse/">Planned Parenthood Southeast, Inc.</a> (PPS), a Georgia nonprofit corporation; Reproductive Health Services, Inc. (RHS), an Alabama corporation; and individuals who own or administer the clinics. (PPS is an affiliate of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc.) The plaintiffs operate abortion-providing facilities in Birmingham, Mobile and Montgomery. They have claimed that the Act's staff privilege requirement violates various constitutional rights: due process; equal protection; and liberty and privacy. They contend that the legislation unconstitutionally restricts the availability of abortion services in Alabama, and delegates licensing authority to private parties. According to court documents, PPS and RHS employ physicians who do not reside in the communities where the facilities are located, which impedes the ability of their physicians to obtain staff privileges. The defendants are state and local government officials charged with enforcing Alabama's laws.</p>

<p>This constitutional litigation is a part of the larger advocacy efforts of the Planned Parenthood Federation and its affiliates. For decades, they have battled against state legislative efforts to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&q">ensure</a> that decisions to have abortions are informed and voluntary and to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3638004152923873163&q">involve</a> parents in the decisions of minor children. They also <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7079370668659431881&q">fought</a> against the federal prohibition of partial birth abortion, a method of late-term abortion. </p>

<p>Judge Thompson has enjoined enforcement of the requirement while this case proceeds, and the parties have moved for summary judgment, submitting extensive briefing and evidentiary materials in support. On March 31, 2013, Thompson dismissed without prejudice the claim that the Act delegates licensing authority to private parties and determined that a trial is necessary on the substantive due process claim.</p>

<p>In reaching his ultimate decision on the merits, Thompson will have the benefit of a recent US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruling on a similar staff privilege requirement in Texas law. In a unanimous decision, Judge Edith H. Jones, joined by Judges Jennifer Walker Elrod and Catharina Haynes, <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C13/13-51008-CV1.pdf">determined</a> [PDF] that the Texas law did not facially violate substantive due process rights by imposing a substantial burden on a woman's right to abortion. Regardless how Thompson ultimately rules, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit will undoubtedly review his rulings soon. </p>

		<title>New York Bar Association Urges US to Push UN to Accept Responsibility for Cholera Epidemic in Haiti</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist<a href="http://www1.law.wne.edu/faculty/index.cfm?selection=doc.9735&uid=79"> Lauren Carasik</a> of Western New England School of Law argues that the UN must change its recent course and uphold its international duties to provide a forum for legal redress to the victims of the Cholera outbreak in Haiti ... </p><strong>L</strong></font>ast month, the venerable <a href="http://www.nycbar.org">New York City Bar Association</a> <a href="http://www.nycbar.org/44th-street-blog/2014/04/22/1548/">added</a> the voices of its 24,000 local and international members to the mounting pressure on the UN to take responsibility for the cholera epidemic in Haiti that has killed 8,500 people and sickened more than 700,00. Penning a letter on behalf of the organization, president Carey Dunne urged Secretary of State John Kerry to implore the UN to respect its obligations, concluding that "It is in the legal and foreign policy interests of the United States to promote the rule of law, international law and compliance with international treaty obligations, including by the UN itself."</p>

<p>The cholera epidemic began in Haiti in October 2010, less than a year after the country was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/01/12/haiti.earthquake/">ravaged</a> by the January earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people, injured countless others and left hundreds of thousands living in squalid and unsanitary displacement camps that lacked even the most basic services. The disease had never been previously recorded in Haiti.</p>

<p>Shortly before the cholera claimed its first Haitian victim, a Nepalese contingent of UN peacekeeping forces, known by their French acronym, MINUSTAH, was deployed to Haiti. At the time, Katmandu was experiencing a known outbreak of cholera that is nearly identical to the strain that has spread across Haiti. The disease was dispersed by inadequate waste treatment management that systematically leaked contaminated sewage into a tributary of the Artibonite River, which serves as the source of drinking and bathing water for tens of thousands of Haitians. Already rendered vulnerable to illness by poverty and inadequate water, sanitation and health facilities, cholera rampaged through the country. The disease continues to claim lives and ravage communities, and threatens other countries in the region as well, having spread already to the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Cuba.</p>

<p>Haitian cholera victims initially sought redress at the UN, petitioning the organization to establish a standing claims commission to resolve civil claims, as required by the <a href="http://www.ijdh.org/2004/07/archive/agreement-between-the-united-nations-and-the-government-of-haiti-concerning-the-status-of-the-united-nations-operation-in-haiti/#.U24kiqXOG2w">Status of Forces Agreement</a> signed by the UN and Haiti in 2004. Rejecting the petition, the UN <a href="http://www.ijdh.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/20130705164515.pdf">argued</a> that it was not receivable, since consideration of the claims would require a policy review that is prohibited under Section 2 of the 1946 <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ethics/pdf/convention.pdf">Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the UN</a> [PDF]. But as the New York Bar Association letter claims, "It is not credible for the UN to maintain that these tort claims brought by individuals would somehow 'necessarily include a review of political and policy matters' and thus relieve the UN of its obligation to provide an appropriate alternate mode of settlement." </p>

<p>Contrary to the UN's assertion, its immunity is not absolute. Instead, conditional immunity is premised on the expectation that the UN would implement an internal mechanism for the resolution for civil disputes arising out of its presence in a country. Section 29 of the Convention requires the UN to "make provisions for appropriate modes of settlement of disputes arising out of contracts and other disputes of a private law character." The claims of negligence, gross negligence and recklessness are quintessentially private law claims. Yet no mechanism to resolve disputes has been established in Haiti, or any other country.</p>

<p>As the incalculable toll of death and suffering has continued to rise, the UN has been <a href="http://www.ijdh.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/20130705164515.pdf">unable to raise</a> [PDF] more than a fraction of the funds needed for its cholera eradication plan, including improvements to the country's fragile water, sanitation and health infrastructure. The UN's intransigence undermines its credibility and may deter other donors from making contributions, reluctant to entrust an organization that shirks its clear responsibility, both morally and legally, for causing the epidemic.</p>

<p>After the UN's denial of responsibility, those associated with the organization initially circled the wagons. But many close to the organization are now speaking out and urging the UN to take responsibility for the suffering it caused. In a report written in February and delivered to the Human Rights Council in March, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/CountriesMandates/HT/Pages/IEHaiti.aspx">Gustavo Gallon</a>, UN Independent Expert on Human Rights in Haiti, lambasted the UN for its failure to take responsibility for the epidemic, and pushed the UN to set up a commission "to enable damages to be recorded, corresponding benefits or compensation to be paid, the persons responsible to be identified, the epidemic to be stopped and other measures to be implemented." Last October, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/un-official-pushes-compensation-haiti-victims">called</a> for the cholera victims to be compensated. Kul Guatam, former UN Assistant Secretary-General from Nepal, also <a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/10/in-haiti-cholera-claims-new-victims-daily/">supports</a> compensation, stating his "wish a creative solution could be found whereby the Haitian victims would get some modest amount of financial support on humanitarian grounds, without the UN having to give up its diplomatic immunity," which would require "some enlightened governments and foundations...to offer help, not as a matter of legal obligation, but as a matter of humanitarian consideration." Stephen Lewis, who served as Canadian ambassador to the United Nations and worked for the UN as Deputy Director of UNICEF and as UN Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, <a href="http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/haiti-canada-blog/2013/10/stephen-lewis-says-united-nations-must-be-accountable-chole">backs</a> the litigation against the UN, stating "I think it is unequivocal, the responsibility of the United Nations for the cholera outbreak." Bruce Rashkow, formerly of the UN Office of Legal Affairs and the US Mission to the UN, <a href="http://www.unanca.org/news-events/news/207-remedies-for-harm-caused-by-un-peacekeepers">questioned</a> how the claims could be considered to fall outside the UN's obligations to settle, and noted that "as the head of the UN legal office that routinely handled claims against the Organization for some ten years, I did not recall any previous instance where such a formulation was utilized."</p>

<p>Yet even after three class action lawsuits, multiple scientific studies and <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/news/17237.htm">overwhelming evidence</a> of its culpability, the UN continues the deafening silence on its responsibility for bringing cholera to Haiti. And it continues to evade its financial obligation to vanquish the waterborne disease from the already impoverished island and to make those who have suffered whole. The UN's legitimacy is premised on its own respect for the principles it espouses. Despite a charge that includes modeling foundational principles of democracy, accountability and stewardship for humanity, however, the UN refuses to be held to that standard itself. As Dunne's letter notes, "The position taken by the UN runs the risk of encouraging governments or courts around the world to lift the UN's immunity, which is not in the interest of either the UN or the United States."</p>

<p>The UN's compliance with international legal standards is critical to upholding its lofty mission of encouraging justice and the rule of law. Dunne's letter noted that his organization is "particularly concerned that the position taken by the UN in this matter is not consistent with its obligations under the 1946 Convention and runs the risk of undermining not only UN immunity worldwide but also in the US as the host State of the Organization and in New York City as host City. It also exposes the UN to charges that it is using its treaty-based immunity to deny victims of a cholera epidemic any recourse to justice." Given the compelling legal arguments for UN liability, the New York Bar Association has joined many others in imploring the US, "to call upon the UN to perform its obligations under that Convention and provide an appropriate mode for settling the cholera claims." The rising number of cholera victims have already waited long enough for justice.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.virginia.edu/lawweb/faculty.nsf/fhpbi/1165630">Brandon L. Garrett</a> of the University of Virginia School of Law comments on the recent problems with botched lethal injections being administered for purposed of imposing the death penalty ... </p><strong>"W</strong></font>e're going to close the blinds temporarily," the Oklahoma corrections officer <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/state/eyewitness-account-a-minute-by-minute-look-at-what-happened/article_f7764efc-d036-11e3-af7e-0017a43b2370.html">told</a> those in the witness room, when Clayton Lockett's execution started to go terribly wrong. None of those outside could see what happened during the almost 45 minute-long botched execution, and the "shuttered blinds" became a metaphor for the modern administration of the death penalty. Behind the curtain, "unknown drugs" and "untested protocols" were used "behind a wall of secrecy," <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/30/oklahoma-execution-misstep-legal-assault-drug-secrecy">said</a> Lockett's lawyer Cheryl Pilate. Challenges to such secret protocols have been brought in a range of states, including Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Missouri and Texas; one federal judge in a recent <a href="http://www.acslaw.org/sites/default/files/Missouri_EighthCircuit.pdf">dissent</a> [PDF] argued the state cannot simply hide "behind the hangman's cloak." But following that botched execution the Oklahoma Court of Appeals approved a six-month stay of executions to at least review the matter. </p>

<p>Will we finally see what lies behind the hangman's cloak? Some even suggest that we shouldn't try. Boer Deng and Dahlia Lithwick, writing for <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/05/death_penalty_in_america_how_the_push_to_abolish_capital_punishment_has.html">Slate</a>, make the provocative claim that it is death penalty opponents that have put states in a bind, with European companies refusing to supply the drugs used in executions, and doctors adopting the view that it violates the Hippocratic Oath to participate in capital punishment. Of course, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> requires humane executions, whether or not the "market" can supply lethal drugs on the cheap. They also claim that lethal injection has "become more gruesome and violent in recent years." </p>

<p>In fact, the death penalty has always been gruesome and violent. Read Austin Sarat's new book, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gruesome-Spectacles-Botched-Executions-Americas/dp/0804789169">Gruesome Spectacles</a>" describing the history of botched executions in the US. Its release had an unintentionally macabre timing to it, what with Lockett's execution. But as Sarat describes, this was nothing new. Whether it was hanging, electrocution, lethal gas, electricity and gas or lethal injection, state killing has never been able to guarantee "humane" process. Of course, the very notion is itself perverse, but let's put that to one side momentarily. Even when we adopted "modern" methods to stop making executions gruesome and violent on purpose, no method has provided a technological "fix" to the problem.<br />
 <br />
Indeed, Oklahoma officials blamed Lockett's botched execution on a "<a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303939404579532601590717622">vein failure</a>," or to be more specific, they administered the IV through his groin, the line at some point became <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-27249743">dislodged</a>, and his "<a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/state/eyewitness-account-a-minute-by-minute-look-at-what-happened/article_f7764efc-d036-11e3-af7e-0017a43b2370.html">vein exploded</a>." Some people have smaller or hard to find veins, making for uncomfortable routine shots or blood tests&#8212;and for the condemned, horribly botched executions. The "best" and most instantly and painlessly lethal drugs in the world cannot solve that problem. Having restored access to the "three drug cocktail" from European companies would not solve the problem either. In fact, that combination was itself untested despite being "standard," and itself may have caused paralysis that disguised deep suffering. That is why a recent bipartisan <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org">Constitution Project</a> report <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Irreversible-Errors_FINAL.pdf">recommends</a> [PDF] use of one drug but also consultation with legitimate scientific experts. </p>

<p>Imagine the horrifying research that doctors of death would have to do to systematically analyze how to make executions fast and painless for each kind of body type and circumstance. If anything, as Sarat documents, botched executions have been more common, particularly in the past few decades, from 1980 to 2010. Some people didn't conduct electricity well&#8212;leading to horrible botched executions where the condemned caught on fire, smoked or had to be jolted time and again. And now that lethal injections have taken the place of the chair, problems with lethal injections have been far from a symptom of recent difficulties getting ahold of drugs. There were fewer botched lethal injections in the 1980s (10) than in the 2000s (34). But that is because there were still quite a few electrocutions in the 1980s (and botched ones), and because there were not many executions themselves in the 1980s, while executions <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions-year">rose sharply</a> by 2000 (and have been declining ever since). </p>

<p>Methods of execution have not gone "underground." They have always been underground. No one is stopping executions from being conducted out in the open, with transparent drugs and protocols, video-cameras or attendance by the public. Given the taste of prior generations for watching intentionally gruesome executions, it is unlikely that more sunlight would mobilize more constructive attention to practice of capital punishment. </p>

<p>The death penalty is in a steep decline for other reasons: the fear that the death penalty is arbitrarily imposed; it is handed out in only certain states and counties and by certain prosecutors; it is inflected by race; criteria for deciding who is "death worthy" are vague; and it is used in high-stakes cases in which too many innocent people have been sent to death row. As I have <a href="http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/112/6/Garrett.pdf">described elsewhere</a> [PDF], 18 death-row inmates have been exonerated by DNA, and in many of those cases it was sheer luck that there was biological evidence to test. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/04/23/1306417111">Far more</a> death-row inmates have been exonerated based on non-DNA evidence, as Samuel Gross and colleagues have recently described. We will never know how many innocent individuals never located such evidence, so were executed. </p>

<p>Stays of executions have become far more common in the past decade. Some have been prelude to abolition of capital punishment (Illinois, for example) while others have given states and the public some time to decide whether to try to fix it (Maryland) but then maybe abolish it (Maryland). The death penalty debate has focused in recent weeks on methods of execution, but whether that Oklahoma stay will lead to any constructive reforms is more doubtful. </p>

<p>We cannot get executions "down to a science," and we never will. Not only is there no clean and humane way to carry out the executions themselves, as if such a thing made sense, but we certainly cannot get prosecutorial discretion down to a science, effective indigent representation down to a science, witness testimony down to a science, jury decisions down to a science or police investigations down to a science. Science may be able to improve some aspects of criminal casework, like forensic analysis, assessments of intellectual disability, interrogations and eyewitness identification procedures, but many jurisdictions have resisted such improvements, even (or especially) in death penalty cases. Unlike the Justices of the Supreme Court, whom Justice Robert Jackson famously called "infallible only because we are final," the death penalty is final, but inescapably fallible.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header> JURIST Guest Columnist Michael Blissenbach, <a href="http://www.stthomas.edu/law/">University of St. Thomas School of Law</a> Class of 2015, discusses Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's Veto of SB 236, which would have codified the rights of students to pray voluntarily in school and at school events and argues that his veto of the bill was justified...</j:header>On April 27, 2014 Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?141+sum+SB236">SB 236</a>, a bill which, as McAuliffe describes in his veto <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?141+amd+SB236AG">message</a>, "proposes to codify the right of students in public schools to pray, engage in religious activities or other forms of expression and to organize prayer groups, gatherings and religious clubs to the same extent that students may engage in nonreligious activities or expression and organize other activities and groups." McAuliffe makes two <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/virginia-governor-vetoes-school-prayer-bill.php">arguments</a> in support of his decision to veto the bill:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The provisions in the bill pertaining to religious student clubs having equal privileges to secular student clubs is unnecessary because the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/4071">Equal Access Act</a> (Act) already requires public high schools to allow religious student clubs the same privileges that are granted to secular student clubs.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?141+ful+SB236ER">mandate</a> in the bill that schools must establish a limited public forum at all school events with a public speaker and "not regulate a student's expression of a religious viewpoint on an otherwise permissible subject" violates the constitutional rights of students to attend voluntary and mandatory school events without being exposed to prayer and religious messages of a coercive nature.</li>
</ol>

<p>I argue here that McAuliffe's first argument is incorrect but his second argument is correct in light of the US Supreme Court's reasoning in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=140480915250262562">Lee v. Weisman</a>. I will address McAuliffe's arguments in that order. </p>

<p>The Act, which McAuliffe cites as evidence that the provisions of SB 236 pertaining to student religious clubs are unnecessary, provides that: <blockquote>It shall be unlawful for any public secondary school which receives federal financial assistance and which has a limited open forum to deny equal access or a fair opportunity to, or discriminate against, any students who wish to conduct a meeting within that limited open forum on the basis of the religious, political, philosophical, or other content of the speech at such meetings.</blockquote><br />
The Act then defines a "limited open forum" as follows: A public secondary school has a limited open forum whenever such school grants an offering to or opportunity for one or more noncurriculum related student groups to meet on school premises during noninstructional time. Thus, McAuliffe is correct in his claim that all public secondary schools that provide an opportunity for at least one extracurricular student group to meet on school premises must provide that same opportunity to other student groups, regardless of their religious, political, or philosophical views. </p>

<p>The provisions in SB 236, however, are broader than the Act. SB 236s' provisions pertain to students in all public schools, whereas the Equal Access Act only pertains to public secondary schools (middle schools and high schools). Public elementary schools and preschools are not required to allow religious student groups to meet on school property. Under SB 236, elementary schools would be required to allow religious student groups to meet on school property, and preschools may have to as well depending on whether they are considered "public schools" under applicable Virginia law, as SB 326 does not define the term.</p>

<p>Moreover, whereas the provisions of the Act only pertain to free access to meeting space, the provisions of SB 236 apply to both access to methods of promotion and to meeting space accorded to secular student groups. Consequently, McAuliffe's argument that the provisions in SB 236 are redundant and unnecessary due to their already being contained in the federal Equal Access Act is incorrect because the scope of the provisions in the relevant part of SB 236 is much broader than in the Act.</p>

<p>McAuliffe's contention that the provisions of SB 236 pertaining to creating a limited public forum at all school events with a public speaker and prohibiting school officials from blocking students from expressing a religious viewpoint in a speech on an otherwise permissible secular subject, however, is a valid concern and justification for vetoing SB 236, because a credible argument can be made that those provisions in SB 236 would conflict with the US Supreme Court's ruling in <span class="casename">Lee v. Weisman</span>.</p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Weisman</span>, the court held that having a benediction and invocation as part of a high school graduation ceremony violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> to the US Constitution, reasoning that: <blockquote>The undeniable fact is that the school district's supervision and control of a high school graduation ceremony places public pressure, as well as peer pressure, on attending students to stand as a group or, at least, maintain respectful silence during the invocation and benediction. This pressure, though subtle and indirect, can be as real as any overt compulsion. Of course, in our culture standing or remaining silent can signify adherence to a view or simple respect for the views of others. And no doubt some persons who have no desire to join a prayer have little objection to standing as a sign of respect for those who do. But for the dissenter of high school age, who has a reasonable perception that she is being forced by the State to pray in a manner her conscience will not allow, the injury is no less real. There can be no doubt that for many, if not most, of the students at the graduation, the act of standing or remaining silent was an expression of participation in the rabbi's prayer. That was the very point of the religious exercise. It is of little comfort to a dissenter, then, to be told that for her the act of standing or remaining in silence signifies mere respect, rather than participation. What matters is that, given our social conventions, a reasonable dissenter in this milieu could believe that the group exercise signified her own participation or approval of it.</blockquote></p>

<p>The court then further elaborates on this coercion test: <blockquote>Finding no violation under these circumstances would place objectors in the dilemma of participating, with all that implies, or protesting. We do not address whether that choice is acceptable if the affected citizens are mature adults, but we think the state may not, consistent with the Establishment Clause, place primary and secondary school children in this position. Research in psychology supports the common assumption that adolescents are often susceptible to pressure from their peers towards conformity, and that the influence is strongest in matters of social convention.</blockquote></p>

<p>In other words, the court is stating that in public school-sponsored activities, such as high school graduation ceremonies, public school children cannot be placed into circumstances where they can be coerced into going along with overtly religious activity. Although it could be argued that SB 236 is distinguishable in that it requires a letter be sent to parents before any speech with religious content disavowing any school endorsement of the content of the speech, that is likely insufficient because a reasonable observer from the community could still infer that the school approved the content of the speech and the government is providing the platform for the speech, even if the speech is given by a student. Moreover, school officials are barred from regulating the content of the speech, even if a prayer is given by the student during the speech, and such a prayer could include a request by the student for people to bow their heads while the prayer is recited. This would constitute the exact sort of coercion that the court ruled unconstitutional in <span class="casename">Weisman</span>. Thus, McAuliffe's concerns that some of the provisions of SB 236 are unconstitutional is well-founded and his veto of the bill was justified.</p>

		<title>Secrecy in Lethal Injection: How the Oklahoma Courts are Supporting a Deadly Double Standard</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Kimberly Newberry, <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/">Harvard Law School</a> Class of 2014, clarifies the current policy surrounding lethal injection law in Oklahoma and explores the repercussions of such a policy...</j:header>On April 29, 2014, the State of Oklahoma forced Clayton Lockett to have a heart attack during a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/us/oklahoma-executions.html?_r=0">botched</a> lethal injection. At least, that is the information that has been released to the public. Lockett and his attorneys had a lot of questions prior to his execution. They knew the date and that the State would inject him with a cocktail of lethal drugs, but the rest of the details were shrouded in a veil of secrecy &#8212; secrecy that the Oklahoma Supreme Court had <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15857624618232608505">decided</a> earlier in the week does not violate Lockett's constitutional right to access the courts.</p>

<p><strong>How Lethal Injection Works</strong></p>

<p>To understand death row prisoners' desire to have details of their proposed executions heard by the courts, it is important to know how states usually conduct lethal injection and why it has the potential to be unconstitutionally inhumane. Historically, most states used a <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-lethal-injection">three-drug cocktail</a>: pentobarbital or sodium thiopental, barbiturates that put a person to sleep so they are unable to feel anything else; pancuronium bromide, a paralytic to stop muscular movement and prevent respiration; and potassium chloride, which stops the heart.</p>

<p>Many opponents to this cocktail concede that if the first drug is properly administered, there is little to no likelihood that the extreme pain associated with the second and third drugs is felt. The problem, however, has been the insufficient guarantee of proper <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/05/botched-death-shows-problems-of-lethal-injection.html">administration</a>: faulty IV lines; the inexperience of the execution team members, who oftentimes do not have medical degrees; and questions surrounding the sources and purity of the drugs all lead to the possibility that the first drug will not work and the prisoner will feel everything else that happens. When the individual begins to experience pain, the second drug &#8212; a paralytic &#8212; will have already kicked in, making he or she unable to signal to anyone watching what is happening. By the time the executioners administer the third drug, the person will experience immense pain and feelings of suffocation or drowning. But nobody will know.</p>

<p><strong>The State of Current Lethal Injection Law</strong></p>

<p>Following numerous executions with signs that someone was conscious throughout the execution, lawyers representing clients on death row filed claims that lethal injection is a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a>. Today's lethal injection law is largely shaped by <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10752510346595419167">Baze v. Rees</a>, a US Supreme Court case in 2008 that reviewed Kentucky's lethal injection protocol. In a severely fractured opinion, a plurality for the court provided that for lethal injection to violate the Eighth Amendment's protection against cruel and unusual punishment, there must be a risk of pain that is "sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering and give rise to sufficiently imminent dangers."  The plurality found Kentucky's lethal injection protocol and any that are "substantially similar" constitutional. </p>

<p>A torrent of cases across the country arose to determine whether each protocol fell within what is often referred to as <u>Baze</u>'s safe harbor (safe for those implementing lethal injection, not for those being executed, of course). Despite a variety of differences in these protocols, most of them were either deemed facially similar and thus constitutional, or prison officials made oral representations to the courts that they could make amendments to any troubling provisions. A large part of the <u>Baze</u> decision, and the lower courts' review of state protocols, has been the speculative nature of many lethal injection claims. Plaintiffs in these suits are able to show what problems have already occurred in past executions, but <u>Baze</u> was clear that one accident or mistake does not lead to a constitutional violation. Many courts refused to find a "sure or very likely" risk in what might go wrong, even when looking at past experience. But as American lawyers needed to figure out a new approach, the fight continued overseas.</p>

<p><strong>The Drug Shortage</strong></p>

<p>In 2010, Reprieve, an organization based in London that seeks abolition of the death penalty, launched a campaign aimed at encouraging pharmaceutical companies in the United Kingdom to <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/publiceducation/executiondrugstimeline/">stop</a> supplying lethal drugs to American prisons. The United Kingdom no longer has the death penalty, so once Reprieve publicly revealed which companies were involved in US executions, the companies quickly changed their practices. Many of them stressed the fact that they were in the business of developing medicines to improve and even save lives, not to end them. They stopped selling their drugs to prisons or placed strict guidelines on buyers not to use them in executions. Soon, the source for sodium thiopental and pentobarbital was completely stymied. This resulted in a mass shortage all across the US. The prisons had a limited supply of their barbiturates left, and those they had bore imminent expiration dates. </p>

<p>When the prisons still had drugs, though, questions arose surrounding where they came from. Allegations that the prisons were circumventing FDA requirements surfaced and in 2010 the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) seized many prisons' supplies, further contributing to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/us/22lethal.html?_r=0">shortage</a>. In response, prison officials relied more heavily on <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/compounding-pharmacies">compounding pharmacies</a>, which combine ingredients on-site to produce drugs. Since compounding pharmacies are bound by less strict FDA guidelines, concerns exist as to the purity and efficacy of these compounded substances. In an effort to get more information about these drugs, those facing death sentences and their attorneys started filing discovery and Freedom of Information Act requests. State legislatures blocked these attempts by passing secrecy statutes to make execution protocols confidential, including what drugs might be used and their suppliers. Once this happened, prisoners on death row filed lawsuits against the DOC claiming that this violated their constitutional rights to due process and access the courts. Without knowing how a state plans to execute someone, it is impossible for that person to review the information and bring any necessary Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment claims. </p>

<p><strong>The Oklahoma Approach</strong></p>

<p>This is the problem Lockett ran into with the Oklahoma DOC. After <u>Baze</u>, Oklahoma courts confirmed that its own three-drug cocktail abided by constitutional standards in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12283918340294463498">Pavatt v. Jones</a>. Once Oklahoma hit a drug shortage, it had a choice to make if it wanted to continue using lethal injection: change its cocktail again or start using compounding pharmacies. To cover its bases, Oklahoma passed a new lethal injection protocol on March 21, 2014, allowing it to <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/04/double-execution-tonight-ok-using-secret-experimental-drug-protocol">choose</a> one of five different drug combinations for each. Other than agreeing to notify those facing execution which combination it would use, everything else remained secret. The attorney general's office <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/12/oklahoma-secret-supply-execution-drugs">informed</a> Lockett that it would use midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride and provided the amounts. The officials also told Lockett's attorneys that the drugs came directly from manufacturers and not from a compounding agency, but they refused to provide any names. They claimed this is necessary because otherwise its suppliers will receive threats and refuse to provide drugs in the future, inhibiting the State's ability to carry out death sentences. </p>

<p>Lockett's attorneys stressed how important it is to know all of the information, especially with the addition of midazolam to the cocktail. Midazolam was used in the highly controversial execution of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/16/justice/ohio-dennis-mcguire-execution/index.html?iref=allsearch">Dennis McGuire</a> in Ohio this past January, where witnesses reported that the procedure took 20 to 25 minutes and that McGuire was gasping for breath for 10 minutes before he was pronounced dead. Midazolam has also been used as part of a three-drug procedure in Florida, and, while the Florida execution seemingly went without issue, the Oklahoma protocol calls for less midazolam than Florida's. Since the amount of pain felt depends on this first drug, it is absolutely crucial that it is pure and efficacious. </p>

<p>On March 26, 2014, an Oklahoma district court found Oklahoma's secrecy requirements <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-26761728">unconstitutional</a> since it prohibited their right to access the courts. The attorney general appealed. The Oklahoma Supreme Court decided in a five to four vote that it would hear the case and granted both men a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-27106623">stay</a>. Victory was short-lived, however, and on April 23, 2014, the Oklahoma Supreme Court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12367997800644158271">ruled</a> in favor of the DOC, finding that it was enough for Lockett to know what drugs would be used and that they do not need to know where the drugs come from.</p>

<p>Lockett's execution went ahead on April 29, 2014, and many of the concerns Lockett's attorneys had raised before the execution became a reality. The midazolam did not quickly render Lockett unconscious; after a doctor announced that Lockett was unconscious, Lockett attempted to speak and move around; and over 40 minutes into the procedure Lockett died of a heart attack. Additionally, the prison staff pulled a curtain when Lockett first started moving, so the witnesses &#8212; including Lockett's attorneys &#8212; were unable to see the rest of the execution. What actually happened in the execution chamber after the curtain was pulled became another state secret.  </p>

<p><strong>The Deadly Double Standard </strong></p>

<p>Like many plaintiffs challenging lethal injection protocols, Lockett lost because the court did not want to rely on what <em>might</em> happen to him. While this was an access to the courts claim, the opinion still referred to the fact that this access "does not include the right to discover a cause of action . . . ." This only hindered prisoners' ability to bring a cruel and unusual punishment claim, since it makes it unlikely they will be able to meet the strict <u>Baze</u> standard without more information on how the state plans to kill them. Before Lockett's execution, he did not know whether the drugs were FDA-approved, whether the DOC obtained them legally, whether the drugs were created by a proper manufacturer or how the drugs were created at all. </p>

<p>Courts do, however, allow speculation from the DOC. Courts permit these officials, not just in Oklahoma but across the country, to hide behind what might happen if the public were to know more about executions, despite the fact that executions are supposedly committed on behalf of the people. The rationale behind the secrecy statutes has been to protect the identities of those involved in executions. DOCs may speculate that the drug suppliers will receive threats and that upon receiving threats all of their potential suppliers will refuse to sell them drugs. The courts are buying this. In doing so, they are allowing prisons to block death row prisoners' constitutional claims with the DOC's own speculative claim. If the DOC is allowed to justify its decisions on what might happen, then those facing execution should be allowed to build their claims off of what might happen (and clearly did happen). Instead, the protocol that was upheld in <u>Baze</u> - one that called for sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride; one that used drugs from FDA-approved manufacturers obtained via legal importing channels; and one that told people exactly what the suggested protocol was - has been replaced by protocols with alternative one-, two- and three-drug cocktails with a variety of suggested drugs; drugs thrown together by unregulated companies; and hidden information important for reviewing the constitutionality of execution procedures. In allowing this, the courts have turned <u>Baze</u>'s safe harbor into <u>Baze</u>'s come one, come all zone. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen how long the Supreme Court either passively allows this to continue, affirmatively condones it by granting cert and upholding lower court decisions, or provides those on death row with a meaningful opportunity to have a court review the constitutionality of the procedure to take their lives. In Justice Taylor's concurrence of the OSC's opinion, he wrote that prisoners are not entitled to information about the drugs, because "if they were being executed in the electric chair, they would have no right to know whether OG&E or PSO were providing the electricity . . . or if they were being executed by firing squad, they would have no right to know whether it be by Winchester or Remington."  With all due respect to a state supreme court justice, the difference is that when a person is shot with a Winchester or Remington, they know what that gun will do to them. Electricity is electricity, regardless of which power company supplies it. The problem with drugs, and the whole point in having an FDA, is that it matters what substance a person puts in his body. It matters who made it; it matters how it was made; and it matters what it was made of. Lockett deserved to have as much information as possible about how the state of Oklahoma planned to kill him. The legalized secrecy in Oklahoma led to a horrific execution that could have been prevented if the Oklahoma Supreme Court had allowed Lockett and his attorneys to review the execution procedure beforehand and look for any indication that it could go wrong. Prisoners on death row deserve to know whether the state is going to kill them within constitutional parameters. Because the ultimate unknown is how much pain they will go through, and that answer remains a secret held only by those who have already been silenced. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Jason Samuel, <a href="https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/">Penn State Dickinson School of Law</a> Class of 2014, explores the constitutional framework surrounding the annexation of Crimea by Russia...</j:header>When the Alma-Ata Declaration was signed on December 21, 1991, 10 nations separated from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Soviet Union) and became independent states. In 2001, a new section in the Federal Constitutional Law of the Russian Federation charted a path for the reclamation and annexation of former soviet territories. This year, the constitutional provisions were utilized, and the first former territory was reunited to the Russian Federation: The Republic of Crimea. </p>

<p>Because of economic turmoil, the EU and Ukraine <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/eu-criticizes-ukraines-oct-28-parliamentary-election-316005.html">agreed</a> to an economic partnership in 2012. However, in November of 2013, the Ukrainian government <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2013/11/ukraine-at-crossroadsafterrejectingeupact.html">canceled</a> their plans to join the economic partnership with the EU. The Russian Federation was strongly opposed to this agreement, and the Ukraine's Pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25162563">refused</a> to join the partnership with the EU arguing that joining the EU would have resulted in a sacrifice of trade with Russia. The decision by Yanukovych to cancel plans to join the EU sparked months of protests by the Ukrainian citizens. This crisis reached a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/08/us-ukraine-crisis-timeline-idUSBREA270PO20140308">breaking point </a>when the Russian Federation provided a financial bailout of Ukraine in effort to keep them from reconsidering joining the EU. Eventually, the protests reached a boiling point and President Yakunovych fled the capital city of Kiev and a provisional government took over. On March 1, the Prime Minister of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (Crimea), Sergey Aksenov, <a href="http://itar-tass.com/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/1013127">appealed</a> to Russian President Vladimir Putin for assistance. This set the stage for arguably the boldest foreign policy move of this new century: annexing the Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>Although the Soviet Union gave Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, the region still maintained strong ties to Russia. After President Yanukovych fled, President Putin sent Russian troops to the Crimean borders in preparation for the eventual invasion of Crimea. The Russians declared that these actions were necessary to protect the rights of the ethnic Russians who made up a substantial part of Crimea. </p>

<p>On March 16, the Crimean regional government announced that it would hold a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/ukraine-crisis-european-leaders-emergency-summit">referendum</a> on whether the region should officially join Russia. International observers were <a href="http://digitaljournal.com/news/politics/op-ed-the-crimea-referendum-and-international-observers/article/377812">not permitted</a> into Crimea to monitor the referendum if they did not recognize the new Crimean government as separate and autonomous from the Ukrainian government. The results of the referendum alleged that 96.7 percent of voters were in favor of Crimea's accession to the Russian Federation. In May it was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/05/06/russian-government-agency-reveals-fraudulent-nature-of-the-crimean-referendum-results/">discovered</a> that actual voter turnout was around 30 percent, and only half of those voters voted for annexation.</p>

<p>Immediately following the Crimean annexation referendum, Russia's Duma moved to formally accept Crimea into the Russian Federation on March 20. They accepted Crimea into the Russian Federation by a <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3135362/posts">vote</a> of 445-1. Then they voted 443-1 in favor of approving the treaty that admitted Crimea to the Russian Federation. In just 20 days, the Russian Federation had annexed Crimean. This swiftness was not an accident. It was the work of careful planning that was realized in 2001 when the procedures for accepting territories into the Russian Federation were spelled out in the Federal Constitutional Law On The Procedure Of Acceptance Into The Russian Federation And Formation Within Its Composition Of A New Subject Of The Russian Federation (Federal Constitutional Law).</p>

<p><a href="http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody&nd=102073629.">The Federal Constitutional Law</a> [in Russian. Note: online English translations of Russian law are often inaccurate and incomplete. The analysis in this piece was based off of William E. Butler's <em>Russian Public Law: The Foundations of a Rule-of-Law State&#8212;Legislation and Documents</em> (Wildy, Simmonds & Hill, 2005)] section was first codified in 2001 and was amended in 2005. In total, the section contains four different chapters and fourteen separate articles. All of the necessary requirements for admitting a new territory into the Russian Federation are spelled out in this section. A brief review of a few articles in this Federal Constitutional Law section will help illuminate the nature of the accession process. </p>

<p>In Chapter 1, Article 4(2), for any state to be accepted into the Russian Federation, there must be mutual consent of Russia and the other state. This article was satisfied by the Treaty Between The Russian Federation And The Republic Crimea On The Admission Of The Republic Crimea To The Russian Federation And The Formation Of New Subjects Within The Russian Federation (Admission Treaty). Article 6(1) of the Federal Constitutional Law requires that the foreign state be the "initiator of a proposal concerning acceptance in the Russian Federation as a new subject of a foreign State or part thereof" in accordance with Article 4(2) of the Federal Constitutional Law. On the same day as the Crimean referendum, the Crimean Parliament <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/crimeas-parliament-votes-to-join-russia/2014/03/17/5c3b96ca-adba-11e3-9627-c65021d6d572_story.html">voted</a> to break with Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. This is how the initiation requirement was satisfied.</p>

<p>While many consider the effort to hold the Crimean Referendum farcical, according to the Federal Constitutional Law, Russia was required to hold a referendum. According to Article 11(1) of the Federal Constitutional Law, "[t]he question concerning the formation of a new subject within the composition of the Russian Federation shall be subject to submission at referendums of interested subjects of the Russian Federation after holding consultations with the President of the Russian Federation." The 2005 Amendments to Article 11 of the Federal Constitutional <a href="http://en.ria.ru/russia/20140319/188570695/Russian-Constitutional-Court-Backs-Crimea-Reunification.html">specify</a> that the "initiative" for holding a referendum belongs to the highest officials of the "interested subjects," who "have the right to take part in agitation" with regard to the question of the referendum. If the referendum fails to pass in Russia's favor the first time, a re-vote that occurs no more than 45 days later will legally suffice as legitimate, in accordance with the amendment.</p>

<p>On March 18, pursuant to Article 6(2), Russian President Vladimir Putin presented the Admission Treaty to the State Duma for <a href="http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/724601">ratification</a>. The only hurdle that remained after ratification was clearance by the Constitutional Court in accordance with Article 7(4) which states, "[a]fter signature of the international treaty the President of the Russian Federation shall apply to the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation with a query concerning verification of the conformity of the particular international treaty to the Constitution of Russian Federation." Unanimously, the Accession Treaty was validated by the Constitutional Court. Chairman of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation Valery Zorkin said, "The Constitutional Court recognized that this treaty complies with the Russian Constitution."</p>

<p>All signs point to the fact that this Crimean Referendum was controlled chaos on the part of the Kremlin and President Putin. Every step of the process was orchestrated in complete synchronization with the Federal Constitutional Law of the Russian Federation. The constitutional provisions used to annex Crimea had been carefully drafted and added to the Russian Federal Constitutional Law with the obvious goal of using them to reclaim former soviet states. All that is needed to reclaim more former territories is the triggering of pro-Russian sentiment among that territories' populace and government leadership. Because Article 11(12) of the Federal Constitutional Law permits foreign State leaders to "agitate" for the pro-Russian cause, it is highly unlikely that these foreign leaders "agitate" without the express "help" of the Kremlin. </p>

<p>The Crimean crisis should send a message to international community. Russia has just taken its constitutional provisions for the reclamation of former soviet states out for a test drive. The result was a smashing success. In what territory will the next Russian reclamation effort be tried? Transnistria?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://bournemouth.academia.edu/SaschaDominikBachmann">Sascha-Dominik Bachmann</a> of Bournemouth University in the United Kingdom argues that while their recent annexation of Crimea and apparent willingness to use military force in Eastern Ukraine, the prospect of a Ukrainian civil war has diminished the need for Russia to engage in an overt and open military intervention&#8212;at least for the time being&#8212;yet it remains to be seen if such will result in an end to the use of military force in the region ... </p>

<p><strong>R</strong></font>ussia's <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/russia-finalizes-annexation-of-crimea.php">annexation</a>&#8212;or reannexation&#8212;of Crimea in April 2014 following weeks of covert and open military operations on the peninsula is&#8212;for all intensive purposes&#8212;a <em>fait accompli</em> and unlikely to be revised anytime soon. Having achieved this first 'victory'&#8212;in the eyes of the Russian public at least&#8212;Russia has focused on the parts of Ukraine where the Russian-speaking minority is the de facto majority&#8212;such as Donetsk, Luhansk and recently cities like Odessa. Whether this practice of 'protective interventionism' advanced by Putin's Russia&#8212;as exemplified by its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=south+ossetia">2008 invasion of Georgia</a>&#8212;will lead to overt military conflict centered around Eastern Ukraine remains to be to be seen. However, the prospect of civil war in Ukraine has removed any immediate Russian necessity for an open military intervention at this stage. </p>

<p>While Ukraine's unelected interim government has <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-urges-peaceful-solution-in-ukraine.php">increased its efforts</a> to quell pro-Russian unrest in its eastern territories, Russia has been able to exploit the situation and basically turn the tables on Kiev by characterizing the growing number of separatist killed as an illustration of the government's disproportionate use of force against Ukrainian citizens of Russian origin and classifying it as a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27268775">'punitive operation'</a>. The de facto break up of the Ukraine has already begun, a stark reminder of the break up of the old Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the ensuing bloody Civil War that resulted in massive <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/breakup-yugoslavia">civilian casualties</a>. Russia seems to be achieving its strategic and economic objectives: the weakening of a pro-Western Ukraine, the isolation of <a href="https://www.rusi.org/downloads/assets/UKRANIANMILITARYDISPOSITIONS_RUSIBRIEFING.pdf">critical armaments industries</a> [PDF] located in the eastern parts of the country&#8212;which possess a potential opportunity of being utilized further if any negotiated division of the country were to take place&#8212;and finally a reassertion of Russian influence along the fault lines of the century old Russian state influence that had become questionable after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.   </p>

<p>The involvement of Russian military personnel in the Crimean intervention and annexation qualifies as a prohibited use or threat of force as defined by Article 2 Section 4 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml">UN Charter</a> and may&#8212;academically speaking&#8212;even amount to a Crime of Aggression per the amended 8 <em>bis</em> provision of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/add16852-aee9-4757-abe7-9cdc7cf02886/283503/romestatuteng1.pdf">International Criminal Court [ICC] Statute</a> [PDF]&#8212;but the 2011 <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/RC-Res.6-ENG.pdf">Kampala Amendments</a> [PDF] do not come into force until after 2017.</p>

<p>An often overlooked possibility is that Moscow's <em>modus operandi</em> with respect to Crimea and the Ukraine is the waging of <a href="http://jcsl.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/2/225.abstract">"New Wars"</a> along asymmetric lines of conflict, which <a href="http://iripaz.org/listado_docs/res_conflictos/Hofmann%20Naturaleza%20evolutiva%20del%20conflicto.pdf">constitute</a> [PDF] "a dichotomous choice between counterinsurgency and conventional war"&#8212;known to military lawyers as 'hybrid threats'. The term 'hybrid threats' refers to multiple dimensions of possible threats to national and global peace and security, and was coined during the 2006 asymmetric conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah in Lebanon. As <a href="http://indianstrategicknowledgeonline.com/web/Hybrid%20threats.pdf">recognized</a> [PDF] by NATO in 2010, hybrid threats are defined as "those posed by adversaries, with the ability to simultaneously employ conventional and non-conventional means adaptively in pursuit of their objectives." NATO has also determined that a "description of hybrid threats within a complex emerging security environment ... should be able to address hybrid threats within the steady state environment and be capable of conducting early threat identification and continuous monitoring/management in addition to crisis management." Yet another <a href="http://www.act.nato.int/nato-countering-the-hybrid-threat">NATO report</a> in 2011 describes these threats in greater detail, saying:<blockquote>"Admittedly, hybrid threat is an umbrella term, encompassing a wide variety of existing adverse circumstances and actions, such as terrorism, migration, piracy, corruption, ethnic conflict etc. What is new, however, is the possibility of NATO facing the adaptive and systematic use of such means singularly and in combination by adversaries in pursuit of long-term political objectives, as opposed to their more random occurrence, driven by coincidental factors."</blockquote>This same report explains that hybrid threats<blockquote>"are not exclusively a tool of asymmetric or non-state actors, but can be applied by state and non-state actors alike. Their principal attraction from the point of view of a state actor is that they can be largely non-attributable, and therefore applied in situations where more overt action is ruled out for any number of reasons."</blockquote>Hunstok&#8212;a Norwegian Army Brigadier General, Co-Chairman of the Deployable Joint Staff Element at NATO ACT and CHT/COIN Director&#8212 explained that NATO was particularly interested in potential hybrid threat actors that cross borders and evade categorization as a defense, security or law enforcement threat. Such threats, he <a href="http://www.cior.net/getattachment/News/2012/Numerous-CIOR-members-participated-in-Security-Jam/2012_Security_Jam_Report_COMPLETE.pdf.aspx">emphasized</a> [PDF] on another occasion, "go beyond conventional weaponry and proliferation and now include clear links between piracy, cyber terrorism, threat finance, trafficking and social networking by non-state actors and terrorists." Others have <a href="http://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=700828">characterized</a> such an actor as "a practitioner of unrestricted operational art that aptly combines regular and irregular capabilities simultaneously into a unified operational force to achieve strategic effects." This follows the hybrid threat <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/adrp3_0.pdf">definition</a> [PDF] of the U.S. Army´s Operation Doctrine 2011, which holds such to be: "the diverse and dynamic combination of regular forces, irregular forces, criminal elements, or a combination of these forces and elements all unified to achieve mutually benefitting effects." The U.S. Department of Defense had already <a href="http://www.defense.gov/qdr/qdr%20as%20of%2029jan10%201600.pdf">discussed</a> [PDF] the military's doctrinal approach in 2010. In June 2012, NATO decided to cease work on CHT&#8212;Countering Hybrid Threats&#8212;at its organizational level but continued to encouraged its member states and associated NATO Excellence Centres to continue working on hybrid threats. Given NATO's inability or reluctance to address the Ukrainian situation with military force as well as such force residing clearly outside of any NATO Non-Article 5 authority, this decision might turn out to have been made prematurely. </p>

		<title>It&#039;s Time to End Public University Speech Zones</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2014/05/david-hacker-speech-zones/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.alliancealert.org/2010/03/01/about-david-hacker/">David Hacker</a> of <a href="http://www.alliancedefendingfreedom.org/">Alliance Defending Freedom</a> discusses free speech zones on public university campuses...</p>

                <p>Free speech zones on public university campuses sound wonderful in the abstract&#8212;a special zone just for free speech! But don't be fooled. College's sell the idea of free speech zones like used car salesmen. They make students think that they want the zones, but in reality, students don't want them and they don't need them. And in the end, students realize they've been duped. </p>

                <p>Several recent news stories highlight the troubling irony of so-called free speech zones on public university campuses: they are used to stifle speech rather than encourage it. In one story, administrators at the University of Hawaii-Hilo stopped two students from handing out free copies of the US Constitution&#8212;the very document that gives us the right to free speech&#8212;because the students were standing outside the university's "free speech zone." According to a <a href="http://d28htnjz2elwuj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Complaint-in-Burch-and-Vizzone-v-University-of-Hawaii-et-al.pdf">complaint</a>  [PDF] filed in federal court in Hawaii, the university's free speech zone is essentially a muddy ravine that occupies less than one percent of the university's campus. This is the only place students may speak on campus without prior approval from administrators. </p>

                <p>In another story, administrators at Modesto Junior College stopped a student from distributing free copies of the Constitution <em>on</em> Constitution Day. The reason? Although he was standing in front of the student center on campus, a likely forum to communicate with his peers, administrators told him that he could not distribute the Constitutions without getting permission five days in advance and even then he could distribute them only in the "free speech area." Like the Hawaii case, the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/USCOURTS-caed-1_13-cv-01630/USCOURTS-caed-1_13-cv-01630-1">complaint</a> alleged that the so-called "free speech area" was a mere 600 square foot stage. The college eliminated the speech zone and <a href="http://d28htnjz2elwuj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Combined-Settlement-in-Van-Tuinent-v.-Yosemite-Community-College.pdf">settled</a>  [PDF] the case in March. </p>

                <p>These cases would be funny, if only they weren't true. Sadly, despite decades of legal precedent declaring university campuses to be the "marketplaces of ideas" in keeping with their historic role, the restrictions public universities place on student speech today would come as a great surprise to James Madison and the Founding Fathers. A basic review of public forum case law reveals the multiple legal problems these policies present. </p>

                <p>Generally speaking, to assess a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> claim arising on government property, the US Supreme Court determined in <a href=" http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/473/788/case.html">Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund</a>  that a court must first "identify the nature of the forum, because the extent to which the Government may limit access depends on whether the forum is public or nonpublic." Streets, sidewalks and parks are traditional public forums, where restrictions on speech are subject to strict scrutiny. Most public university campuses resemble traditional public forums with streets, sidewalks and open-air quads used by students not only to get around campus, but to socialize and debate ideas. As the court said in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/454/263">Widmar v. Vincent</a>, the "campus of a public university, at least for its students, possesses many of the characteristics of a public forum."</p>

                <p>When analyzing public university campuses, many courts have ruled that student free speech rights are at their apex in the common outdoor areas of campus. And yet some universities still persist in attempting to classify the entire campus as non-public or limited public forums with lesser protections. But in <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/ohio/ohsdce/1:2012cv00155/152606/86">University of Cincinnati Chapter of Young Americans for Liberty v. Williams</a>, the US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio commented that it was unaware of any precedent establishing that a "public university may constitutionally designate its entire campus as a limited public forum as applied to students." (In a limited public forum, restrictions on speech need only be reasonable and viewpoint neutral.) This makes sense. As the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit noted in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5872076468369579038&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Hays County Guardian v. Supple</a>, students "live and work on campus, making the campus . . . a 'town' of which the resident student will be a 'contributing citizen.'" Thus, it should be no surprise that the Ninth Circuit recently <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6227660637645612086&q=osu+student+alliance+v.+ra7&hl=en&as_sdt=2003">declared</a>  that Oregon State University's campus was a public forum for students.</p>

                <p>Universities often intertwine speech zone policies limiting the location of student speech with policies that require advanced approval for speech. These prior restraints censor speech before it occurs, so there is a heavy presumption against their constitutionality. As the Supreme Court said in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15663411359492122494&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement</a>, in order to survive constitutional scrutiny, a prior restraint may not delegate overly broad discretion to a government official; it may not be based on the content of the message if it regulates the time, place or manner of speech; it must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest; and it must leave open ample alternative channels for communication. </p>

                <p>Campus speech zones often fail the content-neutrality requirement because the policies implementing these zones grant administrators unbridled discretion. Thus, administrators allow popular student groups to speak outside the designated zones, but deny the same accommodations to less popular speech, like prolife or Christian students. That is exactly what happened in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8848872593454933327&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Pro-Life Cougars v. University of Houston</a>, where university policy allowed administrators to restrict speech to certain areas of campus if it was "potentially disruptive." The Supreme Court warned of these dangers in <span class="casename">Forsyth County</span>. It said that policies which vest government officials with unbridled discretion to regulate speech will violate the content-neutrality requirement by allowing for veiled discrimination against some speakers. </p>

                <p>Universities claim that free speech zones protect student safety, preserve campus aesthetics and prevent disruption of the educational environment. But restricting student speech to one area of campus is not narrowly tailored to any of these interests. Placing all student speech in a small zone on campus actually causes more danger to student safety by requiring competing student groups to voice their ideas in close proximity. Everyone likes a beautiful college campus, but campus aesthetics can be preserved by prohibiting litter, not speech. And preventing substantial disruption of the educational environment can be accomplished by prohibiting bullhorns and loud events near classroom buildings, regardless of where the speech occurs on campus. </p>

                <p>Of course, free speech zones close off all alternative channels of communication in the outdoor areas of campus. Alternatives are not ample if the speaker is unable to reach his intended audience. So if students want to set up a "<a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/files/YALUGlawsuit.pdf">debt clock</a> " [PDF] near the economics department, but the speech zone is located in a different part of campus, the policy fails constitutional review because it does not allow the students to reach their audience. </p>

                <p>Students have been incredibly successful in challenging speech zone policies in court. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7980994215577858262&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Roberts v. Haragan</a>, Texas Tech University limited speech to a gazebo on campus. A student who wanted to distribute religious literature elsewhere on campus sued and the Northern District of Texas struck down the policy because its regulation of even simple conversation between classmates was not narrowly tailored to the university's interest in preserving the educational environment.  </p>

                <p>In <span class="casename">Williams</span>, the university restricted all "demonstrations, picketing and rallies" to a free speech area which constituted less than 0.1% of the campus. The Southern District of Ohio enjoined the policy because it determined that the outdoor areas of the university's campus were designated public forums for students to speak freely and the policy was not narrowly tailored to the university's interest in maintaining a peaceful and safe campus. </p>

                <p>Similarly, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15746465527580994007&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Burbridge v. Sampson</a>, the South Orange Community College District restricted student gatherings of twenty or more people to three "preferred" areas. The Central District of California enjoined the policy because the college failed to articulate any interest in limiting the location of speech and the designation of three preferred areas only did not leave open ample alternative channels of communication.</p>

                <p>Despite courts uniformly striking down university speech zone policies, they persist from coast to coast. "Free speech zones" might sound great at first glance, but they put the First Amendment rights of students in a box and in some cases, a <a href="http://blog.speakupmovement.org/university/freedom-of-speech/do-you-ever-complain-about-your-colleges-speech-zone/">ridiculously small box</a>. When free speech zones prevent students from distributing the US Constitution, we know it is time to put the zones in a box&#8212;six feet under&#8212;and let students participate freely in the "marketplace of ideas."  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.gsu.edu/directory/lslucas">Lauren Sudeall Lucas</a> of Georgia State University College of Law discusses the constitutionality of the opposing arguments surrounding the death penalty ... </p><strong>S</strong></font>ociety's memory is short. So, it may be few are still lingering over the particulars of the botched execution that occurred in Oklahoma last month.</p>

<p>Although not as macabre as the <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/state/eyewitness-account-a-minute-by-minute-look-at-what-happened/article_f7764efc-d036-11e3-af7e-0017a43b2370.html?mode=story-0017a43b2370.html?mode=story">details</a> of Clayton Lockett's failed execution and ensuing death by heart attack, the jarring procedural history of his case's last days was also troubling. It presented a stark contrast between two opposing sides&#8212;one grinding the machinery of death to a halt and the other clearing the way for its operation&#8212;with each side deeming its actions to be constitutionally compelled.</p>

<p>The last chapter of the story began early this year when Lockett's defense attorney filed a civil action challenging <a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=70842">Oklahoma's state secrecy law</a>. This law, similar to others <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lauren-sudeall-lucas/of-secrecy-and-punishment_b_4966960.html">passed</a> recently by states like Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/04/clayton_lockett_s_botched_execution_the_grim_but_predictable_result_of_oklahoma.html">allowed</a> the state to keep its execution protocols secret. In the course of briefing whether a stay of execution should issue (so that the civil action could proceed), it was <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/03/19/execution.pdf">revealed</a> [PDF] that the state lacked the drugs needed to carry out the lethal injection protocol. As a result, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/oklahoma-court-delays-executions-due-to-lethal-injection-drug-shortage.php#.U2EP1VfeNdx">stayed</a> both Lockett's execution and the execution of Charles Warner, scheduled just a week later. In its order, the court <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/03/19/execution.pdf">instructed</a> [PDF] the state to either procure the necessary drug or adopt a new execution protocol.  </p>

<p>The state opted to implement a new protocol that substituted another drug, Midazolam, for the <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2014/05/16/states-go-great-lengths-find-lethal-injection-drugs-249154.html">elusive</a> sodium thiopental. The combination of drugs included in the new protocol had been used only once before, in Florida. Notably, however, Florida's protocol had required five times as much Midazolam. Midazolam serves to sedate the inmate before the second drug, which acts as a paralytic, and the third drug, which stops the inmate's heart, are administered. The lower dosage of Midazolam in the Oklahoma protocol likely <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/oklahoma-high-court-stays-executions-over-lethal-injection-drug-challenge.php">increased</a> the possibility that Lockett would not remain unconscious throughout the execution. The grimaces, grunts and other movements witnessed by those at Lockett's execution before the curtains were closed, even after a doctor had stated that Lockett was unconscious, confirms that Oklahoma's novel combination did not work properly.</p>

<p>In late March an Oklahoma district court judge found the state secrecy statute unconstitutional. The ensuing litigation created a complicated jurisdictional battle between the Court of Criminal Appeals, which typically has jurisdiction over criminal appeals, and the state Supreme Court, which retains final jurisdiction over civil matters. The Court of Criminal Appeals refused to grant a stay of execution, which would have prevented the state Supreme Court from hearing the case. In an unprecedented move, on April 21, the Oklahoma Supreme Court declared its jurisdictional authority to hear the case and <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.newsok.com/documents/stayissued.pdf">voted</a> [PDF] to grant an indefinite stay of Lockett's execution. </p>

<p>When the judicial powers failed to ensure Lockett's timely execution, the legislative and executive branches stepped into the breach. In an executive order issued on April 22, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin proclaimed that the state supreme court had overstepped its constitutional authority and <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.newsok.com/documents/fallinexecorder.pdf">overrode</a> [PDF] the court's decision, reinstating Lockett's execution for April 29. Oklahoma state representative Mike Christian <a href="http://www.okcfox.com/story/25396158/state-representative-mike-christian-releases-statement-about">followed</a> on Governor Fallin's Heels, denouncing the state Supreme Court's ruling as a separation of powers violation and calling for the impeachment of the five state Supreme Court justices who had voted for the stay. The next day, in the face of severe political backlash, the state Supreme Court <a href="http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/1e/11eea394-cb49-11e3-bcc8-001a4bcf6878/53585e277bb8a.pdf.pdf">reversed</a> [PDF] its earlier decision and dissolved the stay, allowing the execution to proceed. </p>

<p>This is not the only instance in which other branches of government have attempted to test the judiciary's will to guarantee access to the courts by proceeding at full steam. Take, for example, Virginia's insistence on scheduling execution dates before the capital defendant's appeals process has run its full course. This has <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-11622.pdf">prompted</a> [PDF] repeated <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/97-8214.ZPC.html">statements</a> by several US Supreme Court Justices that the states are effectively "<a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/09-7328.pdf">truncat</a>[ing the Court's] deliberate process on a matter&#8212;involving a death row inmate&#8212;that demands the most careful attention."</p>

<p>In a slightly different vein, witness the debate surrounding the constitutionality of the <a href="https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=439652">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> (AEDPA), the federal habeas law that encourages deference to state court judgments and, in doing so, has narrowed the ability of federal courts to grant habeas relief. Although unsuccessful, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/crater-v-galaza-4#.U4UrzyhLrdl">several</a> <a href="http://appellate.typepad.com/appellate/2008/04/ca1-rehearing-d.html">judges</a> have <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/05a0462a-06.pdf">suggested</a> [PDF] that the AEDPA is unconstitutional because it violates separation of powers doctrine and infringes on the federal courts' ability to give effect to their independent judgment that a constitutional violation has occurred.</p>

<p>The decision of whether to impose death as a penalty for committing a crime is wholly within the purview of the people, as expressed through the legislature. But our system of government depends on a system of checks and balances, and we have invested our faith in the courts to ensure that such a grave penalty is not carried out in the midst of constitutional violations.</p>

<p>Yet some courts are also willing to allow the need for timely executions to trump the competing need to ensure that executions are carried out in a constitutional matter. Just this past week, the Georgia Supreme Court <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/19/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-anonymity-execution-pharmacists">upheld</a> the constitutionality of Georgia's state secrecy law, which conceals the identity of those supplying the drugs for lethal injection. Justice Harris Hines <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/court-upholds-lethal-injection-secrecy-law/nfzDb/">wrote</a> for the majority, "(W)ithout the confidentiality offered to execution participants by the statute ... there is a significant risk that persons and entities necessary to the execution would become unwilling to participate." In other words, the risk that the execution might not proceed, given a lack of willing participants, trumps the inmate's ability to ensure that the means by which he will be executed are constitutional.</p>

<p>Some judges, like Justice Scalia, read the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment's</a> prohibition on cruel and unusual <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/lawreview/v102/n4/1739/lr102n4stinneford.pdf">punishment</a> [PDF] to forbid only inherently cruel types of punishment, not aspects of its imposition. Concurring in the opinion dissolving the stay, Justice Steven Taylor of the Oklahoma Supreme Court <a href="http://m.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/oklahoma-supreme-court-dissolves-execution-stay/article_342a02f6-cb48-11e3-a1ea-001a4bcf6878.html?mode=jqm">wrote</a> of Lockett and Warner: "If they were being hanged, they would have no right to know whether it be by cotton or nylon rope; or if they were being executed by firing squad, they would have no right to know whether it be by Winchester or Remington ammunition." Yet the opinions of Scalia and Taylor remain the minority view. The Supreme Court acknowledged in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/07-5439P.ZO">Baze v. Rees </a>[PDF] that a lethal injection protocol might violate the Eighth Amendment's guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment if it presents a "substantial risk of serious harm." The Eighth Amendment clearly <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1090&context=lawreview">prohibits</a> torture and, in the case of lethal injection, it may be impossible to know whether the protocol will amount to torture unless its elements are revealed.</p>

<p>Ultimately, judicial and executive officials in Lockett's case staked out two positions on opposite extremes. On one end was a state supreme court that, in the face of the Court of Criminal Appeals' refusal to address the merits of the stay, assumed authority over the matter to ensure that Lockett would have his claim heard before it was too late. Those justices voting for the stay believed that to do otherwise would <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.newsok.com/documents/stayissued.pdf">violate</a> [PDF] their oaths of office and deny Lockett his constitutionally guaranteed right of access to the courts. On the other end of the spectrum were strong political forces demanding that Lockett's execution be carried out, regardless of the outstanding legal issues that remained. In issuing her executive order, Governor Fallin <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.newsok.com/documents/fallinexecorder.pdf">stated</a> that to give effect to the state supreme court's order would violate her oath to uphold the Constitution. </p>

<p>It cannot be that the same document compels two such differing ends, and it should not be that in the face of contradictory commands, the desire for death trumps all. Should such a conflict arise, it is surely within the judiciary's province to determine what the law is. Yet, in the context of determining when and how those who are condemned to death will be executed, the judiciary seems to be losing ground. Clayton Lockett was the clearest victim of this violent constitutional showdown, but our faith in the courts' ability to serve as guardians of the law also suffered a serious blow.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.au.org/about/people/ayesha-n-khan">Ayesha Khan</a> of <a href="https://www.au.org">Americans United for Separation of Church and State</a> discusses the contraceptive coverage requirement of the Affordable Care Act and the current cases challenging the requirement ...</p>

                <p>On April 24, JURIST ran a <a href="/hotline/2014/04/joseph-larue-birth-control-mandate.php">column</a> by Joseph LaRue of the Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents a company that seeks an exemption from an Affordable Care Act regulation that requires health insurance plans to include coverage for a wide range of preventive services, including contraceptives. Mr. LaRue likened the regulatory requirement to a law that would obligate a PETA-supporting company to provide employees with a weekly allowance of meat and chicken. What he omitted is that, to be analogous, the law would have to allow employers to opt out of providing the weekly allowance at all and instead, to pay a tax that is far lower than the allowance itself. Meanwhile, the tax would allow the federal government to subsidize employees' purchasing their own wild salmon and organic meats. Mr. LaRue's half-baked analogy obfuscated rather than "explained" the relevant legal issues.</p>

                <p>As the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12155156101390519754">put it</a>, the ACA "leaves large employers with a choice for complying with the law&#8212;provide adequate, affordable health coverage to employees or pay a tax" of $2,000 per employee (beyond the first 30 employees). Because the tax is actually far lower than the typical cost of providing insurance in the first place, choosing to pay the tax actually would yield substantial savings to employers. And nothing would preclude employers who are concerned about putting themselves at a competitive disadvantage from passing the savings on to employees in the form of healthcare stipends or increased salaries.</p>

                <p>The availability of this option was of considerable interest to the US Supreme Court Justices during the oral argument in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sebelius-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/">Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/conestoga-wood-specialties-corp-v-sebelius/">Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius</a>. That makes sense because the companies' legal challenge is brought under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000bb-1">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a>, which provides relief against "<a href="https://www.casetext.com/case/korte-v-sebelius">substantial burdens</a>" on religious exercise, which arise only when a litigant is forced to violate his or her religion. When the challenged regulations offer a viable option that does not create a religious conflict, a claim must fail. Yet, in briefing the case, the attorneys for the companies all but ignored the availability of this option, an oversight that Mr. LaRue repeated in his column. The US didn't do much with it either because the administration does not want to highlight that employers retain the prerogative to discontinue their plans. Luckily, Americans United for Separation of Church and State&#8212;where I serve as Legal Director&#8212;stepped in to fill the void, submitting an amicus brief that developed this argument at length.</p>

                <p>Americans United has also stepped in to represent three students at the University of Notre Dame, which has brought its own <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9288859216278216116">challenge</a> to the ACA regulations, marking the first time that affected women have been litigants in any of the challenges to the ACA's contraceptive-coverage provisions. Notre Dame's case has even less merit than the one pending before the Supreme Court. The University has the same options as for-profit employers but it, like all other nonprofit organizations, has yet a third option known as the "accommodation": it can continue to provide health insurance while obtaining an exemption from the contraceptive-coverage requirement by alerting its insurer (or, insofar as it self-insures, its "third party administrator"), which then provides the coverage on its own, directly to the students and employees, without imposing any costs on the University.</p>

                <p>Many religiously affiliated nonprofits, including Catholic organizations like Georgetown University, welcomed this accommodation. The University of Notre Dame did, too&#8212;at least at first. In the fall of 2013, the University <a href="http://hr.nd.edu/assets/80205/2014_decision_guide_final.pdf">informed</a> [PDF] its faculty that it would be taking advantage of the accommodation. After an alumni group <a href="http://sycamoretrust.org/media/images/bulletins/131120/jenkinsHHS131026.pdf">pressed</a>  [PDF] the University to litigate, however, the University made an abrupt about-face, filing a federal court challenge in December 2013, almost a year after the accommodation was proposed, five months after it was finalized and mere weeks before it was slated to go into effect. With only weeks to spare, the University argued that the regulations presented a grave emergency and that pursuing the accommodation would violate religious dictates of the highest order.</p>

                <p>Like the attorneys for the for-profit companies, the University's counsel simply ignored the University's ability to pay a tax instead of maintaining its insurance plan for employees; and its counsel likewise ignored that the University could discontinue its student plan while paying no tax at all, because nothing in the ACA or its regulations requires universities to furnish students with health insurance. Rather, the University focused its arguments on the accommodation, to which it objected on the grounds that the opt-out form would "trigger" the provision of objectionable coverage.</p>

                <p>On February 21, 2014, the Seventh Circuit rightfully <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9288859216278216116">rejected</a> that argument, reasoning as follows:<blockquote>What makes this case and others like it involving the contraception exemption paradoxical and virtually unprecedented is that the beneficiaries of the religious exemption are claiming that the exemption process itself imposes a substantial burden on their religious faiths; the process of claiming one's exemption from the duty to provide contraceptive coverage is the opposite of cumbersome. It amounts to signing one's name and mailing the signed form to two addresses.</blockquote></p>

                <p>Indeed, under the University's view, a judge who recuses himself from a death-penalty case could claim that he has a RFRA right to refuse to recuse in writing because that would facilitate the assignment of a new judge to hear the case. A wartime conscientious objector could claim an exemption from appearing at the draft office to put his objection in writing because that would pave the way for someone else to be assigned in his place. But those claims&#8212;like the University's&#8212;should fail because the authorization for a new judge's assignment, for another soldier to be drafted and for contraceptives to be covered, arises from the government's judgment that it should be so, not from the conscientious objector's submission of the form.</p>

                <p>But even if the University was forced to retain its health-insurance plans and even if the opt-out form itself burdened religious exercise, the University's claim should still fail because the challenged regulations withstand strict scrutiny. The US has a much <a href="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2011/Clinical-Preventive-Services-for-Women-Closing-the-Gaps/Report-Brief.aspx">higher rate</a> of unintended pregnancy than other developed nations&#8212;accounting for nearly half of all pregnancies in the nation. When faced with an unintended pregnancy, 42 percent of women choose to have an abortion. Making contraceptives more accessible, and available free of charge, will have a dramatic impact on these statistics. Myriad social-science <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2220022">studies</a> demonstrate that even exceedingly low barriers&#8212;whether financial or logistical&#8212;can deter people from accessing benefits and services. One <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1508904/pdf/amjph00004-0101.pdf">study</a> [PDF] showed that when condom prices rise from 0 to a mere 25 cents, sales decline by a whopping 98 percent. The <a href="http://www.ansirh.org/_documents/library/foster-green_obstet-gyn2-2011.pdf">same result holds</a> [PDF] when the barrier is logistical rather than financial. Dispensing contraceptives for 3 months, rather than an entire year, at one time, results in a 30 percent greater chance of unintended pregnancy and a 46 percent greater chance of obtaining an abortion. </p>

                <p>The results are greatest when both financial and logistical barriers are removed. Making the most convenient forms of contraception&#8212;those requiring the least effort to maintain&#8212;available at no cost to young women <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/10/05/free-contraceptives-reduce-abortions-unintended-pregnancies-full-stop/">resulted</a>  in a staggering 80 percent drop in the rate of unintended pregnancy, leading researchers to predict that the ACA's contraceptive coverage regulations could "prevent as many as 41-71 percent of abortions performed annually in the US." The regulations heed this social-science data by providing women with access to cost-free contraceptives through pre-existing healthcare providers, while allowing objecting employers to opt out of providing the coverage themselves.</p>

                <p>The purposes behind the regulations highlight yet another reason that the University's claim should fail. As Justice Kagan <a href=" http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-354_5436.pdf">observed</a>  [PDF] during the <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> and <span class="casename">Conestoga Wood</span> oral argument, the Establishment Clause precludes the award of religious exemptions that <a href="https://casetext.com/case/cutter-v-wilkinson-3"> override other significant interests</a> or <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/472/703">impose burdens</a>  on third parties. Yet, the University seeks to use its religion as a trump card to override the interests of literally thousands of women in receiving a benefit that provides a lifeline to greater security in their bodies and futures&#8212;<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=505&invol=833">personal autonomy interests</a>  that lie "[a]t the heart of liberty." Well-established legal norms require the courts to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-878.ZS.html">interpret statutes</a> to avoid such constitutional improprieties.</p>

                <p>The government bent over backwards to accommodate religious concerns when it promulgated regulations under the ACA. It chose to provide an opt-out from the contraceptive-coverage requirement&#8212;a benefit that it did not provide for a multitude of other medical procedures that various religious groups oppose, including mental-health care and vaccinations. Objectors would be well advised to heed the advice of St. Jerome in his introductory remarks to the Epistle to the Ephesians: "<em>qui donati dentes non inspiciuntur</em>." In other words, don't look a gift horse in the mouth; you'll most certainly appear ungrateful and you might even get bit.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.stroock.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=49&itemID=125">Bruce Schneider</a> of <a href="https://www.stroock.com/index.cfm">Stroock &#38; Stroock &#38; Lavan LLP.</a> discusses the First Amendment and the "extended use" of public schools ...</p>

                <p>The Framers saw the two religious freedoms secured by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> as being in harmony: the prohibition against a government-established church was what enabled religious minorities to freely exercise their religious beliefs. The 20 year litigation arising from the denial by the Board of Education of the City of New York of an application by Bronx Household of Faith for the "extended use" of a public school auditorium for the conduct of Christian "worship services" each Sunday has pitted those religious protections against each other. On April 3, 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in a 2-1 <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Bronx_Household_of_Faith_v_Bd_of_Education_of_New_York_650_F3d_30">decision</a>, reversed the US District Court for the Southern District of New York's granting of summary judgment and a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the Board of Education's policy against the use of school facilities outside of school hours for the purpose of holding religious worship services.</p>

                <p>The Board of Education promulgated regulations governing the "extended use" of school facilities by outside organizations outside of school hours. "Extended use," which requires a permit from the Board of Education, grants the organization use of the facilities rent-free, requiring only the payment of maintenance fees. The Board regulation provides: "No permit shall be granted for the purpose of holding religious worship services or otherwise using a school as a house of worship." Bronx Household of Faith (the "Church") applied for a permit and in its application used the term "Christian worship services" to describe its intended activity. The Board rejected the Church's application but, for the twenty years of this litigation, the Board was virtually continuously enjoined from enforcing its regulations.</p>

                <p>In those intervening years, the Church had become financially dependent on the government-subsidized public school space for its weekly worship services and claimed that it could not afford to pay prevailing rents for a space large enough to accommodate its entire congregation. </p>

                <p>Through those years, there also developed a movement by certain religious groups to "plant" churches in public schools for long-term use. In the school year 2010-11, 99 permit applicants sought to hold worship services in city schools and approximately 80 of them were holding services in a city school on a regular basis. The City of New York found that, since 2005 when it last tabulated applications, there had been a 348 percent increase in the number of applications by organizations to hold religious services in the public schools on a regular basis.</p>

                <p>Initially, the Church challenged the Board regulation as a denial of Free Speech, but that proved unsuccessful and its argument came to rest on the Free Exercise of Religion. In the District Court's view, because Bronx Household and its congregants have a constitutional right to worship without government interference and could not afford market rents for a sufficiently large site, the Free Exercise Clause obligated the Board to provide them with a subsidized facility in which to exercise that right. Circuit Judge Pierre Leval, writing for the Second Circuit majority, held that the Free Exercise Clause did not require the government to finance the Church and its congregants' exercise of that right. While the government could not place obstacles in the path of the exercise of First Amendment rights, it was not required to remove obstacles not of its own making.</p>

                <p>The District Court believed that the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/508/520">Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah</a> mandated that a city's denial of the use of school premises for worship be assessed under a strict scrutiny test. The District Court reasoned that, because the conduct of religious services has no secular analog, the Board's decision was necessarily a suspect discrimination against religion to be assessed under strict scrutiny. </p>

                <p>The majority disagreed, holding that <span class="casename">Lukumi</span> subjected to strict scrutiny only a city's <em>selective</em> imposition of burdens on the conduct motivated by religious belief. The majority observed that, in <span class="casename">Lukumi</span>, the very motive of the City of Hialeah's ordinances was to suppress the worship of the Santeria religion. The majority found it crucially important that here, the Board's sole reason for excluding worship services was its concern that it would violate the Establishment Clause by appearing to endorse religion. The Board's policies permitted use of the schools by religious groups for other purposes, just not for religious worship. The majority did not consider the prohibition against all worship services as discriminating against religion because rules and policies that were designed to keep a governmental entity in compliance with its obligations under the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses must inherently focus on religion: if the activity were not of a religious nature, the Religion Clauses would have no application.</p>

                <p>The majority found that the Board's action was more analogous to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1315.ZS.html">Locke v. Davey</a>. There, the Supreme Court did not apply strict scrutiny and upheld a Washington statute that excluded theology students from eligibility for a scholarship program for gifted post-secondary students. The Supreme Court distinguished <span class="casename">Lukumi</span> because Washington did not prohibit or restrict the performance of a religious ritual; it merely chose not to fund a particular category of instruction. As the majority read <span class="casename">Locke</span>, strict scrutiny was not required because Washington had enacted that limitation on funding in the interest of historic Establishment Clause concerns. The majority concluded that, likewise here, "the Board's interest in respecting the principle of the Establishment Clause that disfavors public funding of religion is substantial and the burden, if it can properly be called a burden, that falls on Bronx Household in needing to find a location that is not subsidized by the city for the conduct of its religious worship services, is minor from a constitutional point of view."</p>

                <p>The District Court held that the Board's denial of the application would be justified only if conducting worship services on school premises during off-hours would <em>in fact</em> violate the Establishment Clause. The majority, however, did not find it necessary to determine whether the rent-free use of the public school would, in fact, be a violation of the Establishment Clause, although a substantial argument could be made that the quasi-permanent rent-free use of the school facility for worship services was an endorsement of religion. The majority found it sufficient that the Board had a reasonable, good faith concern that making its school facilities available for the conduct of services would give rise to a "substantial risk" of violating the Establishment Clause. They observed that, in having to choose between granting or denying the application, the District Court's rule placed the Board on the horns of a dilemma&#8212;if it granted the application for religious worship to permit "free exercise" of religion and it was later determined to be an endorsement of religion, it would be in violation of the Establishment Clause. The converse would also be true: if it denied the application to avoid violation of the establishment clause, it could later be held to have interfered with the free exercise of religion.</p>

                <p>The majority also rejected the District Court's conclusion that the policy that authorized the Board to look beyond the four corners of the application placed it in the position of determining what constituted a "worship service" and thereby entangled it in religion. The majority found that the Board did not make its own determination but, instead, relied on the user's application. The application required a description of the activities intended to be conducted, required the applicant's certification that the information provided was complete and accurate and did not include any of the uses prohibited by the Board's regulation. The Board was not required to make its own judgment of what conduct constituted religious worship.</p>

                <p>In dissent, Circuit Judge Walker viewed the regulation differently. Returning to a Free Speech analysis, he saw the public school as a limited public forum and that the Board's regulation discriminated against a religious viewpoint, which was impermissible under the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-2036.ZS.html">Good News Club v. Milford Central School</a>. His dissent did not view the rent-free use of the school as a subsidy because the Board charges the same rate to all organizations using its facilities. Accordingly, to be constitutional, Walker argued, the regulation had to withstand strict scrutiny. He rejected the majority's "reasonable, good faith judgment" test because, in his view, Supreme Court precedent foreclosed the possibility that an Establishment Clause violation would result if religious worship services were allowed in school facilities under these circumstances. Walker found this argument bolstered by a survey of the fifty largest school districts in the country, which found New York City to be the only one to entirely exclude worship services. To Walker, it was "striking that none of these other school districts appear to have the slightest concern about violating the Establishment Clause, nor have any of their community use policies been found to violate the Clause."</p>

                <p>The majority's holding, that a reasonable, good faith concern about a violation of the Establishment Clause justified the Board's restriction, strikes a proper balance between the two Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, particularly in the context of children in a public school. Today, the public schools of cities like New York serve a population that is growing ever more diverse. These schools must be sensitive to the fact that many children belong to minority religions or are raised in non-religious environments. The concern that there not be a message of endorsement of a particular religion is greater than ever before for an educational system like New York City's, where so many students are immigrants from different lands and different political systems and cultures, some of which have established religions and some of which do not respect freedom of conscience. An educational system's reasonable, good faith concern not to convey messages to children and their parents of sectarian endorsement and that non-adherents are outsiders, is sound justification for limiting the use of school facilities for worship purposes.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.okcu.edu/?page_id=2649">Andrew Spiropoulos</a> of the Oklahoma City University School of Law discusses the tactical strategies of all parties involved in the Oklahoma Courts' death penalty decisions ... </p><strong>O</strong></font>n April 28, Oklahoma's execution by lethal injection of convicted murderer Clayton Lockett <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/oklahoma-death-row-inmate-dies-after-botched-adminstering-of-lethal-injection.php">went</a> awry. According to witnesses, 13 minutes after being injected with the drug cocktail, the inmate appeared to regain consciousness and experience pain. Lockett died of a heart attack 27 minutes after state officials called off the execution.</p>

<p>No one doubts that the execution was botched. Pending the findings of an investigation of the causes of the mishandled execution, the Court of Criminal Appeals<a href="/paperchase/2014/05/oklahoma-court-delays-executions-until-investigation.php"> has ordered</a> a six-month delay of any further executions. In the meantime, lawyers are asking whether the case was a botched litigation as well. Did the courts or the parties' attorneys commit any errors that contributed to this fiasco?</p>

<p>The byzantine nature of most capital appeals was compounded in this case by Oklahoma's criminal appellate system. Oklahoma is one of two states with separate high courts for civil and criminal cases. The Oklahoma Supreme Court has jurisdiction over civil matters, while the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals presides over criminal cases. The litigation strategy chosen by the attorneys for both Lockett and the next murderer scheduled to be executed, Charles Warner, was designed to exploit the fault lines in the bifurcated system. The defense attorneys, for a time, succeeded in playing one court off another, but their tactical victories are unlikely to affect the ultimate result. It is possible, in fact, that their strategic choices made it less likely that the Oklahoma courts would look closely at the method of execution, raising questions about the ethics and efficacy of their approach.</p>

<p>This round of litigation began in January of this year when the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals set execution dates for both prisoners, March 20 for Lockett and March 27 for Warner. Both inmates decided the best strategy for fighting execution was to file collateral legal challenges to the method of execution.  </p>

<p>Their target was <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/OK_Statutes/CompleteTitles/os22.rtf">22 O.S. &#167;1015(B)</a> [RTF], which provides that "The identity of all persons who participate in or administer the execution process and persons who supply the drugs, medical supplies or medical equipment for the execution shall be confidential and shall not be subject to discovery in any civil or criminal proceedings." Bypassing the Court of Criminal Appeals, on February 22, the defendants filed a civil action contending that the confidentiality statute violated their constitutional rights.  </p>

<p>The theory of their case is rooted in the increasingly successful effort of opponents of capital punishment to discourage the manufacture and sale of the drugs used to carry out lethal injections. In fact, in this case, the state of Oklahoma was forced, because of the shortage of the drugs previously used to carry out executions, to delay the executions until a new drug protocol could be developed. The need for this new protocol provided the foundation for the defendants' constitutional challenge. Relying primarily upon the state constitution's access to courts provision, the defendants argued that in order to challenge the new drug protocol, the identity of the manufacturer of the drugs must be disclosed. The state responded that the statute was clearly constitutional. The defendants only needed to know which drugs would be used; the identity of the manufacturer was irrelevant to any plausible legal challenge.</p>

<p>It soon became evident that, for the Oklahoma courts, the most pressing issue was jurisdictional&#8212;could the civil courts consider this constitutional challenge or was it so intertwined with the criminal case that only the Court of Criminal Appeals possessed the jurisdiction to resolve the issue? After the district court rejected Lockett's and Warner's initial motions for a stay of the execution pending resolution of their civil claim, on March 13, the Supreme Court, in considering the inmates' appeal of the district court's action, ruled that the district court possessed the authority to grant a declaratory judgment on the civil claim but did not have the power to stay the execution. The Supreme Court, then, transferred the petition for the stay to the Court of Criminal Appeals, in the belief that this court had the power to stay the execution, thus allowing the constitutional claims to be adjudicated.</p>

<p>After the Court of Criminal Appeals, due to the problems obtaining the necessary drugs, delayed the executions to April 22 and 29, the district court, on March 26, held the confidentiality statute unconstitutional and ordered the state to disclose the identity of those participating in the execution, particularly the supplier of the drugs. The court, however, did not issue an order to stay the impending executions, forcing the inmates to renew their plea to the Court of Criminal Appeals to delay the executions.</p>

<p>On April 9, the Court of Criminal Appeals rejected the motion to stay the executions. The court held that <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/OK_Statutes/CompleteTitles/os22.rtf">22 O.S. &#167;1001.1(C)</a> [RTF] authorized it to issue a stay only when an action challenging the conviction or the sentence of death is pending in that court and "there exists a significant possibility of reversal of the defendant's conviction, or vacation of the defendant's sentence, and that irreparable harm will result if no stay is issued." The court held that, as the inmates had not filed any action with the court for post-conviction relief, that no action was pending before the court, precluding it from staying the executions.</p>

<p>The inmates then, in the course of the Supreme Court's consideration of both parties' appeal of the district court's order regarding the civil claims, made an emergency motion to the Supreme Court to delay the executions. On April 17, the Supreme Court, wishing to avoid a jurisdictional conflict with the Court of Criminal Appeals, but also desiring that the inmates not be executed before their civil claims could be decided, held that it would maintain jurisdiction over the civil claims, but that the Court of Criminal Appeals was the proper court to issue a stay of execution. The Supreme Court, concluding that its sister court could properly exercise jurisdiction over the motion to stay, transferred the motion to the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>

<p>Here, at last, the central legal issue was joined. The Court of Criminal Appeals had concluded that &#167;1001(C) absolutely enjoined it from issuing a stay of execution. The Supreme Court disagreed, arguing that when read in conjunction with the other sections of &#167;1001, particularly (D), (E) and (F), &#167;1001(C) did not prevent the Court of Criminal Appeals from issuing a stay. The court made it clear that they believed that the Court of Criminal Appeals should reverse course and consider the motion for the stay.</p>

<p>The Court of Criminal Appeals would having nothing of this, ruling the next day, April 18, that, as no action for post-conviction relief had been filed, it had no authority to issue a stay. On April 21, however, on the eve of Lockett's execution, the Supreme Court ordered that the execution be stayed.</p>

<p>A firestorm of criticism, both from dissenters within the court and without, descended upon the court's majority. The court was accused of trampling upon the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeals, thus jeopardizing the comity the two courts had fostered for decades. This jurisdictional conflict seemed particularly unfortunate when, just two days later, on April 23, the Supreme Court rejected the inmates' underlying constitutional claims and lifted the stay of execution, leading to the fateful events of the next week.</p>

<p>While it is easy to sympathize with the Supreme Court's desire to provide these inmates their day in court, it is even easier to see that the Court of Criminal Appeals was right that it did not have the authority to stay the executions. The provisions of &#167;1001 cited by the Supreme Court do not establish that the Court of Criminal Appeals has general authority to stay executions. They only empower the court to set a new execution date if another state or federal court exercises its own authority to stay an execution.</p>

<p>The judges on the Court of Criminal Appeals, as well as the dissenters on the Supreme Court, were also right that the Supreme Court should not have entered into this fray. What contributed to the legal and practical confusion was the refusal of the inmates' attorneys to file an action for post-conviction relief with the Court of Criminal Appeals.  Filing such an action would have empowered that court to consider both any substantive challenges to the method of execution and motions to stay the executions.</p>

<p>Why did the inmates fail to file such an action? One suspects that they knew their odds of prevailing before the Court of Criminal Appeals were slim and that they would have better luck if they could somehow persuade the Supreme Court to involve itself in the case. This judge-shopping worked in the short term, but ultimately, it might have been better to bring the case to a court that could have looked more closely into the method of execution. While it is most likely that nothing would have occurred differently, at least the right judges would have been empowered to ask some of the right questions.</p>

		<title>The Human Rights Implications of &quot;Killer Robots&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/bonnie-docherty">Bonnie Docherty</a> of <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> discusses fully autonomous weapons and their human rights implications...</p>

                <p>Fully autonomous weapons, which could select and fire on targets without meaningful human intervention, have the potential to revolutionize the nature of warfare, bringing greater speed and reach to military operations. In the process, though, this emerging technology could endanger both civilians and soldiers. </p>

                <p>Nations have been considering the multiple challenges these weapons would pose to the laws of war, also called international humanitarian law. But little attention has been given to the implications for human rights law. If these weapons were developed and used for policing, for example, they would threaten the most basic of these rights, including the right to life, the right to a remedy and the principle of human dignity.</p>

                <p>Fully autonomous weapons, also known as autonomous weapons systems or "killer robots," do not yet exist, but research and technology in a number of countries are moving rapidly in that direction. Because these machines would have the power to determine when to kill, they raise a host of legal, ethical and scientific concerns. Human Rights Watch and Harvard Law School's <a href="http://hrp.law.harvard.edu">International Human Rights Clinic</a> are advocating for a pre-emptive prohibition on fully autonomous weapons. The <a href="http://www.stopkillerrobots.org/">Campaign to Stop Killer Robots</a>, a global coalition of 52 nongovernmental organizations coordinated by Human Rights Watch, is making the same call. </p>

                <p>The prospect of fully autonomous weapons has generated widespread international debate, and on June 12, the UN Human Rights Council will get an update about the subject from <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/executions/pages/srexecutionsindex.aspx">Christof Heyns</a>, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. In 2013, when Heyns issued a longer <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/23/47">report</a> [text], the Human Rights Council became the first international body to discuss the humanitarian hazards of fully autonomous weapons. The council's continued attention would be helpful. Its focus on the human rights angle would reinforce the concerns that these weapons could unlawfully threaten humans during peace as well as war. This year Heyns is <a href="http://bit.ly/1pxN1RJ">urging</a>  the council to "remain engaged" in the issue and to "make its voice heard as the international debate unfolds." </p>

                <p>Despite the involvement of the Human Rights Council, most of the international discussion so far has taken place in the context of disarmament and/or international humanitarian law. Most notably, nations that are party to the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) held a four-day experts meeting in May about what they call "lethal autonomous weapons systems." This convention is an instrument of international humanitarian law that applies only to armed conflict. Even so, many countries emphasized at the meeting that the human rights implications of these weapons should also be addressed.</p>

                <p>A new report by Human Rights Watch and the Harvard clinic, <a href=" http://www.hrw.org/reports/2014/05/12/shaking-foundations">Shaking the Foundations</a>, looks at these implications. It addresses the possibility that countries could adapt fully autonomous weapons for use in a range of law enforcement situations, including controlling public opposition and conducting counterterrorism operations. Such use would trigger human rights law, which applies in times of both peace and armed conflict and generally has stricter rules on the use of force than international humanitarian law.</p>

                <p>The report concluded that fully autonomous weapons could compromise the foundations of international human rights law. It found that the weapons could jeopardize the right to life, which prohibits the arbitrary deprivation of life and is viewed as a prerequisite for all other rights. To be lawful, killing must be necessary, a last resort and proportionate to the threat involved. Robots would be ill-suited to establish whether a situation meets these criteria, which require qualitative determinations. The weapons could not be pre-programmed to handle every situation, and they would most likely lack human qualities, such as judgment, that human law enforcement officials rely on to comply with these three criteria in unexpected situations. </p>

                <p>Fully autonomous weapons could also deny the right to a remedy. There are serious doubts that any meaningful accountability would be possible for the actions of such weapons. Punishing a robot is hardly an option. And absent the intent to commit a crime, a military commander or law enforcement officer who deploys such a weapon would probably not be found guilty under existing international criminal law because the person would find it difficult to foresee how an autonomous robot would act. Programmers and manufacturers would have ways to escape civil liability. The United States, for example, grants defense contractors immunity for harm caused by their weapons, and victims in any jurisdiction would often lack the resources and access to courts needed to bring a civil suit. This accountability gap would impair the law's ability to deter harmful acts, and victims would be left unsatisfied that anyone could be punished for the suffering they experienced.</p>

                <p>Finally, fully autonomous weapons could undermine the principle of dignity, which lies at the heart of international human rights law and declares that every human is worthy of respect. An inanimate machine could not truly respect the value of a human life or comprehend the significance of its loss. Allowing a machine to make determinations about when to take life away would vitiate the importance attached to such decisions and degrade human dignity.</p>

                <p>Heyns, the UN expert, has shared the concerns expressed by Human Rights Watch and the Harvard clinic. In his new report for the Human Rights Council, available on the council's website, he writes about the "far-reaching potential implications for human rights, notably the rights to life and human dignity." In his 2013 report, he explored in detail these two issues as well as the dangers of a lack of accountability. </p>

                <p>Heyns calls for the international community to examine fully autonomous weapons from all perspectives. "It will lessen the chances for the international community to find a sustainable and comprehensive solution to the matter of autonomous weapons systems if it were to be dealt with only in either the disarmament or the human rights context, with the one lacking the perspective of the other on this vital issue," he writes in his 2014 report to the Human Rights Council. Heyns is right to oppose limiting the discussion to one forum when fully autonomous weapons raise such a diversity of issues.</p>

                <p>The member countries of the Human Rights Council should embrace their role in this multifaceted effort and take advantage of this week's meeting to voice their concerns about fully autonomous weapons, especially under human rights law. They should also start to articulate national positions on what to do about the weapons. Ideally, all countries should heed Heyns's 2013 recommendation to adopt immediate national moratoria on the weapons. They should take such actions with an eye to ultimately adopting an international treaty that bans, under all circumstances, the development, production and use of fully autonomous weapons.</p>

		<title>Right To Be Forgotten</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://journalism.missouri.edu/staff/sandy-davidson/">Sandy Davidson</a> of the University of Missouri School of Journalism and School of Law discusses removal of a person's past information from the Internet and the potential slippery slope this creates ... </p><strong>B</strong></font>y recognizing in May "the right to be forgotten," the European Union's Court of Justice has stirred the Internet reform pot.  </p>

<p><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=152065&page%20Index=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=391877">Google Spain SL, Google Inc. v. Agencia Espanola de Proteccion de Datos, Mario Costeja Gonzales</a> began when Gonzales lodged a complaint with the <a href="http://www.agpd.es/portalwebAGPD/canaldocumentacion/publicaciones/common/pdfs/AEPD_en.pdf">Spanish Data Protection Agency </a>(AEPD, PDF) against a Spanish newspaper. Two pages from 1998 contained the announcement that Gonzales' real estate would be auctioned to pay his social security debt. Gonzales argued that the attachment proceedings had been resolved and were now irrelevant. He wanted the announcement deleted. While the AEPD ruled against requiring the newspaper to delete the lawfully published information, it also ruled against Google, whose search engine provided links to the pages. The EU Court of Justice upheld that ruling.</p>

<p>This ruling interprets Directive 95/46/EC, which declares that "data-processing systems are designed to serve man" and must respect a person's "fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy..." </p>

<p>According to the court, a search engine's processing of Internet data in a search using an individual's name "is liable to affect significantly the fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data" because the results provide a profile or "structured overview" of information about the individual&#8212;"information which potentially concerns a vast number of aspects of his private life and which, without the search engine, could not have been interconnected or could have been only with great difficulty ..."   </p>

<p>This reasoning is reminiscent of the notion of "practical obscurity" of information <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16773548679263905884&q">invoked</a> by the US Supreme Court in 1989. The court denied a Freedom of Information request for a computerized FBI "rap sheet" on the grounds of an "unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." The court said, "Plainly there is a vast difference between the public records that might be found after a diligent search of courthouse files, county archives and local police stations throughout the country and a computerized summary located in a single clearing house of information."</p>

<p>The Court of Justice says a search operator's economic interest clearly cannot justify interference with an individual's data rights because of the "potential seriousness" of such interference. On the other hand, removing links from search results could affect "the legitimate interest of internet users."  Thus, the court calls for a "fair balance" between the interests of Internet users and individuals' privacy rights, a balance that depends "on the nature of the information in question and its sensitivity for the data subject's private life and on the interest of the public in having that information, an interest which may vary ... according to the role played by the data subject in public life."</p>

<p>Considering the "sensitivity for the data subject's private life" and that the information had initially been published 16 years prior, the court held that Gonzales had established a right to have links referring to the real-estate auction and recovery of his social security debt removed from the search-engine results about him.</p>

<p>And so Google is left to struggle with implementation of the <span class="casename">Gonzales</span> ruling because the Court of Justice gives little direction on how to respond to future requests to disable links. The court does say this:<br />
<blockquote>...even initially lawful processing of accurate data may ... become incompatible with the directive where those data are no longer necessary in the light of the purposes for which they were collected or processed. That is so in particular where they appear to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to those purposes and in the light of the time that has elapsed.</blockquote><br />
Google <em>must</em> create a "take down" policy in countries under EU control. But what about a "right to be forgotten" in the United States?</p>

<p>That "right" has not been widely recognized in the United States. It has now fallen into disfavor even in California, the jurisdiction that was its leading proponent under the <span class="casename">Briscoe</span> doctrine, from <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10883860115016430189&q">Briscoe v. Reader's Digest Ass'n</a>. In 1968 Reader's Digest published an article about truck hijackings and named Marvin Briscoe, who had hijacked a truck 12 years earlier. The article did not indicate that the hijacking had occurred in 1956. Since then, Briscoe had reformed, but his friends and 11-year-old daughter learned about his history from the article, and they abandoned him. Briscoe sued. </p>

<p>Although the California Supreme Court said, "There can be no doubt that reports of current criminal activities are the legitimate province of a free press," the court also said that Briscoe had "paid his debt to society." The court continued: <blockquote>Ideally, his neighbors should recognize his present worth and forget his past life of shame. But men are not so divine as to forgive the past trespasses of others. ... Briscoe's past life pursues him through the pages of Reader's Digest, now published in 13 languages and distributed in 100 nations, with a circulation in California alone of almost 2,000,000 copies.</blockquote></p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Briscoe</span>, the court cited its earlier decision, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/melvin-v-reid#.U5ewLChOTdk">Melvin v. Reid</a>, that involved a film, "The Red Kimono,"about a reformed prostitute. The film and ads for it used her birth name, which, the court said, was "unnecessary and indelicate and a wilful and wanton disregard of that charity which should actuate us in our social intercourse...." The court explained:<blockquote>...eight years before the production of "The Red Kimono", appellant had abandoned her life of shame, had rehabilitated herself and had taken her place as a respected and honored member of society. This change having occurred in her life, she should have been permitted to continue its course without having her reputation and social standing destroyed by the publication of  the story of her former depravity with no other excuse than the expectation of private gain by the publishers.<br />
One of the major objectives of society as it is now constituted ... is the rehabilitation of the fallen and the reformation of the criminal. ... Where a person has by his own efforts rehabilitated himself, we, as right-thinking members of society, should permit him to continue in the path of rectitude rather than throw him back into a life of shame or crime. </blockquote></p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Briscoe</span> the court recognized the tension between freedom of the press and individual privacy but opined that "the great general interest in an unfettered press may at times be outweighed by other great societal interests. As a people we have come to recognize that one of these societal interests is that of protecting an individual's right to privacy."  The court's bottom line was that Reader's Digest should not have used Briscoe's name. However, California also strictly limited the <span class="casename">Briscoe</span> doctrine to cases involving reformed criminals.  </p>

<p>Then in 2004, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13774747403146355756&q">Gates v. Discovery Communications, Inc.</a>, the California Supreme Court overruled <span class="casename">Briscoe</span> . A TV documentary had included information from court records about plaintiff Gates, who pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to a murder for hire but afterward reformed and became a "respected member of the community." The California Supreme Court agreed with the Court of Appeals, which said, "After <span class="casename">Briscoe</span> the United States Supreme Court decided a series of cases dealing with the same broad issue of the tension between the right to privacy and the rights of free speech and free press." Those cases included two permitting naming of rape victims. The California Supreme Court concluded that such cases "have fatally undermined <span class="casename">Briscoe</span>'s holding that a media defendant may be held liable in tort for recklessly publishing true but not newsworthy facts concerning a rehabilitated former criminal." </p>

<p>In short, California's <span class="casename">Briscoe</span> doctrine is dead.  Most jurisdictions did not follow it, anyway. For example, in 2002 a mayoral candidate in Wisconsin thought disclosure of his felony conviction violated his constitutional right to privacy. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2746690985663863996&q">disagreed</a>. Likewise, in 2003 the Supreme Court of Idaho <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16901157705214654888&q">rejected</a> a man's invasion of privacy claim; publication of a photograph of a 40-year-old document, contained in a court file, alleged homosexual activity by him. The court pointed out that the court record was open to the public. The US Supreme Court let Idaho's decision stand.</p>

<p>In 2008 a US story received widespread publicity internationally. It <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1042506/A-cloned-dog-Mormon-mink-lined-handcuffs-tantalising-mystery.html">involved</a> a woman who had her dead pit bull Booger cloned in South Korea. Pictures of her with the cloned pups led to her being recognized for something quite different: She was, according to the Associated Press, "the same woman who 31 years earlier was accused of abducting a Mormon missionary in England, handcuffing him to a bed and making him her sex slave."</p>

<p>Would Google be forced to erase her past history in EU countries?<br />
	<br />
Erasing history rewrites history by purging the record of individual ugliness. Purification. Expurgation. Censorship. It is a slippery slope, indeed. Given the First Amendment, US media should receive more protection than that offered in countries under EU jurisdiction.<br />
	<br />
As for Booger's owner, should she have foreseen that seeking publicity about cloning her dog would lead almost inexorably to republication of stories about her past alleged transgressions? Media do not let some sleeping dogs lie.</p>

		<title>What the Bowe Bergdahl-Taliban Exchange Teaches Us about Closing Guantanamo</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.shu.edu/Faculty/fulltime_faculty/Jonathan-Hafetz.cfm">Jonathan Hafetz</a> of the Seton Hall University School of Law discusses some of the lessons offered by the Bergdahl exchange as they relate to US policy on Guantanamo ... </p><strong>T</strong></font>he Obama administration has confirmed that it will continue to pursue its longstanding goal of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, notwithstanding the uproar over the recent return of five Taliban prisoners in exchange for the release of US <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/final-known-us-prisoner-of-war-released-in-exchange-for-guantanamo-detainees.php">Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl</a>. Below are three lessons offered by the Bergdahl exchange for US policy on <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo</a>.</p>

<p>1. The Perils of Incrementalism</p>

<p>The Bergdahl exchange highlights the downsides of an incrementalist approach to closing Guantanamo. Each case has been thoroughly reviewed, and 78 of the remaining prisoners have been cleared unanimously by all relevant agencies. There are also countries such as Uruguay willing to take detainees. Yet, fearful of political blowback, the Obama administration has been reluctant to transfer detainees more quickly because of the possibility that they might reengage in conduct that could be deemed hostile. The overriding fear is not a fear of the detainees themselves, but rather a political fear that if a former detainee does something at some point in the future it will be used against the Obama administration, as Benghazi was. The desire for zero-risk guarantees in closing Guantanamo is impossible. It has not merely slowed the closure process. By prolonging the prison's existence, it has provided a fresh stream of opportunities for critics to attack the premise of closure and for recalcitrant lawmakers to erect new obstacles to achieving this goal. </p>

<p>The reality is that Guantanamo has been closing for more than ten years. Apart from the transfer of 14 "high-value detainees" from secret CIA jails in 2006, virtually no prisoners have been brought to Guantanamo since 2004. The paradox is that the more slowly the prison closes, the more difficult it becomes to close it, and the more concessions it will require (Note here the version of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113s2410pcs/pdf/BILLS-113s2410pcs.pdf">2015 National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [PDF] reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) that could be read to narrow the scope of habeas review and to bar the release of any detainees in the US if transferred there). </p>

<p>As long as Guantanamo stays open, it remains vulnerable to fear mongering and the vagaries of global events, which tend to increase resistance to closing the prison and releasing its prisoners. Take, for example, President Obama's suspension of detainee transfers to Yemen in 2010 in response to reports that Umar Farouq Abdulmuttalab, who attempted to blow up a commercial airline flight bound for Detroit, had been radicalized in Yemen. That decision helped bring transfers out of Guantanamo to a halt. Although the administration subsequently eliminated the Yemen-transfer ban, the SASC version of the 2015 NDAA would institute a one-year ban on all transfers to Yemen. </p>

<p>The Bergdahl-Taliban exchange is only the latest instance of how a media frenzy can embolden those who want to keep Guantanamo open and hold the men there in US custody indefinitely. The exchange, while the right decision, highlights the downside of an incrementalist approach in which risk aversion drives US policy. Such caution, it might be argued, is necessary given political realities. But rather than successfully manage the opposition, excessive fear of political fall-out has allowed that opposition to take root and fester. In fact, the Bergdahl exchange suggests that the administration has more latitude to go bigger and faster than it has previously acknowledged, notwithstanding the roadblocks in its path. Which brings me to the second lesson.</p>

<p>2. The NDAA's Transfer Restrictions: Still Room to Maneuver</p>

<p>Much criticism of President Obama in the Bergdahl matter has focused on his failure to provide the required 30-day advance notice to Congress before transferring any Guantanamo detainee. Assuming <em>arguendo</em> notice was required in the unique context of prisoner exchange conducted under exigent circumstances (see Defense Secretary Hagel's remarks <a href="http://justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hagel-Testimony-HASC.pdf">here</a> [PDF] defending the exchange), notice has not typically been the sticking point in getting detainees out of Guantanamo. Instead, the main supposed obstacle to transfer has been the separate provisions of the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr1960/text">2014 NDAA</a> requiring the Secretary of Defense to consider various factors before transferring detainees, including the steps US officials have taken to mitigate the future risk a detainee could pose and the national security interest in the detainee's transfer. While previous NDAAs contained more stringent requirements, substantial risk mitigation has always been the standard for transfer, even during the Bush administration. And under current law, the administration no longer needs to certify that all factors have been met; rather, it must only provide notice that they have been considered and that transfer will occur after 30 days.</p>

<p>What is striking about the Bergdahl-Taliban deal, however, is how little an obstacle this substantive requirement poses when the President makes it a priority to get the relevant players on board and move a prisoner out of Guantanamo. </p>

<p>Unlike the procedural advance notice requirement, the substantive requirement is malleable, with ample room for the administration to argue why transferring particular prisoners from Guantanamo is in the US national interest. In short, if the required consideration of security factors can be satisfied for the five Taliban prisoners sent back to Afghanistan, it can be met for many other detainees, particularly for the 78 cleared prisoners. </p>

<p>3. War Means Prisoners Go Home When the War Ends</p>

<p>As others have <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/06/02/3443719/the-case-for-negotiating-for-bergdahls-release/">noted</a>, the US would have been legally obligated to release the five Taliban detainees in the relatively near future anyway, given the projected US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The US will similarly be required to release other Guantanamo detainees once the war is over. While the Obama administration does not expressly claim otherwise, it has not forcefully made the case that the same legal principles that have allowed the US to detain prisoners at Guantanamo for more than 12 years will also require it to release them, like it or not (unless it can charge them with a crime). Whatever disagreement there may be about when the war is over, or whether an armed conflict with al Qaeda even continues today, the obligation to promptly repatriate wartime prisoners when the relevant conflict ends is black-letter international law. Further, there is an argument to be made (I've discussed it <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2277699">here</a>), that long-cleared detainees are not detainable now even if hostilities continue on the theory that their detention is no longer necessary to prevent their return to hostilities.</p>

<p>One of the most troubling aspects of the Bergdahl controversy is not whether the Taliban prisoners pose a future threat, but rather the suggestion that this assessment actually matters in the long run. Once the conflict ends, the metric is not a case-by-case determination about whether a particular prisoner could be dangerous. The Bergdahl controversy, however, suggests the degree to which the paradigm of future dangerousness has taken hold, supplanting the traditional rationale regarding the required release of wartime prisoners in the public discourse. This rationale supports more aggressive steps sooner and faster. Simply put, the US cannot, legally, anyway, hold Guantanamo detainees forever. So it might as well accept that reality sooner rather than later. Further, the longer it takes, the more credence it gives to the notion of the forever prisoner.</p>

		<title>Harmonization of Law is the Key in Europe</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=2013253">Angelique Devaux</a> discusses the harmonization of law in the European Union and the Franco-German Agreement of Common Optional Matrimonial Property Regime...</p>

                <p>In a time when Europe is experiencing economic crisis for several years and developed an identity crisis marked by the boost of <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20140527-europe-pictures-european-parliament-eurosceptic-parties-fn-ukip/">Eurosceptics</a> at the recent European elections, it is somewhat surprising that one of the major advances of European Construction relates to family law, drawn to a value of safe refuge.</p>

                <p>And for good reason, European families exist and the numbers speak for themselves: there are approximately 350,000 marriages between spouses from two different countries celebrated each year within Europe, 450,000 international successions and 170,000 divorces that are pronounced. These past years, family law has been intensively developed within an ongoing process of European <a href="http://www.notaries-of-europe.eu/services/services-for-citizens/couples-in-europe">harmonization</a> essentially directed towards rules of procedures and forms of private international law, bringing practitioners such as civil law notaries and judges to apply a foreign law which they are unfamiliar, or totally ignorant. For instance, in a case involving the dissolution of a couple, marital consequences are accentuated if there is a significant discrepancy in the distribution of matrimonial property according to the spouses' country of origin and therefore, in practice, difficulties arise when attempting to solve issues that are raised.</p>

                <p>In that context, France and Germany, two pillar states of the European construction, have worked together with the common goal of increasing the legal security of mixed married couples and have signed the agreement of 4 February 2010 that inaugurates the first <a href="http://www.bmjv.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/pdfs/Uebersetzung_Abkommen_Wahlgueterstand.pdf?_blob=publicationFile">Common Optional Matrimonial Property Regime</a> (hereafter COMPR). They have selected the community of accrued gains which is already known in Germany as a default regime and in France as a contractual regime to honor this first common substantive law between two states. This is a major legal advance in international family law because the originality of the regime from which it is composed, works and is liquidated under the same rules on each side of the Rhine. The scope is large in order to assure maximum accessibility. Indeed, according to the current French and German private International Law rules in matters of matrimonial property regime, the COMPR can be chosen by French or German citizens, but also by a spouse who has their habitual residence in France or in Germany, and by those who own property in either of these states through a marriage contract that place the civil law notaries in the heart of its implementation. The message is clear: This is not only confined to French or German nationals, this is accessible to every citizen involved with France and Germany today (and to other countries in the future).</p>

                <p>For those who are unfamiliar with the community of accrued gains regime, its operation is very simple: it works as a separation of property during the regime with the corollary that each spouse retains control, manage, use and dispose of his or her patrimony. At the time of the dissolution, the community of accrued gains plays its full role, because it retains a community approach. Each spouses' initial and final assets are compared to fix the accrued gains of the spouses; and if one spouse exceeds the accrued gains of the other, the other spouse can claim half of the surplus as debt on the accrued gains. The spouses finally share the gains equally. The Franco-German agreement establishes the rules to set up and organize the composition and the evaluation of the initial and final assets, and the calculation of the debt on accrued gains. However, these rules are not set in stone because the spouses can derogate in their contract to each other, the freedom of contract.</p>

                <p>Indeed, in a global perspective, the COMPR has several advantages and is a real opportunity for all international couples that are living outside of their country of origin. The regime associates separation of property with community, which is a real gain for spouses. In regard to the rights of their creditors first by protecting the spouse's patrimony during the existence of such regime because the obligations incurred by one spouse can be enforced against his property only. And second, between the spouses themselves when the debt on accrued gains plays a kind of monetary compensation while one spouse has worked for the other one without being paid. It might also design a route towards legal stability and recognition of same-sex married couples that are not recognized in Germany. German law equates a same-sex marriage performed in other jurisdiction to <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgbeg/englisch_bgbeg.html">registered life partnership</a> (<em>Zugewinngemeinschaft</em>) including the matrimonial property regime which cannot exceed the effects of the German registered partnership of community of accrued gains. By opting for the COMPR, it will ensure same-sex married couples a way for their assets to be treated equally whether they are located in France or in Germany.</p>

                <p>The agreement was implemented a year ago in France and Germany, but there needs to be stronger communication between couples and professionals. European couples need answers of cooperation between states, and it is up to professionals to respond to such a request. The main advantage of the COMPR is certainly the possibility for all bi-national couples to opt for a matrimonial property regime that works under the same rules with an official translation in different states, thus limiting the risks of misinterpretation of the provisions. </p>

                <p>Looking to the future, the COMPR is a step towards the harmonization of substantive rules in European family law to simplify the daily lives of couples. This is the beginning of a new era because the agreement is not closed to France and Germany alone: other member states can accede the agreement by accession, and we know today that Luxembourg, Hungary and Bulgaria have expressed a clear wish to accede the agreement. The COMPR may also serve as a model for other type of common optional matrimonial property regime, or other types of common substantive rules related to family law because the harmonization of substantive rules is key to the success of an integrated Europe. The COMPR will secure the legal relationship of couples in Europe for sure, and will reinforce the feeling of a European citizenship by appropriating a device known and appreciated by all.</p>

                <p>Not without displeasing those far-right European parliamentarians recently elected, harmonization in Europe is needed and the harmonization of substantive rules is possible when made by compromise and soft law, as demonstrated by the COMPR. As such, the Franco-German agreement must stay a compromise between states and consequently, the text will need to be amended in the interest of compromise when other member states accede. The goal is to build a common legal culture and not to impose just one vision. </p>

                <p>It is therefore important to promote this device now through significant communications to European citizens and through strong professional trainings, both of which are necessary to change the current European mentality and to show that harmonization is achievable. We need to continue nurturing European integration because the European Union is not an economic union only, it is also the union of thousands of people who themselves are European families. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Griffen Thorne, <a href="http://www.luc.edu/law/">Loyola University Chicago School of Law</a>, Class of 2015, discusses the intricacies of double jeopardy and the point at which jeopardy is thought to first occur...</j:header></p>

<p>Double jeopardy is among the most complex doctrines of constitutional criminal procedure and among the most important protections of the criminally accused. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> provides, "nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb in criminal or civil cases." The Supreme Court noted in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3746284767088352998&q=North+Carolina+v.+Pearce&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">North Carolina v. Pearce</a> that Double Jeopardy bars a second prosecution for the same offense after an acquittal or conviction, and also bars multiple punishments for the same offense.</p>

<p>Though double jeopardy jurisprudence is replete with rules that are vague and perplexing, one of its simpler aspects is that jeopardy must "attach" before the Double Jeopardy Clause can bar a later prosecution. However, what is simple in theory has been difficult in practice, as the Supreme Court has struggled to precisely identify when exactly jeopardy attaches.  </p>

<p>The court has provided substantial guidance to determine when jeopardy attaches. Most notably, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10529174847445915625&q=crist+v.+bretz&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Crist v. Bretz</a>, the court held that in a jury trial, jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn. Despite <span class="casename">Crist</span>'s apparent clarity and simplicity, the court was recently tasked with re-interpreting the rule.  </p>

<p>In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18343075549890325968&q=martinez+v.+illinois&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Martinez v. Illinois</a> the court heard an appeal from the Illinois Supreme Court, which had concluded that a defendant had not been put in jeopardy even after the jury was sworn. The Illinois Supreme Court claimed first that <span class="casename">Crist</span> was not designed for rigid application, but more importantly that the facts of Martinez's case and acquittal indicated that he never actually faced a real threat of conviction.  </p>

<p>In a short <em>per curiam</em> opinion issued on May 27, 2014, the court reaffirmed that jeopardy attaches the moment the jury is sworn, and that double jeopardy bars retrial following an acquittal where jeopardy attached. Essentially, the court made its bright-line rule even brighter. </p>

<p><span class="casename">Martinez</span> confirmed that once jeopardy attaches, the prosecution has one chance to prove its case. The state cannot simply hit the "reset" button in the face of unfavorable obstacles. And most importantly, the accused cannot be twice brought to trial based on the prosecution's errors.  </p>

<p>In August 2006 Esteban Martinez was indicted for mob action, as well as aggravated battery against Avery Binion and Demarco Scott. On Martinez's 2009 trial date, the prosecution moved to continue, as it could not locate Binion or Scott. The motion was granted, but by the rescheduled date, neither Binion nor Scott had been found. The trial court granted three more continuances, each time based on Binion and Scott's absences.<br />
	<br />
On May 17, 2010 the fourth rescheduled trial date, Binion and Scott were still missing. When the prosecution asked for a brief continuance, the court instead offered to delay swearing the jury for a few hours, giving the prosecution the choice between moving to dismiss its case and having the court empanel the jury. The court cycled through all of the cases on its docket and offered the prosecution an additional "couple of hours" to locate Binion and Scott.  <br />
	<br />
When the prosecution inevitably reported that the men could still not be found, the court ordered that the jury be brought in and sworn. After the court directed the prosecution to proceed with its case, the prosecution demurred, twice informing the court that the state would not be participating in the trial. The defense moved for a judgment of acquittal, which the court granted.</p>

<p>The state appealed, arguing that the trial court should have granted its continuance. Martinez disputed the appeal. He contended that double jeopardy barred a subsequent appeal, as the trial court had acquitted him of all charges. </p>

<p>The Illinois Appellate Court sided with the state, concluding jeopardy never attached and that the trial court erred in refusing to grant the state a fifth continuance. The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court. Though it cited <span class="casename">Crist</span>, it nevertheless concluded that jeopardy had not attached in Martinez's case. To support its conclusion, the court cited <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15711668984265389487&q=serfass+v.+united+states&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Serfass v. United States</a>, where the Supreme Court rejected "rigid, mechanical" rules, and held that the relevant question to when jeopardy attaches is whether the defendant was "subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction."</p>

<p>Following what it construed to be the meaning of <span class="casename">Serfass</span>, the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that Martinez was never placed in jeopardy, as the prosecutor had made clear that the state would not participate in the trial. Consequently, Martinez could not have been successfully prosecuted. Therefore, the court held that he was never in jeopardy. But, the Supreme Court disagreed.</p>

<p>The court's entire, albeit short, analysis centered on the faults of the Illinois Supreme Court's reasoning and its misreading of Supreme Court precedent. The Court initially noted that the <span class="casename">Crist</span> rule that jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn is among the clearest rules in criminal procedure jurisprudence.</p>

<p>The court contended that the Illinois Supreme Court relied on a misreading of <span class="casename">Serfass</span>. The Court noted that <span class="casename">Serfass</span>'s admonishment of "rigid, mechanical" rules was not aimed at the moment when jeopardy attaches, but instead at whether the manner in which a trial terminated barred a retrial.  </p>

<p>And, with respect to Martinez not being "subjected to the hazards of trial," the court stated simply that it had never suggested that jeopardy did not attach merely because a defendant did not face a genuine risk of conviction. The mere act of swearing the jury subjected Martinez to jeopardy.</p>

<p>Having determined that Martinez was subject to jeopardy, the court moved onto the question of whether double jeopardy barred a retrial. The court cited its recent <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11830792929649689649&q=evans+v.+michigan&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Evans v. Michigan</a> opinion, noting that acquittal is a resolution of at least some of the factual elements of the crime with which a defendant is charged. Acquittal is the most basic source of a double jeopardy bar.<br />
	<br />
The court concluded that the trial court's acquittal was a "textbook" finding that the prosecution's evidence could not support Martinez's conviction. The trial court's action was not a dismissal, because it was based on the prosecution's failure to provide sufficient evidence in support of its case. Martinez could not be retried.<br />
	<br />
<span class="casename">Martinez</span>'s impact is relatively straightforward&#8212;what was once considered a bright-line rule is much brighter. The moment a jury is sworn, the prosecution is locked into its case, and any subsequent acquittal bars retrial. However, <span class="casename">Martinez</span> confirmed that prior to jeopardy attaching, the ball is in the prosecutor's court. <br />
	<br />
<span class="casename">Martinez</span> provides some guidance to prosecutors in similar, tough situations prior to trial. The court noted that had the prosecutor accepted the trial court's invitation to move for dismissal, double jeopardy would not have barred retrial, as jeopardy would not have attached. In so noting, the court recognized that the prosecution&#8212;even if faced with seemingly fatal circumstances&#8212;still controls the case prior to jeopardy attaching.  </p>

<p>Following <span class="casename">Martinez</span>, prosecutors facing similar circumstances should move to dismiss.  Failure to move to dismiss is a prosecutorial mistake but it is nevertheless impermissible to place a defendant twice in jeopardy based on a prosecutor's negligence.  Failure to make the proper motion at the proper time poses substantial problems for prosecutors.  Procedural incompetency may put guilty (and even violent) criminals back on the street.  But <span class="casename">Martinez</span>'s warning for prosecutors is simple and clear: timing is everything.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.projectisd.org/pisd/sobre-proldi/equipo/">Ryan Seelau</a> of <a href="http://www.projectisd.org/pisd/ ">The Project for Indigenous Self Determination</a> discusses Justice Clarence Thomas' dissent in Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community...</p>

                <p>On May 27, 2014 the US Supreme Court handed down its decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/michigan-v-bay-mills-indian-community/">Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community</a>. The decision was widely regarded as a victory for US Tribes. But as the analysis of the Supreme Court's recent decision in <span class="casename">Bay Mills</span> continues and what it means for the future of tribal sovereign immunity is parsed out, it is interesting to note the length the dissenters were willing to go to in their effort to overturn Supreme Court precedent&#8212;namely, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-1037.ZS.html">Kiowa Tribe v. Manufacturing Technologies</a> decision from 1998&#8212;and eliminate tribal immunity in the commercial context. While Justice Clarence Thomas (joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia) makes a number of cogent arguments against tribal sovereign immunity in the commercial context, at one point he seems to go so far as to suggest that <span class="casename">Kiowa</span> should never have been understood as good law even though it was a 6-3 decision at the time it was made.  </p>

                <p>Justice Thomas notes that one of the arguments in favor of upholding tribal sovereign immunity was that <span class="casename">Kiowa</span> has been settled law for sixteen years and that everyone&#8212;Native nations, States and non-Native businesses alike&#8212;has relied on that holding to structure all types of agreements and contracts. In order to counter this line of argument, Justice Thomas appears to argue that even while the ink on the <span class="casename">Kiowa</span> decision was still wet, it already wasn't good law. Thomas notes that at the time of the decision "the court had strong misgivings about [extending the scope of tribal immunity]" and that three Justices (a.k.a. the dissenters&#8212;Ginsburg, Scalia and Thomas) "would not have expanded immunity in the first place" while "the other six essentially expressed hope that Congress would overrule the court's decision." </p>

                <p>While the court in <span class="casename">Kiowa</span> did state, "There are reasons to doubt perpetuating the doctrine," the court, by a 6-3 decision, did ultimately hold that tribal sovereign immunity extended into the commercial context. Despite this fact, Justice Thomas' seems to think the rest of the world should have seen the majority's holding not so much as law, but as a placeholder until someone (i.e. Congress) could change that holding. In fact, Justice Thomas goes so far as to state, "Against that backdrop, it would hardly be reasonable for a tribe to rely on <span class="casename">Kiowa</span> as a permanent grant of immunity for off-reservation commercial activities." </p>

                <p>Even though it would appear that all actors&#8212;Native and non-Native alike&#8212;treated <span class="casename">Kiowa</span> as good law for sixteen years, Justice Thomas' insinuation is that those actions have all been unreasonable. Given such a line of argument, it is easy to wonder about the other cases we are all relying on, but that would "hardly be reasonable" to do so in Justice Thomas' world. According to SCOTUS Blog's <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/reference/stat-pack/">Stat Pack</a>, more than 34 percent of all Supreme Court decisions over the past five years have been by 6-3 or 5-4 decisions. While not all of those decisions involve a majority with "strong misgivings" about the subject matter in question, it is safe to say the reasoning and analysis underlying many of those decisions is neither uniform nor absolute, and yet we rely on them.</p>

                <p>Perhaps ironically, it is Justice Thomas's own argument that no one should not rely upon as it contains no precedential value and is merely <em>dicta</em> in a dissenting opinion. But precedential value aside, it is striking that Thomas appears to be so strongly opposed to the <span class="casename">Kiowa</span> decision that he would willingly put forth a radical argument about Supreme Court precedent. That said, it is by no means the first time Justice Thomas has had radical thoughts about federal Indian law, nor is it likely to be the last.</p>

Four years ago, in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1371.ZS.html">Christian Legal Society v. Martinez</a>, the US Supreme Court said "no," but bills have been <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2013/01/31/1524541/virginia-lawmakers-approve-bill-forcing-universities-to-fund-student-groups-that-discriminate/">introduced</a>  in many state legislatures to overturn that decision and force public universities to provide recognition and state funding to all religious groups even if those groups discriminate. And one of the leading proponents of those bills, <a href="http://www.intervarsity.org">Intervarsity Christian Fellowship</a>, got a publicity boost earlier this month when the New York Times ran a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/10/us/colleges-and-evangelicals-collide-on-bias-policy.html?_r=2">cover story</a>  about Bowdoin College withdrawing recognition from the Bowdoin Evangelical Fellowship, which elicited a surprising amount of <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/06/campus-christian-groups-should-be-allowed-remain-christian">sympathy</a> from many very sharp writers.</p>

                <p>The next time you read about religious student groups objecting to nondiscrimination policies, here is some important context to keep in mind.</p>

                <p><u>Declining to fund a student group is not the same as banning it</u></p>

                <p>As an initial matter, we should be clear about what it means for a college to not "recognize" a student group. At most colleges and universities, recognized student groups are given special subsidies from the school, which may include school-provided e-mail addresses, the ability to participate in school orientation, electronic keys and access for their outside sponsors and funding from school's activity fees, which are financed through surcharges imposed on the entire student body. Most colleges and universities provide this recognition because they believe that vibrant student clubs and organizations help contribute to the intellectual and social life on campus, which benefits the entire school community.   </p>

                <p>And, in exchange for these subsidies, <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/preview/publiced_preview_briefs_pdfs_09_10_08_1371_RespondentAmCuStateUnivandStateSystems.authcheckdam.pdf">many colleges and universities</a> [PDF] require that the subsidized student groups cannot discriminate in their membership and leadership eligibility policies. Some schools have policies with enumerated categories that prohibit groups from discriminating based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability. Other schools&#8212;like the law school in the Supreme Court case&#8212;have "all comers" policies that set a blanket rule that all student groups have to be open to all students who want to join.</p>

                <p>Even without official recognition, however, students are generally free to form any group they want with any restrictions they want. Religious groups like evangelical fellowships can meet, study, socialize and worship in whatever manner they choose both on and off campus. They just don't get the subsidy that comes with official recognition.  </p>

                <p><u>Students should not have to finance groups that discriminate against them</u></p>

                <p>Just as religious organizations that receive taxpayer dollars shouldn't be able to use those funds to discriminate, student groups that receive funding from student activity fees should not be able to discriminate with those funds either.  </p>

                <p>Most student religious groups have had no problem complying with nondiscrimination policies. As the New York Times article noted, Jewish, Muslim, Catholic and mainline Protestant groups have agreed to nondiscrimination policies, saying they do not discriminate and do not anticipate that the new policies will cause problems. And Hillel says some chapters have elected non-Jews to student boards.  </p>

                <p>The reason why many evangelical fellowship groups are refusing to agree to the colleges' nondiscrimination policies isn't because they are worried about a hostile takeover from Lutherans. It's because they want to <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/december-web-only/why-we-fight-for-campus-access.html">retain by-laws</a>  that bar "<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1371.ZO.html">unrepentant homosexuals</a>" from being eligible to run for leadership roles or sometimes even being members. Before the Supreme Court, Christian Legal Society argued unsuccessfully that it was not really discriminating against gay students because their bylaws exclude anyone who engages in sexual conduct outside of a marriage between a man and a woman. Michelle Bachmann used the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/01/michele-bachmann-gay-marriage_n_1123784.html">same reasoning</a> to argue that bans on same-sex marriage don't discriminate because anyone&#8212;whether they are gay or straight&#8212;can still marry a person of the opposite sex. But as the Supreme Court noted, it is impossible to distinguish between status and conduct in this context.</p>

                <p>There is no inherent reason why a religious student group cannot also include members who do not comport with all particulars of religious orthodoxy. There is a vibrant internal dialogue among many people of faith&#8212;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/17/world-vision-gay-marriage_n_5160816.html">including evangelicals</a>&#8212;about homosexuality and marriage, just as there is a dialogue in the Jewish community about the role of women and there was a dialogue in the Mormon community in the 1970's about the role of black people in the church. If a particular group of students wants to police the boundaries of what qualifies as an acceptable religious belief and excommunicate heretics from their club, that is their right. But there is no reason why the student body as a whole should be forced to subsidize them either.</p>

                <p><u>Buddhists are not staging a hostile takeover of the Catholic student group</u></p>

                <p>To be clear, the issue isn't whether these groups have to elect particular students as their leaders. The issue is whether the groups can have bylaws that exclude particular groups of students from even having the opportunity to run. As the Supreme Court noted, far-fetched hypothetical scenarios of, say, Buddhists staging a hostile takeover of Catholic student organizations have failed to materialize. Organizations are free to have election rules that require students to be active members in the club for several semesters before running as a candidate or voting in in an election. "And if a rogue student intent on sabotaging an organization's objectives nevertheless attempted a takeover, the members of that group would not likely elect her as an officer." All that nondiscrimination policies do is ensure that student organizations can't have a rule that bars particular groups of students from even being eligible to run for election in the first place. </p>

                <p>It is always possible to think up bizarre scenarios in which students exploit a nondiscrimination policy as a prank. But in the absence of evidence that is a real problem, it makes sense for colleges to have rules in place that don't force administrators or student governmental officials to make ad hoc judgments about what types religiously motivated discrimination are legitimate and what types are not. </p>

                <p>Because few "unrepentant homosexuals" will be interested in joining groups like the Christian Legal Society (and fewer would be elected), the issue is to some degree symbolic. But stigma often works through symbolism. And it's also important to understand that many religiously affiliated student organizations are not just prayer circles; they are also social groups, community service organizations, eating clubs and fraternities.</p>

                <p>A student might fairly conclude that she does not want to belong to a club that wouldn't want her as a member. But she could also fairly conclude that she shouldn't have to subsidize their discrimination either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </p>

<p>It is not always clear exactly when a patent is infringed. People typically think of infringement in a black and white manner as the unauthorized use of another person's <a href="http://www.generalpatent.com/patent-infringement">invention</a>. However, infringement becomes more complicated for method patents. A method patent&#8212;unlike a regular patent&#8212;involves several steps a user must perform to achieve a particular result. But what if one user does not perform all of those steps? What if instead one user performs some of the steps, causing another person to perform the other steps? This concept, known as induced infringement, was dealt with by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4020064236349345398&q=Limelight+Networks,+Inc.+v.+Akamai+Technologies,+Inc.&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Technologies, Inc.</a></p>

<p>The facts of <span class="casename">Limelight</span> are fairly straightforward. Akamai was the exclusive licensee of a complicated, multistep method involving Internet content delivery. The patent claimed a method whereby users would designate components to be stored ("tagged") on servers. Limelight was a competitor that provided a similar service but required its customers to tag their own files. Limelight performed all but one of the steps patented by Akamai. Akamai sued Limelight for patent infringement and received a favorable verdict&#8212;including $40 million in damages&#8212;in the Federal District Court. </p>

<p>Two years after Akamai's victory, the Federal Circuit decided <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15707621657953352516&q=Muniaction,+Inc.+v.+Thomson+Corp&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp.</a> Like in <span class="casename">Limelight</span>, the defendant in <span class="casename">Muniauction</span> performed all but one of the steps of the plaintiff's method patent and left the remaining step to its customers. <span class="casename">Muniauction</span> held that where multiple parties are involved, direct infringement&#8212;<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/271">using a patent without authority</a>&#8212;is required before induced infringement can be considered. In such situations, direct infringement requires that one party directly infringed the entire method or exercised control over the entire process. The Federal Circuit consequently held that the defendant was not liable for infringement as it neither performed all the steps of the plaintiff's patent nor exercised control over the process when its customers carried out the remaining steps.</p>

<p>In light of <span class="casename">Muniauction</span>, Limelight moved for reconsideration. Limelight claimed it could not be liable for induced infringement of Akamai's patent where it was not liable for direct infringement or control over the process. The District Court granted Limelight's motion and correctly concluded that there was no direct infringement because Limelight did not perform all the steps of Akamai's claimed method and did not control its customers' completion of the remaining step&#8212;the "tagging."  The Federal Circuit affirmed. </p>

<p>However, sitting <em>en banc</em>, the Federal Circuit reversed, holding that direct infringement was not the proper focus of a multi-party induced infringement claim. Rather the court focused on Limelight's actions, namely performing some of Akamai's claimed steps, while requiring its customers to perform the remaining steps. The court held that Limelight was liable for induced infringement even though it was not liable for direct infringement as direct infringement can exist independently of a violation of the Patent Act.  </p>

<p>Limelight appealed the Federal Circuit's decision. The Supreme Court first noted that nobody&#8212;not even the Federal Circuit&#8212;would argue that direct infringement is a requirement of finding induced infringement. Even the Patent Act requires that. The Court next noted that under <span class="casename">Muniauction</span>, Limelight did not commit direct infringement as it neither performed all of the steps of Akamai's method patent nor exercised control over its customers who performed the remaining steps. </p>

<p>The Court fundamentally disagreed with the Federal Circuit's reasoning that there could be induced infringement merely because a party could have performed all of the steps. The Court was not willing to create a different set of rules for induced infringement. Therefore, without absolute direct infringement, there can be no induced infringement. Unfortunately, it does not seem to matter that Limelight might have encouraged its customers; the bottom line is that nobody directly infringed.  </p>

<p>But should this be the case? If Limelight had forced its customers to engage in tagging, then Limelight would have exercised control under <span class="casename">Muniauction</span>. This would have constituted direct infringement, which would be enough to find induced infringement. However, as the Supreme Court noted, because Limelight did not literally force its customers to tag their materials, Limelight's actions did not rise to the level of control as required by <span class="casename">Muniauction</span> to find direct infringement. At the same time, because the only step the customers performed was the "tagging," the customers were not liable for direct infringement. </p>

<p>This raises obvious and foreseeable concerns. Business tactics could change in the future to avoid infringing method patents. Where one company wants to use a method another company holds, it could merely encourage its customers to perform some of the steps of that method. The problem with <span class="casename">Limelight</span> is that it seems to implicitly encourage suspect business tactics. After all, <span class="casename">Limelight</span> broadens <span class="casename">Muniauction</span>'s gray areas between exercising control and mere encouragement. Though the law is clear in that direct infringement is required for a finding of induced infringement, maybe the correct outcome would have been lowering the threshold for control to encourage customers to perform some of the steps of a method patent. That would be less likely to lead to suspect business practices.   </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/people/adjunct-faculty/linda-tashbook">Linda Tashbook</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> discusses the constitutionality of the Los Angeles law prohibiting the use of a vehicle for living quarters...</p>
<strong>N</strong>othing offends constitutional sensibilities quite like a local ordinance that sets police against poor people as a way of cleaning-up litter. Yet <a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/city/ca/LosAngeles/Municipal/chapter08.pdf">Section 85.02</a> [PDF]of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, which was enacted in 1983 and prohibits the use of a vehicle for living quarters, was lifted out of obscurity four years ago, having not been enforced over the years, for the express purpose of responding to "the illegal dumping of trash and human waste on city streets that was endangering public health."

Note that the dumping was already illegal. The litter ordinance or even the disorderly conduct ordinance, if necessary, could have been invoked against that behavior. But the city dredged up this old anti-homeless law because neighbors claimed that it was homeless folks who were dumping the trash and waste. Here is the entire text of the ordinance:
<blockquote>No person shall use a vehicle parked or standing upon any City street or upon any parking lot owned by the City of Los Angeles and under the control of the City of Los Angeles or under control of the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors as living quarters either overnight, day-by-day, or otherwise.</blockquote>
It doesn't say anything about dumping trash or waste.

And so it came to pass that a small group of people, Desertrain et al, who had each been arrested under this ordinance brought a federal lawsuit against Los Angeles asserting that the law was unconstitutional. On June 19, 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit published a clear and artful decision in the case <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2014/06/19/11-56957.pdf">Desertrain v. City of Los Angeles</a> [PDF]—artful because rather than weighing the city's purpose against the irrelevant effects of the law, the court succinctly eviscerated the ordinance for being so vague that neither the public nor the police knew exactly which aspects of "living" were not allowed to be done in a vehicle:
<blockquote>Plaintiffs are left guessing as to what behavior would subject them to citation and arrest by an officer ... Is it impermissible to eat food in a vehicle? Is it illegal to keep a sleeping bag? Canned food? Books? What about speaking on a cell phone? Or staying in the car to get out of the rain? These are all actions Plaintiffs were taking when arrested for violation of the ordinance, all of which are otherwise perfectly legal. And despite Plaintiffs' repeated attempts to comply with Section 85.02, there appears to be nothing they can do to avoid violating the statute short of discarding all of their possessions or their vehicles, or leaving Los Angeles entirely.</blockquote>
The police confusion about the ordinance resulted in "arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement." Said the court: "Section 85.02 is broad enough to cover any driver in Los Angeles who eats food or transports personal belongings in his or her vehicle. Yet it appears to be applied only to the homeless."

Had the <span class="casename">Desertrain</span> court opined more about the law's lack of applicability to the littering problem that it was supposed to resolve, the decision would have been all about the city administration: politics, governance, narrow tailoring ... And it would not have been nearly as useful to homeless advocates. By focusing its entire decision on the law's failure to clearly guide the police and the public, the court got to expound on the purpose of due process.

Writing about the ways that the US Supreme Court has declared vagueness to violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process clause</a>, Judge Harry Pregerson, writing for the Ninth Circuit in this <span class="casename">Desertrain</span> case, brought-up great leading cases about laws impacting homeless life. He pointed to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=640007019052173504">Chicago v. Morales</a>, which struck down Chicago's anti-loitering ordinance because it entitled police to guess whether people who were outside "remain[ed] in any one place with no apparent purpose."

He quoted long sections of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15009844350298299825">Papachristou v. Jacksonville</a>, which invalidated Jacksonville, Florida's vagrancy law because it empowered the police to arbitrarily decide who could stand in a particular place and how long they could stay there. Referring to <span class="casename">Papachristou</span>, in this Los Angeles vehicle dwelling case, Judge Pregerson even summarized <span class="casename">Papachristou's</span> review of the common law history of "poor laws" that were "designed to prevent the physical movement and economic ascension of the lower class."

This is powerful messaging from the bench. Judge Pregerson was not merely showing what vagueness meant, he was reminding all readers and all city governments that people who live in vehicles are poor and exposed, functioning at the mercy and whims police officers. "It is difficult to imagine how anyone loading up his or her car with personal belongings, perhaps to go on a camping trip or donate household wares to the Salvation Army and parking briefly on a Los Angeles street, would know if he or she was violating the statute," he wrote in subtle irony after referencing the Supreme Court cases.

Vacationers and generous donors were not cited or jailed pursuant to Section 85.02. Homeless people were. This is why police need better instructions—not better instructions about how to keep people from living in their cars. They need instructions in the form of ordinances that enable them to fulfill the real mission behind police work: to protect and serve.

What would happen if a city ordinance required police to provide safety patrols at encampments and parking areas where homeless people live? The homeless population would be more secure. Those could be straightforward routine-setting rules that don't rely on discretion at all. Better yet, the city could even designate public parking lots as legitimate places for vehicle dwellers to park for free during non-business hours. By designating such places for this use, a city could efficiently provide related services that it generally makes available to the population: public restrooms and trash receptacles, for instance.

Cities typically have ordinances about the presence and management of trash receptacles in parks and business districts, but those ordinances are made in consideration of minor visitor usage; they could expanded to accommodate users who do not merely visit outdoors but who actually live there.

The <span class="casename">Desertrain</span> decision mentioned human waste dumping. It is easy to imagine why that happens; public buildings with restrooms are locked-up overnight. City and county health ordinances can provide for free-standing outdoor restroom facilities. Some parks already have them. Cities can figure out ways to implement them more widely.

The final paragraph of the <span class="casename">Desertrain</span> decision leaves no doubt about the Ninth Circuit's opinion of Section 85.02. "For many homeless persons, their automobile may be their last major possession—the means by which they can look for work and seek social services." In closing, the court demands unequivocally that the city provide better public service: "The City of Los Angeles has many options at its disposal to alleviate the plight and suffering of its homeless citizens. Selectively preventing the homeless and the poor from using their vehicles for activities many other citizens also conduct in their cars should not be one of those options."

<span class="casename">Desertrain</span> is such a perfect allegorical title for this case. Of course, it is the last name of one of the Plaintiffs, a disabled woman who was supposed to be exempt from tickets related to parking. How fitting that it also evokes the image of refreshing and renewing parched ground.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Roy Gutterman of the Tully Center for Free Speech at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University comments on the recent Supreme Court decision in <span class="casename">Aereo v. American Broadcast Companies</span>, and provides insight into the world of Copyright Law ... </p><strong>T</strong></font>he Supreme Court may have pulled the plug on Aereo, a streaming video system that used cutting-edge technology to capture broadcast television signals, digitize them and send them to subscribers over the internet.  </p>

<p>The 6-3 Supreme Court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16618400009771667111">decision</a> released Wednesday may relegate Aereo to the graveyard of other tech companies whose business models and services were based on practices that infringed on copyrights.  Does anybody remember Napster and Grokster?  (Supreme Court decisions pretty much wiped these two music sharing companies off the map).</p>

<p>The Aereo case is the latest test of the law catching up with technology. The litigation arose after a coalition of television networks sought a preliminary injunction to block Aereo from transmitting the broadcast signals over its digital system. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York denied the request. In 2013, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12238375817816068158">held</a> that Aereo's system did not violate the Copyright Act's transmission rules because it sent the signals to private users. The Second Circuit mostly relied on a previous precedent set in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13763893657469687275">Cartoon Networks  LLP. v. CSC Holdings, Inc.</a>, which afforded protections to DVR technology.  </p>

<p>Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the majority, found that Aereo's capture of copyrighted television broadcasts and subsequent internet streaming was really no different than what cable television does, and that falls under the protections or restrictions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17">Copyright Act</a>.</p>

<p>Breyer's rendition of the facts and explanation of Aereo's technology and how it relates to the Copyright Act provides a clear picture for this highly-complicated and technical topic. The decision is also guarded, with the majority explicitly stating that the precedent should be narrowly applied to the Aereo technology and not future technologies, mainly the developing advances in cloud-based computer storage.</p>

<p>The case drew widespread media attention because of its potential to either rein in new technology as a means of transmitting content or relaxing protections afforded to copyrighted content. </p>

<p>As technology develops, the court has to wrestle with new questions and applications. These become particularly difficult questions because content dissemination can often become an issue regarding the free flow of information and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> values. Though the Aereo case does not venture into the First Amendment area, it is by its very nature a "media law" case&#8212;actually a modern media law case.</p>

<p>New technology requires new application of the law. Over the decades, the Supreme Court has been called to clarify how intellectual property law should be applied to new forms of media whether it was with player pianos, photocopiers, video recorders or peer-to-peer music sharing websites. </p>

<p>Though VCRs are practically a thing of the past, they have largely been replaced by new technologies, including DVRs and cloud storage. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5876335373788447272">Sony v. Universal City Studios</a>, the the Supreme Court famously declared that recording television shows on a VCR (actually Betamax video tape recorders) for private viewing later at home, was a legitimate fair use. </p>

<p>Aereo heavily relied on this decision in both its briefs and at oral arguments, repeatedly comparing its technology and operation to the "time shifting" video recording technology the court deemed a fair use under the Copyright Act. </p>

<p>Aereo's innovative technology employs tiny antennas which capture broadcast television airwaves which are then digitized and distributed to its subscribers who pay a fee to Aereo. The subscribers can then watch the broadcasts on their computers over the internet. This, the television networks argued, violated their copyrights because Aereo did not obtain permission, secure licenses or pay royalties. </p>

<p>The court's opinion does an excellent job explaining this process, the technology and the conflict while applying the law.  The opinion also explains how Aereo's system violated the public performance and transmission definitions under the Copyright Act.</p>

<p>Under the Copyright Act, Justice Breyer writes it "is unmistakable" that Aereo engages in public performance under the Copyright Act. Further, Breyer noted that Aereo has an "overwhelming likeness" to cable companies.</p>

<p>By equating Aereo's retransmission to those of cable television operators, the court makes an important determination, which follows the Copyright Act. Two Supreme Court cable television/copyright decisions <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2403637276941466845">Fortnightly Corp. v United Artists Television</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13012024816130931072">Teleprompter Corp. v. CBS</a> prompted Congress to re-write the Copyright Act to include cable providers as entities that must acquire a license to retransmit broadcasts, which could be easily accomplished through compulsory licenses.  </p>

<p>The comparison to cable television relates to the licensing scheme. Much of the content disseminated by cable companies is the result of highly-negotiated licensing agreements. Read in light of the 1976 amendments to the Copyright Act, roping cable television systems into the law's definitions for public performance and transmission, the court easily applied copyright protection to the works Aereo streamed. </p>

<p>Thus, a transmission of a broadcast is a transmission regardless of whether it is through a broadcast signal and antenna, a coaxial cable or new technological advancements which take the signal from the airwaves, digitizes it and sends it to a subscriber via the internet, as Aereo did.  </p>

<p>At oral arguments in April, and through its briefs, Aereo argued that it simply provided a service and the hardware for subscribers&#8212;the equipment. A number of justices posed skeptical questions.</p>

<p>"The history makes clear that Aereo is not simply an equipment provider. Rather, Aereo, and not just its subscribers 'perform[s]' or ('transmit[s]'). Aereo's activities are substantially similar to those of the CATV companies that Congress amended to the Act to reach," the court wrote.	</p>

<p>The concern that a ruling against Aereo would stifle future technologies or innovations was somewhat muted by the decision. The court explained the narrow application of the decision and how it will not affect future technologies or cases. <br />
Immediately after the decision, Aereo issued a <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101769731#.">statement</a> calling the court's decision "a massive setback for the American consumer" that "sends a chilling message to the technology industry." Aereo had said that an adverse decision would put it out of business. <br />
 <br />
The company's statement concluded: "We are disappointed in the outcome, but our work is not done.  We will continue to fight for our consumers and fight to create innovative technologies that have a meaningful and positive impact on our world."</p>

<p>Every technological innovation that ends up in court requires a new decision, and the court also concluded that: "We cannot now answer more precisely how the Transmit Clause or other provisions of the Copyright Act will apply to technologies not before us," Breyer wrote.</p>

<p>The next decision may be up in the clouds.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Tung Yin of the Lewis & Clark Law School comments on the statement made by Donald Sterling and how the public outcry should give us pause to consider the underlying issues  ... </p><strong>U</strong></font>nless you've been completely avoiding TV, the Internet, newspapers, magazines and likely your family members and colleagues, it's hard not to have heard about Donald Sterling, the soon-to-be-ex(?)-owner of the Los Angeles Clippers. Sterling <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/sports/basketball/nba-clippers-owner-donald-sterling.html?hpw&rref=sports">made comments in private</a> to his mistress that might charitably be described as offensive and bigoted. Apparently unknown to Sterling, his mistress, V. Stiviano, was tape-recording the conversation, and someone later leaked that recording to the mass media. Public outrage erupted immediately, and four days later, NBA commissioner Adam Silver delivered harsh justice, banning Sterling for life and fining him $2.5 million.</p>

<p>Thereafter, provocative talk show host Bill Maher, among others, pushed back against the conventional wisdom. Without defending Sterling's actual comments (who could?), Maher <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/10/bill-maher-donald-sterling_n_5301576.html">expressed concern</a> about the privacy implications of the public flogging of a person for comments made privately: "So let me get this straight, we should concede that there's no such thing anymore as a private conversation, so therefore remember to 'lawyer' everything you say before you say it, and hey, speaking your mind was overrated anyway, so you won't miss it. Well, I'll miss it, I'll miss it a lot."</p>

<p>CNN political analyst Marc Lamont Hill <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/marc-lamont-hill-bill-maher-is-wrong-to-defend-donald-sterling/">jumped in</a>, making the correct but rather legalistic point that this was not a free speech issue, because Sterling was free to say what he did; he just wasn't free from the inevitable public consequences flowing from public disgust over what he said. The NBA surely didn't have to stand by helplessly while Sterling unwittingly, but definitely, set fire to a rising basketball franchise simply because of some principle of "free speech."</p>

<p>While Maher's rant did rely in part on the notion of free speech, I think Hill overlooked the more subtle and difficult point that Maher was raising. Whether the NBA could and should have sanctioned Sterling once the offensive statements became public was a separate issue from whether society should condone the public disclosure of a private conversation without the consent of the speaker, at least in the absence of potential legal sanctions or administrative investigations for which the statements might be evidence but not the violations themselves.</p>

<p>In one way, we can perhaps say that the state of California has already determined that recordings of such private conversations should not be disclosed in such circumstances, having made it a state crime <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=630-638">to record a conversation without the consent of all parties</a>; note, however, that California is in the minority of states in enacting a "two-party consent" rule, as the federal government and 38 states require only that one party to the conversation consent to the recording. Yet, eavesdropping and wiretapping laws do not fully answer Maher's point, because (1) that something is not illegal does not mean it is something that ought to be done; and (2) the recording of the conversation in some ways distracts from the fact of the conversation&#8212;that is, the only difference between what happened and an alternate scenario where Stiviano did not record the conversation but disclosed her own recollection of it to the press is evidentiary in that the recording would be more credible than Stiviano's testimony.</p>

<p>Once we put the issue of the recording aside, we can see that the concern that Maher and others have raised is really akin to the mixed feelings that we may have about "tattling," or if you prefer, whistleblowing. On the one hand, without the tattletale, we might never learn about the misdeeds of other persons. Obviously, the gravity of the misdeed influences how we grateful are to hear about it, even if "it" concerns private speech.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, the critical role that informants and undercover agents play in revealing incriminating statements that criminal targets make in seemingly private conversations. Sometimes the informant or undercover agent will be wearing a wire, and thus law enforcement will get a true audio recording of the conversation (just like Stiviano's recording of Sterling's comments). In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4585081187464273960">Hoffa v. United States</a>, the U.S. Supreme Court suggested that it not only tolerated but actually approved of such investigative approaches, because any notion of privacy that the defendant might have expected was merely illusory and the result of "a wrongdoer's misplaced belief that a person to whom he voluntarily confides his wrongdoing will not reveal it."</p>

<p>Of course, <span class="casename">Hoffa</span> dealt with the scope of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a>, whose restrictions apply only to government actors, not private individuals like Stiviano and the NBA. But the underlying theme of <span class="casename">Hoffa</span>&#8212;buyer beware in terms of who you are speaking to&#8212;is reflected broadly in criminal law, most notably in American conspiracy law. One of the reasons that statements made by co-conspirators during and in furtherance of the conspiracy is <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_801">not hearsay</a> and is therefore generally admissible evidence against all conspirators is that such an evidentiary approach destabilizes conspiracies, <a href="http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/March-April-2003/review_marapr03_katyal.msp">forcing conspirators to waste energies monitoring one another</a>. </p>

<p>But there is an important difference between statements in furtherance of criminal conspiracies versus Sterling's offensive and bigoted directives to his mistress. If would-be criminal conspirators are deterred from making crime-facilitating statements in private, that is a pleasant side-effect of, but not the main reason for society's tolerance (if not encouragement) of the public disclosure of such statements. Rather, such disclosure helps achieve the goal of enforcing criminal law by producing relevant, inculpatory evidence that might otherwise not be obtained through other traditional investigative methods. The same is true in the civil arena, where a private conversation might be probative of a civil litigant's state of mind; for example, a racist or bigoted comment might well be relevant evidence in an employment discrimination lawsuit&#8212;again, furthering the goal of enforcing civil law.</p>

<p>What should give us pause about the disclosure in Sterling's situation is that the leaked recording doesn't seem to have been relevant to any pending lawsuit. It certainly revealed him to have made offensive and bigoted statements (and in that sense certainly worthy of the public condemnation he's received). But if the only end purpose of the leak has been to subject him to such obloquy, we can easily imagine situations in which analogous disclosure would be a decidedly bad outcome. Consider the underlying issue in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4515566352758049665">NAACP v. Alabama</a>, where the state of Alabama sought to compel disclosure of the local NAACP affiliate's membership list. In rejecting the state's argument, the Supreme Court noted that "[i]nviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs." No doubt part of the court's concern was that public disclosure of the membership list could subject the members to physical harm, but even without the threat of violence, the court anticipated "economic reprisal, loss of employment, . . . and other manifestations of public hostility," which sounds awfully similar to what Sterling has suffered.</p>

<p>We may already live in a world where (mostly) celebrities and politicians should worry about whether every private conversation might be leaked, including in recorded form, simply to entertain, titillate or shock the public. Several years ago, actor Alec Baldwin suffered the ignominy of having a "volcanic tirade of threats and insults on his 11-year-old daughter" leaked to TMZ, which <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2007/04/22/alecs-threatening-message/">gleefully released</a> the recording. Others who have felt such betrayals include <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg1RU35ynf0&feature=player_embedded">Mel Gibson</a>, David Hasselhoff and Tiger Woods. While public condemnation and/or economic boycott of the offending speaker is quite understandable, perhaps some measure of outrage should also be directed at the leakers (and in Sterling's case, surreptitious recorder) where the only apparent goal is to subject the speaker to public ridicule.</p>

		<title>Will Supremes Apply Cell Phone Privacy to Metadata Collection?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Contributing Editor Marjorie Cohn of the Thomas Jefferson School of Law discusses some of the possible implications of the Supreme Court's recent decision on cell phone searches  ... </p><strong>I</strong></font>n one of the most significant <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> rulings ever <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-warrant-required-to-search-arrestees-cell-phone.php">handed down</a> by the Supreme Court, all nine justices agreed in an opinion involving two companion  cases, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-132_8l9c.pdf">Riley v. California</a> [PDF] and <span class="casename">United States v. Wurie</span>, that police generally need a warrant before reading data on the cell phone of an arrestee. This decision may well presage how the court will rule on the constitutionality of the National Security Agency (NSA) metadata collection program when that issue inevitably comes before it.</p>

<p><strong>Warrants Needed to Search Cell Phone Data</strong></p>

<p>There has always been a preference for search warrants when the police conduct a Fourth Amendment search or seizure. But, over the years, the court has carved out certain exceptions to the warrant requirement, including the search incident to a lawful arrest. The 1969 case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7674807914957393039">Chimel v. California</a> defined the parameters of this exception. Upon a lawful arrest, police can search the person of the arrestee and areas within his immediate control from which he could secure a weapon or destroy evidence. Four years later, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5387812968771120977">United States v. Robinson</a>, the court confirmed that the search incident to a lawful arrest is a bright-line rule. These types of searches will not be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. If the arrest is lawful, a search incident to it needs no further justification. It does not matter whether the officer is concerned in a given case that the arrestee might be armed or destroy evidence. </p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Riley/Wurie</span>, the court declined to apply the search incident to a lawful arrest exception to searches of data contained on an arrestee's cell phone. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court that the dual rationales for applying the exception to the search of physical objects&#8212;protecting officers and preventing destruction of evidence&#8212;do not apply to the digital content on cell phones: "There are no comparable risks when the search is of digital data."</p>

<p>Moreover, "[m]odern cell phones, as a category," Roberts noted, "implicate privacy concerns far beyond those implicated by the search of a cigarette pack, a wallet, or a purse." Responding to the government's assertion that a search of cell phone data is "materially indistinguishable" from searches of physical items, Roberts quipped, "That is like saying a ride on horseback is materially indistinguishable from a flight to the moon." Indeed, Roberts observed, the search of a cell phone would typically provide the government with even more personal information than the search of a home, an area that has traditionally been given the strongest privacy protection. Modern cell phones, Roberts wrote, "are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy." Roberts was referring to the ubiquitous presence of cell phones appended to our ears as we walk down the street. </p>

<p>But the court held that while a warrant is usually required to search data on an arrestee's cell phone, officers could rely on the exigent circumstances exception in appropriate cases. For example, when a suspect is texting an accomplice who is preparing to detonate a bomb, or a child abductor may have information about the child's location on his cell phone, or circumstances suggest the phone will be the target of an imminent attempt to erase the data on it, police may dispense with a search warrant. </p>

<p><strong>Metadata Collection Implicates Similar Privacy Concerns</strong></p>

<p>The <span class="casename">Riley/Wurie</span> opinion provides insights into how the court will decide other digital-era privacy issues. Roberts was concerned that "[a]n Internet search and browsing history, for example, can be found on an Internet-enabled phone and could reveal an individual's private interests or concerns&#8212;perhaps a search for certain symptoms of disease, coupled with frequent visits to WebMD." The Chief Justice could have been describing the NSA metadata collection program, which requires telecommunications companies to produce all of our telephone communications every day. Although the government claims it does not read the content of those communications, it does monitor the identities of the sender and recipient, and the date, time, duration, place and unique identifiers of the communication. As Roberts pointed out in the cell phone case, much can be learned from this data. Calls to a clinic that performs abortions or visits to a gay website can reveal intimate details about a person's private life. A URL, such as www.webMD.com/depression, can contain significant information, even without examining the content. Whether we access the Internet with our cell phones, or with our computers, the same privacy considerations are implicated.</p>

<p>Roberts quoted Justice Sonia Sotomayor's concurrence in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-1259.pdf">United States v. Jones</a> [PDF], the case in which the court held that a warrant is generally required before police install and monitor a GPS tracking device on a car. Sotomayor wrote, "GPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person's public movements that reflects a wealth of detail about her familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations." US District Court Judge Richard J. Leon also cited that concurrence by Sotomayor in his 2013 decision that the metadata collection probably violates the Fourth Amendment (<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=485733189267613105">Klayman v. Obama</a>).</p>

<p>And both Roberts and Leon distinguished the cell phone search and metadata collection, respectively, from the 1979 case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3033726127475530815">Smith v. Maryland</a>, in which the court held that no warrant is required for a telephone company to use a pen register to identify numbers dialed by a particular caller. The <span class="casename">Smith</span> Court concluded that a pen register was not a Fourth Amendment "search," and therefore the police did not need to use a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement. In order to constitute a "search," a person must have a reasonable expectation of privacy that is violated. The court said in <span class="casename">Smith</span> that a person does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in numbers dialed from a phone since he voluntarily transmits them to a third party&#8212;the phone company. </p>

<p>Roberts stated in <span class="casename">Riley/Wurie</span>: "There is no dispute here that the officers engaged in a search of Wurie's cell phone." Likewise, Leon wrote that the issue of "whether a pen register constitutes a 'search' is a far cry from the issue in the [metadata collection] case." Leon added, "When do present-day circumstances&#8212;the evolution of the government's surveillance capabilities, citizens' phone habits, and the relationship between the NSA and the telecom companies&#8212;become so thoroughly unlike those considered by the Supreme Court thirty-four years ago that a precedent like <span class="casename">Smith</span> simply does not apply? The answer, unfortunately for the Government, is now." </p>

<p>If the court is consistent in its analysis, it will determine that the collection by the government of all of our electronic records implicates the same privacy concerns as the inspection of the data on our cell phones. It remains to be seen if and when the metadata collection issue comes before the court. But the fact that the cell phone decision was 9-0 is a strong indication that all of the justices, regardless of ideology, are deeply concerned about protecting the privacy of our electronic communications.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.militarylawpro.com/profile.html">Raymond J. Toney</a> of the <a href="http://www.militarylawpro.com/">Law Offices of Raymond J. Toney</a> discusses the case for Amnesty for soldiers with PTSD who received other than honorable discharges...</p>

                <p>The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan saw the participation of more than two million American service members. Over 6,500 died and more than 50,000 were <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/casualty.pdf">wounded</a> [PDF]. Those statistics do not include the tens of thousands more who suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a disorder characterized by behavior changes, sometimes extreme. Common <a href="http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/problems/index.asp">manifestations</a> of the condition include aggression, impulsivity, hyper-vigilance and substance abuse. The VA <a href="http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/PTSD-overview/reintegration/overview-mental-health-effects.asp">estimates</a> that up to 18 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffer from PTSD. The American Journal of Public Health reported <a href="http://www.apha.org/about/news/ajphreleases/2012/marchsup2012release.htm">findings</a> that 39 percent of returning veterans abuse alcohol. Many, undoubtedly, if not most, are self-medicating, a recipe for disaster. Alcohol abuse is <a href="http://ncadd.org/index.php/learn-about-alcohol/alcohol-and-crime">strongly correlated</a> with criminal conduct. </p>

                <p>Studies <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/12/10/249739845/for-veterans-bad-paper-is-a-catch-22-for-treatment">indicate</a> that more than 100,000 veterans have been discharged from the military since 2001 with highly prejudicial service characterizations of "Under Other Than Honorable Conditions" (OTH), typically for "commission of a serious offense" or a "pattern of misconduct" while in uniform. It is unknown how many of those veterans suffer from PTSD or whether the condition influenced the behavior that resulted in their discharge. Scientific <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-244X-10-88.pdf">studies</a>  [PDF] and anecdotal evidence, however, demonstrate a strong correlation between untreated or under treated PTSD and misconduct discharges. </p>

                <p>The cost to veterans of an OTH discharge is exceptionally high. Those who received an OTH discharge are <a href="http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/resources/publications/IB10-448_other_than_honorable_discharges_061713.pdf">generally barred</a> [PDF] from receiving VA benefits such as medical care and disability compensation and lose access to generous benefits under the GI Bill and other federal law provisions. An OTH discharge also can be a serious <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/12/09/249342610/other-than-honorable-discharge-burdens-like-a-scarlet-letter">barrier</a> to meaningful employment. </p>

                <p>The Army now acknowledges that misconduct may be the product of psychiatric injury. As <a href="https://rdl.train.army.mil/catalog/view/100.ATSC/AF18AF6D-7DFB-4CA4-BE78-8D0A5FEDF993-1274316004566/6-22.5/toc.htm#toc">noted</a> in Army Field Manual 6-22.5, "Combat and Operational Stress Control Manual for Leaders and Soldiers:"</p>

                <blockquote>Although war affects all soldiers, most make a successful transition home after combat duty. Some soldiers, however, experience persistent symptoms such as sleep disturbance, hyper vigilance, detachment, anger <strong>or risky behaviors such as alcohol misuse or aggression</strong>. These problems can seriously affect their military duty and Family functioning if not addressed early. </blockquote>

                <p>A 2012 <a href="http://usarmy.vo.llnwd.net/e2/c/downloads/235822.pdf">report</a> [PDF] of the Army, "Army 2020: Generating Health and Discipline in the Force Ahead of the Strategic Reset," recognizes that:</p>

                <blockquote>One of the most important lessons the Army has learned is that many health and disciplinary issues, ranging from post traumatic stress (PTS) to illicit drug use to suicide, are interrelated. To view soldier misconduct in isolation, for example, fails to capture <strong>the real likelihood that the misconduct was related to an untreated physical or behavioral health condition, such as increased aggression associated with PTSD or depression</strong>.</blockquote>

                <p>Special "veterans courts," a growing response to crimes committed by veterans suffering from PTSD and its correlates, such as alcohol and drug abuse, also recognize the role the condition plays in criminal conduct and seek alternatives to simple incarceration for veterans. The programs <a href="https://d3gqux9sl0z33u.cloudfront.net/AA/AT/gambillingonjustice-com/downloads/205863/Veterans_Courts-Law_Article_Widener_Law_School.pdf">seem to be working</a> [PDF].   </p>

                <p>Such recognition, however, has not reached the military administrative boards authorized to change veterans' discharge characterizations. There are two such boards&#8212;the Discharge Review Boards (DRBs) and the Boards for the Correction of Military Records (BCMRs)&#8212;within each branch of the military. Veterans who received OTH discharges typically apply first to the DRBs and if no relief is received, as most often is the case, then to the BCNRs. The authority of both boards to grant relief is very broad. Although Congress granted the boards wide discretion to rewrite an applicant's military history, in practice they exercise that discretion sparingly. </p>

                <p>A recent <a href="http://yalelawjournal.org/article/in-need-of-correction-how-the-army-board-for-correction-of-military-records-is-failing-veterans-with-ptsd">article</a> in the Yale Law Journal  noted that the Army BCMR had approved only 2 of 145 discharge upgrade applications from Vietnam veterans with PTSD. The article further noted the disingenuous approach of the Army BCMR in denying those applications:  the veterans presented no evidence that they were diagnosed with PTSD prior to their discharge. Yet the Army BCMR is fully aware that PTSD was not established as a psychiatric diagnosis until 1980, nearly eight years after the withdrawal of US combat troops from Vietnam. </p>

                <p>The present author's own review, part of a comprehensive study presently underway, of Army DRB applications from Iraq and Afghanistan-era veterans claiming PTSD is producing similar findings. For this article, thirty-four applications from the years 2009-2013 were selected from more than 300. All involved discharges for misconduct. Acknowledgement by the Army DRB of the actual diagnosis of PTSD, typically by the VA, was the sole criteria for selection. Applications were excluded in which veterans asserted a PTSD diagnosis, but apparently provided no supporting evidence. </p>

                <p>Of the thirty-four applications reviewed, the Army DRB did not grant a single application based on PTSD. The language of the Board in case number <a href="http://boards.law.af.mil/ARMY_DRB.htm">AR20090008585</a> is representative of its approach to PTSD claims: "this medical condition did not overcome the reason for discharge and characterization of service granted and the Applicant fully understood the difference between right and wrong when he committed the misconduct that caused the unit commander to initiate the separation action." In AR20110021138, the Board concluded, "just because the applicant suffers from PTSD does not mean he didn't know the difference between right and wrong or that he did not have control over his behavior." Similarly, in AR20130009988, the Board concluded, "[i]t appears the applicant's chain of command determined that although he was suffering from PTSD, he knew the difference between what was right and what was wrong as indicated by the mental status evaluation. Further, there are many Soldiers with the same condition that completed their service successfully." </p>

                <p>The Board granted five of the thirty-four decisions reviewed. Four were granted due to procedural errors in the discharge process, and one was based on the length of the applicant's honorable service. In no case did the Board acknowledge that PTSD contributed to the misconduct that resulted in discharge. </p>

                <p>In effect, the Army DRB is applying the evidentiary standard of the defense of insanity. The federal version of that standard, found at 18 US Code Section 17(a), requires a defendant to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he, "as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts." Yet 10 US Code Section 1553 and Army Regulation 15-180, which govern the DRB, do not create such a high standard, which is utterly inconsistent with the remedial nature of the Army DRB. </p>

                <p>The unwillingness of the Army DRB to accept a causal relationship between PTSD and misconduct underscores the need for a better remedy. While bills in various forms have been introduced in Congress addressing PTSD, none has brought relief to the veterans with PTSD who received OTH discharges. The most effective solution resides with the Commander-in-Chief who by executive order may instruct the military secretaries to receive and grant all applications from veterans with OTH discharges for misconduct who prove service-connected PTSD. In many instances, proof will come from the VA, and in others, from private psychiatrists and psychologists. Presidents have used Executive Orders to implement the amnesty granted to Vietnam-era draft evaders (<a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/11967.html">Exec. Order 11967</a>) and to desegregate the Armed Forces (<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/history/35th/thelaw/eo-8802.html">Exec. Order 8802</a>). </p>

                <p>Opponents of such a measure would argue that granting honorable discharges to veterans who engaged in misconduct would diminish the value of honorable discharges generally. Yet the argument evades the very point made by the Army: the real likelihood that the misconduct resulted from PTSD, whether or not it was diagnosed during military service. And it avoids the compelling argument that soldiers sent into battle should be given the benefit of the doubt afterward, if not shown a good measure of compassion. The Army DRB clearly is unwilling to do so, so the Commander-in-Chief should. </p>

		<title>Second Circuit Undermines Judicial Independence and Agency Accountability</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://tewary.com/about_us.htm">Akshat Tewary</a> of the <a href="http://tewary.com/index.htm">Law Offices of Kamlesh Tewary</a> discusses Judicial Independence and Agency Accountability in reference to SEC v. Citigroup...</p>

                <p>The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recently issued a <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1668853.html">ruling</a> that could debilitate the ability of the judiciary to serve as an independent arbiter of federal agency action. Ostensibly titled <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16953396783676156553">SEC v. Citigroup</a>, the case actually pitted both the enforcement agency and the mega-bank against an outspoken judge from the Southern District of New York, Jed Rakoff. At issue in the case was whether Judge Rakoff had been correct in delaying judicial confirmation of a consent decree entered into by both parties.</p>

                <p>The proposed consent decree related to alleged malfeasance by Citigroup, which, according to the SEC, negligently misled investors while earning a tidy profit of $160 million in the process. Citigroup marketed to investors a billion-dollar fund called Class V Funding III, asserting that the fund's portfolio was chosen by an independent investment advisor. In actuality, the Commission alleges, Citigroup itself had picked many of the assets in the fund and, in fact, took bets against the credit-worthiness of those very assets.  </p>

                <p>This sort of duplicitous conduct was rife in the run-up to the Great Recession of 2008, leading Congress to pass <a href="http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/dodd-frank/assetbackedsecurities.shtml">Section 621</a> of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which authorized the SEC to implement regulations prohibiting such conflicts of interest in the structuring of securitization deals. In the Class V Funding III matter, the SEC's legal theory was that Citigroup had violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.</p>

                <p>Bipartisan government commissions have <a href="http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/report">recognized</a>  that bank malfeasance played a significant role in causing the recent financial crisis, which had catastrophic consequences for the average American: from 2007 to 2010, the median net worth of families dropped by a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/fed-americans-wealth-dropped-40-percent/2012/06/11/gJQAlIsCVV_story.html">jaw-dropping 40 percent</a>. Naturally, there has been a strong public appetite for redress, one manifestation of which was nascence of the Occupy Wall Street movement in September 2011.</p>

                <p>The Citigroup enforcement action, like so many others arising out of the financial crisis, should have been a slam-dunk for the SEC. Sadly in this and other cases, the Commission repeatedly dropped the ball. For any number of reasons ranging from budgetary restrictions to <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-capture.asp">regulatory capture</a>, the Commission has taken a tepid approach to pursuing enforcement actions against the banks and other financial institutions that contributed to the crisis. Even in the most blatant cases of wrongdoing, the Commission has established a practice of settling with the offending bank for a paltry sum and allowing the offender to "neither admit nor deny" culpability for the misconduct.  </p>

                <p>The Class V Funding III investigation followed the same pattern. Even though Citigroup had engaged in arguably criminal conduct that netted the bank $160 million in profits, the SEC did not refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal enforcement. Instead, the Commission was content with settling the matter with Citigroup in exchange for:</p>

                <blockquote>a) a permanent injunction from future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the 1933 Act;</blockquote>

                <blockquote>b) promises by Citigroup to implement internal changes to avoid similar actions in the future;</blockquote>

                <blockquote>c)disgorgement of the $160 million in ill-gotten gains;</blockquote>

                <blockquote>d) interest of $30 million; and</blockquote>

                <blockquote>e) a penalty of $95 million.</blockquote>

                <p>To many <a href="http://wallstreetonparade.com/2014/06/the-untold-story-of-why-judge-jed-rakoff-took-on-the-sec%E2%80%99s-shady-deal-with-citigroup/">observers</a>  of the financial markets, this deal amounted to little more than a proverbial "slap on the wrist." The permanent injunction component of this settlement deal was particularly risible: presumably Citigroup would have been bound by the 1933 Act even without the injunction. Equally laughable was the promise by the bank to implement changes to its business to avoid similar actions. Citigroup has actually made the same promise in <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2011-11-02/citigroup-finds-obeying-the-law-is-too-darn-hard-jonathan-weil">several prior enforcement actions</a>, and one suspects, will make similar empty promises in future enforcement proceedings.</p>

                <p>The total settlement amount of $285 million <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/judge-rejects-sec-citigroup-settlement/2011/11/28/gIQA8KsH5N_story.html">paled in comparison</a>  to the $700 million lost by investors in the deal, or the quarterly profit of $3.8 billion enjoyed by Citigroup at the time. Citigroup could easily dismiss the $95 million penalty as the mere "cost of doing business," given that it amounted to an infinitesimal 2.5 percent of profits earned in one quarter.</p>

                <p>The Commission could have been content with gifting Citigroup this sweetheart deal and policing any noncompliance under its administrative enforcement process. Instead, the agency applied for the SDNY to confirm the settlement in the form of a consent decree. Courts have in the past, routinely confirmed such proposed consent decrees and the Commission likely expected a similar outcome before the SDNY.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately for the agency, Judge Jed Rakoff was assigned the case. Rakoff had previously held the Commission's feet to the fire for entering into a similarly lopsided settlement in the case of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/08/07/us-bankofamerica-sec-idUSTRE57555A20090807">SEC v. Bank of America Corp</a>. In that action, Bank of America agreed to pay $33 million in settlement, without admitting any culpability, for alleged misconduct relating to the payment of $5.8 billion in banker bonuses after its takeover of Merrill Lynch &#38; Co. In 2003, Rakoff had similarly been critical of a $500 million settlement proposed by the SEC over accounting fraud at WorldCom Inc.</p>

                <p>Rakoff rejected the Citigroup settlement in <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/SECCITI11282011.pdf">eloquent fashion</a> [PDF], setting a trial date for an exposition of the facts underlying the deal:</p>

                <blockquote>[W]hen a public agency asks a court to become its partner in enforcement by imposing wide-ranging injunctive remedies on a defendant, enforced by the formidable judicial power of contempt, the court, and the public, need some knowledge of what the underlying facts are: for otherwise, the court becomes a mere handmaiden to a settlement privately negotiated on the basis of unknown facts, while the public is deprived of ever knowing the truth in a matter of obvious public importance.</blockquote>

                <p>Rakoff expressed the common-sense concern that enforcement actions have no deterrent effect when the penalty for misconduct, like the $95 million "contrivance" proposed by the SEC and Citigroup, is negligible. Particularly irksome to Rakoff was the fact that the settlement deal did not require Citigroup to admit to any material facts, in the absence of which Rakoff could not "exercise even a modest degree of independent judgment."</p>

                <p>The decision sent shockwaves throughout the legal and financial community. In what once commenter has called the "Rakoff effect," the SDNY Citigroup decision emboldened others in the judiciary to decline to rubber-stamp proposed agency consent decrees and instead, demand the presentation of underlying facts.</p>

                <p>The Commission fought back against the decision quite vigorously (exhibiting a rare solicitude that might have been better utilized in actual enforcement efforts). The agency immediately filed an interlocutory appeal with the Second Circuit seeking a stay of Rakoff's order. Citigroup joined ranks with the SEC on the appeal. The appeal attracted significant media attention and no fewer than ten interest groups filed amicus briefs in the case. In an unusual step, the court appointed an attorney to represent Judge Rakoff's position, given that both the SEC and Citigroup were on the same side on the interlocutory appeal.</p>

                <p>After deliberating over the case for more than a year, the Second Circuit finally overturned and sharply rebuked Judge Rakoff's decision. While conceding that a district court need not "rubber stamp" proposed agency settlements, the Second Circuit held that Rakoff failed to afford due deference to the SEC's discretionary authority to settle on terms of its choosing.</p>

                <p>While declining to delineate the precise contours of what could generally constitute a factual record sufficient to justify confirmation of a proposed settlement, the court nevertheless held that in this particular case Judge Rakoff likely had enough information to rule on the Citigroup consent degree. He should not have set a trial date to gather further information regarding the proposed settlement.</p>

                <p>Tellingly, the court held that in such cases the "primary focus of the inquiry ... should be on ensuring that the consent decree is <strong>procedurally proper</strong>," and further concluded that "[i]t is not within the district court's purview to demand 'cold, hard, solid facts, established either by admissions or by trials'" before deciding on a proposed agency settlement. The court remanded the case to Judge Rakoff for review under this revised standard.</p>

                <p>Under the precedent established by the Second Circuit in this case, district courts are to be relegated to rubber&#8212;stamping proposed settlement <em>so long as</em> the correct forms have been filed and the right boxes have been ticked. It is a sad day in American jurisprudence when a court of appeals restricts a district court's capacity to engage in fact-finding, given that that has historically been the lower court's very purview. The decision also raises Separation of Power concerns; by undermine the capacity of the judiciary to demand that administrative agencies explain their actions.<br />
                    <br />
                    True, agencies have historically enjoyed a broad swathe of judicial latitude over substantive decisions, under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/467/837">Chevron</a> line of cases. However, Judge Rakoff's order plainly was not a substantive rejection of the Citigroup settlement. Rather, it was merely a request (albeit a sharply-worded one) for the parties to present further evidence surrounding the settlement during a trial. The Citigroup decision renders the SEC free to continue its practice of entering into middling enforcement settlements, all the while leaving the public in the dark about what exactly goes on behind that agency's closed doors.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://law.pitt.edu/people/full-time-faculty/haider-ala-hamoudi">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law discusses Grand Ayatollah Sisani's call for jihad against ISIS in Iraq ... </p><strong>A</strong></font>s has been widely discussed, Grand Ayatollah Sistani recently <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27834462">issued</a> a call for jihad against the terrorist organization currently rampaging throughout much of Iraq, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ("ISIS," recently renamed the Islamic State). This call, however well intentioned, is not likely to be the solution to Iraq's problems and may in fact create more problems than it solves. The reason is not, as is commonly stated, that it will contribute to rising sectarianism in Iraq. In fact, Grand Ayatollah Sistani's call was phrased as ecumenically as it could be. It urged all Iraqis, and not merely Iraq's Shi'a, to join this jihad, though admittedly it is unlikely that significant numbers of non-Shi'a Iraqis would heed such a call. More importantly, the Grand Ayatollah made clear that volunteers should join the army itself rather than fight on behalf of any one of the numerous sectarian militias active in Iraq. </p>

<p>The problem, instead, is that the call to jihad operates on the principles of jihad long established among jurists operating in the Muslim tradition, and it hardly seems fitting for the type of modern warfare in which Iraq is currently engaged. As a result, it is not a solution to the real military problems with which Iraq is faced. To understand why, it is important to review the historic rules respecting jihad as jurists have laid them out.</p>

<p>Essentially, the call to a jihad relies on a conception of warfare wherein a significant number of free adult males who are not professional soldiers are engaged in most of the fighting. Hence, a leader of some sort (in the ideal case, a caliph in the Sunni tradition, and an Imam in the Shi'a one) issues a call for fighters. The obligation then lies on the community as a whole to supply the number of fighters that the leader needs to prosecute the contemplated military action. Once sufficient numbers are reached, the obligation is discharged. Certain individuals are prevented from joining the jihad in most circumstances, including the mentally ill, those in debt, slaves and those with insufficient loyalty to the state. The purpose of the call to jihad, then, is to supply the soldiers necessary to fight a war. Such a conception was not a wholly unrealistic state of affairs throughout much of history, including the US, where wars were generally fought until recently by little trained nonprofessionals called into service either voluntarily or through a draft. <br />
 <br />
The problem, however, is that contemporary warfare generally requires a standing, extensively trained professional army with the significant administrative and organizational capacities this demands. The ability to call together tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals with light weapons such as AK-47's and even rocket propelled grenades is far less important than the existence of well trained and well equipped soldiers who are aware of how to fight a war with technological sophistication. To be sure, manpower is hardly irrelevant, and states with smaller populations often do maintain an active reserve to ensure adequate numbers of soldiers. But even in such a case, the reserves are trained and have their training updated repeatedly over time, so as to ensure that when and if they are called, they are able to serve as an effective fighting force.  </p>

<p>In fact, the recent stunning victories of ISIS throughout much of Iraq demonstrate this well. By most media estimates, ISIS and its allies command no more than 10,000 soldiers. However, they are battle hardened, well trained and decently equipped. Iraq's army, by contrast, exceeds 200,000 soldiers. If such an army can neither hold significant parts of its territory, and by most assessments is unlikely to be able to get back most of that which it has lost, then the problem will hardly be solved by more volunteers. This is the equivalent of supplying more teachers to a failing school where funds are being siphoned off to the personal accounts of administrators, cafeterias are substandard and many staff seem to be absent regularly without consequence. No matter how eager or dedicated the new employees, their entry into the failing system will inevitably prove destructive to their own morale and ineffective at improving the school.</p>

<p>Indeed, the comparison of Iraq's army to a failing school may be charitable. Reports are rife of corruption, cronyism and the emasculating of the military in an effort to render it "coup proof." It fled numerous posts without so much as a fight against a force it greatly outnumbered. Under such conditions, more volunteers have not proven helpful. Some recent eager recruits were left literally without food for days guarding a border post. Others, untrained and unaware of how to travel on unprotected roads properly, were ambushed and killed. There is little to be gained by a recruit joining such a hapless force, where starvation and pointless death seem almost as likely as actual engagement with the enemy.  </p>

<p>To be fair, Grand Ayatollah Sistani has attempted to address these root problems as best as he can. He has urged Iraqi parliamentarians to speed their formation of a new and inclusive Iraqi government, and he has spoken out endlessly against corruption and cronyism. He is neither general nor president, and cannot be blamed if Iraq's ruling classes seem impervious to these calls. Still, the call to jihad is not helpful, and emblematic of the ossified thinking that prevails in the juristic academies, where adherence to tradition is greatly valued, while independent, original and unconventional thought is not. Little consideration has been given, or could be given, to means by which to revamp and reconsider principles and rules of warfare entirely in modern conditions in such an environment. This is but one example of the way in which traditional juristic rules seem ill equipped to deal with modern problems.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the call to jihad is being heeded by masses of Iraq's downtrodden and desperate population, partly because of its historic resonance and juristic pedigree, and partly because it is the greatest opportunity for Iraq's ordinary citizens to do something to stem the tide of violence and terrorism destroying their land.  It is all the more tragic that with the best of intentions, this contribution seems likely to lead only to even more loss of life.</p>

		<title>The Use of Force Against ISIS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Bilal Khan discusses the legal implications of the use of force against ISIS in IRAQ...</p>

                <p><u>The Factual Background</U></p>

                <p>The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) made headlines in June, when it escalated its offensives in Iraq. By June 10, it had captured Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, followed by Tikrit, Rawa, Ana and Al-Qaim. It now controls border crossings with Syria, and pledges to march on Baghdad. Its aim: to forcibly establish a state across the region.</p>

                <p>ISIS has a stronghold in Syria, where it controls large areas including eastern Aleppo and Raqqa, as well as oil and gas fields. With assets worth an alleged $2 billion, ISIS has little difficulty recruiting personnel or obtaining weaponry.  </p>

                <p>Iraq has taken steps to combat ISIS within its own territory, with limited US assistance. Talk abounds of the prospect of US-led military strikes across the border. When policy makers consider their options, it is essential to consider this question: <em>how are the international legal rules governing the use of force to be applied to military action against ISIS in Iraq and/or Syria.</em></p>

                <p><u>The Prohibition of Force</u></p>

                <p>The heart of the rules on the use of force is <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml">Article 2(4)</a>  of the United Nations Charter. This prohibits the "threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State". Recognized as <em>jus cogens</em>, states cannot derogate from Article 2(4). The only widely accepted exceptions to the prohibition are Chapter VII action by the Security Council and the right of self-defense (this article considers the latter).</p>

                <p>Before looking at exceptions, a logically prior question is whether intervention in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi Government would engage Article 2(4) at all. Iraq as a sovereign State has the right to ask others for assistance in order to repel non-state actors (NSAs) within its own territory. Such action will not offend Iraq's territorial integrity or political independence. Article 20 of the ILC's <a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft%20articles/9_6_2001.pdf">Articles on State Responsibility</a>  [PDF] provides: "Valid consent by a State to the commission of a given act by another State precludes the wrongfulness of that act ... to the extent that the act remains within the limits of that consent".</p>

                <p>That provides a legal basis for the use of force <strong>within</strong> Iraqi territory, but only if one assumes a purely internal armed conflict. A significant locus of the ISIS threat and source of current attacks is arguably Syria. What if the battle is taken across the border? The use of force on Syrian territory without the Syrian Government's consent will <em>prima facie</em> infringe its territorial integrity and entail a breach of Article 2(4). The only justification for such action would be self-defense, which in the writer's view affords a more appropriate characterization for Iraqi and allied actions both inside and outside Iraq. </p>

                <p><u>The Law of self-defense</u> </p>

                <p>Article 51 of the UN Charter provides: <br />
                <blockquote>"Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs..."</blockquote></p>

                <p>Article 51 was not intended to delineate the scope of self-defense, but rather to affirm its continuation post-1945 and safeguard regional security arrangements. Further, as confirmed by the ICJ, the content of self-defense is influenced by customary international law. Custom, in turn, depends on evolving State practice, and so the right is not static.</p>

                <p>Today, there are three requirements:<br />
                <blockquote>1.  An actual or imminent armed attack against a State;</blockquote><br />
                <blockquote>2.  The attack must attain a minimum scale;</blockquote><br />
                <blockquote>3.  Necessity and proportionality of the armed response.</blockquote></p>

                <p><u>Is there an "Armed Attack"</u></p>

                <p>The first question is whether Iraq has suffered an armed attack. This in turn revives the controversy over whether NSAs can in law commit armed attacks, justifying a forcible response on foreign soil. For some, the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/br-1842d.asp">Caroline case of 1837</a>  supports this proposition. A ship, the Caroline, had been used in a rebellion against British rule in Canada, but there was no question of United States' involvement. British forces seized and destroyed it while it was moored in New York State.</p>

                <p>The difficulty with this argument is that up until recently, State practice unequivocally held that attacks had to be attributable to a State. In 1985 Israel took action against the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/439725/Palestine-Liberation-Organization-PLO">PLO</a>  based in Tunis on the basis that Tunisia had "harbored the PLO." The action was condemned in <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/un573.htm">Security Council Resolution 573</a> as the threshold for attribution was not met. In 1995 the international community condemned Turkey's actions against the <a href="http://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/Listedterroristorganisations/Pages/KurdistanWorkersPartyPKK.aspx">PKK</a>  in northern Iraq. Similarly in Nicaragua the ICJ held that an attack by rebels would only be an "armed attack" if they had been sent "by or on behalf" of a State.</p>

                <p>The law has moved on. Today, an armed attack can be committed by NSAs without any State involvement. This was put conclusively beyond doubt by the welcoming international response to the operations against Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan in 1998 and 2001. <a href="http://www.un.org/docs/scres/2001/sc2001.htm">Security Council resolutions 1368 and 1373</a>  recognized the "inherent right of self-defense" in the context of terrorism, without any suggestion of attribution to a State. Even during Israel's offensive in Lebanon in 2006, few States in the Security Council debates questioned Israel's right to respond to rocket attacks and kidnapping; the disagreement was instead over proportionality. In each case, however, the host State had violated its international <a href=" http://www.un-documents.net/a25r2625.htm">obligations</a>  by "tolerating" armed NSAs on its territory.</p>

                <p>Accordingly, nothing turns on the fact that ISIS' attacks cannot be attributed to a State. <em>Prima facie</em> its attacks constitute "armed attacks" under Article 51, so long as the other requirements are met.</p>

                <p><u>Scale</u></p>

                <p>According to Nicaragua an attack must attain a minimum scale in order to qualify as an armed attack. The rationale is to exclude minor disturbances. In similar vein <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/public-international-law/war-aggression-and-self-defence-4th-edition">Dinstein</a>  argues that an "armed attack presupposes a use of force producing serious consequences, epitomized by territorial incursions, human casualties or considerable destruction of property." In <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/90/9715.pdf">Oil Platforms</a>  [PDF] however, the ICJ refused to exclude the possibility that the mining of a single military vessel would meet the requirement. </p>

                <p>On any interpretation, ISIS' attacks are of sufficient scale. It has forcibly taken Iraqi towns and cities, and attacked armed forces and civilians. Although framed with inter-state warfare in mind, its attacks fall within the spirit of Article 3 of the UN <a href="http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/da/da.html">Definition of Aggression</a>.</p>

                <p><u>An Actual or Imminent Attack</u></p>

                <p>As stated above, an armed attack must be under way or imminent. In Iraq today the ISIS attacks are ongoing. Further, given the intelligence position made public in conjunction with the stated future aims of the organization and its capability, there is an imminent threat of further attacks. </p>

                <p><u>The Extra-territorial Requirement</u></p>

                <p>It must be shown that ISIS' attacks are not purely internal. Put differently, there must be an international dimension. The ICJ in its <a href=" http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=4&case=131&p3=4">Wall Advisory Opinion</a>  held that "the threat which [Israel faces] originates within, and not outside, that territory...and therefore Israel could not ... invoke a right of self-defense". </p>

                <p>In the writer's view ISIS' attacks are sufficiently internationalized. Up until recently, the preponderance of its activity was in Syria, where it controls large areas of territory, natural resources and weaponry. Moreover, it appears that ISIS personnel and weaponry are crossing the border into Iraq. Indeed, it has seized border crossings between the two States for this purpose. The organization also has broad international aims. The threat, therefore, does not originate purely within Iraqi territory. To argue the contrary would be to unnecessarily undermine Iraq's right to defend itself.</p>

                <p><u>Necessity and Proportionality</u></p>

                <p>Even if ISIS has committed armed attacks it must still be <strong>necessary</strong> for Iraq and its allies to use force. As Roberto Ago states in his <a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/documentation/english/a_cn4_318_add5-7.pdf">8th Report to the ILC on State Responsibility</a>  [PDF] "the State must not have had any means of halting, repelling or preventing the attack other than recourse to armed force." In the current case, necessity flows automatically from the fact that an attack is underway. Moreover, an attempt to resolve the issue peacefully would enable ISIS to consolidate its gains and prepare further attacks. </p>

                <p>None of this means that it is permissible to use force on Syrian territory <em>per se.</em> Post 9/11 State practice suggests that self-defense against NSAs is permissible when the host state has acquiesced in attacks contrary to international law. An example would be Afghanistan's toleration of Al-Qaeda. Syria conversely has not acquiesced in rebel activities; it rather lacks the <strong>capability</strong> to dismantle ISIS, which of itself is not unlawful. As a result consent should be sought from the Syrian Government before taking action on its territory. Given Syria's inability to tackle ISIS itself, any refusal will be unreasonable and cement the necessity for action.</p>

                <p>Any defensive response must be <strong>proportionate</strong>. This has two elements. Firstly, the response must not be manifestly out of proportion to the scale of ISIS' attacks. This does not, however, require complete symmetry of scale between the two; in 1982 the UK had to use significantly more force in recapturing the Falklands than Argentina had used in taking it.</p>

                <p>Secondly, the objective of the action must be reasonable, and the action itself must not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective.  </p>

                <p>Air strikes against ISIS bases, assets and personnel within Syrian territory will arguably be proportionate to both the scale of ISIS' attacks, and the reasonable aim of diminishing its capability.</p>

                <p><u>Conclusion</u></p>

                <p>Iraq has a right to self-defense against armed attacks perpetrated by ISIS. There are advantages to characterizing the attacks as armed attacks, since it <em>prima facie</em> renders it permissible to take the battle to Syrian territory. The strict requirements of necessity and proportionality limit the scope of the ensuing response. </p>

                <p>Iraq would be entitled to call for assistance from its allies, such as the US, transforming the action into collective self-defense. Defensive actions must be reported to the Security Council as required by Article 51.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.webblaw.com/professionals/christian-d-ehret.htm">Christian Ehret</a> of the <a href="http://www.webblaw.com/">Webb Law Firm</a> discusses patent law in reference to Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International...</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-298_7lh8.pdf">Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International</a>  [PDF] is the last of several patent law cases decided by the US Supreme Court in its October 2013 term. While the decision has generated considerable speculation questioning the future of "software patents," conclusions on the scope of patent-eligible subject matter will have to wait. The court's unanimous and fact-specific holding serves to disappoint proponents and opponents of software and business method patents alike. The court's decision, however, is not surprising to those familiar with the never-ending struggle to define the metes and bounds of patentable subject matter.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court has struggled with analyzing the subject matter requirement of patents for well over a century. Under 35 USC &#167; 101, "any new and useful process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof" is eligible for patent protection. Other statutory sections require the subject matter to be novel, non-obvious and described in a reasonably clear manner. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, specially designated to decide issues of patent law, has not provided consistent guidance despite having numerous opportunities. The <em>en banc</em> Federal Circuit in <span class="casename">Alice</span> is illustrative&#8212;the appellate court issued seven disparate opinions and failed to garner a majority vote on even one. Panel decisions from the Federal Circuit have been equally discordant and irreconcilable, seemingly serving as gap-fillers between Supreme Court rulings.</p>

                <p>A trip down the <span class="casename">Alice</span> rabbit hole requires a review of the court's &#167; 101 jurisprudence and accepting from the start that no case extends far beyond its specific facts and claim language. The "test" arguably articulated by the court in <span class="casename">Alice</span> is the following:</p>

                <blockquote>First, we determine whether the claims at issue are directed to one of those patent-ineligible concepts. If so, we then ask, "[w]hat else is there in the claims before us?" To answer that question, we consider the elements of each claim both individually and "as an ordered combination" to determine whether the additional elements "transform the nature of the claim" into a patent-eligible application. We have described step two of this analysis as a search for an "'inventive concept'"&#8212;i.e., an element or combination of elements that is "sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself."</blockquote>

                <p>The so-called "inventive concept" prong has been the subject of many concerns over a perceived overlap in the tests for subject matter eligibility and novelty. Tracing this analysis through a history of Supreme Court decisions illustrates what this inquiry is supposed to entail.</p>

                <p>The "inventive concept" language was first introduced by the court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12542933152070861616&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Parker v. Flook</a>. In <span class="casename">Flook</span>, the court examined the patentability of claims drawn to mathematically calculating alarm limits for process variables, not limited by any computer hardware, during the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons. In examining the mathematical claims, the court stated:</p>

                <blockquote>Even though a phenomenon of nature or mathematical formula may be well known, an inventive application of the principle may be patented. Conversely, the discovery of such a phenomenon cannot support a patent unless there is some other inventive concept in its application.</blockquote>

                <p>In <span class="casename">Flook</span>, the court found that the claims at-issue were not an "inventive application" of the formula for calculating an alarm limit for a process variable, but were instead drawn to nothing more than the formula itself.</p>

                <p>The court in <span class="casename">Flook</span> emphasized that the inquiry into an "inventive concept" and "inventive application" did not involve an examination of prior art by warning against "confus[ing] the issue of patentable subject matter under &#167; 101 with that of obviousness under &#167; 103." In other words, the court found that applying the abstract idea or law of nature to accomplish a result was distinguishable from the abstract idea or law of nature itself, even if the application of the idea lacked novelty. In addressing the confusion between prior art validity and the "inventive concept" analysis, the <span class="casename">Flook</span> court provided the clearest guidance in a footnote: </p>

                <blockquote>Whether or not respondent's formula can be characterized as "obvious," his process patent rests solely on the claim that his mathematical algorithm, when related to a computer program, will improve the existing process for updating alarm units. Very simply, our holding today is that a claim for an improved method of calculation, even when tied to a specific end use, is un-patentable subject matter under &#167; 101.</blockquote>

                <p>The court could have been clearer. While giving a warning in the footnote, the court's opinion engaged in a discussion of what was "known" and "within the prior art." The court's assumption that the mathematical equation was "known" can be misleading if read without context. The assumption was made to determine if the claim, as a whole, was directed to an invention other than the formula itself, not to individually examine the claim elements in isolation to determine if they were within the prior art.  </p>

                <p>While <span class="casename">Flook</span> may be the first time that the court discussed an "inventive concept," the analysis finds its roots in <a href="http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/ch7.htm#Neilson">Neilson v. Harford</a>, an English case first cited by the court in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/56/62/case.html">O'Reilly v. Morse</a>. The language from <span class="casename">Neilson</span> that the <span class="casename">Morse</span> court adopted is the following:</p>

                <blockquote>After full consideration, we think that the plaintiff does not merely claim a principle, but a machine, embodying a principle, and a very valuable one. We think the case must be considered as if the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first invented a mode of applying it . . .</blockquote>

                <p><span class="casename">Neilson</span> provides the original, unadulterated test: if a principle is at issue in a patent claim, the claim is eligible subject matter if it is drawn to a mode of applying that principle. After <span class="casename">Morse</span> adopted this reasoning, the inquiry clearly required determining if the claim includes an invention other than the principle itself.  </p>

                <p>After <span class="casename">Flook</span>, the court revisited the issue in <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=450&invol=175">Diamond v. Diehr</a>. In <span class="casename">Diehr</span>, a divided court found that a claim directed to a process for curing synthetic rubber, including a mathematical formula, was patent-eligible subject matter. <span class="casename">Diehr</span> therefore clarified the test that was implicit in <span class="casename">Flook</span>: a mode of applying an abstract idea or law of nature, even if lacking in novelty, is patentable subject matter. As in <span class="casename">Flook</span>, the <span class="casename">Diehr</span> court warned that "[t]he 'novelty' of any element or steps in a process, or even of the process itself, is of no relevance in determining whether the subject matter of a claim falls within the &#167; 101 categories of possibly patentable subject matter."  </p>

                <p>The Patent Office took the position in <span class="casename">Diehr</span> that the language from <span class="casename">Flook</span> concerning the assumption of what was "known" mandated "dissecting a claim into old and new elements" to determine eligibility. In another footnote, the court flatly rejected this argument:</p>

                <blockquote>The fallacy in this argument is that we did not hold in <span class="casename">Flook</span> that the mathematical algorithm could not be considered at all when making the &#167; 101 determination. To accept the analysis proffered by the petitioner would, if carried to its extreme, make all inventions un-patentable because all inventions can be reduced to underlying principles of nature which, once known, make their implementation obvious.</blockquote>

                <p><span class="casename">Diehr</span> therefore clarified that "claims must be considered as a whole" and not dissected "into old and new elements ... to ignore the presence of the old elements in the analysis."</p>

                <p>Almost thirty years after <span class="casename">Diehr</span>, the court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2277797231762274855&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Bilski v. Kappos</a> held that a particular business method patent drawn to a method of hedging risk in commodities trading was ineligible for patent protection under 35 USC &#167; 101. The <span class="casename">Bilski</span> court did not undergo an analysis similar to that of <span class="casename">Diehr</span> or <span class="casename">Flook</span>, instead focusing on whether the claim was tied to a particular machine or apparatus. In rejecting the claims, the majority cited to particular prior art references in support of the proposition that "[h]edging is a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce and taught in any introductory finance class." The concurrence in <span class="casename">Bilski</span> expressed concern that the majority opinion imported principles of prior art validity into its analysis. ("But the fact that hedging is 'long prevalent in our system of commerce,' cannot justify the court's conclusion, as 'the proper construction of &#167; 101 . . . does not involve the familiar issu[e] of novelty' that arises under &#167; 102.") </p>

                <p>If matters were not complicated enough, the court's decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=505607866460473908&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Mayo Collaborative v. Prometheus Lab</a>  two years later addressed the patent-eligibility of a method of treatment premised on existing relationships between concentrations of certain metabolites in blood and the likelihood of harm or ineffectiveness of a drug. The <span class="casename">Mayo</span> court performed the "inventive concept" analysis by first examining the elements of each claim individually and then as an "ordered combination." While the court quoted <span class="casename">Diehr</span> for support of this two-step analysis, <span class="casename">Diehr</span> arguably supports only the "ordered combination" aspect of the test. In examining the elements individually, the <span class="casename">Mayo</span> court noted that "methods for determining metabolite levels were well known in the art" and that a particular step "tells doctors to engage in well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by scientists who work in the field." This analysis is difficult to reconcile with the court's prohibition on combining the subject matter requirement with that of novelty or obviousness.</p>

                <p>Prior to <span class="casename">Mayo</span>, it was clear that the "inventive concept" prong did not involve an inquiry into what was "known" or "within the prior art." The assumption from <span class="casename">Flook</span> that the underlying concept was "known" was merely a way to frame the question of whether the "invention" was more than the abstract idea itself. An "<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/invention">invention</a>" is a "discovery" or a "finding," and need not be novel or non-obvious. Just because two individuals simultaneously developed the integrated circuit, months apart, does not mean that both Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce were not inventors. The "inventive concept" analysis merely asks whether the "discovery" or "finding" made by the inventor is something other than the law of nature or abstract idea itself.</p>

                <p>The <span class="casename">Alice</span> court focused on the <span class="casename">Mayo</span> "two-step" and underwent a similar analysis. The court found particularly instructive the proposition in <span class="casename">Mayo</span> that, since "metabolite levels were already 'well known in the art,'" the claim amounted to nothing more than "an instruction to doctors to apply the applicable laws." Applying this reasoning to Alice's "computerized" business method patents, the court first stepped through the claim limitations in isolation and found that the computer functions to "obtain data, adjust account balances and issue automated instructions ... are 'well-understood, routine, conventional activit[ies]' previously known to the industry." Unlike the <span class="casename">Flook</span>, <span class="casename">Diehr</span> and <span class="casename">Bilski</span> decisions, a discussion of the boundaries between subject matter eligibility and novelty&#8212;even in a footnote&#8212;was noticeably absent from <span class="casename">Alice</span>.  </p>

                <p>Regardless of whether the ultimate outcome in <span class="casename">Alice</span> is correct, the analysis certainly appears distinct from that of <span class="casename">Flook</span> and <span class="casename">Diehr</span>. Examining individual claim limitations in isolation as an initial step runs the risk of dictating the outcome of the "ordered combination" second step. In view of the reasoning from <span class="casename">Mayo</span> and <span class="casename">Alice</span>, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where any claimed step or limitation, in isolation, could be viewed as being more than conventional. Such an analysis could easily run afoul of the mandate from <span class="casename">Diehr</span> to view the claims as a <strong>whole</strong> to determine if it "adds something more" to the underlying principle. The import and applicability of <span class="casename">Alice</span> will ultimately depend on how the Federal Circuit and Patent Office adopt the reasoning. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.edu/fac-staff/williamsv/">Victor Sanchez Williams</a> of the Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law discusses the constitutionality of the debt limit statute and why it needs to be eliminated ... </p><strong>P</strong></font>artisan conflict has brought our nation to the brink of catastrophic debt default three times since 2011. Markets are again <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-11/cantor-defeat-puts-markets-on-guard-for-debt-limit-gridlock.html">on default watch</a> after House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's surprise primary <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/magazine/david-brats-hand-of-god-economics.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=2">defeat</a> by Professor Dave Brat. Debt <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/us/politics/many-in-gop-offer-theory-default-wouldnt-be-that-bad.html?hp&_r=1&">default-deniers</a> across the country seek to "<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/the-next-dave-brat-108142.html">pull a Brat</a>." Chris McDaniel <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victor-williams/mcdaniels-loss-cochrans-d_b_5559751.html?utm_hp_ref=politics">came</a> painfully close in Mississippi's ugly senatorial primary against Thad Cochran. Markets hate such uncertainty.  </p>

<p>What is certain is that all of Uncle Sam's accrued debts, loans and bills come due on March 15, 2015, when the most recent debt limit suspension ends. In a recent interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101841679">acknowledged</a> that the bills were coming due. He decried the recent "terrible" debt limit fights and the partisans who "use our ability to pay our debt as a tool to gain leverage in a political debate." Secretary Lew detailed the cost of debt ceiling conflict:  "It hurt confidence ... it hurt it internationally. It hurts the whole economy."   </p>

<p><strong>Economic Patriotism</strong> </p>

<p>The Treasury Secretary is right about the dangerous cost of debt limit battles and more generally correct about the need for a "new economic patriotism." That is exactly why I <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/02/11/65273.htm">sued</a> Jack Lew in February 2014, seeking a declaratory judgment to void the unconstitutional debt ceiling and an injunction to prevent its enforcement. The national debt is about our national honor. The United States timely pays all its obligations&#8212;Treasury debt interest, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans' health care, etc.    </p>

<p>The debt ceiling does exactly what the Constitution's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a>'s Section 4 explicitly prohibits; the statute "questions" the "validity of the public debt of the United States." The debt limit statute's constitutional violation is patent; "this wolf comes as a wolf," as stated by Justice Scalia dissenting in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17629076715773250697&q">Morrison v. Olson</a>. As with Tiberius' "holding a wolf by the ears," the national government and Treasury debt holders alike <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/Pages/debtlimit.aspx">have come to fear</a> the "catastrophic" consequences of the statute's enforcement. The macro-economic harm of US debt default would last for generations. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304104504579377303355489512">has editorialized</a> for a repeal of the debt limit statute.        </p>

<p><strong> "Absolute Expectation of Security" in Public Debt Holdings</strong></p>

<p>Along with China, Japan, each of the 50 sovereign states, the House of Morgan, the Social Security Trust Fund and countless others (perhaps you), I <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/10/10/230944425/everyone-the-u-s-government-owes-money-to-in-one-graph">owe</a> US public debt. We hold this debt under a constitutional guarantee <em>not only</em> that these Treasury debt instruments will remain valid, <em>but also</em> that the "validity" of those securities will not be "questioned" by this nation's government     </p>

<p>Through <a href="http://treasurydirect.gov/">TreasuryDirect.gov</a>, I purchased a very modest amount of every available type and duration of Treasury bond, note, bill, TIPS, FRN, savings bond and <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/help/TDHelp/help_ug_152-CofILearnMore.htm">Certificate-of-Indebtedness</a>. A portion of my TIAA-CREF teachers' retirement account is directly invested in Treasury TIPs and I have a spousal interest in a federal retirement TSP G Fund (which Treasury regularly <a href="http://www.fedsmith.com/2014/02/05/borrowing-from-the-g-fund-again-to-offset-the-debt-ceiling/">raids</a> to avoid a debt limit caused default as an "extraordinary measure").                                                                                                               </p>

<p>My lawsuit makes the novel argument that debt holders have an <em>absolute expectation of 14th Amendment security</em> in our Treasury investments. Unlike a reasonable expectation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> privacy, this <em>absolute expectation</em> can never be "balanced" or excepted away. The debt limit statute <em>facially</em> breaches that constitutional security, causing debt holders actual and concrete harm (past, present and ongoing). The statute's intended, contemporary operation subjects debt holders to Treasury's repeated threats to arbitrarily enforce it, which results in as-applied harm (past, present and ongoing). Debt holders are also, separately, in danger of the "as-applied" harm of a certainly-impending risk of catastrophic government default resulting from the statute's enforcement. </p>

<p>The lawsuit to void the debt ceiling is part of a larger policy/litigation endeavor&#8212;<a href="http://disruptivejustice.org/">DisruptiveJustice.org</a>&#8212;that I launched, applying Harvard Business School's market-based "disruptive innovation" strategies for reform of public markets. <a href="http://disruptivejustice.org/private-attorney-gereral-litigation-projects">The Jerome Frank Litigation Center</a> implements Judge Frank's vision of the "private attorney general" suing on behalf of the public while unencumbered by government accountability or special interest affiliation.   </p>

<p><strong>Academics Agree that Debt Limit Statute Conflicts with Fourteenth Amendment</strong></p>

<p>Many academics, other than Dr. Brat, persuasively argue that the debt limit statute conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment. Most rely on the Supreme Court's 1935 <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/294/330">Perry v. United States</a> plurality ruling that Section Four embraces "whatever concerns the integrity of the public obligations." Professor Jack Balkin <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2011/06/legislative-history-of-section-four-of.html">connects</a> the Fourteenth Amendment's drafting history and text to its contemporary relevance. The Public Debt Clause has "broad terms in order to prevent future majorities in Congress from repudiating the federal debt to gain political advantage, to seek political revenge, or to try to disavow previous financial obligations because of changed policy priorities."  Professors Neil Buchanan and Michael Dorf have repeatedly <a href="http://www.cap-press.com/books/isbn/9781611634426/The-Debt-Ceiling-Disasters">explained </a>how the debt limit statute <a href="http://columbialawreview.org/Borrowing-by-any-other-name_Buchanan-and-Dorf./">traps</a> the Executive in an impossible "trilemma." The president must choose which of the three fiscal statutory duties he must violate&#8212;spending, taxing or borrowing. In <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/06/the-constitutions-latest-blaze-of-notoriety-bad-for-the-republic/241308/"><em>Atlantic</em> essays</a>, Professor Garrett Epps <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/10/if-congress-wont-raise-the-debt-ceiling-obama-will-be-forced-to-break-the-law/280176/">analyzed</a> the statute's unconstitutionality; he even drafted a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/04/the-speech-obama-could-give-the-constitution-forbids-default/237977/">presidential speech</a> announcing repudiation. </p>

<p>President Obama rejected their collective advice. The Treasury Department has instead managed to push through a series of congressional debt limit suspensions just in the nick of time to avoid catastrophic default. </p>

<p><strong>Media Misreporting: Not a "Clean Debt Bill" </strong></p>

<p>The last debt limit suspension was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-gop-leaders-will-bring-clean-debt-ceiling-bill/2014/02/11/1544cf8a-9338-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html">universally misreported</a> a a "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/11/house-passes-debt-ceiling_n_4769622.html">clean debt bill</a>." It is anything but clean. The February 2014 <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ83/html/PLAW-113publ83.htm">Temporary Debt Limit Extension Act</a>'s Section 3 was subtitled, <em>Restoring Congressional Authority Over the National Debt</em>. The statute as amended prevents Treasury from prepaying obligations and/or building a "cash balance above normal operating balances in anticipation of the expiration of such period." The amendment envisions and encourages default. </p>

<p>As if it were a huge student loan, Republican Congressional Leadership strategically <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/us/politics/behind-debt-limit-retreat-a-gop-eye-on-retaking-the-senate.html?_r=2">put the debt</a> into "deferment" into 2015&#8212;until after the midterm elections strengthen their numbers. While the debt is in deferment, Uncle Sam continues to borrow to cover present bills while the interest <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">accrues</a> and is capitalized. Our foreign creditors do not acknowledge even the rare hardship exception to allow bankruptcy discharge. Is the US to <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rejects-argentina-bond-appeal.php">become</a> the next Argentina? </p>

<p><strong>Dave Brat's Delusional Pledge: No Debt Limit Increase for Five Years and No Tax Increase, Ever.</strong></p>

<p>Dave Brat states emphatically that Congress can reduce spending so that it need not raise the debt limit or increase tax revenues. With an American University Ph.D. in Economics, Professor Brat surely understands Treasury's stated position that massive spending cuts with substantial tax increases "cannot <a href="http://www.cfr.org/budget-debt-and-deficits/us-debt-ceiling-costs-consequences/p24751">make</a> the necessary cash available" to avoid debt default. Debt must be rolled over. Why does Dr. Brat ignore the financial market's reactions to the imminent debt default of November 2013? The "<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-15/oct-17-is-start-rather-than-finish-of-debt-limit-crisis-endgame.html">TED spread</a>" between investor confidence in government debt versus corporate debt inverted; big commercial banks <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/19/us-usa-fiscal-banks-warrooms-insight-idUSBRE9AI05P20131119">spent</a> millions preparing for the default; and large financial houses, such as Morgan and Fidelity, <a href="http://www.arabianmoney.net/us-stocks/2013/10/12/jp-morgan-dumps-all-short-term-us-treasuries-as-default-approaches-next-week-with-no-deal-on-the-debt-ceiling/">dumped</a> all short-term Treasury holdings. </p>

<p>Brat has doubled down on delusion by <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dave-brat-meet-candidate-beat-eric-cantor/story?id=24081628">renewing</a> a pledge to never increase taxes and to not vote to increase (or suspend) the debt limit for five years.  </p>

<p>In <em>Stress Test</em>, Tim Geithner warns about Republican economic delusion: "Many of them truly seemed to believe that default could cleanse the sins of the US economy, which was insane. Boehner was unwilling ... to correct the delusions of much of his caucus." The former Treasury Secretary is explicit: "They ... strap a financial bomb to their chests and try to extort a ransom in exchange for agreeing not to blow up the economy."  </p>

<p><strong>Killing the Debt Ceiling Through Litigation</strong></p>

<p>Hours before the debt limit was last <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/197821-lew-sets-feb-27-debt-limit-deadline">breached</a>, on February 7, 2014, I initiated suit in the District of Columbia's federal trial court in D.C., attempting to kill the debt limit law. I publicly <a href="http://www.acslaw.org/acsblog/applying-'brown'-to-void-the-debt-ceiling">revealed</a> the lawsuit&#8212;on the American Constitution Society's blog in May 2014 just after ACS ran an excellent series celebrating <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/347/483">Brown v. Board of Education</a>'s 60th Anniversary. I use <span class="casename">Brown</span> in the suit to argue that the debt limit statute similarly facially contravenes a fundamental provision of the very same Fourteenth Amendment (which was, of course, one of the three broadly written post-bellum amendments). Just as the Fourteenth Amendment allows no separated-but-equal education regime under its Equal Protection Clause, there can be no limited-but-valid public debt regime under its Public Debt Clause.  </p>

<p>In a subsequent Huffington Post Memorial Day Tribute, I <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victor-williams/lawsuit-filed-to-void-deb_b_5393293.html">explain</a> that holding public debt is a patriotic act of civic engagement on the order of electoral participation. Proudly during times of peace and humbly during war, Americans have held their nation's debt.  Public debt is about <a href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/history/history.htm">national honor</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Invoking <span class="casename">Clapper</span> and Ignoring <span class="casename">Susan B. Anthony</span>, DOJ Defends the Debt Limit by Throwing Jack Lew under the Bus</strong></p>

<p>Attempting to avoid the constitutional analysis by not answering my complaint, the Justice Department filed a strong preemptive attack on the suit's standing and ripeness. Invoking <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-1025">Clapper v. Amnesty International</a>, DOJ attempts to have the suit preemptively dismissed on standing and ripeness grounds. Parroting <span class="casename">Clapper</span> DOJ argues in its FRCP 12(b)1 motion that my "fears" of debt default injury are only a law professor's hypothetical "speculation."  </p>

<p>No longer is debt default a "catastrophic" <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2178.aspx">danger</a>; it is only a "hypothetical fear." DOJ's dismissal motion thus <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Lew-at-BPC.aspx">contrasts</a> starkly with Secretary Jack Lew's repeated <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2182.aspx">congressional testimony and public statements</a> averring present bondholder harm, and actual and impending debt-limit default harm. </p>

<p>The Justice Department position directly conflicts with years of Treasury warnings about&#8212;and "extraordinary actions" taken to prevent&#8212;a "catastrophic" default. It appears that DOJ is throwing Jacob Lew and the Treasury Department (its clients) under the bus to win a quick procedural dismissal.    </p>

<p>Regardless, DOJ reliance on <span class="casename">Clapper</span> may prove too much in light of the Supreme Court's June 2014 <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/13-193">Susan B. Anthony v. Driehaus</a> ruling. Commentators query whether the "substantial risk of injury" standard may have <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/06/commentary-susan-b-anthony-list-clapper-footnote-5-and-the-state-of-article-iii-standing-doctrine/">returned</a> to Article III standing analysis regarding future ham. DOJ refuses to accept that my lawsuit avers past, present and ongoing harm.   </p>

<p>I am still puzzled as to why Eric Holder chooses to defend the patently unconstitutional debt limit statute. As he courageously proved by <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-222.html">repudiating</a> DOMA, our Attorney General knows that his highest calling is to not enforce the unenforceable; to not defend an unconstitutional statute.  </p>

<p>The Ides of March, 2015 is now eight months away. Whether by a declaratory judgment or a "miracle" of legislative common sense, we must eliminate the debt limit statute. Our "interesting times" need not be catastrophic "end times."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.eckertseamans.com/directory.aspx?View=Detail&DirectoryID=758">Renee Mattei Myers</a> and Redeate Dessalegn of <a href="http://www.eckertseamans.com/">Eckert, Seamans, Cherin &#38; Mellott, LLC</a> discuss the effect of the recent US Supreme Court decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. on employers and employees...</p>

                <p>In a 5-4 decision, the US Supreme Court held the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) mandate to provide contraception that conflicted with an employers' religious beliefs was unlawful under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA). The aftermath of the ruling has led to numerous debates, many based on broad, and in some instances, inaccurate interpretations of the court's opinion. So what is the truth behind the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sebelius-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.</a> decision and how will it actually affect employers and their employees? </p>

                <p><u>Background</u></p>

                <p>In 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandating certain employers provide "preventative care and screenings" for female employees at no cost. This included mandating the coverage of certain contraceptives that have the effect of preventing a fertilized egg from developing. </p>

                <p>Following the passage of this mandate, three closely held, family operated, for-profit companies (Hobby Lobby, Conestoga and Mardel) filed suit, alleging that the requirement to provide such contraception violated their religious rights under the RFRA. The RFRA prohibits the government from substantially burdening a person's exercise of region unless: 1) it furthers a compelling governmental interest and 2) it is done in a manner that is least restrictive. </p>

                <p><u>The Decision</u></p>

                <p>In its opinion, the court focused on four main issues in determining whether the ACA mandate violated the RFRA as applied to <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span>. </p>

                <p>First, because the statutory provisions of the RFRA apply only to "persons," the court needed to address whether a corporation could be considered a "person" under the RFRA. In doing so, the court looked to the dictionary definition of "person" (which includes "corporation"), the legislative history of the RFRA (which suggested no congressional intent to deviate from the dictionary definition) and the court's prior application of the RFRA to non-profit corporations (noting it would be irrational to differentiate between non-profit and for-profit corporations in its application).</p>

                <p>Furthermore, the court reasoned that ruling businesses like Hobby Lobby are not "persons" within the RFRA would force merchants to make a difficult decision between judicial protection of their religious liberty and the benefits of operating as corporations. Thus, the court ultimately concluded that closely held for-profit corporations are "persons" under the RFRA.<br />
                    <br />
                    The next issue the court addressed was whether a corporation can "exercise religion." Ultimately, the court concluded that there is no credible explanation to find that closely held corporations couldn't exercise religion. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied mainly on statutes from the states where the three corporations at issue were incorporated. Specifically, the statues allow for-profit corporations to pursue "any lawful purpose" including exercise of religion. In addition, the court relied on the fact that non-profit corporations were found to "exercise religion" under the RFRA. Thus closely held corporations should not be excluded from being able to "exercise religion" under the RFRA simply because they are for-profit.  <br />
                    <br />
                    Once the court determined that for-profit corporations were entitled to the protections afforded by the RFRA, it turned to the issue of whether the ACA mandate substantially burdened the corporations' free exercise of religion, and if so, whether there was a compelling governmental interest to impose such a burden.</p>

                <p>Under the terms of the ACA, the corporations were subject to fines up to $475 million per year, for refusing to provide coverage for the four contraceptive devices at issue. In addition, if the corporations made the business decision to stop offering health insurance benefits completely, they would be subjected to approximately $26 million in penalties. </p>

                <p>Based on these numbers, the court found that the ACA mandate did in fact place a substantial burden on the companies' right to exercise free religion. The court dismissed the argument that the cost of the fines for discontinuing insurance coverage was actually less than the overall cost of providing health coverage to their employees. The court reasoned that in order to retain and attract skilled employees, corporations would be forced to provide additional compensation to make up for the lack of health coverage, which in the long run, would cost the company more than a group health plan. In any event, the court reasoned that Congress could not have enacted the RFRA or the ACA to encourage employers to eliminate health care coverage completely. </p>

                <p>Finally, after assuming providing cost-free access to the four contraceptives at issue is a compelling governmental interest, the court addressed whether the mandate in the ACA was the least restrictive alternative. In finding whether alternatives existed, the court looked no further than the exemptions to the mandate offered to non-profit corporations that are permitted to exclude contraceptive coverage from group health insurance plans. In this situation, the insurance companies are required to offer the coverage directly to the employees, thus permitting female employees to continue to receive coverage for all FDA-approved contraceptives. A second option the court noted was to have the government assume the cost of providing the mandated contraceptives.  </p>

                <p><u>Dissent</u></p>

                <p>Justice Ginsburg wrote the dissent to the court's opinion, which was joined by three other Justices. The dissent argued that the decision in <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> will allow all corporations to opt out of any laws that they deem to be against their religion, despite the majority explicitly stating otherwise. Ginsburg goes on to state that for-profit corporations should not be afforded religious freedom simply because their main goal is to earn profit rather than religious worship. She stated that the majority ruling imposes the beliefs of the employers on the employees and denies "a legion" of female employees access to affordable contraceptive care. In total, the dissent warned that the court "has ventured into a minefield," in which female employees will be its victim. </p>

                <p><u>The Real Effect on Employers and Employees</u></p>

                <p>It appears as if most of the misunderstandings over the <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> decision stem from the perceived effect it will have on employers and employees in the future. The court, foreseeing such confusion, explicitly states in the majority opinion that the decision is "concerned solely with the contraceptive mandate ... it should not be understood to hold that an insurance coverage mandate must necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer's religious beliefs." Thus, employers may still be required to provide coverage for health services such as immunizations and blood transfusions despite their religious beliefs.</p>

                <p>Additionally, the court further clarifies that the decision does not apply to all for-profit corporations, but only to closely held corporations with owners that operate their businesses according to their shared religious beliefs. So conglomerates, such as Wal-Mart, are not exempt from providing contraceptive coverage, given it is run by shareholders who have different religious values. Thus, most female employees will not be affected by the court's decision in <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span>, and those who are will have access to the four contraceptives through a system that will be less restrictive on a company's free exercise of religion.  </p>

		<title>Hall v. Florida: Over Relying on a Single Source to Set a National Standard</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header> JURIST Guest Columnist Susan Schneider, <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu">Syracuse University College of Law</a>, Class of 2015, explores criticisms of the DSM-5 after the US Supreme Court used it as the sole national standard to define intellectual disability in <span class="casename">Hall v. Florida</span>...</j:header><strong>I</strong>n its 2002 decision <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2043469055777796288">Atkins v. Virginia</a>, the US Supreme Court declared that <a href="http://jurist.org/feature/featured/death-penalty-and-intellectual-disabilities/">executing a person with intellectual disability</a> is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a>. In the opinion, the court did not thoroughly explain how states were to define intellectual disability, only stating that it requires "subaverage intellectual functioning," "significant limitations in adaptive skills" and that both of which must "manifest before age 18." As for specific methods for identifying such factors, none were given: "we leave to the States the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon its execution of sentences."</p>

<p>Twelve years later, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15558669892520126172">Hall v. Florida</a>, a <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-death-penalty-for-mentally-retarded.php">discussion</a> at the highest level has finally taken place regarding the definition of intellectual disability. Hall, on death row since 1981, appealed his sentence several times throughout the years, most recently on grounds of intellectual disability. In order to prove "subaverage intellectual functioning," Florida required an IQ score of 70 or below. Hall's lowest admissible IQ score was 71. That one-point difference barred Hall from offering any other evidence of intellectual disability, including the testimony of teachers, family members, doctors and experts that Hall had "significant limitations in adaptive skills." Hall's appeal reached the US Supreme Court this year.</p>

<p>The decision handed down by the court in <span class="casename">Hall</span> declared that Florida's <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/supreme-court-finds-florida-iq-cutoff-for-executions-unconstitutional.php">interpretation</a> of their own state law was unconstitutional. They deemed the strict IQ score cutoff as inappropriate and that, within a certain range, defendants must be allowed to present additional evidence of intellectual disability. On the surface, this defining moment for intellectual disability is more expansive, less reliant on strict test scores and gives a better understanding of how the first two requirements from <span class="casename">Atkins</span> should be applied. However, the method the court used to come to such a conclusion is much debated.</p>

<p>The first and most substantial method the court utilized when constructing its more expansive definition was to consult the work of medical experts and professionals. This is extremely common for all levels of courts and legislatures when working with medical assessments and examinations. However, except for research on successfully administering IQ tests and attaining accurate scores, the court relies almost exclusively on the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Psychiatric Association's publication of the <a href="http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Default.aspx">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</a> (DSM-5) to guide their definition of intellectual disability. </p>

<p>The problem here lies not in the definition itself, but in the reliance on the DSM-5 as a national standard. The court split 5-4 on the <span class="casename">Hall</span> decision, and the dissent strongly criticized the court's reliance on the DSM-5 as "sharply depart[ing] from the framework prescribed in prior Eighth Amendment cases and adopt[ing] a uniform national rule that is both conceptually unsound and likely to result in confusion."</p>

<p>Although the APA is one of the most recognized organizations in the field of psychology, and the DSM has commonly been referred to as the "bible" within the field of psychiatry, the American Psychiatric Association does not hold <a href="http://aaidd.org/intellectual-disability/definition#.U9b0wFboYfE">exclusive rights</a> on defining intellectual disabilities or disorders, nor is there a consensus within the field that the DSM is correct. In fact, over 50 organizations openly criticize the DSM-5 and called for severe revisions before its distribution, including well over a <a href="http://www.apadivisions.org/division-32/publications/newsletters/humanistic/2012/10/dsm-5-reform.aspx">dozen</a> divisions within the APA.</p>

<p>The dissent described several issues with relying on a single organization's viewpoints. First, the court strayed from basing standards on those held by American society as a whole and instead based them on standards held by professional societies&#8212;most notably those reliant on the DSM-5. Essentially, this ruling allows a single organization to control the standards by which we define intellectual disability across the nation and endorses the APA and their DSM-5 as the sole national standard. As the dissent poignantly notes, this decision elevates the American Psychiatric Association's current views to a constitutional level.</p>

<p>Second, the dissent remarks that this reliance and endorsement may lead to confusion as the American Psychiatric Association's views will change in the future. As a fifth edition, this DSM provides the fifth version of the APA's position on and definition of intellectual disability. It is certain that there will be future versions of the DSM, and that those editions will add to, edit, detract from or possibly rescind current definitions and standards. </p>

<p>Lastly, the dissent notes that the DSM-5 is meant as a diagnostic tool for social services, such as school aid, employment accommodations and health insurance. The DSM-5 is not tailored for analyzing the penological determinations necessary to determine if the death penalty is appropriate for an individual, such as the correlation between criminal activity and the severity of the punishment.</p>

<p>But the issues do not end there. Of the numerous experts and organizations that criticize the DSM-5, the most concerning complaint is the lack of scientific rigor and independent review. One of the main components of a proper and valid scientific theory or declaration is that it be subjected to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=827109112258472814">peer review and publication</a>, and gain validity in the relevant scientific community; in this case, psychiatry.</p>

<p>Allen Frances, MD, chaired the previous DSM's task force, but now staunchly opposes the DSM-5. Accordingly, he attests that the American Psychiatric Association ignored professional, public and press accusations that the revisions produced within the DSM-5 lacked scientific support. Frances stated that "<a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1722526&resultClick=3">field trials</a> produced reliability results that did not meet historical standards and deadlines were consistently missed." Frances further stated that "the opposition to the DSM-5 comes from all over the world and includes tens of thousands of psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, counselors, social workers and other mental health practitioners." The people who <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allen-frances/is-criticism-of-dsm-5-ant_b_3326980.html">oppose</a> DSM-5 belong to many different schools of thought, but unite in the worry that it is not safe or scientifically sound. In no way has the DSM-5 attained the necessary "widespread acceptance" to be considered the sole source for a national standard, at a constitutional level, by the highest court in our country. </p>

<p>This lack of independent review and acceptance may stem from an even more critical aspect, the growing influence of the pharmaceutical industry on the changes integrated into the DSM-5. The percentage of task force members who have financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry has <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1001190">grown</a> from 57 percent for the DSM's fourth edition, to 69 percent for the DSM-5. The many that criticize the DSM-5, including several divisions within the American Psychological Association, argue that the manual has taken a huge step towards overly <a href="http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/dsm5/">"medicalizing"</a> disabilities and disorders. </p>

<p>With so many in the disability community fighting society's generally-held medical view of their abilities (an individual has a problem or illness that must be cured), and actively encouraging a social view instead (an individual may need accommodations, but is a person first instead of a medical diagnosis), a task force that favors viewpoints and opinions offered by the pharmaceutical industry is one to be closely scrutinized. If this task force does not take into account criticism of their guidelines on research, independent peer review and the soundness of their methods and conclusions, the American public should also be concerned.</p>

<p>American society and medical professionals should sit up and take notice when this task force, under the auspices of the American Psychiatric Association, becomes thoroughly endorsed and relied upon by the US Supreme Court as the sole source defining intellectual disability. Their opinions are elevated to a constitutional level as the single organization to create, maintain and revise a national standard.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court could have easily avoided such a sweeping endorsement of the American Psychiatric Association and their DSM-5 as the sole source for a national standard by incorporating other organizations into their opinion. There are many within the <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/05/hall-florida-ruling.aspx">medical field</a> and the <a href="http://aaidd.org/news-policy/news/aaidd-news-quick-view/2014/05/27/us-supreme-court-decision-in-hall-v.-florida-reaffirms-understanding-of-intellectual-disability#.U9b22VboYfE">disability community</a> that adamantly agree with the new, more expansive and flexible criteria for defining intellectual disability laid out by the Supreme Court's ruling, but the court's obvious preference for and reliance on the DSM-5 deserves criticism.</p>

		<title>A Cold War in Cyberspace: Does the US Have Jurisdiction Over Russian Hackers?</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2014/08/arkady-bukh-cyber-crime/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Arkady Bukh of the <a href="http://www.nyccriminallawyer.com">Law Offices of Bukh &#38; Associates</a> describes the recent arrest of an alleged Russian cyber criminal and its place in the history of cybercrime...</p>

                <p>The recent arrest of Russian citizen Roman Valeravich Seleznev by US authorities for alleged cyber crimes highlights one of the most difficult jurisdictional problems facing the international community today. In brief, does the country in which a cybercrime originates have sole jurisdiction over the act and the person committing the crime, or can countries whose citizens have been harmed by the crime, in this instance hacking, bring the criminal to justice? The United States has taken the stance that it has jurisdiction over criminals who hack into American computers and has taken vigorous action to bring these individuals to court. The Secret Service, FBI, CIA and other state agencies have conducted extensive investigations into the actions of hackers worldwide; Mr. Seleznev is one of several alleged Russian cyber criminals who have been arrested by US authorities over the last few years.  </p>

                <p>The case involving Mr. Seleznev is based on an <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/waw/press/2014/July/seleznev.html">indictment</a> handed down  in US District Court for the Western District of Washington that was sealed charging him with "hacking into point of sale systems at retailers through the United States." The indictment took place in March 2011 and was unsealed when the Russian citizen was found in Maldives and arrested in Guam. He is presently in jail in Guam awaiting extradition to the US. This became a cause of tension between Russia and the US partially due to the fact the father of the defendant is a member of the Duma (the Russian parliament) named Valery Seleznev and has <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/07/08/russian-man-hacking-retailers/">accused</a> the US of kidnapping his son in the Maldives.</p>

                <p>The jurisdictional question of arrest has arisen several times between the US and Russia involving cybercrimes with Russia accusing the US of taking unauthorized custody of its citizens and the US considering Russia a "safe haven" for cyber criminals. The basis for this problem is the fact that the two countries have no extradition treaty. This was certainly given media attention by the recent asylum granted by the Russians to Edward Snowden.  </p>

                <p>Members of the criminal defense bar have stated that American officials have become increasingly relaxed in their overall recognition of established guidelines when pursuing accused cyber criminals across international boundaries. In September 2013, Russia's Foreign Ministry <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/09/dont-leave-home/">issued a warning</a>  for "citizens to refrain from traveling abroad, especially to countries that have signed agreements with the US on mutual extradition, if there is reasonable suspicion that US law enforcement agencies" have a case pending against them.</p>

                <p>In quite a few of the cases, the suspects were held in third countries following a request from US authorities. American officials have extradited several and are presently working to secure the extradition of others. This repeated practice has raised the ire of Moscow officials. Defense attorneys have sought to fight these cases, but are unable to do so until the defendant is on US soil. One such case was that of Victor Bout, who was arrested for arms trafficking, and spent several years in a Thai prison before defense counsel was able to contest his arrest, to no avail, before a NY judge. </p>

                <p>Prior to the present practice of first obtaining a sealed indictment, the FBI had worked on a few sting operations. In what may be the FBI's most famous case in connection with alleged Russian cyber criminals are the cases of Vasily Gorshkov and Alexei Ivanov. Promising a job interview in Seattle, the FBI established a fake computer security firm in 2000, named "Invita," and picked up Gorshkov and Ivanov when the duo came in under the pretense of a job interview. Arrested at the meeting, Gorshkov and Ivanov were subsequently convicted of cyber crimes, which hit PayPal, Yahoo and eBay and received three and four year sentences, respectively.</p>

                <p>In an effort to arrest a client of mine, Alexander Panin, FBI agents crossed the globe as they joined the dark side and hacked into computers and posed as cyber crooks. Despite sifting through millions of lines of computer code, getting frustrated with law enforcement in Thailand, Bulgaria and Britain, they finally were forced to wait for Panin to leave Russia before they could arrest him in the Dominican Republic.  </p>

                <p>These jurisdictional issues are certainly raised by the defense in all of these cases and however there potentially be a bias in the judiciary in the country where the defendant is on trial. While it certainly may not happen very soon, the US and Russia would both benefit from coming to some agreement on extradition in the worldwide fight against cybercrime. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Columnist <a href="http://www.oklahomalegalgroup.com/attorney-profile">Adam Banner</a> of the <a href="http://www.oklahomalegalgroup.com">Oklahoma Legal Group</a> discusses the Fourth Amendment implications of warrantless cell phone searches in the context of two recent Supreme Court decisions on the issue...</p>

                <p>Two cases recently decided by the US Supreme Court will likely have a tremendous impact on our Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures of cell phones in the absence of a warrant. Luckily for the criminal defense bar (and privacy rights in general), the Supreme Court has ruled that police generally may not, without the safeguards of a warrant, search digital information on a cell phone seized from a recently arrested individual.</p>

                <p>The standard, up and until these new opinions, has been that property on a person at arrest&#8212;a wallet or a purse, for example&#8212;may be searched. However, in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/riley-v-california/">Riley v. California</a>  and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-wurie/">United States v. Wurie</a>, the Supreme Court was asked to reconsider the nature of the Fourth Amendment in the face of ever-changing technology. According to the High Court's most recent decision on the issue, we can all rest a little easier in the knowledge that the court has not completely killed the few shreds of stability the Fourth Amendment has historically offered.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in both cases in April, and Chief Justice Roberts delivered an opinion which is sure to stand as a hallmark in the fight to balance privacy interests in the face of ever-changing technological advances.</p>

                <p>The arguments hinged on a need for computer-specific Fourth Amendment rules to counteract privacy issues raised by new technology.</p>

                <p>Previously, the "<span class="casename">Robinson</span> Rule" applied to the post-arrest search and seizure of property on a person. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5387812968771120977&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">United States v. Robinson</a>, a defendant was pulled over and arrested for driving with a revoked license. As he was patted down, police found a cigarette pack that contained heroin. Although Robinson challenged the "frisk" as a Fourth Amendment violation, the Supreme Court found that a thorough search of a person at arrest was not a violation, but rather a reasonable search for weapons or to prevent the concealment or destruction of evidence, further building on its previous precedent established in <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=395&invol=752">Chimel v. California</a>.</p>

                <p>Consequently, the majority of the arguments in <span class="casename">Riley</span> and <span class="casename">Wurie</span> centered on the court's two specific and clear reasons for searching a person at arrest: to protect the safety of law enforcement and the public by securing weapons and to prevent a suspect from concealing or destroying evidence.</p>

                <p>In oral arguments, Jeffrey L. Fisher, attorney for David Riley, argued that neither element was present in the search of the petitioner's cell phone. The phone had already been seized, and therefore the chance of evidence being deleted or destroyed had been nullified. Furthermore, scanning apps, emails, photos and other digital files on the phone would not reveal a weapon. </p>

                <p>Justice Kennedy asked Fisher if he believed police would have been able to obtain a warrant to search his client's cell phone. Fisher responded, "In all likelihood, yes ... [but] this court has said time and again that the mere fact the police could have gotten a warrant but didn't does not excuse a Fourth Amendment violation."</p>

                <p>The ability to get a warrant for a search of a cell phone subsequent to seizure also arose in oral arguments for <span class="casename">Wurie</span>. Michael R. Dreeben, attorney for the petitioner, reasoned that a search of an arrestee's cell phone log was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, but rather a reasonable search to find evidence of a person's identity. Dreeben said that, in the <span class="casename">Wurie</span> case, police saw the suspect's cell phone ringing with the caller ID of "My House" displayed. Subsequently, an officer pressed one button to allow the call to come through and another button to check the phone number associated with the call.</p>

                <p>Dreeben further asserted, "That kind of a search serves valid, time-honored functions in the search situation of helping to ascertain the identity of the offender." He noted that it was particularly relevant in the <span class="casename">Wurie</span> case as the arrestee then lied about where he lived, which would have affected the ability to obtain a warrant to search his home.</p>

                <p>However, Justice Sotomayor was not so easily convinced. She responded, "I'm not so sure. If he was at the precinct, they could have gotten a warrant, and once he lied about his address, they would have known he wasn't living there and would have gotten a warrant." </p>

                <p>Ultimately, reason and precedent prevailed, as the High Court accepted the fact that there is a clear-cut distinction between the physical nature of a cell phone itself and the digital nature of the potentially private information that the physical phone contains. </p>

                <p>Moreover, the court opined that the recent decisions in no way limit the ability of law enforcement to employ other existing warrant exceptions as applicable on a case-by-case basis. For example, even though the "search incident to arrest" exception to the warrant requirement does not apply to cellphones, there may be situations that allow for law enforcement to search a phone without a warrant based on the "exigent circumstances" exception.</p>

                <p>In other words, it was not necessary to search the phones in these cases without a warrant; it was simply easier. When it comes to the Fourth Amendment, the path of least resistance can often be the catalyst for a very slippery slope. However, the court agreed that none of the risks offered in <span class="casename">Chimel</span> or <span class="casename">Robinson</span> were present in these cases, and as such, there was no pre-existing search warrant exception for law enforcement to hang its hat on.</p>

                <p>These decisions show the court returning, in some sense, to the safeguards of the warrant requirement in regards to criminal investigations. This is great news following some recent head-scratching opinions. Hopefully, this new precedent will signal that the Supreme Court is not completely willing to fold in the face of technology which seems to advance exponentially every day. However, unless and until the court has an opportunity to examine and analyze the ever-expanding grip that growing technological advances will have on the protections offered by the Fourth Amendment, it will be up to criminal defense attorneys across the nation to rise to the occasion by vigorously protecting the privacy interests of their clients.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/directory/marjorie-cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of the Thomas Jefferson School of Law discusses the ongoing conflict in Gaza  ... </p><strong>B</strong></font>y sending vast amounts of military aid to Israel, members of the US Congress, President George W. Bush, President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel have aided and abetted the commission of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity by Israeli officials and commanders in Gaza. An individual can be convicted of a war crime, genocide or a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">crime against humanity</a> [PDF] in the International Criminal Court (ICC) if he or she "aids, abets or otherwise assists" in the commission or attempted commission of the crime, "including providing the means for its commission." </p>

<p>There is growing evidence that Israeli leaders and commanders have committed the following war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity as defined in the Rome Statute for the ICC. US military aid has aided, abetted and assisted the commission of these crimes by providing Israel with the military means to commit them. </p>

<p>During Operation Protective Edge, Israeli forces again used the Dahiye Doctrine, which, <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf">according to the UN Human Rights Council [Goldstone] Report</a> [PDF], involves "the application of disproportionate force and causing of great damage and destruction to civilian property and infrastructure, and suffering to civilian populations." </p>

<p>A summary of Israeli leaders' extensive crimes is presented below.</p>

<p><strong>US military aid to Israel</strong></p>

<p>According to the Congressional Research Service, in 2007, the Bush Administration agreed to provide Israel with <a href="http://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf">$30 billion</a> [PDF] in military assistance from 2009 to 2018, provided in annual increments of $3.1 billion. During his March 2013 visit to Israel, Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/03/21/remarks-president-barack-obama-people-israel">pledged</a> that the US would continue to provide Israel with multi-year commitments of military aid subject to the approval of Congress.</p>

<p>Since 2012, the US has <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/usa-stop-arms-transfers-israel-amid-growing-evidence-war-crimes-gaza-2014-0">sent</a> $276 million worth of weapons and munitions to Israel, not including exports of military transport equipment and high technologies. From January to May 2014, the US transferred to Israel almost $27 million for rocket launchers, $9.3 million worth of parts of guided missiles and nearly $762,000 for bombs, grenades and munitions of war.</p>

<p>On July 20, 2014, Israel <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/07/u-s-has-sold-ammunition-to-israel-since-start-of-gaza-conflict/">requested</a> additional ammunition, including 140mm tank rounds and 40mm illumination grenades, and the Defense Department approved the sale three days later. It came from a $1 billion stockpile of ammunition the US military stores in Israel for that country's use; it is called War Reserve Stockpile Ammunition-Israel. In early August 2014, both houses of Congress <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/congress-backs-225m-bill-to-replenish-israels-iron-dome-missile-defense/">overwhelmingly passed</a>, and Obama signed, an appropriation of $225 million for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, which has also been used in Gaza. The Senate vote was unanimous. With no debate, the House of Representatives voted 395 to 8 to approve the deal.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the crimes, as defined in the Rome Statute, Israeli leaders have committed and US leaders have aided and abetted:</p>

<p><strong>War crimes</strong></p>

<p>(1) <strong>Willful killing</strong>: Israeli forces have <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/08/07/gaza-children/13673931/]">killed</a> nearly 2,000 Palestinians (more than <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2014/7/21/palestinian_human_rights_lawyer_raji_sourani">400 children</a> and over 80% civilians). Israel used 155-millimeter artillery, which, <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/25442-as-palestinians-go-to-icc-human-rights-watch-alleges-israeli-war-crimes-for-shooting-fleeing-gazans">according to</a> Human Rights Watch, is "utterly inappropriate in a densely populated area, because this kind of artillery is considered accurate if it lands anyplace within a 50-meter radius."</p>

<p>(2) <strong>Willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health</strong>: Nearly <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.608892">10,000 people</a>, 2,500 of them children, have been wounded. Naban Abu Shaar <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/01/who-is-behind-gaza-s-mass-execution.html">told</a> the Daily Beast that the dead bodies from what appeared to be a "mass execution" in Khuza'a looked like they were "melted" and were piled on top of each other; assault rifle bullet casings found in the house were marked "IMI" (Israel Military Industries). UNICEF <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/world/middleeast/un-reports-dire-impact-on-children-in-gaza-strip.html?_r=0">said</a> the Israeli offensive has had a "catastrophic and tragic impact" on children in Gaza; about 373,000 children have had traumatic experiences and need psychological help. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2014/8/4/disgraceful_criminal_act_israel_condemned_as">said</a>: "There's a public health catastrophe going on. You know, most of the medical facilities in Gaza are non-operational."</p>

<p>(3) <strong>Unlawful and wanton, extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity</strong>: Tens of thousands of Palestinians have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/03/world/middleeast/assessing-the-damage-and-destruction-in-gaza.html">lost their homes</a>. More than 1,300 buildings were destroyed and 752 were severely damaged. Damage to sewer and water infrastructure has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/04/us-mideast-gaza-reconstruction-idUSKBN0G40PS20140804">affected</a> two-thirds of Gazans. On July 20, Israeli forces virtually flattened the small town of Khuza'a; one man <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/gaza/11012640/Gaza-conflict-360-degree-panorama-of-flattened-town-of-Khuzaa-Gaza.html">counted</a> 360 shell attacks in one hour. Reconstruction of Gaza is estimated to <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/palestinian-official-at-least-6-billion-to-rebuild-gaza/1970960.html">cost</a> $6 billion. Israel <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/05/gaza-buffer-zone-dennis-kucinich">shrunk</a> Gaza's habitable land mass by 44 percent, establishing a 3 km "no-go" zone for Palestinians; 147 square miles of land will be compressed into 82 square miles. Oxfam <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2014-08-01/gaza-crisis-spiralling-out-control">described</a> the level of destruction as "outrageous ... much worse than anything we have seen in previous [Israeli] military operations."</p>

<p>(4) <strong>Willfully depriving a prisoner of war or a civilian the rights of fair and regular trial</strong>: Nearly 2,000 Palestinians were arrested by Israeli forces during July 2014, <a href="http://samidoun.ca/2014/08/july-2014-over-1930-palestinians-arrested-by-occupation-forces/">according</a> to the Palestinian Prisoners Center for Studies. Prisoners include 15 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, about 240 children, dozens of women, journalists, activists, academics and 62 former prisoners previously released in a prisoner exchange. Israeli forces executed many prisoners after arrest, either by directly firing on them, refusing to allow treatment or allowing them to bleed to death. More than 445 prisoners are being held without charge or trial under administrative detention.</p>

<p>(5) <strong>Intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population, civilian objects, or humanitarian vehicles, installations and personnel</strong>: "The civilian population in the Gaza Strip is under direct attack," <a href="http://www.alternativenews.org/english/index.php/features/human-rights/8364-int-legal-experts-end-collective-punishment-in-gaza">reads</a> a joint declaration of over 150 international law experts. Israeli forces violated the principle of "distinction," which forbids deliberate attacks on civilians or civilian objects. Israeli forces bombed 142 schools (89 run by the UN), including six UN schools in which civilians were taking refuge. Israeli forces shot and killed fleeing civilians (warnings, which must effectively give civilians time to flee before bombing, do not relieve Israel from its legal obligations not to target civilians). Israeli forces repeatedly bombed Gaza's only power plant and other infrastructure, which are "beyond repair." Israeli forces <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=48395#.U-RBUIBdVBM">bombed</a> one-third of Gaza's hospitals, 14 primary healthcare clinics and 29 ambulances. At least five medical staff were killed and tens of others were injured.</p>

<p>(6) <strong>Intentionally launching attacks with knowledge they will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or long-term severe damage to the natural environment, if they are clearly excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage</strong>: The principle of "proportionality" forbids disproportionate and excessive civilian casualties compared to the claimed military advantage gained in the attack. The Dahiye Doctrine directly <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/it-is-a-war-crime-to-target-densely-packed-gaza-homes-1.1874825">violates</a> this principle. Responding to Hamas' rockets with 155-millimeter artillery is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/world/middleeast/international-scrutiny-after-israeli-barrage-strike-in-jabaliya-where-united-nations-school-shelters-palestinians-in-gaza.html">disproportionate</a>. Although nearly 2,000 Palestinians (over 80 percent civilians) <a href="http://my.firedoglake.com/fairleft/2014/08/04/1843-palestinians-67-israelis-killed-in-gaza-conflict-boycott-israel-bds-now-more-than-ever/">have been killed</a>, 67 Israelis (all but three of them soldiers) have been killed. The coordinates of all UN facilities were repeatedly <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/230160.htm">communicated</a> to the Israeli forces; they nevertheless <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/israel-bombs-yet-another-united-nations-school-killing-women-and-children/5394068">bombed</a> them multiple times. Civilians were <a href="http://www.alternet.org/media/american-media-finally-waking-truth-about-israels-assault-gaza">attacked</a> in Shuja'iyyah market.</p>

<p>(7) <strong>Attacking or bombarding undefended towns, villages, dwellings or buildings, or intentionally attacking religious, educational and medical buildings, which are not military objectives</strong>: On July 20, Israeli forces virtually flattened the small town of Khuza'a; one man <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/gaza/11012640/Gaza-conflict-360-degree-panorama-of-flattened-town-of-Khuzaa-Gaza.html">counted</a> 360 shell attacks in one hour. Israeli forces <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/world/middleeast/un-reports-dire-impact-on-children-in-gaza-strip.html">bombed</a> 142 schools (89 run by the UN), one-third of Gaza's hospitals, 14 primary healthcare clinics, and <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=48395#.U-RFC4BdVBM">29 ambulances</a>. Israeli shelling completely <a href="http://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/13229-israel-bombed-161-mosques-in-gaza">destroyed</a> 41 mosques and partially destroyed 120 mosques. </p>

<p><strong>Genocide</strong></p>

<p>(a) <strong>With the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group:</strong> Palestinians, including primarily civilians, and Palestinian infrastructure necessary to sustain life were deliberately targeted by Israeli forces.</p>

<p>(b) <strong>The commission of any of the following acts</strong></p>

<p>(i) <strong>killing members of the group</strong>: Israeli forces <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/israeli-airstrike-kills-militant-leader-before-unilateral-cease-fire/2014/08/04/7979b66d-e990-4009-8735-19c24e9538c0_story.html">killed </a>nearly 2,000 Palestinians.<br />
(ii) <strong>causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group</strong>: Israeli forces <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.608892">wounded</a> 10,000 Palestinians.<br />
(iii) <strong>deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its destruction in whole or in part</strong>: Israeli forces devastated Gaza's infrastructure, knocking out Gaza's only power plant, and destroying homes, schools, buildings, mosques and hospitals.</p>

<p><strong>Crimes against humanity</strong></p>

<p>(A) <strong>The commission of murder as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population</strong>: Israeli forces relentlessly <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/specialseries/2014/08/gaza-under-fire-one-month-20148720459697565.html">bombed</a> Gaza for one month, killing nearly <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/israeli-airstrike-kills-militant-leader-before-unilateral-cease-fire/2014/08/04/7979b66d-e990-4009-8735-19c24e9538c0_story.html">2,000 Palestinians</a>, more than 80 percent of whom were civilians. Israeli forces intentionally destroyed Gaza's infrastructure, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/middle-east-unrest/israel-strikes-fuel-tanks-gazas-only-power-plant-n167291">knocking out</a> Gaza's only power plant, and <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/rania-khalek/israel-deliberately-targeting-civilians-gaza">destroying</a> homes, schools, buildings, mosques and hospitals.</p>

<p>(B) <strong>Persecution against a group or collectivity based on its political, racial, national, ethnic or religious character, as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population</strong>: Israeli forces killed, wounded, summarily executed, and administratively detained Palestinians, Hamas forces and civilians alike. Israel forces intentionally destroyed the infrastructure of Gaza, populated by Palestinians. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/jordan-circulates-revised-resolution-gaza-24857584">said</a>: "the massive death and destruction in Gaza have shocked and shamed the world." He added the repeated bombing of UN shelters facilities in Gaza was "outrageous, unacceptable and unjustifiable." </p>

<p>(C) <strong>The crime of apartheid (inhumane acts committed in the context of an institutional regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over another racial group, with the intent to maintain that regime)</strong>: Ali Hayek, head of Gaza's federation of industries representing 3,900 businesses that employ 35,000 people, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/world/middleeast/after-conflict-gaza-industry-lies-in-ashes.html?_r=0">said</a>: "After 30 days of war, the economic situation has become, like, dead. It seems the occupation intentionally destroyed these vital factories that constitute the backbone of the society." Israel maintains an illegal barrier wall that encroaches on Palestinian territory and builds illegal Jewish settlements on Palestinian lands. Israel keeps Gazans caged in what many call "the world's largest open air prison." Israel controls all ingress and egress to Gaza, limits Gazans' access to medicine, subjects Palestinians to arbitrary arrest, expropriates their property, maintains separate areas and roads, segregated housing, different legal and educational systems for Palestinians and Jews and prevents mixed marriages. Only Jews, not Palestinians, have the right to return to Israel-Palestine.</p>

<p><strong>Collective punishment </strong></p>

<p>Although the Rome Statute does not include the crime of collective punishment, it is considered a grave breach of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/380">Fourth Geneva Convention</a>, which constitutes a war crime. Collective punishment <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marjorie-cohn/israel-palestine-collective-punishment_b_5589208.html">means</a> punishing a civilian for an offense he or she has not personally committed; it forbids reprisals against civilians and their property (civilian objects). </p>

<p>Ostensibly to rout out Hamas fighters, Israel has <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/rania-khalek/israel-deliberately-targeting-civilians-gaza">wreaked</a> unprecedented devastation on the people of Gaza, killing nearly 2,000 people (more than 80 percent of them civilians) and destroying much of the infrastructure of Gaza. This constitutes collective punishment.</p>

<p>On August 5, 2014, veteran Israeli military advisor Giora Eiland advocated collective punishment of Gaza's civilian population, <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/13255-israel-uses-media-incitement-to-justify-collective-slaughter-of-palestinians-in-gaza">saying</a>: "In order to guarantee our interests versus the other side's demands, we must avoid the artificial, wrong and dangerous distinction between the Hamas people, who are 'the bad guys,' and Gaza's residents, which are allegedly 'the good guys.'" That is precisely the strategy Israel has employed during Operation Protective Edge.</p>

<p>Israel's occupation of Palestinian lands also constitutes collective punishment. Israel maintains effective control over Gaza's land, airspace, seaport, electricity, water, telecommunications and population registry. Israel deprives Gazans of food, medicine, fuel and basic services. </p>

<p><strong>Prospects for criminal accountability</strong></p>

<p>Both Israel and the US have refused to ratify the Rome Statute. But if Palestine were a party to the statute, the ICC could exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed by Israelis and Americans in Palestinian territory. The ICC could also take jurisdiction if the UN Security Council refers the matter to the ICC, or if the ICC prosecutor initiates an investigation of the crime. The US would veto any Security Council referral to the ICC. And the ICC prosecutor has not initiated an investigation. So the question is whether Palestine can ratify the statute, thereby becoming a party to the ICC.</p>

<p>In 2009, the Palestinian National Authority filed a <a href="http://iccforum.com/media/background/gaza/2009-01-21_Palestinian_National_Authority_Declaration.pdf">declaration</a> [PDF] with the ICC accepting the court's jurisdiction. In 2012, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/israel-rejects-palestinian-authority-statehood-despite-un-resolution.php">recognized</a> Palestine as a non-member observer state. During the present war, the Palestinian minister of justice and the deputy minister of justice both submitted documents to the ICC indicating that the 2009 declaration is still valid. On August 5, 2014, the Palestinian minister of foreign affairs met with officials from the ICC and inquired about the procedures for Palestine to become a party to the statute.</p>

<p>On July 25, 2014, a French lawyer <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20140725-israel-icc-war-crimes-gaza-complaint-filed/">filed</a> a complaint with the ICC on behalf of the Palestinian justice minister. Citing Israel's military occupation of Palestinian territories, Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip and the ongoing military operations there, the complaint alleges that Israel committed war crimes and other crimes. The Palestinian government has not formally commented on this complaint.</p>

<p>On July 23, 2014, the UN Human Rights Council <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-wallance-gaza-unfair-un-resolution--20140729-story.html">established</a> a commission of inquiry into Israeli violations of international human rights and international humanitarian law. The resolution also called on parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to convene and respond to the alleged violations. That convention requires parties to prosecute violators. Countries can bring foreign nationals to justice for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity under the well-established doctrine of universal jurisdiction. Genocide charges could also be brought under the Genocide Convention, to which both Israel and the United States are parties. That convention also punishes complicity in genocide; US leaders' provision of military aid would constitute complicity.</p>

<p>Although the Israeli and US governments continue to maintain that Israel has only acted in self-defense against Hamas' terrorism, the weight of world opinion points in the opposite direction. There is overwhelming opposition to Israeli aggression in Gaza and calls for justice and accountability.</p>

<p>Both Israeli and US leaders must be criminally prosecuted for committing and aiding and abetting these crimes.</p>

		<title>A Bungling Barbarism: Court Baselessly Holds That Child Abuse, Used to Get Kids to Do Chores, Cannot Be Forced Labor</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.msu.edu/faculty_staff/profile.php?prof=8">Susan H. Bitensky</a> of Michigan State University College of Law discusses the error of the court's holding that using child abuse to make children do their chores cannot be forced labor ... </p><strong>P</strong></font>ity the poor children of Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, for they have come within the crosshairs of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On August 4, 2014, that court decided <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9032607792570597473&q">United States v. Toviave</a>, an extraordinary and unnecessary soul-murder of the innocents.</p>

<p>The facts giving rise to the case are that Toviave used physical violence (beating with broomsticks and the like) on the children in his custody to compel them to do household chores and homework. Michigan authorities considered the violence so extreme as to be child abuse and eventually removed the children from the house. Prosecutors went after Toviave for violating <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1589">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1589</a>, a forced labor statute. He was ultimately convicted under that provision in federal district court.  </p>

<p>The court of appeals reversed, holding that the guardian had not contravened the forced labor statute by using physical child abuse to coerce performance of these tasks. <em>Reductio ad absurdum</em>, the holding means that for those within the geographic boundaries of the court, &#167; 1589 protects adults from physical violence used to force their labor and, at the same time, denies protection to juveniles from such violence when used by a parent or guardian for the same purpose. This principle controls regardless of the severity or grotesquery of the physical violence inflicted on minors. This principle controls regardless of whether the child suffers injury or death due to the violence. This principle, at its most benign, dehumanizes children with the message that they are not worthy of protection from violence.</p>

<p>In order to fully understand the opinion of the court, it is important to be clear on what &#167; 1589 says and does not say. The provision states, in pertinent part, that whoever knowingly obtains the labor of another person by means of force is criminally liable. The court asserted as a reason for reversal the following interpretation of &#167; 1589: "forcing children to do household chores cannot be forced labor without reading the statute as making most responsible American parents and guardians into federal criminals." However, the statute is silent on types of labor and ages of victims. This should signify, of course, that the statute criminalizes forced labor even if the labor consists of housework and even if the laborer is a child.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the court's rationale quoted above contains a disturbing underlying assumption, i.e., that the great majority of responsible American parents and guardians employ physical child abuse to make children do their chores. <span class="casename">Toviave</span> turns out to be unexpectedly evenhanded when it comes to disparagement, managing to both diminish children and malign their parents and guardians.</p>

<p>The court's second reason for its holding is the conceit that if child abuse were to qualify as a means of forcing labor that violates &#167; 1589, then "the forced labor statute would federalize the traditionally state-regulated area of child abuse." What the court seems to be saying is that there is a conflict between Michigan statutes criminalizing physical child abuse and the federal forced labor statute which also criminalizes physical child abuse (as per appellee's legal theory) insofar as said abuse is used to force a child's labor. The court apparently perceived the conflict to lie in the federal statute's trenching upon the state statutes by usurping some physical child abuse for federal prosecution. The court opined that in this situation state law must prevail. That conclusion is far-fetched in the <span class="casename">Toviave</span> context. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/preemption">Preemption Doctrine</a> dictates that where such a conflict exists, it is federal law which prevails if the conflict concerns a subject area, like forced labor, constituting a dominant interest of the national government.</p>

<p>To add insult to sophistry, the court also misuses and misrepresents US Supreme Court precedent. The <span class="casename">Toviave</span> opinion cites <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8832526571245844043&q">United States v. Kozminski</a> for the proposition that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiii">Thirteenth Amendment</a> was not intended to govern the right of parents and guardians to the custody of their minor children or wards. This is true. It is true too that Toviave did lose custody. But the Thirteenth Amendment was not dealt with by <span class="casename">Toviave</span> as a claim or defense, rendering the Amendment irrelevant to the merits of the <span class="casename">Toviave</span> litigation. Just to set the record straight, the guardian lost custody at the hands of state authorities; nor does the federal forced labor statute under which he was convicted authorize loss of custody as a remedy. </p>

<p>The court's chutzpah in relying on <span class="casename">Kozminski</span> unfortunately does not end there. <span class="casename">Kozminski</span> is a statutory involuntary servitude case. The Kozminskis used physical abuse, among other coercive techniques, to keep two adult, mentally-retarded males at work on the perpetrators' farm. The Supreme Court affirmed the Kozminskis' conviction pursuant to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1584">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1584</a> and a federal conspiracy statute. The former enactment makes it a crime to hold a person in or sell a person into involuntary servitude. The Justices construed "involuntary servitude" in &#167; 1584 as a crime entailing the element of coercion, including physical coercion. Ergo, the forced labor statute and the involuntary servitude statute parallel each other in this regard. Moreover, on the facts, <span class="casename">Toviave</span> and <span class="casename">Kozminski</span> both involved defendants' infliction of physical coercion to compel the victims' work. The opposite results in <span class="casename">Toviave</span> and <span class="casename">Kozminski</span> thus cannot easily be reconciled, and the cases cannot be distinguished in any legally significant way.<br />
 <br />
One wonders what the <span class="casename">Toviave</span> judges thought they were doing. Their errors in the case are embarrassingly basic and numerous; but if they are not bona fide mistakes, then what on earth was the court's agenda? What could have possibly motivated the court to go so far to cheapen children's lives, cast ugly aspersions on American parenting and, in the final analysis, betray the integrity of the judiciary?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benweinberger">Ben Weinberger</a> of <a href="http://www.phoenixbs.com/home.aspx">Phoenix</a> discusses the international protection of data in the cloud...</p>

                <p>In a recent proceeding before the US Court, Microsoft was ordered to turn-over email belonging to a user of its hosted mail service. That email belonged to a user outside the US. The email itself was located on a server in a data center in Ireland&#8212;outside the US, which should be out of the reach of US authorities and subject to the requirements of the EU privacy laws. Microsoft challenged the order and lost. They argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over this particular data as it was stored outside the US, and therefore it was not subject to disclosure. They were wrong.<br />
                    <br />
                    On April 25, 2014, Magistrate Judge James C. Francis of the Southern District of New York issued a memorandum and order upholding a subpoena ordering Microsoft to turn-over information held on a server in a datacenter in Ireland. Microsoft had contested the subpoena and argued that courts in the United States do not have jurisdiction and therefore are not authorized to issue a warrant for an "extraterritorial search and seizure." Relying upon the Stored Communications Act (the "SCA"), passed as part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (the "ECPA") and codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2701-2712, the judge <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1149373-in-re-matter-of-warrant.html">found</a> that, even when applied to information that is stored in servers abroad, an SCA warrant does not violate the presumption against extraterritorial application of American law and therefore denied Microsoft's motion to quash the subpoena. <br />
                    <br />
                    Though the judge relied upon the SCA in making his determination, he also cited the Patriot Act as evidence of legislative intent to not limit jurisdiction, which is the crux of the issue. He recognizes and relied upon the fact that Microsoft is a US business&#8212;and, more so, that it has a US presence from which it has access to the data on the servers in Ireland (regardless of where that data itself is stored, which is where he relies on a provision of the Patriot Act for clarification). As a US business, Microsoft is subject to US jurisdiction and laws. Arguably, Microsoft might not have to have been a US business for the court to have reached the same conclusion.<br />
                    <br />
                    Whereas the facts of this ruling do not lend themselves to suggesting that the US government would have unlimited jurisdiction over electronic information, in theory, the court's finding does suggest that any business operating in the US could be subject to the same warrant/subpoena power regardless of where its data resides. Thus, it could very readily extend to any hosted/service provider with a US presence, regardless of where their data centers are sited and regardless of where their customer data is stored. In essence, a company providing a hosted service (be it email, finance, document management, whatever) anywhere in the US could be subject to the same demand to turn-over customer data of an EU customer, regardless of whether that data is held solely on document servers located within the EU. Therein lies the challenge such a ruling now presents to EU and other jurisdictions' data protection laws.<br />
                    <br />
                    In a blog post on his website, a colleague of mine commented on this case in regards to its Safe Harbor implications. Interestingly enough, I would suggest that it doesn't actually violate the Safe Harbor privacy<br />
                    principles. While my colleague correctly states that the purpose of the Safe Harbor provisions is in fact to facilitate commerce between the US and EU, what is missed is the actual requirement (or lack thereof) of that agreement. First and foremost, participation is voluntary. Second, and perhaps more important, is that, its goal is protection of personal data from unreasonable disclosure. In regards to the Federal Court ordering Microsoft to turn-over data, it was to be turned-over to the US government. Regardless of whether that disclosure meets the various criteria (including notice, choice, security, etc.), it's arguable that, as the receiving party is the US government, the disclosure would not violate the agreement. Regardless, even if it did violate that agreement, there has been ongoing debate about the efficacy and legitimacy surrounding the Safe Harbor agreement that was raised shortly after it was first established; the conclusion that was reached in that other blog commentary&#8212;that the Safe Harbor provisions never really meant much&#8212;probably is correct and further validates that exact debate. This holds true at least with regard to the extent of protection afforded individuals relying upon their data remaining strictly within the EU and not being subject to disclosure beyond its borders. The Safe Harbor provisions exist explicitly to accommodate that transfer of data.<br />
                    <br />
                    This takes us back to the obvious question&#8212;that, in a modern world, where the internet connects everyone and everything, well beyond borders, is it really reasonable to expect that data in one jurisdiction will only remain in that jurisdiction and not be accessible or discoverable outside that jurisdiction? In reality and in light of what we know today of various governmental entities and their international surveillance programs&#8212;not to mention hacking (be it state-sponsored or otherwise), the answer is probably "no." So, what are the implications of that?<br />
                    <br />
                    The <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/advice/practice-notes/cloud-computing/#cc5">UK Law Society</a> and the <a href="http://www.sra.org.uk/documents/solicitors/freedom-in-practice/cloud-computing-law-firms-risk.pdf">SRA</a> [PDF] have issued guidance on the use of "cloud" technologies. While they are not completely proscriptive, they do provide advice and guidelines that, presumably, create certain expectations.<br />
                    <br />
                    In essence, the Law Society states that any cloud solution must comply with the Data Protection Act of 1998 ("DPA"). The considerations of this law on the adoption of cloud technologies are <a href="http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/guidance_index/~/media/documents/library/Data_Protection/Practical_application/cloud_computing_guidance_for_organisations.ashx">summarized</a> by the information commissioner's office on their site and include a variety of recommendations. Some of the key elements of this act addressed by the ICO include: the use of encryption of data in transit and at rest; prevention of unauthorized access to client data by the cloud providers' personnel; and, access to data by intelligence agencies. The document on their site gives general guidance and recommends a variety of measures to be employed to safeguard data placed into the cloud. The ICO specifically notes that the DPA requires that personal data "shall not be transferred to any country or territory outside the European Economic Area (EEA) unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data." Arguably, as the US and EU created the Safe Harbor agreement, this statement could readily be interpreted to mean that it is assumed that the US meets those specific criteria such that a mandated disclosure of personal data to the US government is not in violation of those laws.<br />
                    <br />
                    Further, all of the various provisions make reference to guidelines in contractual agreements. There are few steadfast rules with regard to how data is treated and communicated that mandate specific contractual obligations. Companies can meet the requirements of the DPA and various other regulations as may be called for by the Law Society or SRA and still have contractual language that could very likely contradict or otherwise limit the protections intended. Though, in essence, vendors do have to provide some very precise protections, the regulations and guidance are not so strict as to prohibit or preclude the type of data transfer and disclosure that was ordered in the instant scenario.<br />
                    <br />
                    So, what does all this mean? At the very least, I'd suggest it means that, a firm that is truly 'worried' about their data not leaving the EU (and many seem to be) perhaps will think twice about where that data is and where it may end-up. Taken to the extreme, I think firms outside the US (especially those within the EU) who are worried about their data being accessed by the US will probably want to avoid using ISP's or hosting providers (software as a service providers or otherwise) with ANY presence within the US. While that may seem a bit excessive, given the instant facts and the relevant guidance, it's completely plausible to expect that data held and hosted by a company with presence in both the US and EU will certainly be subject to the same disclosure: if the hosting company has access to it from the US, it could be subject to the same requirement to disclose for the same reason. That won't stop these firms from building infrastructure to accomplish the same purpose (mobility, accessibility, etc.) or adopting technologies (such as a private cloud) that will prepare them for the eventual move to a hosted/cloud environment. Regardless, as the decision isn't about technology, but, more so the overall business need and value (what is gained and at what price, especially considering factors such as the total cost of ownership), firms will add this to their list of considerations when choosing whichever technology posture they feel is most appropriate.<br />
                    <br />
                    Whether or not this potential for disclosure will have the effect of dissuading firms from adopting various technologies and platforms today or in the near or distant future remains to be seen. For those firms who want to adhere to a more strict interpretation, they may choose to avoid various cloud providers with regard to placing client data into their data centers. Those firms will not necessarily be limited with regard to the functionality they provide their end-users as the concept of cloud computing, in and of itself, offers no functional advantage over on premises solutions (accessibility of data/programs, disaster recovery, business continuity, etc.)&#8212;it merely offers a different financial model and a shifting of the management from an internal to an external resource (which, again, in that regard, an owned yet externally managed service also accomplishes if that is a preferred option).<br />
                    <br />
                    Policies change&#8212;and regulations evolve. As such, this concern over where data resides and whether or how it is discoverable will change. It remains to be seen how firms&#8212;and providers&#8212;will react to this most recent development.<br />

		<title>How US Government Surveillance Threatens Attorney-Client Privilege</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/author/alex-sinha">G. Alex Sinha</a> of <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> discusses US government surveillance and the attorney-client privilege</p>

                <p>American lawyers have been concerned for some time that the legally protected space for attorney-client communications is shrinking. But recent reports detailing massive electronic surveillance by the US government suggest truly confidential communications may largely be a thing of the past. </p>

                <p>Documents leaked to the press over the past year by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden reveal that the US government is sweeping up vast amounts of private data and communications, including confidential information related to ongoing legal matters and privileged communications between attorneys and their clients.</p>

                <p>In researching a new report over the past year, I interviewed over 40 attorneys and data security experts covering a range of legal practice areas to find out what impact, if any, these revelations have had on their work. Many expressed the concern that surveillance fears were undermining their ability to represent their clients effectively.</p>

                <p>"I feel ethically obligated to tell all clients that I can't guarantee anything [they] say is privileged . . . or will remain confidential," a defense attorney specializing in national security and terrorism cases told me. Another has begun including a bolded auto-signature in her work-related emails: "Warning: Based on recent news reports, it is possible that the NSA is monitoring this communication."</p>

                <p>A number of lawyers said that not being able to guarantee the privacy of their conversations makes it much harder to build trust with their clients, and makes clients less willing to speak fully and frankly, complicating efforts to devise an effective legal strategy. "If your clients see you uncomfortable communicating, they may resist telling you everything," observed one federal defender handling a terrorism case.</p>

                <p>Some attorneys I spoke with are also nervous about falling short of their professional responsibilities to maintain confidentiality around their clients' information, which can include an explicit obligation to take positive steps to protect the confidentiality of information concerning their clients and cases. According to some experts in legal ethics, as the implications of large-scale surveillance sink in, unguarded use of conventional technologies for communicating with clients and storing information may become impermissible (if they haven't already).</p>

                <p>In an effort to protect their communications and data, some attorneys have started changing their practices, turning to technologies like encryption, air-gapped computers isolated from the Internet and disposable  "burner" phones. Another favorite technique is to use less technology, and trying to do more work face-to-face. One federal defender described meeting a client in person on the weekends to prepare a case&#8212;rather than communicating electronically during the workweek. As one prominent national security defense attorney, told me, summing up the changes: "Nobody practiced law like this 15 years ago unless you were a crook."</p>

                <p>How effective any of these countermeasures are is hard to say, since there is still much we don't know about the nature and scope of US government surveillance.</p>

                <p>Concerns are especially pronounced in contexts where the US government is an opposing legal party&#8212;and especially those where the government might have an elevated interest in the work of defense counsel, such as cases related to terrorism. As one prominent public interest lawyer put it, fear of government surveillance makes sense in part because the government that holds all of the surveillance information is also "the adversary we're worried about."</p>

                <p>But the issue is not limited to the federal terror defense bar. Attorneys at corporate law firms may feel insulated from US surveillance, accustomed as those firms are to guarding against hacking by individuals or foreign governments. Yet a recent episode suggests that such confidence may be at least somewhat misplaced. Last February, the New York Times reported on the surveillance of attorneys at Mayer Brown, a major global law firm. While the attorneys were representing the government of Indonesia in a trade dispute with the US, Australian intelligence services picked up some of their communications with their client, and offered the results of that surveillance to the US.</p>

                <p>NSA officials maintain that the agency is "firmly committed to the . . . bedrock legal principle of attorney-client privilege" and point to rules (called "minimization procedures") that are designed to limit the collection and use of privileged information. But the strongest known NSA rules for protecting privileged communications vacuumed up under Section 702 of FISA apply only to a limited subset of privileged communications (and not at all to confidential information more generally). Specifically, the rules apply to communications "between a person who is known to be under criminal indictment in the United States and an attorney who represents that individual in the matter under indictment...." Even there, the government can retain privileged communications even after recognizing they are privileged, and can make use of (broadly defined) "foreign intelligence information" that it gleans from those communications before realizing they should be specially protected. Some advocates worry that minimization procedures are even weaker for collection of information under other surveillance authorities, such as Executive Order 12,333.</p>

                <p>A number of legal groups, including the American Bar Association, the New York City Bar Association, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the National Lawyers Guild, have begun to wrestle with the issues raised by surveillance through outreach to government officials, amicus briefs, training webinars and reports.</p>

                <p>But the legal community needs to do more. Legal organizations should band together and demand a full ban on the acquisition, retention, dissemination or use of protected attorney-client communications. We are all united by fidelity to the core values of the profession, which includes a long-standing recognition of the protections for the attorney-client relationship. Such values are essential to the right to counsel, and when they come under attack, we are all obliged to respond.</p>

		<title>Kurdistan: Time to Make Good on a 95-Year Old Promise</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="https://law.creighton.edu/directory/michael-kelly">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law makes the historical legal case for a change in US policy on Kurdistan ... </p><strong>H</strong></font>aving existed through millennia of foreign dominance and occupation, hard by the Zargos mountains, Kurds have a saying older than our country.  "The Kurd has no friend but the mountain." Now is the time for Washington to change its policy of a unified Iraq and support Kurdish independence. Now is the time to show the Kurds they have a friend who will stand with them. Military operations by the US in northern Iraq have begun that could pave the way for this long-delayed eventuality.</p>

<p>US airstrikes against ISIS and air drops for trapped Yazidi and Christian minorities in northern Iraq are legal under the <a href="http://www.oas.org/dil/1948_Convention_on_the_Prevention_and_Punishment_of_the_Crime_of_Genocide.pdf">1948 Genocide Convention</a> [PDF], which obligates member states to prevent and punish genocide. US military actions to protect these minority groups are in furtherance of the "prevent genocide" prong of that multilateral treaty.  According to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/07/world/iraq-options/">UN estimates</a>, over 200,000 members of these groups are now fleeing into Iraqi Kurdistan as ISIS advances on Erbil, the Kurdish capital city, under threat of death by ISIS forces.  Many of those minority groups are also ethnically Kurdish. By extension, these airstrikes also protect Iraqi Kurdistan as the safe haven for those groups.</p>

<p>The US has a long-standing obligation to protect the Kurds, and it will not allow the Kurdish capital to fall to ISIS. Ever since the US encouraged the Kurdish uprising of 1991, but then failed to support it as Saddam savagely crushed the Kurds, American foreign policy has been geared to protect Iraq's Kurds. Consequently, despite this betrayal, the Kurdish government and people are the most ardent supporters of the US in the Middle East outside Israel. Yet the Kurds continue to exist under the control of other states; such has been their collective political fate for almost a century.</p>

<p>It is time for the US and the international community to make good on a 95-year old promise that the Kurds have their own state. Like the Armenians, the Kurds were promised a homeland in the aftermath of World War I. Upon the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Allied Powers outlined an independent state for the Kurds in 1920 through the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/sevres/part3.html">Treaty of Sevres</a>. However, the rise of Ataturk during the ensuing Turkish War of Independence and his alliance with Lenin spelled the end of independence for both the Armenians and the Kurds. Not wanting another conflict, Britain and France replaced the Treaty of Sevres with the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Treaty_of_Lausanne.html">Treaty of Lausanne </a>in 1923, dividing the Kurdish population outside Persia among the new states of Syria, Iraq and Turkey. The US was not a party to either peace settlement as America was never technically at war with the Ottomans during the First World War.</p>

<p>A population of 30 million spread over an area the size of France, Kurds were victims of this legal double-cross and still do not have a country of their own. The Kurds of northern Iraq have functionally been a state since the US established a "no-fly" zone over their territory to exclude Saddam Hussein's forces from massacring them after 1991.  While a de facto state with an independently functioning government, economy, border control, military and educational and healthcare system, the Kurds remain formally part of the Iraqi federation. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, US policy has favored a unified Iraqi state with a federal power-sharing structure; not independence for Kurdistan. The time has come to abandon this outmoded idea. Facts on the ground have dramatically shifted and American foreign policy on Iraq must catch up to this new reality. The Shiite dominated Maliki government in Baghdad has collapsed and Iraq is reforming itself into a new configuration. Washington needs to be ahead of this reformation, not behind it trying to support the preservation of what is quickly becoming a failed state.</p>

<p><img alt="kurdish" src="http://jurist.org/images/wiki/14/08/kurdish.jpg" width="735" height="600" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p>Located in the mountainous convergence of Iran, Turkey, Syria and Iraq, an independent Kurdistan would be a strategically important platform for US foreign diplomatic and defense policy in the Middle East and would establish a new player in the region on the international stage that could alter the formula in favor of stability in the Middle East.  Last month, the Israeli Prime Minister <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/29/israel-prime-minister-kurdish-independence">called for</a> the establishment of an independent Kurdish state. Israel and Kurdistan are natural allies against various combinations of Arab Sunni and Shiite factions that have long been arrayed against them. Kurdistan has recently begun shipping petroleum through a pipeline out of Turkey from the reserves it controls, and Israel has received four of these shipments. American diplomatic efforts would only benefit from the addition of Kurdistan to the ranks of Israel and Turkey as its most dependable allies there.</p>

<p>That said, territorial guarantees must be made reassuring Turkey and Iran that the Kurdish areas in those states would not join a newly independent Kurdistan. Turkey and Iran have traditionally been opposed to a Kurdish state carved out of northern Iraq for fear of losing the Kurdish parts of their own territories. Yet both have developed lucrative cross-border trade relationships during the past 20 years with Iraqi Kurdistan and have come to view the area as stable and reliable. Syria has also opposed an independent Kurdistan for the same reasons, but that is irrelevant at this point. Almost as irrelevant as the current American policy on Iraq is becoming.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Sacha Baniel-Stark, <a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu">New York University School of Law</a> Class of 2016, discusses the botched execution of Joseph Wood and analyzes the dissenting opinion from the denial of Wood's motion to stay his execution, which argued that capital punishment by lethal injection is fundamentally flawed...</j:header><strong>O</strong>n July 23, 2014 a man lay, strapped to a table, unable to move, as for nearly two hours men injected him with <a href="http://rt.com/usa/177568-arizona-execution-wood-blotched/">15 doses of drugs</a> meant to kill him. It sounds like the opening scene from a gruesome episode of Law &#38; Order, but in fact the description above is of the state-sanctioned execution of Joseph Wood. </p>

<p>Capital punishment has not always been permitted in this country. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3510234117314043073">Furman v. Georgia</a>, the US Supreme Court effectively ruled the death penalty unconstitutional, stating that because of untrammelled discretion in the system, being sentenced to death was essentially random and therefore was "cruel and unusual" under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> to the US Constitution. Many states were quick to change their death penalty statutes in light of the Court's decision, and in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15950556903605745543">Gregg v. Georgia</a>, the Supreme Court re-allowed capital punishment under new, modern regimes. </p>

<p>Since the reinstatement of the death penalty, methods of execution have evolved, perhaps in part driven by Eighth Amendment considerations: The Eighth Amendment, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4755107314332030951">according to the Supreme Court</a>, is meant to "embody the evolving standards of decency of a maturing society," and "broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency against which we must evaluate penal measures." Wood, who was sentenced to death for a crime he committed in 1989, was executed with a mix of drugs that was used in a botched execution in Ohio earlier this year. Despite controversy over the drug, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/death-row/2014/05/28/arizona-inmates-execution-date-set-court/9696547/">permitted</a> Wood's execution to go forth.</p>

<p>The botched execution of Wood joined the botched execution in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/16/ohio-killer-executed-with-new-lethal-drug-combo/4512651/">Ohio</a> and two botched executions in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/06/16/autopsy-finds-failure-to-place-iv-properly-during-botched-oklahoma-execution/">Oklahoma</a> to become at least the fourth botched execution so far this calendar year. All four have raised questions about the efficacy of lethal injection protocols; the manner of execution is often kept confidential and approved drugs are quickly expiring, raising significant concerns about what drugs are being used and how states are getting them. (For a recap of some of these issues, see Kimberly Newberry's June 2014 <a href="/dateline/2014/06/kimberly-newberry-lethal-injection.php">JURIST piece</a>.)</p>

<p>Wood's case, however, has created some unique waves, even in this fraught area of law. Before his execution, Wood moved to stay the execution, arguing that he and others had a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> right to know the protocol that would be used to kill him. The motion was ultimately denied, but along the way Alex Kozinski, Chief Judge of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, had occasion to <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2014/07/21/14-16310.pdf">weigh in on the issues</a> (PDF) that are plaguing the system today. </p>

<p>Judge Kozinski's opinion, a dissent from the denial of <em>en banc</em> review of Wood's motion to stay his execution, argued that capital punishment by lethal injection is fundamentally flawed and that we as a society ought to return to execution by firing squad. Judge Kozinski's argument has three main reasons for this: First, "attacks" to executions will continue so long as lethal injection is used because of the secrecy surrounding drugs and execution protocols. Second, lethal injections are less effective than other, more seemingly primitive methods; Judge Kozinski favors the guillotine and death by firing squad, ultimately concluding the latter is favored because it is 'foolproof' but would still be relatively socially acceptable. Third, Judge Kozinski argued that if we are to put people to death&#8212;and it is a "we," for criminal prosecutions are done in the name of the people and criminal punishments are authorized on our behalf&#8212;we should do so without allowing ourselves to fall victim to the charade that executions are calm and dignified events. As he stated, "if we are willing to carry out executions, we should not shield ourselves from the reality that we are shedding human blood."</p>

<p>Certainly, if execution protocols remain secret, defendants&#8212;and their lawyers and advocates&#8212;will likely continue to seek release of the information. To the extent that such moves have been <a href="http://thelensnola.org/2013/07/29/execution-protocol-requires-drug-be-kept-but-state-cant-produce-records/">successful in the past</a>, they will likely continue and, as Judge Kozinski states, such litigation bogs down the legal system.</p>

<p>Judge Kozinski's other contentions seem partially right, but partially off-base. It is the case that lethal injections are "botched" at a rate higher than some other, more 'primitive' forms of execution. On the whole, executions are botched at a rate of <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120529133458.htm">approximately three percent</a>, with lethal injections botched at a rate <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/30/lethal-injection-leads-to-the-most-botched-executions.html">closer to seven percent</a>. But earlier methods of execution, including the firing squad, are not foolproof. There are <a href="http://deathpenalty.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=001623">records</a> of at least two executions by firing squad that were botched in Utah, one of last states to allow the firing squad (which interestingly, at the time, led contemporary critics to suggest that a reversion to the guillotine might be called for). To the extent that Judge Kozinski turns away from "the electric chair, hanging and the gas chamber [because they] are each subject to occasional mishaps", firing squads fall to the same concern.</p>

<p>Judge Kozinski's other contention&#8212;that if we are to carry out executions we ought not shield ourselves from the fact we are shedding human blood, and from their brutality&#8212;is more nuanced and, at some level, leads to more trouble. </p>

<p>The backlash from Wood's execution shows an interesting psychological phenomenon that is not unknown to those who advocate on behalf of convicted and otherwise disadvantaged populations. There are people who truly revel in the horror that was wrought upon Wood and take value from the gruesome nature of executions. A <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2014/07/24/arizona-execution-joseph-wood-eyewitness/13083637/">quick read of comments</a> on the news coverage of Wood's botched execution reveals it. </p>

<p>Certainly, there are people from whom callous disregard, or even revelry in suffering, is expected and understandable. This certainly can include the survivors of the deceased victims of the crimes, as it did in this case. It may even include average members of the American population who comment or post about executions, as in the article provided above. But it also includes individuals like Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, who <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/lethal-injection/arizona-execution-joseph-wood-took-nearly-two-hours-n163086">stated</a> that in comparison to his victims, Wood didn't suffer.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that there is no space in Eighth Amendment analysis for a comparative amount of suffering. States are not permitted to torture people, even if those people tortured their victims. When the governor of a state putting people to death feels comfortable making such comparisons, the system is suffering from more than illusion about the peacefulness of death&#8212;it is suffering from a fundamental misunderstanding of how, and why, executions are permitted to occur. The condemned are to be free from "cruel and unusual punishment"&#8212;regardless of how cruel and unusual their crime.</p>

<p>To the extent that people simply refuse to believe that a condemned person suffers during the act of execution, it's not clear that a shift from injection to firing squad will be of much assistance. Similar sentiments&#8212;that the death is fast and relatively painless, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/05/17/utah-lawmaker-proposes-bringing-back-firing-squads-for-executions/">for instance</a>&#8212;can be lodged against death-by-firing-squad. </p>

<p>There's an interesting flipside to Judge Kozinski's argument, as well: There is perhaps nothing that illustrates the brutality of execution more clearly than botched executions. Perversely, if botched executions occur as frequently as they have over the past year with lethal injections, this may do a better job of raising awareness of the messiness of execution than any alternative method of execution could. This, of course, lays aside the point that we shouldn't use a system that is easily botched&#8212;which is the main thrust of Judge Kozinski's argument.</p>

<p>This leaves us with the question of what system of execution can, or should, be adopted. If the goal is to have a "foolproof" system, as Judge Kozinski suggests firing squads would be, we're probably just out of luck: mishaps have always <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/botched-executions-since-1890/2014/04/30/33206a14-d07d-11e3-a6b1-45c4dffb85a6_story.html">marred our system</a> of capital punishment including in the modern, post-<span class="casename">Furman</span> <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/some-examples-post-furman-botched-executions">era</a>. So in a system that will likely always suffer from mistakes, where the legal standard is supposed to be one that disallows torture and evolves with a "maturing society," what is the best way to proceed? As Chief Judge Kozinski stated, and as has been <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/07/arizona_botched_execution_of_joseph_r_wood_iii_lethal_injection_secrecy.2.html">underscored</a> by commentators, pretending executions are peaceful and easy when they are not is detrimental. But opting for a method that shines the light on the violent nature of execution will not, in and of itself, suffice. States may not carry out torture; if the best alternative we have is honest torture that in any event is not foolproof, then it's not immediately clear that that alternative&#8212;firing squads&#8212;passes constitutional muster. And if we take seriously legal tenets against retribution, torture and cruel and unusual punishment&#8212;as well as the Supreme Court's exhortation that the Eighth Amendment embodies ideals beyond just outlawing outright barbaric punishment&#8212;the road forward becomes much less clear and our problems cannot be solved simply by a return to the methods of the past. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www1.law.wne.edu/faculty/index.cfm?selection=doc.9735&uid=79">Lauren Carasik</a> of Western New England University School of Law discusses what appears to be the politically motivated charges against former president Jean Bertrand Aristide of Haiti ... </p><strong>T</strong></font>he latest chapter in a long series of preliminary legal actions against Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has generated a series of standoffs. Outside Aristide's house in the suburb of Tabarre, his supporters have gathered several times in the past weeks to protest announced efforts to arrest him and have usually been dispersed with tear gas by Haitian police and UN soldiers. Inside the Courthouse Judge Lamarre Belizaire <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Haiti-judge-orders-arrest-of-former-president-Aristide">insists</a> that the police execute an arrest warrant he issued on August 14, while his chief judge issues <a href="http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/134762/Aristide-le-mandat-damener-suspendu-ou-encore-debout.html">contradictory statements</a> about whether the effort to have him recused&#8212;now before Haiti's Cour de Cassation (Supreme Court)&#8212;affects the warrant's validity. In the court of public opinion, Aristide's lawyers&#8212;who have not been allowed any hearings or access to the case file&#8212;argue that the Judge Belizaire is an illegally-appointed judge following a deeply flawed process to harass an opponent of the government that named him.</p>

<p>Judge Lamarre Belizaire issued the August 14 arrest warrant after Aristide failed to appear to answer a summons issued the day before, on what Aristide's lawyers contend are politically-motivated, time-barred charges. Mario Joseph, head of the <em>Bureau des Avocats Internationaux</em>, claims the summons was never <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/relief-and-reconstruction-watch/will-former-president-aristide-be-arrested-after-10-years-of-investigations-he-has-never-been-charged">properly served</a> and that Aristide never received it. The criminal investigation centers on allegations of corruption, criminal conspiracy, money laundering and misappropriation of funds during Aristide's presidency that ended with a US-backed coup more than a decade ago.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that Aristide has been the target of charges that are brought with public fanfare and then dropped before Aristide has an opportunity to challenge the allegations. Aristide's supporters claim the repeated legal actions are aimed at discrediting him and Fanmi Lavalas, the country's most popular political party, that he founded, and intended to undermine a free and fair electoral process in Haiti. </p>

<p>Aristide's lawyers Mario Joseph and Ira Kurzban claim the charges are wholly fabricated and reflect Belizaire's bias. Belizaire, who was appointed by President Michel Martelly, has a history of using his judicial role to pursue Martelly's political enemies. This practice led the country's Bar Association to suspend him for ten years, starting when he steps down from the bench. Joseph and Kurzban echo the concerns of others who suggest that the meritless charges were manufactured to hinder elections scheduled that have been overdue since 2011, when Martelly became president. Joseph also believes the reports were calculated to <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/08/12/4286011/authorities-haitian-fugitive-clifford.html">distract the public</a> from the jailbreak of over 300 prisoners, including Clifford Brandt&#8212;a member of one of Haiti's wealthiest families with ties to the government, who is suspected in a number of high profile kidnappings&#8212;from a maximum security facility outside of Port-au-Prince on August 10; he has since been recaptured. Others have suggested that sullying Aristide's reputation diverts attention from the prosecution of former dictator Jean Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier for financial malfeasance and crimes against humanity. Aristide's lawyers have also filed a precautionary measures (injunctive relief) petition to the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a>, seeking to protect Aristide from the abuse of state power.</p>

<p>Aristide, the country's first democratically-elected president, has maintained a low profile since returning to Haiti from forced exile in 2011, focusing on education and health care for the country's impoverished masses. Yet he symbolizes a popular grassroots mobilization that those with a tight grip on the reins of power appear to find threatening.  </p>

<p>Haiti has seen more than its share of hardship and deprivation. The 2010 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and the cholera epidemic that followed on its heels continue to ravage the country, compounding endemic poverty and corruption. The 2011 election that brought Martelly into power was held less than a year after the catastrophic quake, in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. The voting process was <a href="http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/haitis-doctored-elections-seen-from-the-inside-an-interview-with-ricardo-seitenfus">widely contested</a>: Martelly, who has ties to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/in-haiti-the-former-dictator-duvalier-thrives/2012/01/13/gIQAaYbM6P_story.html">Duvalier</a>, only triumphed after an unprecedented intervention by the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/default.asp">Organization of American States (OAS)</a> (more specifically, by the US, France and Canada) and with Fanmi Lavalas barred from participating, in an election that was widely boycotted by political parties and voters.</p>

<p>Legislative elections had been <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/140611/haiti-announces-legislative-elections-october-0">scheduled</a> for October 26 of this year, but Haiti's electoral authority announced on August 11&#8212;two days before the Arsitide summons&#8212;that they will now need to be delayed yet again. Since the 2011 elections, the terms for elected local officials and one-third of senators' seats have already <a href="http://www.ijdh.org/2014/07/topics/politics-democracy/frequently-asked-questions-about-haitis-upcoming-elections/">expired</a>. The shortage of seated senators has paralyzed the legislative process since the open seats allow a small number of senators to defeat a quorum. Martelly has appointed "municipal agents" to fill the vacant mayoral seats.</p>

<p>Another third of the Senate seats and the 99-member House of Deputies will be vacant next year if elections are not held this fall. The process of implementing the constitutionally-mandated Permanent Electoral Council tasked with overseeing elections has been fraught with delays and controversy. Various civic groups point out that Martelly has benefitted from missteps in setting up the council. Without elections this year, Martelly will further consolidate his grip on power, and with only a third of the senate remaining, the legislative process would grind to a standstill.</p>

<p>The investigation into alleged wrongdoing by Aristide follows an all-too familiar pattern. The Haitian government first <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE3D9173EF937A35752C1A9639C8B63">filed</a> a civil suit against Aristide and several co-defendants in the US District Court of the Southern District of Florida in November 2005. The Haitian government, which had come into power following the 2004 coup, and the US government held a series of press conferences and briefings about the case, generating extensive media attention. Yet despite the apparent enthusiasm for, and investment in, the case, Haitian authorities never served the complaint on Aristide or any of the other defendants. Aristide was in South Africa at the time, complicating the process of serving him with the complaint, but other defendants were living openly in Florida. The Haitian government sought one extension to serve the defendants, but declined to seek another, eventually requesting that the case be <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/118988716/Haiti-Vs-Aristide-Notice-of-Dismissal">dismissed</a> just before the service deadline. This was more than six months after the initial filing and the Haitian government retained the right to re-file the complaint. After the enthusiastic media campaign to publicize the suit, critics questioned the government's motivation in bringing and then dismissing the case. Charges brought in Haiti against Aristide in 2005 on the same charges were dismissed in April 2006, after a judge found that the government failed to submit the case to the appropriate court.  </p>

<p>The current investigation is the third time the Haitian government has pursued a criminal complaint against Aristide in 20 months. Each time, the warrant was leaked to the press before being served on the former president. The first time, in January 2013, the charges were so patently unjustified that when Aristide's lawyers pushed back, the prosecutor dropped the case after trying to save face by canceling the formal hearing and conducting an informal interview at Aristide's house. The case backfired politically, as the informal interview was seen as an embarrassing capitulation. Aristide was targeted a second time for investigation, in May 2013, in the investigation of the April 2000 murder of journalist Jean-Dominique. Aristide was properly summoned, and attended the hearing, as 10,000 of his supporters protested outside. Lacking any merit to the allegations, the prosecutor let that case drop as well.</p>

<p>Mention of Aristide's imminent arrest engenders widespread media attention. Yet the press reports on these events uncritically: the stories neglect to mention the past initiatives that were summarily abandoned, give scant attention to the procedural irregularities that taint the charges and fail to contextualize the judge's documented history of partisan behavior. This is not a new tactic for the Haitian government. US State Department cables released by Wikileaks <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/relief-and-reconstruction-watch/will-former-president-aristide-be-arrested-after-10-years-of-investigations-he-has-never-been-charged">suggest</a> that previous arrest warrants for Aristide were also politically motivated&#8212;and supported by top UN officials&#8212;aimed at dampening support for the deposed leader. International meddling in Haitian politics reinforces the entrenched power structure. A statistical analysis of the 2011 election by the Center for Economic and Policy Research demonstrated that the OAS <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/press-releases/press-releases/oas-overturned-haitian-presidential-election-in-a-qpolitical-interventionq-new-cepr-paper-suggests">intervention</a> on behalf of Michel Martelly was unwarranted. </p>

<p>Given the Haitian government's pattern of charging Aristide when it is politically expedient to do so, the decade old allegations are likely to resurface even if the current investigation is not pursued. Until Haiti's government fosters the conditions for a free and fair democracy, the descendants of the first country to throw off the shackles of slavery will continue to face bleak conditions.</p>

		<title>Military Firearms in Ferguson and Beyond: Arms Transfers to Civilian Law Enforcement Under the &amp;apos;1033 Program&amp;apos;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.avemarialaw.edu/faculty/profile/Kevin.Govern">Kevin Govern</a> of <a href="http://www.avemarialaw.edu">Ave Maria School of Law</a> in Naples, Florida, discusses the Department of Defense Excess Property Program&#8212;commonly known as the '1033 Program'&#8212;under scrutiny for the recent events in Ferguson, Missouri and concludes that this will result in stricter delineations concerning military cooperation than ever before... </p>

<p>Last year, JURIST <a href="/forum/2013/05/kevin-govern-posse-comitatus.php">highlighted</a> the notable subject of the <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_28.pdf">Defense Support for Civil Authorities</a> [PDF], in the context of man-made and natural disasters. A variety of historic laws and policies are the foundations for providing defense support to civilian authorities. One law garnering very little public scrutiny before the Fall of 2014&#8212;but tremendous media coverage since&#8212;is the <a href="http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/pages/1033programfaqs.aspx">Department of Defense Excess Property Program</a>, commonly referred to as the '1033 Program.' The '1033 Program' is primarily oriented towards counter-drug activities, but sometimes leads to very different capabilities and employments.</p>

<p>Section 1208 of <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/101/hr2461/text">The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1990</a>, allowed the Secretary of Defense to:<blockquote>[T]ransfer to Federal and State agencies personal property of the Department of Defense, including small arms and ammunition, that the Secretary determines is-- (A) suitable for use by such agencies in counter-drug activities; and (B) excess to the needs of the Department of Defense."</blockquote></p>

<p>The law further provided that:<blockquote>2) The Secretary shall carry out this section in consultation with the Attorney General and the Director of National Drug Control Policy.<br />
(b) Conditions for Transfer-The Secretary of Defense may transfer personal property under this section only if-<br />
(1) the property is drawn from existing stocks of the Department of Defense;<br />
(2) the recipient accepts the property on an as-is, where-is basis;<br />
(3) the transfer is made without the expenditure of any funds available to the Department of Defense for the procurement of defense equipment; and<br />
(4) all costs incurred subsequent to the transfer of the property are borne or reimbursed by the recipient.</blockquote></p>

<p>In 1996, Congress replaced Section 1208 with Section 1033 that subsequently became <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section2576a&num=0&edition=prelim">Section 2576a</a>, yet is still colloquially called the '1033 Program' through the present. </p>

<p>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) <a href="http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/default.aspx">notes</a> that "[s]ince its inception, the '1033 Program' has transferred more than $5.1 billion worth of property. In 2013 alone, $449,309,003.71 worth of property was transferred to law enforcement." As part of its outreach to civilian agencies, the DLA predicted that, "[i]f your law enforcement agency chooses to participate, it may become one of the more than 8,000 participating agencies to increase its capabilities, expand its patrol coverage, reduce response times and save the American taxpayer's investment.</p>

<p>Critics of the program, such as the ACLU, have <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform-free-speech/terrify-and-occupy">remarked</a> that "a disturbing range of military gear [is] being transferred to civilian police departments nationwide" and allege that "one-third of all war materiel parceled out to state, local and tribal police agencies is brand new."</p>

<p>Accountability problems are also surfacing as 184 state and local police agencies have been <a href="http://fusion.net/leadership/story/americas-police-departments-lose-loads-military-issued-weapons-984250">reportedly suspended</a> from participating in the Pentagon's '1033 Program' for losing weapons or failing to comply with other stipulations. Notably, on August 26th the nationally-known sheriff of Maricopa County, Joe Arpaio, <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2014/08/26/mcso-weapons-pentagon-suspension-1033/14659089/">admitted</a> that his department had been suspended from the program and is currently missing nine firearms&#8212;eight .45-caliber pistols and one M-16 rifle&#8212;issued to the agency out of 200 weapons from the surplus program. Twenty to 22 of the weapons vanished over the years, but roughly half were recovered from retired or current deputies who, incredibly, took them home. Under the '1033 Program,' the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office amassed an arsenal of "a Hummer, a tank, 90 M-16 rifles, 116 .45-caliber pistols, 34 M-14 rifles and three helicopters."  </p>

<p>This '1033 Program,' coupled with National Guard troops deployment to Ferguson, Missouri, became the subject of <a href="https://www.aclu.org/aclu-response-ferguson">critical medial focus</a> in August 2014. Following the police shooting of the teenager Mike Brown, the Ferguson Police Department responded to protests and riots with a robust show of force, using gear that <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/mittens-not-m4s-what-ferguson-police-really-got-from-the-pentagons-1033-program">one media outlet</a> documented as not obtained through the '1033 Program', yet <a href="http://www.latinpost.com/articles/20109/20140827/immigration-ferguson-missouri-militarization-maricopa-county-police-raise-concerns-1033.htm">others</a> speculated to the contrary.</p>

<p>In response to calls for a 'demilitarization' of civilian police forces, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/ferguson-missouri-in-wake-of-clashes-calls-to-demilitarize-police.html?_r=0">said</a> "[a]t a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community...I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message." </p>

<p>On Friday, August 15th, Senate Armed Services Chair Carl Levin (D-MI) <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/carl-levin-senate-review-military-transfers-1033">called for a review</a> of the so-called '1033 Program,' saying:<blockquote>Congress established this program out of real concern that local law enforcement agencies were literally outgunned by drug criminals. We intended this equipment to keep police officers and their communities safe from heavily armed drug gangs and terrorist incidents. Before the defense authorization bill comes to the Senate floor, we will review this program to determine if equipment provided by the Defense Department is being used as intended.</blockquote></p>

<p>Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial & Contracting Oversight, also announced she will lead a hearing, observing that:<blockquote>We need to de-militarize this situation&#8212;this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution. I obviously respect law enforcement's work to provide public safety, but my constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests and the police need to respect that right and protect that right. Today is going to be a new start, we can and need to do better.</blockquote></p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, President Obama <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/us/in-washington-second-thoughts-on-arming-police.html?_r=0">ordered</a> a "comprehensive review of the government's decade-old strategy of outfitting local police departments with military-grade body armor, mine-resistant trucks, silencers and automatic rifles," according to media interviews of senior officials.</p>

<p>Early on August 21st, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/21/jay-nixon-national-guard_n_5698038.html#821_the-toll-on-michael-browns-family">announced</a> that the National Guard&#8212;which was brought in to provide security for the police command center&#8212;would be withdrawn from Ferguson; this withdrawal began the next day, some five days after being dispatched to help "quell the unrest" and four days before the burial of Michael Brown.</p>

<p>These recent developments&#8212;along with Congressional review of the surplus Department of Defense military equipment program&#8212;will lead to even stricter delineations than ever before regarding military cooperation with civil authorities, while still focusing on preparation, partnerships and vigilance.</p>

		<title>The Immigration Court is a Legal Paradox</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2014/09/geoffrey-hoffman-immigration-court/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Geoffrey Hoffman, of the <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/">University of Houston Law Center</a>, discusses the problems that the immigration court creates for unaccompanied alien children...</p><strong>T</strong>he law is no stranger to paradoxes, contradictions and strange coincidences. Immigration courts however present a special case of legal paradox. As an attorney representing immigrants in removal proceedings, one comes away feeling that the respondent is caught up in the process as either a non-participant or a quasi-party, effectively cut off from the process in important ways. Moreover, immigration law has grown increasingly complex, expanding like an ever-growing coral reef. The recent effort by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/">Executive Office for Immigration Review</a> to push unaccompanied alien children to the forefront of immigration judges' dockets to expedite their removals without legal counsel in the vast majority of cases is a deprivation of due process on a vast scale and further evidence of our broken immigration court system.<br />
 <br />
A paradox is a good lens through which to view the problematic nature of immigration adjudication. Immigration courts and adjudicators are required to apply byzantine laws, rules, regulations, practices and policies. It is well-recognized that these laws have become increasingly more difficult to apply year after year. A paradox also has the added benefit of capturing the twin poles of US immigration law: enforcement on the one hand and family unity and the granting of benefits on the other. The paradoxical nature of immigration adjudication presented in the foreground may be compared to the larger, overarching paradox looming in the background that we as a "nation of immigrants" feel compelled to ramp up enforcement at the expense of due process and other constitutional protections. The paradox is compounded by an administration's simultaneous and contradictory intentions in granting deferred action to childhood arrivals, calling for more "humane" deportation and pushing for much needed immigration reform on the one hand and at the same time sacrificing due process by prioritizing the removal proceedings of unaccompanied children. To the government's <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/press/2014/JusticeAmeriCorpsRelease06062014.html">credit</a>, it has announced a program in conjunction with <a href="http://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps">AmeriCorps</a> to provide grants to fund approximately 100 "lawyers and paralegals" to potentially help unaccompanied minors in removal proceedings.<br />
 <br />
In thinking about the many paradoxes which arise in the immigration courts, it is also useful to consider the law's unintended consequences. The concept of law's "revenge effects" is an apt analogy. In studies of technology, it is well-documented how technological "innovation" can lead to disaster in society. Similarly, even well-intentioned laws many times end up making matters worse for immigrants and their families. Laws can negatively affect the target of the legislation, immigrants, as well as citizens and even society as a whole. Even the current immigration reform proposals now pending in Congress contain severe revenge effects. These include vast border militarization plans, increased fines and penalties for immigrants and hidden and not-so-hidden costs which may negatively impact immigrants and their families.<br />
 <br />
Many of the paradoxes so ingrained in immigration adjudication can be traced to the central presupposition that removal is a civil versus a criminal proceeding. This largely unquestioned assumption has served to insulate removal proceedings from the important constitutional protections widely guaranteed to criminal defendants. The lack of constitutional safeguards affect a wide array of rights including access to counsel, rules of evidence and discovery, i.e., access to information in government files.  <br />
 <br />
While many courts pay lip service to the de facto punitive consequences of deportation and detention of immigrants, there is also a line of Supreme Court cases which affirms that removal proceedings are merely civil in nature. The paradox lies in the demotion which "decriminalizes" deportation at the expense of the rights of the accused or in this case of the rights of the respondent "charged" with grounds of inadmissibility and/or removability. The paradox has become even more acute recently with the sharp rise in recent year in prosecutions of immigrants for illegal immigration-related activity such as <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1325">illegal entry </a>and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1326">illegal reentry </a>after an order of deportation.<br />
 <br />
This core paradox is at the root of a comment made by a sitting immigration judge, Hon. Dana Marks that immigration <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/judges-union-immigration-courts-alternate-legal-universe-n190216">adjudication</a> is like doing "death-penalty cases" in a traffic-court setting. This is no idle quip. It contains a deep insight. The procedure which should be in place for cases with such grave consequences is ill-equipped to guarantee the level of substantive fairness we expect and demand from a US court.<br />
 <br />
It is no overstatement that deportation cases represent in many cases "banishment" from family members, friends, employment&#8212;in short from a life in the US. Many judges, legislators and members of the public are unaware of the seriousness of this aspect of deportation&#8212;the so-called "permanent bar" where (in some cases) no waiver may be possible for a set period. The bar to reentry may be 20 years in certain cases where a person has been deported more than once or it may truly be a lifetime bar in cases where specific type of criminal conviction preceded removal. In many cases, where an immigrant should not be barred but is nevertheless denied entry at a consulate, there is absolutely no review under the doctrine of consular non-reviewability.<br />
 <br />
There is no question that immigration law's twin poles of enforcement and relief make for puzzling applications. These twin goals undergird executive and legislative decision-making that appear at best contradictory or paradoxical and at worst counterproductive or illogical. The immigration court system is especially prone to this kind of unfairness. The least capable of obtaining immigration counsel are those with the least funds and resources; for example, detained juveniles. Such children are often those with favorable claims, such as "special immigrant juveniles," or even asylum seekers. How many out there were denied the chance to stay in the US by the simple fact that an attorney was not by their side to raise a valid claim against deportation in their defense?<br />
 <br />
Retention of an attorney of course does not guarantee relief. However, the statistics tell a very compelling story regarding the importance of good counsel. Perhaps in no other area is having an attorney so crucial. According to <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/359/">Syracuse</a> University, in almost half the cases in which a child was represented, the court allowed the child to remain. Interestingly, where the child appeared alone, without representation, nine out of ten children were ordered removed.<br />
 <br />
Among adults, consider that those most able to afford an attorney (those who have resources as long-time permanent residents or even as long-term undocumented persons who may have had jobs and other ties) also may have strong claims for cancellation of removal or other relief. Then consider that those who may need an attorney the most, those with the most difficult cases who have entered most recently or who are minors, may be relatively speaking the least financially able to afford counsel. Though their need for counsel is greater, their ability to find private counsel is greatly diminished. Recently, a <a href="http://www.nwirp.org/news/viewmediarelease/40064">federal court</a> in Seattle, Washington has been asked to certify a nationwide class to block the government from pursuing removal of children unless they are ensured legal representation.<br />
 <br />
Other fundamental aspects of immigration adjudication have historically fostered and motivated paradoxes and contradictions. On one side of the equation there are concepts which have been used by courts to solidify and amplify power on the part of the immigration decision-makers: the so-called "Plenary Power Doctrine" giving Congress wide latitude in fashioning laws affecting immigration and also the deference afforded by Supreme Court precedents, like <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14437597860792759765&q">Chevron</a>, among other cases, to administrative agency decisions. These two powerful considerations stand as backdrops in many cases tilting the scale in favor of governmental action and authority. On the other hand, these doctrines are not absolute and have been chipped away to some extent in a series of cases, where the Supreme Court has recognized that exceptions exist to the "Plenary Power Doctrine." In addition, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/biainfo.htm">Board of Immigration Appeals</a> has also opened up avenues for relief in asylum cases under appropriate circumstances involving <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/intdec/vol26/3811.pdf">domestic violence</a> and for other vulnerable populations but has been resistant to gang violence cases. But even for asylum cases premised on a particular social group impacted by gang violence, it is <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/intdec/vol26/3795.pdf">important</a> to note that the Board has not completely foreclosed such claims brought on behalf of children or adults.<br />
 <br />
The immigration judges themselves are speaking up and rightly so. As catalogued in a recent news article, the judges' union itself has pointed out that the immigration court is an "<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/judges-union-immigration-courts-alternate-legal-universe-n190216">alternate legal universe</a>." This "alternate universe" language is an appropriate reference. In other US courts, the dangers of <em>ex parte</em> communications are recognized and guarded against, due process is protected by clear and consistent evidentiary rules, and dockets cannot be determined based on the whim of one party to the litigation. The legal paradoxes of immigration adjudication have not redounded to anyone's benefit and especially not for unaccompanied alien children. For them, the system's flaws have exacerbated an already tragic and desperate situation. If ever we do implement much-needed immigration reform, the immigration courts should be the first system to be redesigned, revamped and reformed. A process where the children could make claims as refugees outside the US is another approach and one which would alleviate some of the burden on the immigration court. We must address the needs of these unaccompanied children and to fail to do so is a failure not just of our immigration system but of our entire constitutional scheme.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/graeme-reid">Graeme Reid</a>, of <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a>, discusses the weakening of LGBT rights in international law ...</p>

<p><strong>F</strong>or lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people the law is a paradox. The law can operate as an instrument of repression and control, but also as a tool for resistance and liberation. We find fragments of our collective histories in court records. Here we find a sorry history of people in countries across the world convicted of loitering, sodomy, cross-dressing or so-called "crimes against nature." </p>

                <p>For a vulnerable minority, and an unpopular one, domestic and international law has proven to be an indispensable tool, sometimes the only tool, for LGBT people to claim a space in the world. Two decades ago in a 1994 case, the UN Human Rights Committee in  <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/html/vws488.htm">Toonen v. Australia</a> asserted the right to privacy for same-sex consenting adults under  international law. In 1998, South African courts <a href="http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1998/15.html">repealed</a> the Immorality Act and five years later, in 2003, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas</a> saw the remaining sodomy laws in the US declared unconstitutional. </p>

                <p>Yet some 76 countries around the world maintain discriminatory LGBT laws. Britain exported its sodomy laws to the empire, where many remain in force. <correction num=1>These laws not only hold the threat of arrest and prosecution, but have other profound implications for LGBT people as well.</correction> Even in the many countries where sodomy laws are seldom enforced, such as India and Uganda, they still symbolize national discrimination against LGBT people.</p>

                <p>Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/topic/lgbt-rights">has reported</a> these laws are routinely used for blackmail and extortion, in settings as diverse as <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2014/01/29/they-said-we-deserved">Kyrgyzstan</a>, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/16/jamaica-letter-prime-minister-simpson-miller">Jamaica</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/uganda-president-signs-anti-gay-bill-into-law.php">Uganda</a>. Such laws contribute to a climate of prejudice and hostility in which violence occurs with impunity.  The passage of the <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/russia-lawmakers-approve-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">anti-propaganda laws</a> in Russia led to a peak in violence against LGBT people. In Nigeria, the immediate effect following the enactment of <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/nigeria-anti-gay-law-draconian-un-rights-chief.php">draconian legislation</a> was mob violence against gay men. The law in these places means that LGBT people must live a shadow existence under the threat of violence.</p>

                <p>What seldom gets talked about is the psychological impact on individuals. The archaic language of these laws; "the abominable crime of buggery" as the Jamaican law <a href="http://www.ecc.gov.jm/Downloads/Child-Laws/The%20Offences%20Against%20the%20Person%20Act%20-%201864.pdf">reads</a>, the more delicate language of "the love that dare not speak its name" or vague reference to "carnal knowledge against the order of nature," casts a shadow over desire and the most personal expression of human intimacy. Read through the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/12/india-supreme-court-reinstates-gay-sex-ban.php">judgment</a> of the Indian Supreme Court ruling that upheld the sodomy law: the language of family and kinship is reserved for heterosexual marriage, while for homosexuals the language is one of body parts engaged in sexual acts.  </p>

                <p>A Nigerian activist in Abuja recently told me a story about how, when she visited London, someone had asked her about the situation back home.  She said she instinctively withdrew to a corner and spoke in hushed tones, before thinking,  "What am I doing?"  She had already internalized a fear of being noticed.  What cumulative effect does this have on self-esteem and self-worth?  </p>

                <p>Sodomy laws have historically been used for political purposes. In France in 1307, King Philip IV brought <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3704138">sodomy accusations</a> against the Order of the Knights Templar and dissolved it.  The reason - he was heavily indebted to the Knights at the time. In England, King Henry VIII promulgated the <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/englaw.asp">Buggery Act in 1533</a> then promptly accused Roman Catholic monks of sodomy and used that as an excuse to confiscate their monastic lands. He also disposed of his opponent Lord Hungerford by executing him for sodomy in 1540.  </p>

                <p>Such tactics are still in use. The progress, passage and <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/uganda-ag-appeals-decision-against-anti-gay-law.php">fate</a> of the Ugandan Anti-Homosexuality Act has as much to do with political intrigue within the ruling party and President Yoweri Museveni's fluctuating popularity as it has to do with homosexuality. Vladimir Putin wears a mantle of traditional and family values as political armor that works for him domestically, and also internationally as he takes the stage on an anti-Western ticket. In Malaysia, the political opposition is kept in check by recurrent accusations of sodomy against opposition leader <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/malaysia-appeals-court-finds-opposition-leader-guilty-of-sodomy.php">Anwar Ibrahim</a>. And in Zimbabwe we can tell an election is coming just by monitoring the level of homophobic rhetoric emanating from the ruling party. </p>

                <p>Anti-gay laws are seldom just about homosexuality. Homophobia is both a reality and a ruse. Increasingly it is being used as an instrument of political repression. Laws that ban  "propaganda,"  "promotion" or support of LGBT groups are so vague and sweeping that they threaten fundamental freedoms of association and expression. And it is not only LGBT groups that are at risk. The recent wave of anti-LGBT legislation that seeks to outlaw not only sexual practice but also public expression of identity is almost invariably accompanied by broader attacks on activism, on political opposition and on the ability of local organizations to receive foreign funding.   </p>

                <p>This is playing itself out at a national level, but it is also evident internationally. At the UN, Russia is leading an aggressive charge against the rights of LGBT people under the rubric of "traditional values." <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/0/8CD55D75F7FAEA3D44257C9100593FDF">Speaking</a> on the crisis in Ukraine at the UN Human Rights Council in March, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov caricatured recent advances in basic human rights for marginalized people as resulting from "[s]upporters of ultraliberal approaches, supporting all-permissiveness and hedonism, requesting a revision of moral values." </p>

                <p>Similarly with a push for more limited language on "the family" and an emphasis on the rights of the family as an entity, rather than the individuals who make up the family, the Russian government and its allies are pushing for a concept of human rights that protects the group over the individual. This rhetoric and practice creates a false dichotomy and pits "tradition" against human rights. LGBT rights are the wedge issue, but at stake are the basic principles of international human rights law: that human rights are universal, inalienable and indivisible. </p>

                <p>So we should not fool ourselves into thinking that this is only about the rights claims of a vulnerable minority. The well-known adage that the way a society treats its minorities is a good measure of its democracy rings particularly true. What seems distinct about this particular time in our history is the way in which the rights of LGBT people have become a lightening rod for competing visions of the world.   </p>

                <p>Using homophobia for political ends is as old as the law itself. What has changed is that this is playing itself out on an international level and is becoming the language for articulating two very different visions of the world, one in which human rights are seen as a value to be cherished and upheld, the other in which human rights are seen as a profound threat.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Christina Piecora, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a>, Class of 2015, is the author of the first article in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law/academic-programs/student-journals/journal-civil-rights-and-economic-development">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Piecora discusses possible solutions to the issue of sexual assault against female inmates...</j:header><strong>I</strong>magine a young woman handcuffed as a large man beats and rapes her so forcefully that it results in her rectum being torn. Imagine her pained cries that go unanswered and ignored. Imagine that after hours of this vicious assault she is left in a bloody heap on the floor. In all likelihood, this deplorable act of violence makes you angry and disgusted. However, does your reaction change if you learn that the victim was wearing a prison jumpsuit? Does it, or should it, make you any less enraged or any less willing to help? These are the questions that confront American society, as it becomes harder to ignore what Congress has labeled an "epidemic" of <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/us-commission-proposes-prison-rape.php">sexual assault in America's prisons</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, there are over 200,000 women <a href="https://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights/women-prison">imprisoned</a> in the US. According to Human Rights Watch at least <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2007/12/15/us-federal-statistics-show-widespread-prison-rape">15 percent</a> of incarcerated females have been the victims of prison sexual assault. These assaults occur at the hands of prison staff and other inmates. </p>

<p>Males are the perpetrators in 98 percent of <a href="http://www.wcl.american.edu/endsilence/documents/CrossGenderSupervisioninPrisonsandtheConstitutionalRightofPrisonerstoRemainFreeFromRape.pdf">staff-on-inmate sexual assault</a> (PDF] of female inmates. Forty-one percent of guards in the average state female correctional center are male, a job that entitles them to perform strip searches and have access to prisoners in their most vulnerable states. Therefore, although women comprise only 7 percent of the state prison population, they comprise 46 percent of sexual abuse victims. Male prison officials not only use force and violence to commit sexual assault against female prisoners but also use their positions to coerce, threaten and intimidate inmates into sexual activity. Thousands of documented accounts exist of prison staff demanding sex in exchange for drugs, favors and access to educational programs. Similarly, prison officials often use threats of going to the parole board with false reports of bad behavior, planting drugs on prisoners or withholding basic necessities such as feminine hygiene products or visitation with children if inmates do not perform sexual acts. While these acts are repugnant, prison officials are not the only perpetrators of sexual assault against female inmates. </p>

<p>The rate of <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/pdca12.pdf">inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization</a> [PDF] is at least 3 times higher for females (13.7%) than males (4.2%). This has been attributed to the fact that a majority of prison officials do not view female-on-female sexual assault as "true rape," making them less likely to reprimand inmates. Furthermore, as the female prison population has grown at a dramatic rate, states have been unable to keep up. Therefore, female prison facilities tend to be overcrowded and poorly designed, making them difficult to police. </p>

<p>In addition to cross-gender supervision and poorly designed facilities, prison sexual assault against females is prevalent because little punishment exists to deter perpetrators. Victims are often blocked from bringing charges against prison staff who were either complacent or the culprits in their attacks by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1997e">Prison Litigation Reform Act</a> (PLRA). The PLRA requires prisoners to exhaust all administrative remedies before they are allowed to file suit in federal court to challenge prison abuses. For victims this means that they must report their abuse to the very people committing or facilitating that abuse. Thus, inmates who complained of staff sexual misconduct were punished <a href="http://www.justdetention.org/en/listserv/2012/051712_2.aspx">46.3 percent</a> of the time. </p>

<p>Additionally, victims must meet an incredibly high burden of proof to substantiate a constitutional claim. The Eighth Amendment establishes the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. However, for victims to establish a violation of their <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> rights they must prove that the prison official had a "seriously culpable state of mind" by satisfying the subjective deliberate indifference test. The test requires that the prison official must (1) "both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists" and (2) "also draw the inference." For victims, the difficulty lies in proving that prison administrators were aware of the risk and ignored it. In applying the test courts have severely limited the liability of prison officials.</p>

<p>Another reason for the high incidence of prison sexual assault is the limited oversight of state prisons. Recently the federal government made history by passing the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/15601">Prison Rape Elimination Act</a> (PREA). The PREA implemented national standards for the detection, prevention and punishment of prison rape. However, the PREA standards only apply federally. Thus, because state and local facilities confine the majority of inmates, most inmates are not protected by the PREA standards.</p>

<p>There are a number of steps we can take to better protect inmates from the horrors of sexual assault. First and foremost states need to adopt the PREA standards. Congress can incentivize states to do so by withholding or increasing federal grant money. Additionally, while the PREA was a good first step, many other provisions can be incorporated to make it more effective. These provisions should address prison overcrowding, establish a national hotline where prisoners can anonymously report sexual abuse and create a national taskforce to investigate prisons with high incidences of sexual assaults. </p>

<p>Additionally, I propose that Congress adopt a statute entitled the Protecting Vulnerable Inmate Populations Act (PVIP). PVIP would prohibit non-violent first offenders from being placed with violent offenders, mandate that all correctional staff in female prisons be trained to interact specifically with female inmates and allocate funding to help modernize female correctional facilities to make them easier to police and monitor. </p>

<p>Furthermore, no legal roadblocks should stand in the way of victims getting the justice they deserve. Therefore, the PLRA should be amended to allow for suits without exhausting administrative remedies when a sexual assault claim exists. Additionally, the US Supreme Court should make the deliberate indifference standard an objective standard, which would only require victims show that a reasonable person would have been aware of the risk and ignored it.</p>

<p>The epidemic of prison sexual assault will not be cured overnight. However, these proposed measures will move us closer to eliminating the horrible problem. We need to demand government action. For every moment we just stand by more vulnerable women are being victimized. </p>

		<title>Winning Marriage Equality: Neither Everything Nor the Only Thing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.temple.edu/pages/faculty/n_faculty_carpenter_main.aspx">Leonore Carpenter </a>of Temple University Beasley School of Law discusses the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit's opinion in two same-sex marriage cases and where the LGBT legal rights movement should be heading in the wake of marriage equality<br />
 ... </p><strong>E</strong></font>arlier this month, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued a rather remarkable opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3799443173115877763&q">Baskin v. Bogan</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11205026391935193161&q">Wolf v. Walker</a>, two same-sex marriage cases from, respectively, Indiana and Wisconsin. As many commentators have already noted, the unanimous opinion, penned by the inimitable Judge Richard Posner, was a ringing victory for the gay and lesbian plaintiffs, and followed less than two weeks on the heels of an oral argument that was something of a bloodbath for the states' attorneys. Posner, one of the most highly respected federal judges in the nation (and not a man known for his left-wing bent), skewered the states' reasons for prohibiting same-sex marriage as essentially unserious and incapable of passing even the most deferential form of constitutional scrutiny. </p>

<p>The court's opinion and oral argument, remarkable as it is, is simply the latest in a nearly unbroken string of well over a dozen same-sex marriage wins at the federal district level since the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609&q">United States v. Windsor</a> in the summer of 2013 (which held that the federal government cannot constitutionally withhold marriage benefits to same-sex couples who are validly married). Many of those victories have been quite decisive, featuring sweeping opinions that invoke <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5103666188878568597&q">Loving v. Virginia</a> and echo the language of the African-American civil rights movement. </p>

<p>I offer my home state of Pennsylvania as an example of the scope of many of these victories. In May of this year, Pennsylvania became the nineteenth state to legalize same-sex marriage, after Honorable John Jones of the Middle District of Pennsylvania ruled in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8827557605779650532&q">Whitewood, et al v. Wolf</a>, that Pennsylvania's Defense of Marriage Act (PA-DOMA) violated the US Constitution. Not only did Jones hand same-sex marriage advocates a win, he predicated that victory on a determination that sexual orientation is a quasi-suspect class and that statutes that discriminate based upon sexual orientation are consequently entitled to heightened scrutiny. </p>

<p>Jones, in ruling that PA-DOMA should be subject to heightened scrutiny, did not rely upon established precedent within the Third Circuit, but instead adopted the reasoning of the Second and Ninth Circuits, as well as numerous assorted district courts and state courts that had previously considered the question. Thus, Jones' decision was not only a win for the plaintiffs, it provided a strengthened foundation for constitutionally based lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights claims in the Third Circuit going forward.</p>

<p>But the Pennsylvania victory extended beyond the pages of the opinion itself. A mere two days after the decision in <span class="casename">Whitewood</span> was handed down, Pennsylvania governor Tom Corbett&#8212;a Republican governor who has been unfriendly to LGBT issues in the past&#8212;issued a statement asserting that his administration would not even appeal the ruling. The governor's decision, coupled with the fact that Jones did not stay his decision pending even the thirty-day appeal period, meant that same-sex couples in Pennsylvania were immediately able to obtain marriage licenses and recognition of out-of-state marriages.</p>

<p>The LGBT civil rights movement has come to model itself over the last two decades, both in terms of legal strategy and in terms of rhetoric, on the African-American civil rights movement. The movement has turned its attention from the protests and direct grassroots action that marked the political response to the AIDS crisis, and has chosen instead to invest enormous amounts of time and capital fighting against formal inequality in the courts. The centerpiece of that campaign against formal inequality, for better or worse, has been the fight for legal recognition of same-sex relationships. Victories like the ones I've discussed demonstrate the unquestionable success of a decades-long marriage equality impact litigation strategy.</p>

<p>But let's be clear&#8212;a victory for a same-sex marriage <em>strategy</em> does not equate to lived, real equality for actual LGBT <em>people</em>. For decades, legal scholars have noted, often in the context of race, that formal equality schemes do not perfectly address the lived inequality of minority groups. Formal equality is, without more, a limited instrument to achieve real change in the lives of citizens. And that is just as true for LGBT citizens as it has been for many African Americans in the decades since <span class="casename">Brown</span>, <span class="casename">Loving</span>, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>

<p>First and most obviously, marriage only matters if you <em>want</em> to be married.  For single people, polyamorous families and those who are philosophically opposed to the institution of marriage, marriage equality does not fix much. In fact, as some scholars have noted, those who do not wish to marry may soon find themselves under greater pressure from our legal institutions to do so anyway, in order to obtain rights that were once unlinked to marriage. For example, same-sex couples in many jurisdictions can currently use the mechanism of second-parent adoption to cement the legal relationship between a non-biological parent and the child he or she is raising with a same-sex partner. Some family law scholars worry that, in the wake of universal same-sex marriage, states will do away with second-parent adoptions, instead requiring couples to marry in order to take advantage of either a marital presumption of parentage (for children born within a marriage) or a stepparent adoption (for children born prior to a marriage). In fact, Posner's recent opinion links marriage rights so closely to the role of same-sex couples as parents that its tone may give credence to these concerns. Formal marriage equality, therefore, may liberate while it simultaneously constrains.</p>

<p>Second, marriage rights do not begin to touch the myriad of other ways in which LGBT people face discrimination. The very fact that an LGBT couple is married irrevocably "outs" that couple, so marriage may actually expose some LGBT people to discrimination. Pennsylvania, for example, is in the unique position of allowing same-sex marriage while still having no statewide anti-discrimination protection for LGBT people. Thus, an LGBT Pennsylvanian could conceivably legally marry her partner and then be legally fired for putting a wedding photo in her cubicle at work. The achievement of marriage rights, therefore, achieves some important goals, but leaves broad swaths of unfairness untouched.</p>

<p>Third, rights are simply not self-enforcing. A person in a valid marriage ostensibly has access to all of the benefits and responsibilities that marriage offers but if that individual encounters a hostile institutional actor, those rights can quickly prove unattainable. LGBT people desperately need culturally competent, well-trained legal representation to ensure that hard-fought gains are actually made available to all. For example, when a same-sex couple marries and then has a child, Pennsylvania has thus far refused to place both parents' names on the child's birth certificate, despite the fact that the marital presumption of parentage ought to apply equally to married same-sex and opposite-sex couples. And when couples divorce, bias may well creep into custody proceedings if a court favors a biological same-sex parent over the non-biological parent. In short, the success of formal equality gains creates an entire second wave of work around enforcement of rights; that work is not always well suited to an impact litigation strategy, but is nevertheless vital.</p>

<p>In my opinion, those of us who work in the movement must now take a step back and assess. We should carefully consider how to organize ourselves to acknowledge the legal needs of those who do not wish to marry, and to continue to press for formal equality gains, particularly in the employment context, and particularly on behalf of transgender and gender nonconforming people. Most importantly, the movement must consider how to shift resources so that well-trained, culturally competent attorneys are available to provide direct legal services to those whose legal rights, while technically available, still prove difficult to enforce without representation.</p>

<p>A college football coach once famously said, "Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing." But rights aren't football. Winning marriage equality neither fixes all other problems, nor does it fix the only problem. Lest I be accused of being a Debbie Downer (it wouldn't be the first time), I must note that I am hopeful about the future of the LGBT rights movement. However, I believe that it's critical to think about that future with the understanding that marriage equality, while important, is really a way station on a very long journey toward lived equality for all LGBT Americans.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Sandy Davidson, of the <a href="http://journalism.missouri.edu/">University of Missouri School of Journalism</a> and <a href="http://www.law.missouri.edu/">School of Law</a>, discusses the recent revelations of Yahoo and the potential fallout...</p><strong>A</strong>t least the Yahoo case has now shed a little sunshine on secret government surveillance.</p>

<p>The US government, as part of its foreign surveillance program, ordered Yahoo to turn over the content of communications of targeted foreign users in 2007. Yahoo balked, and its legal battle to resist began secretly because <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1881a">surveillance law</a> prohibits companies such as Yahoo from <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/09/yahoo-files-suit-to-disclose-details-of-data-requests-from-government.php">revealing government requests</a>. The government threatened daily fines of $250,000 for noncompliance.</p>

<p>On September 11, 2014, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/September/14-nsd-971.html">released</a> 1,500 pages of formerly secret documents about Yahoo's losing attempt to resist government use of the PRISM surveillance program of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1801">Protect America Act of 2007</a>. This act had a 180-day sunset provision, so Congress then passed the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-110hr6304enr/pdf/BILLS-110hr6304enr.pdf">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 2008</a> [PDF].  </p>

<p>PRISM stands for "Planning Tool for Resource Integration, Synchronization and Management." PRISM permits surveillance of actual communications. The 2007 and 2008 laws say, "the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence may authorize jointly ... the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence information." But the implementation of PRISM only became publicly known through Edward Snowden's 2013 <a href="/feature/2013/07/edward-snowden.php">leaks</a> to <em>The Guardian</em>'s Glenn Greenwald, <em>The Washington Post</em>'s Barton Gellman and documentary film maker Laura Poitras.</p>

<p>So Yahoo received government subpoenas to turn over information under PRISM. But these warrantless searches struck Yahoo as a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a>. Yahoo had a point. The founding fathers wanted searches to be authorized by search warrants.   </p>

<p>On the other hand, the release by the FISA court on the thirteenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks perhaps drove home some implicit points. We are vulnerable. Some people hate us. We have apparently been doing something right because we have not, so far, experienced further attacks. And, as Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2189837708321658845&q=Terminiello+v.+Chicago&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">noted</a> in 1949, the US Constitution is not a "suicide pact."</p>

<p>We want security, of course. The recent, ghastly beheadings of journalists James Foley and Steve Sotloff by ISIS certainly emphasized the hatred directed toward this country. But we want our liberty, as well. If our liberties are stripped from us in the name of security, then the freedom haters of the world have already won.</p>

<p>The battle to balance security against liberty is an old one, and President Harry Truman brought the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) into the mix when he ordered its creation in 1952. During WWII, the US broke military codes of Germany and Japan, and the NSA was formed to continue, in Truman's words, "communications intelligence activity." But an investigation in 1976 by Senator Frank Church's intelligence committee into reports of illegal spying on domestic activities led to the 1978  passage of the original FISA, with its secret court to reign in surveillance activities.</p>

<p>On September 11, 2001, disaster struck. Then surveillance power swelled. On October 24, 2001, Congress passed the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-107hr3162enr/pdf/BILLS-107hr3162enr.pdf">USA Patriot Act</a> [PDF], which includes a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1861">Section 215</a> amendment to FISA: "The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ... may make an application for an order requiring the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation to protect against international terrorism...." Section 215 covers metadata collection (who is calling whom, when, where and for how long).</p>

<p>On December 16, 2005, <em>The New York Times</em> published a story, "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts</a>," by James Risen and Eric Lichtblau. The story began, "Months after the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans and others inside the United States to search for evidence of terrorist activity without the court-approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying, according to government officials." The series of NSA stories won the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for national reporting.</p>

<p>In 2007 and 2008, Congress empowered the president to do emergency surveillance without getting a FISA warrant for a limited time (the president would go to the court to get retroactive approval) and granted companies immunity from suits for turning over information. In 2012, the US Supreme Court let the retroactive immunity stand and Congress approved the foreign surveillance law for another five years.</p>

<p>Two other surveillance provisions under attack are Section 215, covering metadata collection and Section 702, governing PRISM.  </p>

<p>While PRISM allows greater depth of information-gathering because it permits surveillance of actual content of communications, PRISM is only supposed to target "foreign intelligence information." Section 215 collection of metadata, however, affects anyone who relies on phone conversations.</p>

<p>On July 24, 2013, the House of Representatives voted 217 to 205 to defeat a Patriot Act amendment from Representative Justin Amash (R-MI) that would have prevented the NSA from collecting phone data of individuals not under investigation. The White House lobbied against this bill. Democrats voted in favor 111 to 83. Republicans voted against 94 to 134.</p>

<p>Suits also flew over metadata collection, with conflicting results. For example, on December 16, 2013, in Washington, DC, a 68-page decision came down in the first class-action lawsuit against the NSA's bulk phone-record collection, filed by Freedom Watch founder and former Justice Department prosecutor Larry Klayman. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=485733189267613105&q=Klayman+v.+Obama&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Klayman v. Obama</a>, Judge Richard Leon, an appointee of President George W. Bush, awarded Klayman a preliminary injunction against the phone program but <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/supreme-court-denies-review-of-nsa-bulk-data-collection-case-grants-federal-court-transferal-case---.php">stayed implementation</a> pending appeal. Calling the program "almost Orwellian," the judge said it "almost certainly" violates the Fourth Amendment. The Justice Department has appealed.</p>

<p>On December 27, 2013, in Manhattan, Judge William Pauley, a Clinton appointee, declared that NSA bulk data-collection operations are legal. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1687150376533481548&q=ACLU+v.+Clapper&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">ACLU v. Clapper</a>, he wrote a 54-page decision that begins, "The September 11 terrorist attacks revealed ... just how dangerous and interconnected the world is."</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of these information-surveillance laws passed by Congress to protect us from terrorist attacks. </p>

<p>On February 26, 2013, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13987610465347808803&q=ACLU+v.+Clapper&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Clapper v. Amnesty International USA</a>, the US Supreme Court rejected a challenge to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1881a">Section 702</a> of the FISA Amendment Act. The court ruled 5-4 that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they failed to prove likelihood of interception of their communications with foreign contacts. Plaintiffs also included Global Fund for Women, Human Rights Watch, International Criminal Defense Attorneys Association and The Nation magazine, among others.</p>

<p>Barring court relief, Yahoo and other companies must comply with government orders to turn over information or face serious penalties: $250,000 a day adds up quickly.</p>

<p>What is the solution for those who value privacy and cringe at government's easy access to information about whom they call, when and for how long&#8212;and maybe even the content? Perhaps former President Jimmy Carter, who told NBC he thinks the NSA is spying on him, has the answer: Put pen to paper. And maybe use hand delivery.</p>

		<title>An Affirmative Decision for Transgender Marriage in Texas</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Francesca Acocella, <a href="http://www.cardozo.yu.edu">Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law</a>, Class of 2016, discusses the recent decision by the Thirteenth Court of Appeals of Texas to recognize transgender identity in determining the validity of marriage ...</j:header><strong>T</strong>hink about all the times you need to show ID: seeing a movie, ordering a drink, purchasing certain medicines, traveling abroad, voting, driving, opening bank accounts, buying a house, leasing an apartment, starting a new job, applying to school and accessing health care and health insurance. When the gender marker on a transgender person's identity documents does not match their gender expression, engaging in these everyday activities can lead to discrimination, harassment and violence. Furthermore, inaccurate identity documents can lead to denials of legal rights, including lack of marriage recognition, which encompasses the ability to marry someone of the opposite sex, inheritance rights should their partner die intestate and the ability to be granted a divorce and have marital property divided equitably. While Texas courts have been slow to remedy these denials of legal rights, some Texas courts are <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/texas-appeals-court-overturns-ruling-voiding-marriage-of-transgender-widow.php">gradually adopting</a> a more evolved understanding of gender. An understanding all Texas courts ought to adopt and that all Texas agencies enforce.</p>

<p>Adopting a more nuanced concept of gender includes undoing anti-transgender precedents. In 1999, the Fourth Court of Appeals of Texas held in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8781470914058572427">Littleton v. Prange</a> that gender is immutable. <span class="casename">Littleton</span> was a case of first impression in Texas; as the court noted, "transsexual [is] a term not often heard on the streets of Texas, nor in its courtrooms." Littleton was a transgender woman. Upon her husband's death, she filed a medical malpractice suit against his doctor, Prange, under Texas' wrongful death statute. In order to determine whether Littleton had standing to sue as a surviving spouse, the court framed the issue as whether a marriage between a cisgender man and a transgender woman is valid. </p>

<p><span class="casename">Littleton</span> predated <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16499869016395834644">Goodridge v. Department of Public Health</a> by four years.  The court noted that very few courts had, at the time, considered transgender rights cases and noted that the only ruling in favor of same-sex marriage was by the Hawaiian Supreme Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9275123432984088983">Beahr v. Miike</a>. The court then contrasted this lack of case law to the "very wide spread" opposition to marriage equality. Furthermore, <span class="casename">Littleton</span> relied on the Defense of Marriage Act's <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-110/pdf/STATUTE-110-Pg2419.pdf">definition</a> [PDF] of marriage as between one man and one woman.</p>

<p>During the course of litigation, Littleton amended the gender designation on her birth certificate to state she is female. The trial court allowed her affidavit stating she is female as evidence that the original birth certificate was inaccurate, pursuant to <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/HS/htm/HS.191.htm">Texas Health & Safety Code § 191.029</a>, which allows for changes if there is "satisfactory evidence [the original is] inaccurate."  However, the court held that the legislative intent behind the word "inaccurate" meant a clerical error on the birth certificate made at the time of birth.  The majority considered the birth certificate sufficient evidence that, as a matter of law, Littleton is a man.  The dissent, however, emphasized that this discrepancy creates a genuine issue of material fact, arguing summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>

<p>The court, using cases from other jurisdictions, concluded that Littleton was a man and that gender is an immutable trait. The court invalidated Littleton's marriage as a same-sex marriage, rendering her unable to sue as a surviving spouse. The court declined to establish a standard for successful sex reassignment, especially without legislative guidance, deeming it "intellectually impossible" and rejecting Littleton's argument that surgery serves as the definitive test of gender. The rejection of this argument may have been ultimately more useful than its acceptance would have, as the more progressive standard today is not surgery but appropriate clinical treatment. </p>

<p>Fifteen years after <span class="casename">Littleton</span>, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals of Texas in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9919752989258791825">Estate of Araguz</a> reversed and remanded a trial court's summary judgement that invalidated the marriage between Nikki Araguz, a transgender woman and volunteer firefighter Thomas Trevino Araguz.  Thomas died in the line of duty in 2010 and after his death, his mother, Simona Longoria, brought suit to invalidate his marriage to Nikki on the basis that it was a same-sex marriage. Thomas's ex-wife, Heather Delgado, also intervened as next friend on behalf of her two minor children with Thomas.</p>

<p>In 1996, Nikki amended her California birth certificate to reflect her name change. She also obtained a Kansas driver's license with a female gender marker. She used the Kansas driver's license to get a Texas driver's license that stated she was female. In 2008, she used her Texas driver's license to apply for a marriage license. At the time, Nikki had not yet undergone genital reassignment surgery. In 2010, several days after her husband died, Nikki requested that a San Francisco court change her birth certificate to a female gender marker. A month later, California issued her a new birth certificate. Nikki produced her California birth certificate as summary judgment evidence.</p>

<p>Each party filed motions for summary judgment. Nikki filed a no evidence motion "asserting that she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Heather and Simona could produce no evidence that Thomas and Nikki did not have a valid ceremonial marriage or, alternatively, a valid informal marriage." Heather and Simona argued that summary judgment was proper based on <span class="casename">Littleton</span>. The trial court granted Heather and Simona's motions while denying Nikki's.</p>

<p>In it's decision delivered earlier this year, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals of Texas noted that the legal landscape had changed since <span class="casename">Littleton</span> and that the Texas legislature was no longer silent.  It found that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to Araguz's gender, that the legislature overturned Littleton in 2009 and the summary judgment cannot be upheld based on judicial estoppel. An affidavit from Nikki's doctor, discussing the complexities of gender, was sufficient for the court to find a genuine disputed fact. The court also mentioned the ever-increasing number of states with marriage equality and the US Supreme Court's ruling in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">US v. Windsor</a> overturning Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-104hr3396enr/pdf/BILLS-104hr3396enr.pdf">Defense of Marriage Act</a> [PDF]. Ultimately, the <span class="casename">Araguz</span> court held that "an individual who has had a 'sex change' is eligible to marry a person of the opposite sex," citing the Texas Family Code Section <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/FA/htm/FA.2.htm">2.0005(b)(8)</a>. The new trial has yet to take place.</p>

<p>The difference between the courts' outcomes in <span class="casename">Littleton</span> and in <span class="casename">Araguz</span> is partly due to evolving social, medical and legal understandings of gender. The 2009 amendment to Texas's Family Code is part of that evolving understanding. The Texas legislature amended its Family Code to include that "an original or certified copy of a court order relating to the applicant's name change or sex change" can establish the proof required for a marriage license. The court in <span class="casename">Araguz</span> found the amendment invalidates <span class="casename">Littleton</span>, legitimizing marriage in Texas for transgender people. During the 82nd legislative session in Texas, which ended in 2012, there were several unsuccessful attempts to repeal the 2009 amendment.</p>

<p>Because Texas statutes now recognize the rights and marriages of transgender people, Texas agencies must allow transgender Texans to amend gender markers on their identity documents and all courts, not just courts within the jurisdiction that decided <span class="casename">Araguz</span>, must recognize the marriages of transgender Texans.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/law/panov-stoyan.aspx">Stoyan Panov</a> of the University of Birmingham Law School compares and contrasts executive powers under the transitional constitutions of South Sudan and Somalia ...</p><strong>T</strong>he veto power of the executive over legislation creates certain political and legal tensions in newly independent states or states which are sometimes labelled as failed states. The following entry examines the role of the executive in the constitutional provisions of South Sudan and Somalia, and the veto power in terms of its effect and relation to the rule of law in both countries. </p>

<p><strong>South Sudan </strong></p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/south-sudan/">South Sudan</a> became an independent state on July 9, 2011 after decades of prolonged armed conflicts with Khartoum. The <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/IMG/pdf/The_Draft_Transitional_Constitution_of_the_ROSS2-2.pdf">Transitional Constitution of South Sudan</a> (TCSS) [PDF] was adopted in 2011 and the document reflects the attempt to establish a state based on "justice, freedom, equality and dignity." The TCSS as a transitory constitutional arrangement aims at creating a decentralized multi-party system. Illustrating the difficult emergence of South Sudan, one of the core political objectives of all governmental branches is to 'initiate a comprehensive process of national reconciliation and ... promote national harmony, unity and peaceful co-existence among the people of South Sudan' according to Article 36(2)(b) of TCSS.</p>

<p>In order to understand the importance of the president's veto power, it is necessary to look at the legislative process in South Sudan. The National legislature is bicameral, consisting of the National Legislative Assembly (NLA), and the Council of States, possessing the ability to "consider and pass amendments" to the Constitution and impeach the president according to Article 55 of the TCSS. The upper house, the Council of States, consists of 19 honourables and 20 representatives appointed by the president. The veto power of the president is established in Article 85(1) of the TCSS as "any bill approved by the National Legislature shall not become a law unless the president assents to it and signs it into law." Once the president vetoes the bill, the bill is sent back to the National Legislature which considers the president's observations. </p>

<p>The two houses can overcome the president's veto on the bill by passing it by a two-thirds majority of all members of the two houses. However, to garner a two-third majority in the Council of States is quite difficult to fathom as approximately half of the Council representatives are appointed by the president. Such concentration of appointees and veto power within the hands of the executive tilts the balance of power between the various branches of government in executive's favor. The legislative branch has the power to amend the constitution to limit the president's powers but a threshold of two-thirds majority must be obtained in the both houses. Again, the power of the executive to control the Council of States through the appointment procedure of representatives is significant. The executive significantly tilts the check-and-balances control over the legislative branch in his favor.</p>

<p>The concentration of power within the president reflects his role in South Sudan as an executive. The president is the head of state and government as well as the Supreme Commander of all armed forces. The president appoints, and can dismiss the vice president without the approval of the NLA, according to Article 105(2). The discord on the powerful executive capabilities to appoint and dismiss high state officials such as state governors caused initial struggles as opposition parties to the ruling SPLM opposed such extended executive powers in the TCSS drafting process. The presidential powers to sack the government and the vice president also contributed to the mid-2013 conflict between President Kiir and the Vice President Riek Machar. The conflict also had ethnic undertones as Machar belongs to the second largest ethnic group, the Nuer. The clashes between forces loyal to Kiir and Machar resulted in hundreds of casualties.</p>

<p>A strong, accountable and transparent executive could be beneficial for building institutions in the newly emerging State. However, the constitutional arrangement as of the current moment does not allow for proper, democratic check-and-balances mechanisms, and the reformist push on part of the president primarily depends on the personal inclinations and political interests of the executive. </p>

<p>The judiciary may also exert some control over the presidential powers. The judiciary is perceived as the final arbiter in parliamentary or presidential democracies, especially when there is a concentration of powers within the executive. The president's acts may be challenged by any person before the Supreme Court in accordance with Article 104 of the TCSS. The individual constitutional complaint serves as a powerful corrective mechanism with an independent and strong Supreme, Constitutional Court. Additionally, the president's powers are limited as the National Assembly can impeach the executive by two-thirds majority on limited grounds of "high treason, gross violation of the Constitution or gross misconduct in relation to National affairs." The impeachment is referred to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>However, the independence of the judiciary, a crucial organ for maintaining the balance of power in any functioning type of democracy and for upholding the rule of law, is put in question as the president approves the budget of the whole branch in South Sudan. More significant and damaging for the independence of the judiciary is the fact that the president appoints the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court along with other high judicial positions according to Article 134 of the TCSS. In such manner, the president has immense power over the constitutional court which is supposed to provide checks on president's acts. The politicization of the judiciary makes it unable or unwilling to provide checks and balances to the executive branch. The independence and accountability of the judiciary branch are significantly compromised.</p>

<p><strong>Somalia </strong></p>

<p>Somalia aspires to be a federal, representative parliamentary republic. The constitutional structure of Somalia is different from that of South Sudan as Somalia had been ravaged by an endemic, wide-spread internal conflict, ranging for more than 20 years. The current structure of government and the <a href="http://unpos.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=RkJTOSpoMME=">Provisional Constitution</a> (PC) are a product of international efforts since 2008 to stabilize the state, involving transitional governments and Transitional Federal Charter. As the conflicts were heavily influenced by local loyalties in Somaliland and Puntland, it is not surprising that the current structure of Somali is a federal government with a strong emphasis on representation of federal member states (See Article 50 of PC) in comparison to the more centralized structure of the newly independent South Sudan. </p>

<p>Article 3(4) of the 2012 PC aims at ensuring separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judiciary branches. The Federal Parliament resembles the structure of the South Sudanese bi-cameral houses as there is a House of the People of the Federal Parliament, and the upper house, representing federal states and representatives, both electable by a direct and free ballot. The House of the People together with the upper house elects or dismisses the President of the Federal Republic in a joint session, which is significantly different from the South Sudan's president direct election.</p>

<p>The legislative initiative is vested with the Council of Ministers, or at least ten members of the House of the People, or at least one representative of the upper house in light of Article 80 of the PC. Once the draft law is passed by both houses, the bill is sent to the president of the Federal Republic for his signature. The federal president has the power to "sign draft laws passed by the Federal Parliament in order to bring them into law" according to Article 90(f). It is not clear whether the president is obliged to sign the draft law, or has veto power. However, from the language of Article 90(f), the draft law becomes law when signed by the president, so if the president refuses to sign the draft law, then the bill cannot be interpreted to have legal power. It is ambiguous whether the legislative branch can overcome the situation of veto non-signature by the president as is the case in South Sudan. The TCSS seems clearer in the part of overcoming the executive veto. </p>

<p>The powers and functions of the president of Somalia significantly differ from the president of South Sudan. The Somali President Mohamud is the head of state, a primarily ceremonial figurehead, symbolizing national unity. As Somalia attempts to be a federal parliamentary democracy, such role for the president is not surprising. The executive power is concentrated in the Council of Ministers, which consists of the prime minister, deputy prime ministers, state ministers and their deputies. </p>

<p>Additionally, the president has the power to appoint the chairman of the Constitutional Court, and other lower courts according to Article 90(j). The judiciary branch seems more independent in comparison to South Sudan. The Judicial Service Commission, consisting of nine members, proposes the candidates for the highest court of the land, the Supreme Court, the House of the People approves the candidate and the president must appoint the selected judge to the Constitutional Court.</p>

<p>In conclusion, South Sudan may learn from the lessons of the internal conflicts of Somalia by adopting a more balanced constitution which provides for more powers to the directly electable lower house of the legislative organs and the transparent selection of high judicial officials. The current concentration of powers within the executive has already provoked internal conflicts in 2013. Somalia may adopt more precise language as to the powers of the federal president, and a more powerful judiciary to review the acts of government. </p>

		<title>The Man Behind the Curtain: Mandating Transparency in the Military Judicial System - Part I</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Robert Bracknell, a career Marine officer, discusses ways to reform the military judicial system...</p><strong>F</strong>or the past several years, the Department of Defense and the armed services have been thrashed by the media, victim interest groups, the civilian and military bars and Congress over military justice issues. Accusations of systemic flaws, cultural indifference and enmity toward alleged victims and commanders turning a blind eye to sexual assault accusations has ratcheted the debate in the administration and Congress to a strident cacophony. Concepts on reform and oversight have bounced from interest groups to the Hill to the White House to the Pentagon and back. Some reform proposals have attained administrative and legislative traction, while others have fallen by the wayside.  </p>

                <p>Disappointingly, two simple reforms that could transform the landscape of military justice have been wholly overlooked. This is the first of a two-part series addressing each of these issues, advocating modest, affordable, easy to implement reforms that would improve transparency and public accountability for the military justice process. First, Congress must amend the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-II/chapter-47">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> (UCMJ) to mandate real-time, open access to paper and electronic court-martial records. The legislation should direct open access through <a href="https://www.pacer.gov/">PACER</a> or some other electronic online system on the same basis and availability as the records of Article III courts&#8212;without a requirement to wield the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) to gain access to military judicial records. Second, Congress should mandate unrestricted access to records of attorney and judicial misconduct on the same basis as the professional standard set by most state bars and judicial codes of conduct.</p>

                <p>The past few years have been simply dreadful for military justice, particularly the management of sexual assault investigations and prosecutions, legislative hearings and several UCMJ reform bills. The Air Force ended the careers of two three-star generals, including at least one who was a shoo-in for four stars, over their perfectly lawful exercise of clemency in sexual assault cases. The Army tried a brigadier general by court-martial (culminating in a plea agreement that ended this rising star's career), recently relieved a general officer commander in Japan for suppressing sexual assault investigations and has a sexual assault case pending against a sexual assault prosecutor.  </p>

                <p>The Navy suffered through the high-profile investigation and prosecution of three Naval Academy midshipmen. The Marine Corps has suffered humiliating appellate defeats pertaining to unlawful command influence, post-trial delay and right to counsel and a scathing assessment by a US district judge of the handling of a routine military justice case that landed in federal court due to Marine prosecutorial incompetence. The Corps also has been at the receiving end of an embarrassing civil action by two female officers and alleged rape victims suing the service and the Department of the Navy over its alleged inability to protect them from sexual assault. Sexual assault <a href="http://www.usmedicine.com/agencies/department-of-defense-dod/dod-seeks-to-revise-alcohol-policies-to-help-address-sexual-assaults/">reports</a> climbed yet another 50% in 2013.  </p>

                <p>The anecdotes and metrics at least suggest a problem in culture, legal and command competence and ethics and senior leadership. But the opaqueness of the military justice system itself is one very important aspect of the wider institutional failure. Military leaders have been embattled, struggling to explain themselves to the Secretary of Defense, the President and issue leaders in both houses of Congress, particularly Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Claire McCaskill and Representative Jackie Speier. Senator McCaskill was successful in sponsoring and orchestrating passage of military sexual assault reform legislation requiring significant changes to sexual assault investigation and prosecution.  </p>

                <p>More reforms are in the offing even though a clear preference for the status quo remains within the Department of Defense, illustrated by a recommendation by the <a href="http://responsesystemspanel.whs.mil">Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel</a> to maintain commander's convening authority and keep prosecutorial organizations within the military chain of command. Despite being on notice of a perceived problem in military justice, particularly in the handling of sexual assault cases, it took congressional interest and action to energize the Department of Defense sufficiently to move beyond inertial intransigence to take the issue seriously, causing one service chief to describe it stunningly as his "number one priority" above war-fighting, recruiting, training, retaining and equipping the force, doctrine development and care for returning wounded veterans.  The political forces swirling around this issue have been breathtaking.</p>

                <p>Despite the blinding flurry of military, executive, legislative, judicial and special interest group activity, the stubborn opacity of the military justice system with regard to judicial records and attorney and judicial misconduct has received absolutely no attention as an inexpensive, immediate, viable avenue for reform with clear merit well in excess of the systemic cost of implementation. The Department of Defense and the military services have failed completely to recognize the important potential effect of increased transparency and low implementation cost of this vital reform.</p>

                <p>Transparency is a cornerstone of accountable government, including a valid, credible judicial system. The President's Transparency and Open Government <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-26/pdf/E9-1777.pdf">Memorandum</a> [PDF] of January 26, 2009, notes:<br />
                <blockquote>Government should be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.  Information maintained by the Federal Government is a national asset. My Administration will take appropriate action, consistent with law and policy, to disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and use. Executive departments and agencies should harness new technologies to put information about their operations and decisions online and readily available to the public. Executive departments and agencies should also solicit public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</blockquote></p>

                <p>Any involved party has a substantial interest in access to records reflecting how the courts are operating and whether those courts are regular civilian courts (state courts of general jurisdiction or federal "Article III" courts) or military courts-martial. Similarly, virtually every state system of attorney and judicial discipline publishes the records of their findings so that the public and consumers of attorneys' professional services can have access to data in the information marketplace that will inform their decision-making on issues of attorney and judicial competence.  </p>

                <p>Open judicial records and public records of attorney and judicial discipline ensure that the public, aided by the democratic legislative and executive rulemaking processes, can monitor the system and refine it to balance the government's interests in accountability and deterrence with the public's and accused service-members' interests in fairness and justice. An open judicial system, including access to records of professional misconduct, even in the military, is a hallmark of a progressive system of government that places individual rights on par with the power of the government.  </p>

                <p>The military justice system is unique in its lack of transparency among systems of American law. Federal courts of course use PACER, facilitating near-instant access to court records, orders, motions, filings and petitions. State systems have implemented electronic records systems and also generally allow individuals to show up at a courthouse unannounced, pay a fee and photocopy public, unsealed judicial records. The federal and state trial and appellate courts take seriously their obligation to provide transparency in the judicial system, withholding information from the public only in very narrow circumstances subject to special justifications. These limited exceptions include classified information, cases involving minors or protected witnesses, <em>qui tam</em> actions (sealed in cases brought under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3729">False Claims Act</a> to protect the government's ability to intervene in select cases) and cases involving confidential business information or settlement agreements.</p>

                <p>This value of transparency has been mostly embraced by the Department of Defense in the context of the military commissions system, with every single unclassified filing, ruling, motion, response and exhibit available on the Commissions website within days of its filing with the court clerk. By contrast, transparency not only is absent in the military justice system applicable to American service-members&#8212;in fact, it is sometimes deliberately thwarted.  Why should the Department of Defense make a deliberate choice to open the Commissions&#8212;the forum trying the worst alleged terrorists in history&#8212;to the world, but hide American military justice responsible for applying the Constitution to America's sons and daughters behind an ominous veil of secrecy and non-disclosure? Alleged terrorists get more transparency and publicly open judicial procedure than active duty service-members subject to the UCMJ.</p>

                <p>In stark contrast, absent a change in the law requiring affirmative disclosure of military legal records (e.g. motions, responses, judicial orders, records of trial and other court-martial records), the only way to obtain them is through FOIA. FOIA, as implemented by DoD, of course permits the government days, sometimes weeks, of delay to respond and requires individual requests for each record sought to be disclosed. Moreover, a requester has to be aware of the existence of the records to begin with.  </p>

                <p>Consider for example a media requester who wants to report on a sexual assault case at Fort Lewis. The requester would have to know of the existence of the case, file FOIA requests and await the government's response for 10 days or longer whereas a similarly situated justice beat reporter in virtually any city, county or federal district in America simply reads the published court docket for newsworthy cases and requests copies of judicial filings from the clerk or downloads them from PACER. The delayed disclosure occasioned by leveraging FOIA to obtain military justice records postpones reporting on the case to the point that it diminishes its newsworthiness. <br />
                    <br />
                    The end result is that ironically, rather than promoting transparency in the military justice context, FOIA actually works to constrain it. Slow-rolling disclosure is likely a desirable outcome from the military bureaucracy's perspective but it is manifestly not in the public interest&#8212;nor ultimately in the long run, the military's own interest. Public scrutiny can be invaluable to shaping the law to fit the public's expectations about how military members should be governed and disciplined.  </p>

                <p>That is not the status quo with Article III judicial records, the closest analogue to military justice records. Every individual Article III court record is available to anyone who looks into PACER within hours of its filing and acceptance or issuance by a court. The affirmative disclosure regime established by the federal courts through PACER provides near-instant transparency into the federal judicial system. The media, Congress, the executive, the public, activists, business and the academy&#8212;law professors, economists and historians&#8212;have immediate access to court records for reporting, analysis and decision-making.  </p>

                <p>This immediacy serves the public interest. An unsuccessful motion to dismiss charges against a stockbroker for wire fraud can be immediately available to traders, attorneys and economists, which allows the market to reflect the news accurately and promptly. The availability of an indictment against a political figure gives the public important information on how to make political choices such as voting or making political contributions. These are important functions in our democracy and judicial transparency helps perfect the available information on which society makes decisions.</p>

                <p>Whereas the media can utilize PACER to drive public awareness of federal judicial proceedings, covering military cases is an order of magnitude more difficult&#8212;and not only because the proceedings take place on military installations that may not even be accessible by the public. In addition to the requirement to request records and the delay, the government often does not meet the timelines for production of records mandated by the statute and frequently drags its feet and unlawfully withholds or redacts records through misapplication of FOIA's legal standards. A statutory requirement to post all records applying the same standards of redaction as exist in PACER would aid public understanding of the military justice system and would promote better trial practice because every proceeding would potentially be on stage and covered in the evening news or the next day's newspapers.</p>

                <p>Transparency in court-martial records driven by a change in the law requiring military judicial circuits to post them into PACER on the same basis as Article III courts would work wonders for the challenges facing the court-martial process and military justice. The media would be able to report on cases faster, more accurately and more often, enabling transparent, accurate information to flow to the public in near real-time. Moreover it would allow reporting from a distance; reporters across the country would have online access to electronic records to augment wire reports in their reporting.  </p>

                <p>Improving access to information can lead to greater political and supervisory accountability for military justice decisions and outcomes and can help shape the debate regarding military justice in terms of expanding or contracting the rights of the accused, refining offenses and changing judicial procedures for greater efficiency and effectiveness. This is a simple, affordable reform for which there is already a proven model or platform&#8212;PACER&#8212;that would work wonders with respect to public and media access to military justice case information.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST guest columnist <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/leslie-haskell-0">Leslie Haskell</a>, of Human Rights Watch, discusses how some European countries have taken affirmative steps to prosecute those within their borders&#8212;as well as those who may eventually come within them&#8212;for major international crimes by enacting universal jurisdiction laws and creating specialized war crimes units to investigate and prosecute these crimes, arguing that this practice should be encouraged since it may be the only means through which victims of such atrocities can obtain justice ... </p>

                <p><strong>W</strong>ith many hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the violence in Syria, the focus&#8212;as it should be&#8212;has been on finding them safety, shelter and aid. But some governments are also looking to hold those responsible for the underlying mass murder and torture to account for their crimes. This requires an proactive approach, with appropriate laws to pursue suspects, skilled professionals to investigate these crimes and strong political will to support accountability efforts.<br />
                    <br />
                    Germany is one such country. There, prosecutors have initiated broad preliminary investigations with respect to several crisis countries&#8212;including Syria and Libya. These "structural investigations" are aimed at cataloging grave international crimes committed in these countries and identifying potential victims and witnesses inside Germany who may be useful for future prosecutions in the country or elsewhere. Since late 2013, the German immigration service has been asking Syrian asylum seekers whether they have witnessed any war crimes and whether they can name those responsible.<br />
                    <br />
                    Invoking what is known as universal jurisdiction, more and more courts of countries far from where some of the world's worst crimes&#8212;such as genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and torture&#8212;have been committed are stepping in to prosecute those responsible. For that to happen, countries need to adopt laws that give their courts jurisdiction. But having universal jurisdiction laws on the books is not enough to ensure that those responsible for these horrific deeds are brought to justice. A handful of countries have also created specialized war crimes units consisting of police, prosecutors and immigration officials to investigate and prosecute such crimes.<br />
                    <br />
                    The first of these units came about in the Netherlands more than a decade ago after authorities realized that even as refugees from brutal crimes around the world arrived in the country seeking safe haven, so too were some of those responsible for the crimes. In some chilling cases, victims came face-to-face with their abusers.<br />
                    <br />
                    Investigating and prosecuting grave international crimes is different than handling domestic criminal cases, even for serious crimes like murder or rape. These crimes often occurred on a massive scale years earlier in another country. Victims and witnesses may be dispersed throughout the country and in other countries, perhaps far away. Finding reliable evidence is difficult and usually requires investigations abroad&#8212;including in the country where the crimes originally took place. Professionals in national war crimes units know how to overcome these challenges and dig up the evidence needed for successful prosecutions.<br />
                    <br />
                    A new Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/129175">report</a> examines the inner workings of specialized war crimes units in France, Germany and the Netherlands, highlighting key lessons learned. One valuable lesson gleaned from the experience of these three countries is that war crimes units are not limited to going after war crimes suspects who are already in the country. Criminal justice authorities can also prepare for the possibility that new suspects will arrive on their soil.<br />
                    <br />
                    The war crimes units in all three countries have come to realize that it is far easier to collect evidence soon after events transpire rather than decades later, when victims and witnesses may be scattered widely and other relevant evidence lost or destroyed. With the number of asylum seekers in the world at its highest level in nearly 70 years&#8212;many from conflict zones like Syria, where mass atrocities have been committed&#8212;authorities have an opportunity to collect information early on and begin investigations even before they have specific suspects in their sights.<br />
                    <br />
                    In addition to Germany, a few other European governments are trying to collect testimony from asylum seekers and others on their territory that may be used for subsequent investigations and prosecutions. While these types of investigations may be costly, they can help ensure that their countries do not become safe havens and that those responsible for the worst crimes are prosecuted before national courts.<br />
                    <br />
                    With the conflict still raging in Syria and no immediate prospect of trials there, universal jurisdiction may be victims' best chance for justice. More countries should create specialized war crimes units and empower them to gather information about grave international crimes that are available within their borders for use in future trials. As more countries join this effort, it may provide the first dent in impunity for Syria and extend the reach of justice for serious crimes being committed elsewhere.</p>

		<title>Why Every Single Supreme Court Justice Got Hobby Lobby Wrong</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Ron Fein, of <a href="http://freespeechforpeople.org/">Free Speech for People</a>, discusses the Supreme Court's recent <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> decision ...</p><strong>T</strong>he Supreme Court's majority <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF] in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hobby%20Lobby">Hobby Lobby</a> made a serious mistake about the nature of corporate religious claims. But so did the dissent.<br />
                <br />
                As Hobby Lobby's case worked its way through the courts, both sides took one thing for granted: they assumed that the Supreme Court had already extended the religious freedom protections of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) to nonprofit corporations. Under that assumption, the next question was whether that supposed rule should be extended to for-profit corporations. But what if the assumption is wrong: what if nonprofit corporation&#8212;even churches&#8212;don't themselves independently hold religious free exercise rights?<br />
                <br />
                When we think of corporations, we usually think of businesses, like ExxonMobil, Wal-Mart&#8212;or Hobby Lobby. But there are also nonprofit corporations, like the Sierra Club and the National Right-to-Life Committee. Many religious congregations, such as churches, synagogues or mosques, find it useful for legal purposes to incorporate.<br />
                <br />
                That brings us to <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span>. In the past few decades, there were a handful of Supreme Court cases involving religious claims where the named plaintiff was an incorporated church. But does that mean that the church corporation itself had religious rights?<br />
                <br />
                Nearly everyone reading these cases assumed that the nonprofit corporations themselves have religious freedom rights. And so the argument in <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> was about whether for-profit corporations also have religious rights.<br />
                <br />
                But this assumption is wrong. Incorporated nonprofit religious institutions&#8212;including churches&#8212;don't have, and never had, their own independent religious rights. They come into court as representatives of their members.<br />
                <br />
                Let's look at some of those cases. In <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span>, Justice Alito wrote: "[w]e have entertained RFRA and free-exercise claims brought by nonprofit corporations." His first example was <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7036734975431570669">Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficiente União do Vegetal</a>, a 2006 decision involving a request for a RFRA exemption from federal anti-drug laws by a small (incorporated) church whose members sought to use a hallucinogenic tea in religious ceremonies.<br />
                <br />
                But the <span class="casename">O Centro</span> decision doesn't say anything about religious rights for nonprofit corporations; it doesn't even mention the word "corporation." Rather, the opinion explained that RFRA should yield an "exception for the 130 or so American members of the [church] who want to practice" their religion. Members of the church: that's people, not corporations.<br />
                <br />
                It turns out that the church, which is incorporated, filed its RFRA suit as "a New Mexico corporation on its own behalf and on behalf of all its members in the United States."<br />
                <br />
                Their case was based on a legal concept known as associational standing. To file a case in federal court, you must show that you suffered harm from whatever the defendant did or didn't do, and this violated your legal rights. This is called standing. And to have standing, you have to argue your own rights; you can't come into court and argue that the defendant violated someone else's legal rights.<br />
                <br />
                But there are exceptions, and one of the most important is associational standing. This means that an association can bring a claim that really belongs to its members. Let's take environmental law. Suppose a factory pollutes a river and the Sierra Club wants to sue the factory under the <a href="http://www.epw.senate.gov/water.pdf">Clean Water Act</a> [PDF]. But how is the Sierra Club harmed? The polluted water isn't coursing through the Sierra Club's San Francisco headquarters. Instead, the Club needs to identify a few members who regularly kayak through that river. Those members fill out affidavits saying that they can't kayak the river any more because the pollution is making it so bad. And then&#8212;here's the legal device&#8212;the Sierra Club can bring the lawsuit on its members' behalf, because people pay dues to the Sierra Club to do exactly this sort of thing, and the Sierra Club's lawyers can present the case in court more effectively than a few individual kayakers could.<br />
                <br />
                That's the magic of associational standing: it lets an association that has no injury or legal right of its own file a lawsuit on behalf of its members.<br />
                <br />
                Let's return to <span class="casename">O Centro</span>. The church's lawyers were apparently worried that the government might pull some clever maneuver to get the case kicked out of court, because they came up with every possible plaintiff you could imagine: the church on its own behalf; the church using associational standing to argue on behalf of its members; and then 15 of those members (more than 10 percent of its total membership!) as individual plaintiffs.<br />
                <br />
                And because of this abundance of plaintiffs, none of the courts involved spent too much time worrying about whether the church corporation itself had religious rights. After all, at least one of the plaintiffs could raise the claim for a RFRA exemption, so why quibble over who gets to be a plaintiff?<br />
                <br />
                Something similar happened in another case that Alito mentioned, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=975414503455261754">Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah</a>, involving a ban on animal slaughtering practices that was targeted at the Santería religion. The case is named after the first plaintiff on the complaint: the church corporation. But it could just as easily been called <span class="casename">Pichardo v. Hialeah</span>, after the other plaintiff: Ernesto Pichardo, a Santería priest, who was listed second. And the religious rights of Santería practitioners like Ernesto Pichardo, not any corporation's rights, were at stake in the case. Indeed, the Supreme Court opinion focused on the "religious exercise of Santería churchmembers." Same with another case that Alito cited, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6711345368740496870">Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>, which held that churches are exempt from discrimination law when hiring and firing ministers. The problem with applying discrimination law to ministers isn't that the government is forcing a minister on the church corporation, but on its congregants.<br />
                <br />
                We can now understand the court's previous cases in a new way. When an incorporated church challenges a restriction on its members' right to engage in religious activities, it can do so not because the corporation itself has any religious rights, but because its members have religious rights.<br />
                <br />
                So both the majority and the dissent in <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> got it wrong: <span class="casename">O Centro</span> and similar cases don't establish that nonprofit corporations have a special status under the law of religious exercise. Rather, they're just examples of an associational standing concept that applies across many different areas of law. The church corporations didn't have, and didn't need, their own religious rights; they were just asserting the rights of their members using associational standing.<br />
                <br />
                Once we understand <span class="casename">O Centro</span> and related cases in this way, we see that both Alito's majority opinion and Justice Ginsburg's dissent asked the wrong question in <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span>. The question shouldn't be whether the court's "tradition" of "special solicitude" for nonprofit corporations raising religious freedom claims should be extended to for-profit corporations. Rather, we start with the baseline assumption that corporations don't have religions and ask whether for-profit corporations can use associational standing to represent their investors' religious claims in court.<br />
                <br />
                The Supreme Court has addressed this issue in other contexts. Membership-oriented nonprofit organizations, the court has explained, can typically rely on associational standing because "the primary reason people join an organization is often to create an effective vehicle for vindicating interests that they share with others." And with a nonprofit, we rarely worry about whether an organization seeking a religious exemption is truly representing the religious interests of its members, or whether it's all a money-making ruse, since the nonprofit can't distribute extra funds as profits.<br />
                <br />
                That's not true of business corporations. They don't have members&#8212;they have investors. They aren't associations of individuals joined together for a common religious purpose&#8212;they're separate legal entities that are authorized by state law to issue stock to be purchased by stockholders. These corporations can't raise associational standing claims on behalf of their stockholders.<br />
                <br />
                That's not to say that for-profit business corporations can never raise someone's religious claims. In some cases, a business can argue that the rights of a third party are being violated, but the third party isn't in a good position to bring the case directly. For example, if the government banned kosher slaughter, a kosher food company could challenge the law by arguing that its customers' religious rights were at stake. The company might argue that it could hire fancier lawyers than individual customers and it would have factual information about slaughterhouse practices that customers wouldn't have. And it would be arguing for a well-established standing exception, not a radical extension of the law.<br />
                <br />
                But in <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span>, these factors didn't apply. The company didn't bring its claims on behalf of its customers, or employees&#8212;indeed, it essentially brought its claim against its employees' interests.<br />
                <br />
                So the question that the court should have asked was whether Hobby Lobby&#8212;a  corporation with no religion, which has special state-granted privileges that (unlike a nonprofit) enable it to accumulate much more wealth for its investors than would be possible without the privileges of incorporation&#8212;should be able to use associational standing to raise those investors' claims. And under traditional rules of both standing and corporate law, corporations aren't associations of their stockholders and can't raise these types of claims.<br />
                <br />
                Why does this way of thinking about corporate rights claims matter?<br />
                <br />
                First, this approach will help us think more clearly about religious nonprofit organizations that aren't churches, like religiously-affiliated hospitals. It forces us to ask: exactly whose religious rights are they claiming?<br />
                <br />
                Second, the court often works out its corporate rights thinking with non-profits and then extends those rights to business corporations. For example, consider <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6233137937069871624">Citizens United</a>, which allows unlimited corporate spending in elections. The court started by describing Citizens United itself (a nonprofit) as an "association of citizens" and then generalized to all corporations, including multinational conglomerates. Similarly, in <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span>, the majority started by wrongly assuming that <span class="casename">O Centro</span> and similar cases had already established that nonprofit corporations could raise religious claims (when in fact the better analysis involved associational standing) and then generalized to for-profit corporations. The more the justices do this, the easier they'll find it to blur the differences between a citizens' association and a for-profit business corporation.<br />
                <br />
                In <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span>, a misinterpretation of a few cases involving churches and their worshippers led to 13,000 employees of a for-profit retail enterprise losing insurance coverage, as will many thousands more working at other companies trying to claim this new exemption.  To fix this, we must start with one basic premise: corporations, no matter what type, are not people. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Omar Subat, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a>, Class of 2015, is the author of the second article in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://jcred.org">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Subat discusses the US Supreme Court's decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry holding that the proponents of Proposition 8 did not have Article III standing to appeal in federal court...</j:header><strong>J</strong>une 26, 2013 was a day of celebration for gay and lesbian advocates across the state of California and the country. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17941114802734225386">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a>, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/california-supreme-court-ends-legal-challenges-to-same-sex-marriage.php">declined</a> to overturn a US District Court's ruling invalidating California's <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a>, which limited the validity and recognition of marriage in California to strictly opposite-sex couples. However, the court's ruling did not just invalidate Proposition 8; the court reached its decision not by holding that Proposition 8 itself was unconstitutional, but on the grounds that the initiative proponents did not have the standing necessary to have the court litigate the constitutionality of the initiative.</p>

<p>This holding is troubling as it gives state executives like the governor or attorney general, the power to "veto" and undo valid initiatives passed by a majority of voters by simply refusing to defend the initiatives in court. This power undermines the strength and ultimate purpose of the initiative process, which enacts state laws without the approval of the state's legislature and executive. California and 25 other states use ballot initiatives to enact laws and the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="casename">Hollingsworth</span> compromises the strength and legitimacy of those laws.</p>

<p>The appellants in <span class="casename">Hollingsworth</span> filled a void left by then-governor Schwarzenegger and former California attorney general Jerry Brown after a lesbian couple sued the state executives on the grounds that the new law violated the Constitution. Both officials refused to defend Proposition 8 at trial or appeal the district court's August 2010 ruling in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1984506746130471324">Perry v. Schwarzenegger</a> that overturned it. The ruling also made the 100-year-old <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_2">California initiative power</a> much more vulnerable.</p>

<p>Proposition 8 amended Article I, Section 7.5, of the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html">California Constitution</a> to state that "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California." On November 4, 2008, Proposition 8 was <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2008-general/sov_complete.pdf">enacted</a> [PDF] with 52.3% of the vote. Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier sued Schwarzenegger and Brown, alleging that Proposition 8 deprived them of "due process and of equal protection of the laws contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment." Schwarzenegger and Brown refused to defend Proposition 8 in district court, leaving a giant void in the litigation, as there was no remaining defendant willing to defend Proposition 8 and the state's interest. The official proponents of Proposition 8, led by State Senator Dennis Hollingsworth attempted to intervene and fill that void and were allowed to stand in the place of the state officials who refused to defend Proposition 8.  </p>

<p>After a lengthy trial, Chief Judge Vaughn R. Walker held that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional as it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a>. Proposition 8's sponsors attempted to appeal the decision, leading the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to certify a question to the California Supreme Court asking whether the sponsors of an initiative had the authority to assert the State's interest. The California Supreme Court concluded that the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18025881830846879498">initiative sponsors could assert</a> California's interest, at least from a state law concept of standing. On February 7, 2012, the Ninth Circuit in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11174451370677368587">Perry v. Brown</a> held Proposition 8 was unconstitutional by a vote of 2-1.  Once again, the initiative proponents appealed.</p>

<p>On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court rendered a 5-4 decision in <span class="casename">Hollingsworth v. Perry</span> that the proponents of Proposition 8 did not have Article III standing to appeal in federal court. Chief Justice Roberts, writing the majority opinion, concluded that Proposition 8's proponents could not invoke the standing afforded to them by California's Supreme Court because a "litigant must assert his/her own rights and cannot claim relief through intervention of a third party." Roberts wrote: "standing in federal court is a question of federal law, not state law."  The Supreme Court did not address the underlying substantive merits of Proposition 8. Justice Kennedy dissented, writing: "The very object of the initiative system is to establish a lawmaking process that does not depend upon state officials...Giving the governor and attorney general this <em>de facto</em> veto will erode one of the cornerstones of the state's governmental structure."</p>

<p>Even gay marriage advocates <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323689204578575992886711294">voiced concern</a> for the initiative system. California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, who as mayor of San Francisco oversaw an administration that married thousands of gay couples in contravention of the Proposition 8 ballot initiative, expressed concern over the court's holding, stating: "You'd be hard pressed to find someone more enthusiastic about the outcome of the Supreme Court decision. But, I do think that the decision raises legitimate questions that are very problematic in the future." Charles Moran, an openly gay political consultant and chairman of the California Log Cabin Republicans similarly stated:  "This could have long-term impacts on elective politics...Anytime somebody has a statewide ballot initiative I think there's a new question that has to be asked: Will this pass the smell test of the Attorney General and the Governor."</p>

<p>To eliminate this "<em>de facto</em> veto," California should enact a law that would require a ballot measure's proponents to petition the state's highest court for a special attorney to be appointed when a state's elected officials refuse to defend a ballot initiative. With this proposed solution, it will still be the state of California defending the initiative, albeit through a Special Attorney of the state. This mechanism will insure that any law enacted through a ballot initiative will be given a full defense on its merits. And once such a defense is made, the law will still have to endure a constitutionality test on appeal. The only requirement would be that the proponents would have to make a preliminary showing to the state's highest court that the ballot measure did not violate state or federal law. This preliminary showing is analogous to the requirement that a party seeking a preliminary injunction must make, which is demonstrating a substantial likelihood of success on the merits to a court. This law would insure that state executives would not have a <em>de facto</em> veto as described by Justice Kennedy, allowing them to undo state ballot initiatives.</p>

		<title>The Man Behind the Curtain: Mandating Transparency in the Military Judicial System - Part II</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Robert Bracknell, a career Marine officer, continues his discussion on ways to reform the military judicial system...</p><strong>T</strong>his is the second of a two part series on transparency in military court-martial and attorney/judicial misconduct investigation records. Part I presents the case for transparency in court-martial records equivalent to the federal courts' <a href="https://www.pacer.gov">PACER</a> electronic records system to increase public understanding of military justice cases and enable the reporting necessary for public oversight of the system. Part II critiques exempting military attorney misconduct and judicial misconduct records; including reports of investigations, findings and sanctions, from being released to the public and advocates for legislative changes that promote regulatory systems similar to those employed by the state bars.</p>

                <p>Civic accountability over the legal profession is required in state bar systems. Conversely, attorney misconduct in the military system is shrouded in mystery and obfuscation, with supervising attorneys wielding privacy concerns as a shield against being held publicly accountable for professional performance. In the military system, individual privacy rights trump the public's ability to ensure the military bar is holding its practitioner's accountable on a basis similar to the state bars.</p>

                <p>One characteristic of a profession (as opposed to a job or a vocation) is its willingness, fitness and ability to regulate itself under a moral code; as well as to demonstrate its self-regulation to the public and to a group of peers within the profession itself. Regulation of professions is designed to protect the public, and accountability within the profession can best be realized by making the results of regulation public. Exposure of regulatory actions allow the market to steer clear of incompetent or unethical professionals, and allows certifying authorities to remove the practitioner's accreditation to practice within the profession.  Public scrutiny of a judge or legal practitioner's competence, ethics and performance are a required obligation of joining the profession.</p>

                <p>State bars make their disciplinary actions public. Public disclosure of professionals who engage in incompetent or unethical practice is simply life in the big leagues. When an attorney accepts a commission as an attorney, he agrees to all the rules accompanying bar membership, including revealing professional discipline in the public record. This is part of the deal society strikes with the bar. In return for the privilege of self-regulating, determining the profession's own ethical standards and enforcing these standards, the bar agrees to a robust public record of its proceedings. Certain specialized federal bars and other state licensing authorities take similar public enforcement action. Publicly naming violators of the standards of professional conduct signals that the profession takes its ethical and performance obligations seriously, and harnesses the power of peer pressure and the market to drive practitioners toward a high state of competent and ethical practice.</p>

                <p>Logically, judicial misconduct investigations mirror the tenets on which attorney misconduct investigation and sanctioning systems are based. Judicial discipline is often public as well, with disclosure policies falling along a gamut of publication options, depending on the jurisdiction or the identity of the investigating and sanctioning body. Like the attorney misconduct process, one common feature of the judicial misconduct investigation and discipline process is that complaints and investigations are private and undisclosed until the complaint has undergone at least some limited fact-finding. This bifurcation helps ensure specious claims from jilted litigants do not unfairly tarnish the reputations of otherwise principled judges. This robust system of judicial accountability instills faith in the third branch, and ensures that the judicial virtues of independence, impartiality and integrity are valued and honored by the judiciary.</p>

                <p>No such public disclosure of attorney and judicial misconduct exists under the implementing regulations published by the Judge Advocates General. Shielded by overaggressive interpretations of federal privacy statutes, misconduct proceedings and their outcomes are; quite simply, a giant secret, shrouding systemic transparency behind a thicket of sorcerous obfuscation. Like Oz working the levers behind the curtain, attorney and judicial discipline processes in the armed services amount to an exhortation to simply have faith in a system the public cannot see operating, ostensibly producing results that are never disclosed. Our 40th President unintentionally framed the correct approach to this issue when discussing the signing of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty at a joint press conference with Mikhail Gorbachev in December, 1987: Trust, but verify.</p>

                <p>Secrecy has a very limited place in mature systems of law. Grand jury proceedings and deliberations are secret for good reason: protecting grand jurors, witnesses and evidence from being influenced or tampered with by people being investigated, preventing the targets of grand jury investigations from fleeing arrest and preventing damage to the reputation of persons being investigated on whom no true bill is returned. However, when they produce public indictments these indictments are placed at the public's disposal through PACER almost immediately after their filing with the court asserting jurisdiction.  </p>

                <p>Similarly, certain criminal proceedings can be closed in narrow circumstances, such as to protect a vulnerable witness or to prevent the public disclosure of classified national security information. These are narrow exceptions to the general rule that the American criminal justice system operate openly, with virtually universal public disclosure of its proceedings and its records. Open trials are a hallmark of the American system that places primacy on the rule of law. The American Revolutionary War was predicated in part on the abuse of judicial power through nonpublic trials where a person had no reasonable opportunity to defend themselves.</p>

                <p>Opponents of transparency in judicial files and attorney and judicial misconduct records will interpose the straw man of federal privacy laws regarding disclosure. However, the <a href="http://foia.state.gov/Learn/PrivacyAct.aspx">Privacy Act of 1974</a> was never intended to prevent the disclosure of judicial records. It could easily be amended to emphasize that records of attorney and judicial misconduct shall be public, and not subject to withholding as personnel records or some similar non-sequitur, under the shield of the Privacy Act or other privacy-related statutes.  </p>

                <p>Disclosure of these records publicly - naming and shaming - should be mandatory, in exactly the same way that records of attorney and judicial misconduct and sanctions are available in state civil systems which license attorneys to practice and grant commissions to judges. If a government or military attorney or judge does not want records of his or her professional or judicial misconduct to be made public, there are at least two good options: do not commit professional or judicial misconduct; or do not become a government or military attorney or judge. Making public the professional record of the bar and bench are hallmarks of what makes the law a profession, instead of a mere vocation.</p>

                <p>Finally, Congress could prescribe itself an oversight role as a function of its Constitutional authority to "raise and support Armies" and "to provide and maintain a Navy", and to "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." Specifically, Congress could require that each service submit a report annually of all professional and judicial misconduct complaints, documentation of the investigations of the complaints, and an account of their resolutions.  Jurisdiction could be shared between committees that have significant interests in the administration of justice and the proper administration of the armed services, including the Armed Services, Judiciary and Oversight Committees of each house. Oversight works, inspiring compliance in self-protective and non-responsive bureaucracies. Prescribing a regime of actual accountability instead of the paper tiger system now in place could be a huge step in reforming the practice of military justice in the services.</p>

                <p>Congress is the only institution in the position to enact meaningful reforms. Continued calls for the Department of Defense to fix itself are likely to be met with the same frustrating responses that have recently damaged the system's reputation and functioning. Mandating an open, affirmative disclosure and oversight regime for court-martial records including military professional misconduct complaints and findings would allow the public a direct line of sight into the military justice system.  Increased transparency and scrutiny of military justice practices by the free flow of information from military courts to the public would mirror federal judicial best practices, promote better advocacy and judicial decision making, highlight military justice system successes, ensure accountability for system failures, affirm the public's faith that their sons and daughters are being treated with fairness and justice and could restore service member confidence in military justice.</p>

Yet, common sense allowed most to realize that the protracted firing of missiles and dropping of bombs by US military personnel on ISIS military equipment and fighters in Iraq and later in Syria has been significant war-time conduct. Under international law and US constitutional law, it is also war and armed conflict. </p>

<p>Under international law, it is the fact of war that compels the legal conclusion that war exists and, importantly, that the laws of war apply. At this moment, the US is engaged in an international armed conflict in Iraq and Syria to which all of the customary laws of war apply as well as several treaty-based rules of war. Under international law, the US is also engaged in measures of collective self-defense with the consent of Iraq against ongoing ISIS armed attacks on the Iraqi government that also happen to be partly planned and emanate from Syria. The Russians are wrong that these measures of collective self-defense are not lawful under the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a> and that the US must have authorization from the UN Security Council. <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Article 51</a> of the UN Charter expressly recognizes the inherent right of member states to engage in responsive measures of self and collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs. Quite clearly, ISIS is engaged in armed attacks against Iraq and, because the attacks are partly planned and partly emanate from Syria, selective use of force against ISIS in Syria as a matter of collective self-defense is also permissible and the US did not need special consent from the Assad government and is not at war with his regime.</p>

<p>Further, if the US was not participating in what is known as an international armed conflict in Iraq and Syria, US military personnel would be placed in harms way. It is only during such an armed conflict that US military personnel would have pow status, combatant status, and combatant immunity for lawful acts of war. Claiming that the US is not participating in an international armed conflict would be against common sense, contrary to international law, and remarkably inconsistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the US.</p>

<p>Under the US Constitution, US targetings of ISIS in Iraq and Syria are measures of war or armed conflict as well as measures of collective self-defense that are lawful under international law. The president's duty under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Article II</a>, Section 3 of the Constitution is to faithfully execute the "Laws," which throughout US history have decidedly included international law. It is this constitutionally-based duty that actually provides a competence of the president to use military force that is authorized by international law, like measures of collective self-defense. President Lincoln, President Truman, and every subsequent president has affirmed that they have a constitutionally-based competence to go to war in accordance with authority that pertains under international law, like the Security Council authorization to use military force in Korea that is still operative, the Security Council's authorization regarding Libya, and NATO's authorizations to use military force in Kosovo and Libya.</p>

<p>This constitutionally-based authority cannot be obviated by Congress. In the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ40/html/PLAW-107publ40.htm">2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force</a>, Congress admitted that "the President has authority under the Constitution to take action to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States." This is correct with respect to action authorized by international law. <br />
Moreover, as expressly recognized in the 1973 <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-33">War Powers Resolution</a> nothing precludes the president from using authorizations to use military force that are provided under existing treaties of the US, which necessarily include the UN Charter and the <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2061835">North Atlantic Treaty</a>. However, as recognized by the Supreme Court, Congress could limit the war in terms of time, place, and methods as long as the limitations do not go so far as to violate the separation of powers. Whether Congress will set limits to this war is presently unknown.</p>

		<title>Why &quot;Federalism&quot; Should Not Prevent Nationwide Marriage Equality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist David Glasgow, a fellow at the <a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/publicinterestlawcenter">New York University School of Law Public Interest Law Center</a>, discusses the reasons why the <span class="casename">Windsor</span> decision was not based on federalism...</p><strong>A</strong>dvocates and opponents of same-sex marriage are breathlessly waiting for news from the Supreme Court that a marriage equality case will be heard this term. The expectation of an imminent nationwide ruling comes after scores of lower courts have declared bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, relying heavily on the Supreme Court's reasoning in its landmark 2013 decision, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609&q">United States v. Windsor</a>. To date only one federal ruling has broken the consensus: the September 2014 decision by Judge Martin Feldman upholding Louisiana's ban.</p>

                <p>At this juncture, it is worth asking why <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, which declared a section of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defense_of_marriage_act_doma">Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)</a> unconstitutional, has made the legal landscape so lopsided toward marriage equality. Appreciating the answer requires us to put to rest the idea that <span class="casename">Windsor</span> is actually a federalism decision supporting a state's right to define marriage however it wishes. As I will argue, the near unanimity among recent lower court decisions is not a product of judicial activists licking their chops at the opportunity to impose their political ideology on the nation, but rather a logical consequence of <span class="casename">Windsor</span> itself. </p>

                <p>The court's decision in <span class="casename">Windsor</span> was ostensibly narrow. The question at issue was whether federal law could refuse to recognize same-sex marriages that were lawfully entered at the state level. By a majority of 5-4, the justices said no, effectively requiring consistency between the tiers of government. Even this limited ruling had profound and immediate consequences for same-sex couples in taxation, immigration and a host of other fields.</p>

                <p>Although <span class="casename">Windsor</span> compelled federal law to align with the states, it did not address the separate question whether states may continue to define marriage as between a man and a woman. The court insisted that its opinion and holding were "confined" to states in which same-sex marriage is lawful. But most people, including Justice Scalia, saw through the majority's attempt to cabin its opinion. "How easy it is, indeed how inevitable, to reach the same conclusion with regard to state laws denying same-sex couples marital status," Scalia angrily predicted in dissent. His words already sound prophetic.</p>

                <p>There is, however, a contrary view. Michigan Solicitor General Aaron Lindstrom and Deputy Solicitor General Eric Restuccia argue that <span class="casename">Windsor</span> was based on "federalism" and the exclusive authority of the states to define marriage. The problem with DOMA, according to proponents of this view, was that it impermissibly trampled on states' rights. Under such analysis, when a state makes its own decision about the meaning of marriage without meddlesome interference by the feds, the law should stand, even if it excludes same-sex couples. The Louisiana judge in September hinted at this idea, noting that <span class="casename">Windsor</span> "repeatedly and emphatically reaffirmed the longstanding principle that the authority to regulate the subject of domestic relations belongs to the states."</p>

                <p>The federalism reading of <span class="casename">Windsor</span> has become something of a rallying cry for opponents of same-sex marriage. Sensing their power slipping away, their aim is no longer to entrench the "traditional" definition of marriage nationwide, but simply to allow the ever-decreasing number of states that retain it to be left alone. Some would say this is fair enough as a purely political claim, but as a reading of <span class="casename">Windsor</span> it is impoverished. Here's why.</p>

                <p>The majority in <span class="casename">Windsor</span> acknowledged that, by history and tradition, the states have had virtually exclusive authority to regulate marriage, and the federal government has deferred to the states' policy decisions. DOMA rejected this precept by defining marriage federally to be only between a man and a woman, irrespective of the state definition. So far, so federalist. But then the court explicitly stated that it is "unnecessary to decide whether this federal intrusion on state power is a violation of the US Constitution because it disrupts the federal balance." Why? Because the court could rely on "basic due process and equal protection principles" to strike down the law. Federalism issues made the majority suspicious of DOMA, but those issues were not the reason for the law's unconstitutionality. The relevant section of DOMA was invalidated because it violated the due process and equal protection rights of couples in same-sex marriages, not because the federal government usurped power from the states.</p>

                <p>Even if federalism was an important reason for the decision in <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, in no way would this suggest that state bans on same-sex marriage are constitutional. "State laws defining and regulating marriage ... must respect the constitutional rights of persons," affirmed the majority. And this is precisely what marriage equality advocates claim is wrong with state bans: they do not respect same-sex couples' constitutional right to marry and constitutional right to equal protection. Whether or not Congress can poke its nose into state marriage laws is an entirely separate question from whether the Constitution allows states to exclude same-sex couples from the definition. The latter question can only be resolved by looking beyond <span class="casename">Windsor</span>'s language on states' rights to its language on gay rights.</p>

                <p>So, does <span class="casename">Windsor</span> suggest that the Constitution requires marriage equality? This is unanswerable without a conception of what marriage means. It has become fashionable in conservative intellectual circles to distinguish between two "views" of marriage: a "conjugal view" in which marriage is a man-woman union ordered to procreation, and a "revisionist view" in which marriage is a private romantic commitment between two people, regardless of gender. The distinction is based on the writings of Sherif Girgis, Robert George and Ryan Anderson, whose book, <em>What is Marriage? Man and Woman: a Defense</em>, was hailed by conservative activists as the most "formidable defense of the tradition ever written" upon its release in 2012.</p>

                <p>There are many reasons to dismiss the arguments of Girgis and his co-authors, which are based largely on bizarre natural law claims about "bodily union" achieved through coitus, but if their basic distinction between conjugal and revisionist views of marriage is correct, the court in <span class="casename">Windsor</span> has signaled its preference for the revisionist view. The opinion is replete with references to the institution of marriage as conferring a "dignity and status of immense import," of marriage enhancing "recognition, dignity, and protection," of it giving "further protection and dignity" to an enduring "personal bond" and of it acknowledging "the intimate relationship between two people, a relationship deemed by the state worthy of dignity." Nowhere did the court identify procreation or children as central to the meaning and purpose of the institution: the essence of the "conjugal view" of marriage. The only references to children in <span class="casename">Windsor</span> were the court's statements that DOMA "brings financial harm to the children of same-sex couples" and makes it difficult for children "to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives." Hardly a ringing endorsement of so-called traditional marriage.</p>

                <p>Once we dispense with the narrow interpretation that <span class="casename">Windsor</span> was about a state's right to define marriage however it chooses, we are left with strong hints that the Supreme Court endorses an inclusive definition. Based on its own language in <span class="casename">Windsor</span> and the extraordinary streak of successful marriage litigation over the previous year, I predict the Supreme Court will ride the wave of history rather than use federalism to push against it.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.cuhk.edu.hk/people/william-partlett.php">William Partlett</a>, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law, discusses recent reforms to Russia's judicial system ... </p><strong>R</strong></font>ussia is well known for having poor rule of law. Recent empirical research, however, <a href="https://media.law.wisc.edu/m/zdzjy/hendley_varieties_of_dualism.pdf">suggests</a> [PDF] that this reputation is not completely justified. This research suggests that Russia has a dualist system of law where politically sensitive cases are decided outside of the law (a "political" track) but where ordinary legal cases generally proceed with little political interference (an "ordinary" track). Recent judicial reforms have improved the adjudication of these ordinary track cases. For instance, the creation of the Justices of the Peace has been widely regarded as a positive step in improving access to courts and improving justice in Russia. Furthermore, since 2005, the leadership of the Russian commercial courts has markedly improved the quality of adjudication in commercial cases.  </p>

<p>In June 2013, President Vladimir Putin announced the most far-reaching <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/europe-rights-body-urges-russia-to-reform-judiciary.php">judicial reform</a> in the last 30 years: The creation of a new "super" Supreme Court that will merge the leadership of the Russian commercial courts with the regular courts.  Since this reform was announced, many have debated the effects of this reform. Some have argued that these reforms would further strengthen the ordinary track of the Russian legal system. Others were more pessimistic, warning that it is a way to ensure that more cases are placed on the political track.  </p>

<p>The time for speculation is now over. The restructuring is now complete: The new "super" Supreme Court began work on August 6, 2014.  Recent details about the makeup and organization of the new "super" court suggest that the pessimists were correct: This reform will weaken rule of law in Russia by eliminating one of the most innovative parts of the Russian judicial system and providing high level officials more opportunities for placing cases on the political track.   </p>

<p><strong>Russia's two court systems</strong></p>

<p>Since 1992, in addition to a stand-alone constitutional court, Russia has had two separate court systems: The courts of general jurisdiction (headed by a 115-judge Supreme Court) and the commercial courts (headed by a 55-judge High Commercial Court). The general courts consider the bulk of Russian legal cases including military, civil, and criminal courts cases. The commercial courts, by contrast, focus on commercial disputes between legal entities. </p>

<p>This separation&#8212;which was formalized in the <a href="http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-01.htm">1993 Constitution</a>&#8212;has led to two very different approaches to adjudicating disputes. Much of this difference can be traced to leadership. The Russian court system is incredibly hierarchical. The Chair (and his or her team) has vast bureaucratic power over lower court judges, including depriving them of housing or removing them from office if they are seen to be "underperforming." This leadership also has the power to shape the law by choosing issues to provide interpretations that guide lower court decisions.  </p>

<p>The Supreme Court&#8212;under the leadership of Vyacheslav Lebedev (a judge since 1970)&#8212;has not changed a great deal from the Soviet period. The courts of general jurisdiction continue to operate in a rather secretive way, stressing deference to government and interpreting statutes in very formalistic ways. Although many ordinary cases are decided without outside interference on the ordinary track, it is rather easy for a case to be placed on the political track in the courts of general jurisdiction.  </p>

<p>The commercial courts, by contrast, have been led by Anton Ivanov, a friend of Dmitry Medvedev and a former corporate lawyer. Ivanov has pushed the commercial courts to improve Russia's poorly drafted commercial law through guiding interpretations with the power of precedent. The High Commercial Court has also adopted a highly transparent approach, making opinions available online and streaming important court meetings on the internet. These reforms have made it more difficult to place cases in the commercial courts on the political track. </p>

<p><strong>Merging the two tracks?</strong></p>

<p>Vladimir Putin proposed merging these two court leadersips in 2013. In response, some expressed optimism about the unification of the two high courts. Judicial reform in recent years has improved access to courts and the quality of justice. Recent efforts to introduce new courts and pay judges more have improved the quality of justice on the ordinary track.  Optimists argued that this unifying reform would better allow solutions to cases where the two court systems had developed competing approaches to the same legal matter. Second, others speculated that the consolidation of the two systems could allow the reforms of the Commercial Courts to increase the influence of the ordinary track in the general courts.   </p>

<p>Recent details, however, suggest that this optimistic scenario has not come to pass. First, commercial court judges will have far fewer levers to develop and clarify commercial law. Under the reform, the High Commercial Court will be replaced by a far-diminished 30-judge Economic Collegium. This Collegium will have far less power to issue guiding interpretations, ending any experiments with the use of precedent to improve Russian commercial law. These reduced levers of power by the leadership potential are also likely to lead to more variability in lower court decisions, undermining any greater uniformity in adjudication. </p>

<p>Second, the selection process for the new court has eliminated most of the former leadership of the High Commercial Court. Indeed, the judges who were selected to the new Economic Collegium were those who opposed Ivanov's policies. The head of the new Economic Collegium is Oleg Sviredenko, a Moscow commercial court judge who opposed many of the former Chair reforms. By contrast, the leadership of the old Supreme Court has remained entirely intact: The former head of the old Supreme Court, Vyachaslev Lebedev, remains in charge of the new "super" Supreme Court.   </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The reform, therefore, has become embroiled in politics and emerged as a way to eliminate the innovative and assertive leadership of the High Commercial Court. Although this reform will not extinguish all of the positive steps made in Russian rule of law and the improvement made to ordinary track cases, it is likely to reduce the pace of innovation and reform in the Russian judicial system overall. This will certainly weaken the development of commercial law in Russia&#8212;a critical component of Russia's economic development. More broadly, this reform will likely damage recent attempts to reduce the number of cases decided on the political track.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Jason Birriel, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a>, Class of 2015, is the author of the third article in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law/academic-programs/student-journals/journal-civil-rights-and-economic-development">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Birriel discusses the issues with mandatory judiciary retirement provisions and possible alternatives...</j:header><strong>I</strong>n the summer of 2008, the Chief Justice of the New York Court of Appeals, Judith Kaye, authored the last opinion of her career. Why? Because Kaye turned 70 years old in 2008, and under the <a href="https://www.dos.ny.gov/info/constitution.htm">New York Constitution's</a> mandatory retirement provision she was legally barred from serving past the end of the year. Keep in mind that Kaye's retirement was not based on her judicial abilities or any health issues. Rather, she was forced to retire for no other reason than at age 70, the New York State Constitution deemed her too old to preside over the bench. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, what happened to Chief Justice Kaye is the reality for state appointed judges in thirty-two states and the District of Columbia. But most people who hear about Kaye's forced retirement react indifferently. After all, it is hard to empathize with someone who, while forced to retire, can easily join a law firm in private practice and double her salary or enter academia for a comparable salary and better quality of life. However, regardless of the opportunities that await Kaye in private practice or academia, the fact remains that state appointed jurists are discriminated against solely because of stereotypes of the elderly as "senile," "morbid" or "demented."</p>

<p>In addition, state judicial retirement laws completely ignore increased life expectancy in the US and the empirical research proving that Americans maintain their cognitive abilities later into life than once thought possible. For example, life expectancy <a href="http://cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/06Sep/RL32792.pdf">increased</a> [PDF] from 49.2 years at the turn of the last century to 77.5 years at the turn of the 21st century. Furthermore, Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner's study on elderly federal judges demonstrated that a judge's cognitive abilities do not necessarily decline with age. </p>

<p>Taking into account increased life expectancy and maintained cognitive abilities, courts should now use intermediate scrutiny instead of rational basis review when hearing challenges to state judicial retirement provisions under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a>. In contrast to the more deferential rational basis review, laws reviewed under intermediate scrutiny are presumptively unconstitutional and courts take a more exacting look at the method ("means") being employed by a legislature to achieve a particular objective (the "ends"). Further, intermediate scrutiny requires a tighter connection or "fit" between the "means" and "ends" than a legislative act pursues when compared with rational basis review. </p>

<p>Absent heightened judicial scrutiny, states can freely implement arbitrary and discriminatory judicial retirement laws the same way they once implemented arbitrary laws based on gender or sexual orientation. At one time, a state legislature could enact a law premised on gender stereotypes, like barring the admission of women to military schools on the stereotyped belief that women could not meet the physical requirements established for men. Similarly, in the past a state could enact laws targeting homosexual conduct for no reason other than it viewed such conduct negatively and considered it detrimental to society as a whole. </p>

<p>However, under intermediate scrutiny, such laws are considered unconstitutional if they are not "substantially related to an important governmental interest." Generally, that means that laws cannot be premised on broad generalizations. The result is that laws that discriminate against women simply because they are women or against gay people simply because they are gay are unconstitutional.</p>

<p>To qualify for intermediate scrutiny, a class of people must demonstrate that it has historically been "subjected to discrimination"; has a defining characteristic that "frequently bears [a] relation to ability to perform or contribute to society"; exhibits "obvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them as a discrete group"; and is "a minority or politically powerless." </p>

<p>Applying the four-factor test for intermediate scrutiny, state jurists qualify for heightened review. First, thirty-two states and the District of Columbia have mandatory judicial retirement provisions going back over a century, which demonstrates that state jurists have historically been subjected to discrimination. Second, state jurists have a defining characteristic that bears a relation to their ability to contribute to society: their ability to be judges. Third, state jurists also exhibit a distinguishing characteristic that defines them as a discrete group: their profession. Finally, the results of the New York State ballot initiative on November 3, 2013, which sought to merely increase the judicial mandatory retirement age, shows that despite the appearance of being politically connected, state jurists are politically powerless. </p>

<p>Since state jurists meet the requirements for intermediate scrutiny, a less discriminatory method of ensuring a competent judiciary must be developed. Instead of across-the-board mandatory retirement ages, some form of objective testing can be developed to allow states to meet the substantial government interest of maintaining a competent judiciary while not discriminating against state jurists solely because of their age. </p>

<p>For example, consider how Illinois <a href="http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/drivers/drivers_license/drlicid.html">tests</a> elderly residents renewing their drivers' licenses. As an Illinois resident's age increases, the requirements to maintain a driver's license increase as well. Upon reaching 75, a driver must pass a road test to renew his license, regardless of whether a driver recently renewed his license. Upon reaching 81, a driver has to renew his license every two years as opposed to every four. And after the age of 87, a driver must renew his license every year. The net effect of the Illinois driver regulations for the elderly is that the state has a method to ensure the elderly are proficient behind the wheel, while not discriminating against them solely because of their age. A similar test can be designed for state jurists as well. </p>

<p>Overall, increased life expectancy and new research dismissing "age-old" stereotypes about the elderly demonstrate that judicial mandatory retirement provisions should no longer be reviewed under rational basis scrutiny. Further, with life expectancy only expected to increase, unless the Supreme Court addresses this issue and applies a heightened standard of review, litigation challenging state judicial mandatory retirement ages will continue to enter the courthouse doors. </p>

		<title>Constitutionality of Constitutional Acts in Egypt: Can the Egyptian Supreme Constitutional Court Extend its Jurisdiction?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Mohamed Abdelaal, of the <a href="http://www.law.alexu.edu.eg/">Alexandria University School of Law</a> in Egypt, discusses the complexities of the current state of the Egyptian Supreme Constitutional Court...</p><strong>A</strong>fter the now-ousted President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-swears-in-first-democratically-elected-president.php">assumed power</a> in Egypt in June 2012, the country witnessed a huge wave of political polarization. That is, Egypt's liberal bloc and civil society organizations accused Morsi of attempting to seize power and continued to <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">cast doubt</a> upon his legitimacy. On the other hand, Egypt's Islamists showed great support for President Morsi, accusing his opponents of trying to halt the state by being biased against the president's policies and by refusing any initiative to bring the conflicting parties together. Such polarization was evident in the judiciary as well. Specifically, a number of judges gathered in a coalition known as <em>Qudāh mn ajel Misr</em> (Judges for the Sake of Egypt) to support Morsi's presidency and legitimacy. Likewise, Judge Ahmad El-zined, the Chairman of the Egypt's Judges Club, led those judges who opposed Morsi, calling for the toppling of his regime.</p>

<p>However, disagreement between the judiciary and the president reached its acme when President Morsi issued the <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/58947.aspx">2012 Constitutional Declaration</a> on November 22, 2012. The declaration immunized the Constituent Assembly responsible for drafting the 2012 constitution, preventing it from being dissolved by the judiciary and its work from being challenged in court. This was in violation of the <a href="http://www.egypt.gov.eg/english/laws/constitution/">2011 Constitutional Declaration</a> issued by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) and approved in a popular referendum after the Revolution of 2011 to serve as the country's fundamental law until the drafting of a new constitution. Additionally, the declaration immunized President Morsi's decrees and decisions from judicial oversight. Further, the declaration dismissed of the Prosecutor General Abdul Majid Mahmoud, who was appointed by President Hosni Mubarak, in violation of the Judicial Authority Act.</p>

<p>However, the way the Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) responded to this declaration was lame. The Court denounced the declaration, describing it as a mere attempt by Morsi to grab power and to degrade the judiciary by immunizing his decisions. Further, many judges appeared in the media to urge people to demonstrate and protest to topple the declaration. Likewise, rights and political activists strongly opposed the declaration, arguing that it solidified despotism. Thus, the Court's reaction did not go further than merely objecting without proceeding to any legal-judicial action, which raises the question of whether the Court has the authority to review constitutional acts.</p>

<p>At first sight, reviewing the constitutionality of constitutional acts seems odd simply because judicial review is concerned with the constitutionality of ordinary laws, which are inferior to the constitution. Consequently, the standard of review is whether these ordinary laws are consistent with the measures, norms and principles found in the constitution. Nevertheless, the constitutions of some countries grant constitutional courts the power to examine the constitutionality of constitutional acts. For instance, Article 148(1) of the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_127495.pdf">Turkish Constitution of 1982</a> (PDF) empowers the constitutional court to review the constitutionality of constitutional amendments. </p>

<p>Further, Article 146(a) of the <a href="http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act1_2">Romanian Constitution of 1991</a>, as it stands in the 2003 revised version, authorizes the constitutional court to adjudicate on initiative to revise the constitution. Likewise, the constitutional courts of some countries granted themselves the power to decide over the constitutionality of constitutional acts without having such power included in the constitution. Specifically in 2009, the Czech Constitutional Court ruled that Constitutional Act no.195/2009, regarding shortening the term of the Office of the Chamber of Deputies, was unconstitutional on the basis that it was an individual and retroactive act, and thus violated the requirements of a democratic state governed by Art. 9(2), an <a href="https://www.icl-journal.com/download/9154631a2731a1b56b82771aa7ad8754/ICL1_Roznai.pdf">unamendable</a> (PDF) provision in the constitution. Moreover, in the remarkable case <a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1939993/">Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India</a>, the Indian Constitutional Court ruled that the 42nd Amendment of the Indian Constitution is unconstitutional because it violates the basic structure of the constitution.</p>

<p>However, in Egypt, the case is different. Specifically, Article 192 of the current <a href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/20131206EgyptConstitution_Dec.pdf.pdf">Constitution</a> (PDF) of 2013 determines the jurisdiction of the SCC to be: "(1) decide on the constitutionality of laws and regulations; (2) interpret legislative texts; and (3) adjudicate disputes regarding affairs of its members, disputes pertaining to the implementation of its rulings and decisions, disputes between judicial bodies and entities with judicial mandate and disputes that raise implementation of two final contradictory rulings." In addition, after emphasizing the Court's power to examine the constitutionality of laws and regulations and to interpret legislative texts; Law No. 48/1979, regarding the establishment of the SCC and the determination of its procedures and jurisdiction, authorizes it to interpret laws and presidential decrees that have the authority of law (Art. 26). Consequently, neither the constitution nor Law No. 48/1979 authorizes the SCC to review the constitutionality of constitutional acts. Further, there is no precedent where the SCC exercised its judicial review power to examine the constitutionality of a constitutional act.</p>

<p>In fact reviewing the constitutionality of constitutional acts is to a great extent related to the idea of a proactive judicial review, which allows the court to proactively test the constitutionality of laws before they come into effect. However, the Constitution of 2013 as well as Law No. 48/1979 support the idea of subsequent judicial review; that is, that the SCC can only review the constitutionality of laws and regulations after their actual issuance and in regard to an ongoing judicial case in which a constitutional challenge is raised. Thus, the idea of proactive review does not actually exist.</p>

<p>Indeed, if the SCC had the authority to examine the constitutionality of constitutional acts in 2012, the Court would have been able to nullify the 2012 Constitutional Declaration issued by President Morsi without being involved in conduct such as threatening not to adjudicate judicial cases and urging the general public to protest. So, the question is how the Court's jurisdiction can be expanded to review constitutionality of constitutional acts.</p>

<p>The first option is to introduce a constitutional amendment that empowers the SCC to proactively check the constitutionality of constitutional acts and amendments before they become binding. However, this option seems a bit difficult given the complicated procedure for amending the constitution. Precisely, according to Article 226 of the constitution, the amendment may be requested by the president of the Republic or one-fifth of the members of the House of Representatives, before the latter decides to accept the request in whole or in part by a majority of its members. Further, it should debate. If the text of the articles to be amended is approved by a two-thirds majority of the House's members, the amendment is put to a public referendum within 30 days of the date of approval.</p>

<p>The second option is that the Court can try to add such power to its jurisdiction through affirmative action by ruling on the constitutionality of constitutional acts and amendments by itself, without waiting for a constitutional or legislative authorization. In fact, this approach is likely to be challenged by both the executive and legislative branches on the ground that neither the constitution nor the Court's law supports it. Despite that, this approach remains effective since the verdicts of the SCC are final and cannot be appealed.</p>

<p>Now the question is what standard of review the Court should adopt. According to Article 226 of the 2013 Constitution, "texts pertaining to the principles of freedom and equality stipulated in this Constitution may not be amended, unless the amendment brings more guarantees." Thus, the constitution made all provisions regarding the principles of freedom and equality unamendable if an amendment hinders such principles. Consequently, the Court can declare a constitutional amendment or a constitutional act unconstitutional if it infringes the principle of equality or fundamental freedoms or restricts their practice. Further, the Court's jurisdiction must extend to reviewing amendments that undermine the country's basic constitutional principles, such as democracy and rule of law. However, the Court must be very cautious while exercising its power. Likewise, the Egyptian jurisprudence must play a great role in developing the standard of review and in determining what is considered a permissible amendment and what constitutes an impermissible one that must be nullified by the Court. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Amaury Reyes-Torres of <a href="http://unibe.edu.do/es#zone-portadacentros">Iberoamerican University</a> (UNIBE) in Mexico, discusses Baskin v. Bogan and argues that the opinion presents an alternative approach to the equal protection standard of review for discriminatory acts...</p><strong>T</strong>he right to equality or the right to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">equal protection</a> of the laws is essential in a democratic society. This right has a particular content and it requires a particular standard of review in order to properly assess whether a given act or conduct of the government constitutes an unreasonable differentiated treatment (discrimination) involving an individual or a class. This commentary focuses on the following questions: How should the courts proceed in the assessment of any possible violation to the equal protection clause? Is there a test to rely on as a standard of review? </p>

<p>Latin-American constitutional courts (e.g the Constitutional Court of Colombia and the Constitutional Court of the Dominican Republic), rely on 'the equality test' to examine whether a particular treatment is constitutionally permitted. The equality test, as developed by these courts, presents three fundamental components under which a potential discriminatory act or conduct is reviewed:<ol><br />
	<li>The determination of whether or not the affected individuals in the situation under analysis are similar;</li><br />
	<li>The analysis of the proportionality, suitability and necessity of the differentiated treatment; </li><br />
	<li>The analysis of the goals to be achieved by the differentiated treatment, the means to achieve them and the relationship between the means and the goals.</li><br />
</ol>However, the test advanced by these courts could be upgraded or at least, semantically speaking, refocused under a new different perspective. In <em>Making Our Democracy Work: A Judge's View</em>, Justice Stephen Breyer noted, since the constitution is a meant to be workable, a new approach&#8212;when it comes to equal protection&#8212;is a good way to make it so. </p>

<p>In one of the many decisions favoring the unconstitutionality of same sex marriage bans in the US, as a result of the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">Windsor Effect</a>, there is one particular judicial opinion that must be given our attention for the purposes of the inquiry. Even though it is not a supreme court opinion, its relevance should not be dismissed lightly. This is because of how it deals, as a matter of practical legal reason, with the right to equal protection of the laws and how it should be properly applied as a standard of review regarding discriminatory acts. Furthermore, it gives us an interesting focus on how an issue related to discrimination should be approached, in particular when it comes to a protected class.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17115587439154811848">Baskin v. Bogan,</a> Judge Posner, writing for a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, posed four questions that in a practical manner help address the issue of whether a concrete policy is discriminatory, and therefore unconstitutional, under the equal protection clause. To properly engage in this exercise, we must ask ourselves the following: <ol><br />
	<li>Does the challenged practice involve discrimination, rooted in a history of prejudice, against some identifiable group of persons, resulting in unequal treatment harmful to them?</li><br />
	<li>Is the unequal treatment based on some immutable or at least tenacious characteristic of the people discriminated against? The characteristic must be one that is not relevant to a person's ability to participate in society.</li><br />
	<li>Does the discrimination, even if based on an immutable characteristic, nevertheless confer an important offsetting benefit on society as a whole?</li><br />
	<li>Though it does confer an offsetting benefit, is the discriminatory policy over-inclusive because the benefit it confers on society could be achieved in a way less harmful to the discriminated-against group, or under-inclusive because the government's purported rationale for the policy implies that it should equally apply to other groups as well?</li><br />
</ol>These questions are nothing but a semantic way to inquire whether or not a policy is discriminating against a particular class. Through these questions, writing for the majority, Posner tried to summarize the equal protection doctrine in a more accessible way. Each question deals with a specific part of the equal protection assessment. According to Posner:</p>

<blockquote>Our questions go to the heart of equal protection doctrine. Questions 1 and 2 are consistent with the various formulas for what entitles a discriminated-against group to heightened scrutiny of the discrimination, and questions 3 and 4 capture the essence of the Supreme Court's approach in heightened-scrutiny cases: To succeed, the defender of the challenged action must show at least that the classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.</blockquote>On Posner's view, this 'semantic' view of the equal protection standard places emphasis on  the government aims or interests and to what extent the law is best suited or tailored to achieve the compelling interest. It excludes from the test the cost and benefits analysis approach by focusing only on how 'fit' the policy is to achieve the identified aim: whether or not the policy might do more harm than required to attain the goals or whether the exclusion of similar groups is indicative of arbitrariness regarding the group subject to policy.

<p>As we see, the semantic approach in Posner's opinion dares to take a closer look at the concrete circumstances surrounding the individuals who claimed they had been discriminated against. Also, it places emphasis on the political and social stance, historically speaking, of a class or group, which helps provide a comprehensive view of the situation under review. Furthermore, when it comes to a protected or a suspect class, it helps identify the elements to establish the presumption of discrimination that shifts the burden of proof on the state or the third party claiming that no discrimination has occurred. To have a constitution that is meant to work is about asking ourselves the proper questions regarding a particular constitutional clause to fully understand it as meant by the constitution. <br />
 <br />
How useful could these questions be to determine when a particular policy is discriminatory under the equality test? As I said, the equality test is a standard created by the Constitutional Court of Colombia that was later adopted by the Constitutional Court of the Dominican Republic. However, the components of the equality test, as we saw, are not so accessible (in a practical way) and do not offer a set of concrete questions to assess whether or not a given questioned conduct is permissible under the constitution. </p>

<p>This does not mean that these courts should give up their equality test, but it means that a new approach such as the 'semantic approach' developed by the Seventh Circuit in <span class="casename">Baskin</span>, could be a very useful tool to properly apply the equality test, particularly when it comes to components 2 and 3 of the test. The semantic approach is a suitable complement to the equality test and it helps us study and decide cases from a pragmatic approach, by asking ourselves the important and pragmatic questions.</p>

<p>Even when the <em>certiorari</em> petition was recently <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/100614zor.pdf">denied</a> (PDF), Posner's opinion in <span class="casename">Baskin</span> offers a good starting point to develop a pragmatic approach on the equality test. I personally believe that this fascinating approach is useful to refocus the way courts see the equal protection standard of review against discriminatory acts.</p>

		<title>Ebola, Human Rights and Health Discrimination</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Stefan Kirchner, of the <a href="http://www.ulapland.fi">University of Lapland</a> in Finland, discusses the possibility of global discrimination during the ongoing Ebola outbreak ...</p><strong>T</strong>he current Ebola outbreak has lead to discrimination against those infected with Ebola as well as against health care workers caring for those infected or suspected of being infected with Ebola. Discrimination based on health reasons is hardly a new phenomenon. It has culminated in countries, which <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/87/pdfs/ukpga_19670087_en.pdf">do not allow at will abortion</a>, to permit abortion in cases where the health of the child is only <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2011092/Aborted-cleft-palate-Thousands-pregnancies-aborted-abnormalities-including-500-Downs.html#ixzz3G8Oy0cax">marginally affected</a>. This discrimination is also present in the outright celebration of suicide as a form of self-determined approach to sickness, where there appears to be a greater expectation of health and a lack of acceptance of illness. </p>

<p>While nurses, physicians and others risk their lives to fight highly infectious diseases; elsewhere it is not the disease but those affected by it who are targeted. While there is not yet a cure for HIV/AIDS, at least some patients in developed countries (a small percentage of those infected with HIV globally) have access to the full range of <a href="http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/treatment/en/">medical options</a> and may start to consider HIV to be a chronic disease. Essentially, it has become possible to delay the outbreak of AIDS after an HIV infection for many years. However, HIV/AIDS will continue to provide medical and legal challenges so long as a fast, effective treatment remains globally unavailable to all affected patients. </p>

<p>If HIV patients are enabled to live longer, healthier lives, they will be more likely to remain part of the workforce. If the search for a cure will take many years, HIV-positive employees will become a more common phenomenon. In many legal systems this already raises the question: Under which conditions do employees have a duty to inform their employers about their infection? While information about HIV is more easily available today than in the past, the stigmatization of HIV-positive persons continues.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-127055">I.B v. Greece</a>, decided late last year, the European Court of Human Rights heard the case of an applicant who had lost his job after his co-workers learned about his HIV-infection. Article 14 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR) protects against discrimination. The right to a private life, protected under Article 8. Article 14 sets out a number of examples where discrimination will be found, but also includes what the Convention refers to as "other status" within its meaning. This includes a person's health status. Not providing the totality of rights established under the Convention due to the fact that somebody is HIV positive is discrimination under Article 14, as a person's health status is part of the right to private life under Article 8.</p>

<p>Infectious diseases also have wider legal implications. While it might be difficult to successfully litigate before the European Court of Human Rights for a state's failure to prevent infections, doing so remains a possibility. Especially when it comes to infections that occur while a state has control over an individual; for example, during a detention, military service or when medical staff works on behalf of the state. In the case of the current Ebola outbreak, the non-governmental organization Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has taken the lead in the international effort to fight the disease and several nations are sending hundreds of experts to the affected countries. Under Article 2 of the ECHR, which protects the right to life, nations have an obligation to equip their staff, in the widest sense of the term, adequately with the required protective gear. The same principle applies to the deployment of armed forces in combat. Unlike a case under the UN's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/cescr.aspx">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a>, the right to life is not a social human right that could be limited by the available resources. Rather, this is an immediate obligation regardless of a nation's financial possibilities. This does not mean that volunteers for MSF, the Red Cross or others are not protected in a similar way: Their employers or sending organizations have an obligation to equip them adequately and states have a duty under Article 2 of the ECHR to ensure that this happens. </p>

<p>Ebola differs significantly from HIV in that the risk of an infection with Ebola is present in day-to-day interaction; such as shaking hands, while becoming infected with HIV is much more difficult. It appears justifiable under the ECHR to limit the activities of persons infected with Ebola and those reasonably suspected of being infectious. In the context of the current outbreak, there have been calls for limitations on international travel, ranging from refusing to permit infected persons entry into countries where they could actually receive highly qualified medical treatment, to the idea of closing international borders completely. The latter possibility would not be compatible with the ECHR as, at the time of this writing, there have been only a few cases of secondary infections outside the most affected countries, which does not warrant a complete halt to international traffic. </p>

<p>In any case, the human dignity of all patients must be protected at all times. For Ebola patients, this is often set aside due to fears concerning Ebola. Here the state has a duty to create an environment in which discrimination is prevented. This includes an obligation to inform the general population, but to also extend legal protections to health care workers by private actors such as landlords, shop owners and others who may discriminate against them. </p>

<p>Attempts to curb Ebola include quarantining both patients and those suspected of being infected. In an HIV context, the European Court of Human Rights already dealt with quarantine for the purpose of preventing the spread of a viral disease: Detaining a person has to be the "last resort in order to prevent [them] from spreading the [disease and] less severe measures [must have] been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the public interest." Also, "a fair balance between the need to ensure that the [disease] did not spread and the applicant's right to liberty" is required by the European Court of Human Rights.  In <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-68077">Enhorn v. Sweden</a>, the manner and length of the detention were taken into account. Although the court found Sweden at fault for hospitalizing an HIV positive man for a year and a half, quarantining suspected carriers of the Ebola virus for the duration of the incubation period of 21 days would seem to be compatible with the ECHR, especially in light of the dangerous nature of Ebola.</p>

<p>Infectious diseases remain an important and often global health care challenge and in a globalized and highly mobile and interconnected world diseases like bird flu, swine flu, Ebola, HIV and other diseases are likely to be spread more quickly than in the past. At the same time globalization allows the world to react better to health emergencies. Rather than being split by fear of infection, such diseases should bring the world closer together in the fight against disease. Human rights norms, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, provide a legal obligation to take action and to protect the ill.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist D'Arcy Kemnitz, Executive Director of the <a href="http://lgbtbar.org">National LGBT Bar Association</a> discusses reasons why the "gay panic" defense should be outlawed...</p><strong>J</strong>ust over a year ago, barely a dozen states recognized lesbian and gay marriages. Today, following a sea of change spurred on by rapidly evolving public opinion and a US Supreme Court that has permitted <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">marriage recognition</a> to grow, a majority of the US now provides the rights and benefits of marriage to couples both gay and straight.</p>

                <p>This rapid extension of a fundamental legal protection to lesbian and gay Americans has left many people, including many within the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, feeling as if equality for LGBT families is sweeping the nation. In some ways, it is. In many other ways, however, LGBT people continue to face unspeakable discrimination. </p>

                <p>As of this writing, one of the eleven or so states not yet extending marriage to same-sex couples is Mississippi. It, along with many of its neighbors in the deep south, continues to be not just an unequal place to live, but in many respects, a dangerous place, too. While couples across the country celebrate their unions, LGBT people in Mississippi have a justifiable fear for their lives.</p>

                <p>In 2013, Marco McMillan, a candidate for mayor of Clarksdale, Mississippi, was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/20/us/mississippi-murder-mystery/">murdered</a>. McMillan, who was a trailblazing, openly gay political candidate in a region of the country where there are few such pioneers, was killed in an apparent homicide. In February of this year, a grand jury indicated Lawrence Reed, though a trial date has not yet been set.</p>

                <p>When Reed's trial does begin, however, it is entirely plausible that jurors will be told the defendant murdered McMillian simply because he was gay. Following his arrest, Reed allegedly <a href="http://www.avp.org/storage/documents/2013.3.5%20_ncavp_mr_marcomcmillian.pdf">told</a> police he killed McMillan because the Mississippi mayoral candidate made an advance toward him. In Reed's mind, this justified McMillan's murder.</p>

                <p>It's a strategy known as the "gay and trans panic" defense, and it has been used by perpetrators of violence against LGBT people from <a href="http://www.matthewshepard.org/our-story/matthews-story">Matthew Shepard</a> to Marco McMillan. In 49 of our 50 states, its use is perfectly legal.</p>

                <p>Just weeks ago, California became the first, and only, state to make use of the so-called "panic" defense illegal. <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB2501">Legislation</a> signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/california-outlaws-gay-panic-homicide-defense.php">prohibits defendants</a> from even attempting to convince a jury that a victim's sexual orientation is justifiable grounds for murder.</p>

                <p>It's a significant step forward, but we're only 1/50 of the way done.</p>

                <p>Last year, the LGBT Bar, introduced a <a href="http://lgbtbar.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Gay-and-Trans-Panic-Defenses-Resolution.pdf">resolution</a> [PDF] at the annual meeting of the American Bar Association (ABA), calling on all states to outlaw the use of this reprehensible "defense." The delegates of the ABA&#8212;who represent every red and blue corner of the country and every judicial philosophy from Scalia to Ginsburg&#8212;approved our resolution without dissent. Legal professionals, regardless of their ideological leanings, understand it is never acceptable to defend violence based on who a victim is.</p>

                <p>To most people, this will seem like a no-brainer. Indeed, in our outreach work, the LGBT Bar has found that most people do not even realize such a "defense" is permissible in any court. Yet the list of hate crimes in which perpetrators are employing its use is growing. The "panic" defense has been used, in some form, to justify the murder of <a href="http://www.glaad.org/blog/gwen-araujo-murdered-ten-years-ago-today">Gwen Araujo</a>, a transgender woman murdered in California; the in-school <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scottie-thomaston/brandon-mcinerney-lawrence-king-murder_b_1161555.html">attack</a> against Larry King; an <a href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/05/30/watch-atlanta-trans-women-beaten-train-bystanders-film">attack</a> on two transgender women using Atlanta's public transit system; and the now infamous murder of Wyoming college student Matthew Shepard.</p>

                <p>Despite the advancement of legal protections for our relationships, these cases underscore that, for too many people, there is too little protection for our lives.</p>

                <p>That's why the LGBT Bar is working to replicate our advances in California across the country. By working with state attorneys general and state legislators, we know we can put an end to this unconscionable courtroom tactic. Even before other laws are passed, however, judges have a clear choice, as exemplified by the ABA. They can&#8212;and should&#8212;instruct juries to disregard any use of the "panic" defense. It would dishonor the memory of victims to even silently imply that being an LGBT person is sufficient means for violence or murder. </p>

                <p>Until more states follow California's lead, the use of this deplorable legal tactic is likely to continue unabated.</p>

                <p>Indeed, just this past July, another perpetrator raised the likelihood that they, too, would hide behind such a cowardly defense. A relative of the suspect in the <a href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/07/02/suspect-trans-womans-murder-turns-himself">shooting</a> of Tiffany Edwards, a transgender woman in Cincinnati, told local media that the person accused in Edwards's attack "gets an attitude" about gay or transgender people "trying to hit on" him. The message was clear: The shooter thought it was perfectly fine to fire a gun at someone because he didn't like her gender identity. </p>

                <p>As a lawyer, I am outraged by the idea that anyone would justify violence because of prejudice. As a mother, I am furious that anyone's child&#8212;at any age&#8212;could be the target of such tactics. Marco McMillian left behind grieving parents who lost their only child. Every parent should be moved to action by his story.</p>

                <p>Our country has rightly said that no one should be targeted for violence because of their gender, ethnicity or religious beliefs. It is past time we added the same protection for those targeted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>

                <p>That work, however, will not be easy. But it must become a priority as we realize that, even in states where our relationships can be celebrated and protected, our livelihood and lives still remain vulnerable and under attack.</p>

The <a href="http://www.usccr.gov/">United States Commission on Civil Rights</a> invited <a href="http://law.pitt.edu/people/david-harris">Professor David A. Harris</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law to testify at the Commission's hearing on October 17, 2014.  The subject of the hearing is Stand Your Ground laws. The state of Florida passed the first such law in 2005, and many states have followed suit.  Professor Harris will testify about how these laws are influenced by unconscious, implicit racial bias. The following is the written version of Professor Harris's testimony. <br />

<h3>Stand Your Ground Laws and Implicit Bias</h3>
United States Commission on Civil Rights
October 17, 2014, Orlando, Florida
</center>

<p>I am grateful to the Commission for the invitation to share my views on the subject of Stand Your Ground (SYG) laws.  These laws now exist in the majority of the States, and they have had a measurable impact on deadly violence and the criminal justice systems in many of them.  I will begin with a basic explanation of what these laws say, especially how they differ from the long-established law of self-defense in Anglo-American law.  I will then examine the empirical evidence concerning how SYG laws work; this evidence has emerged in just the last couple of years.  I will then discuss implicit bias, which is the source considerable racial disparity in the enforcement of SYG laws, and the rest of the criminal justice system.</p>

<p><strong>I.	A Brief Examination of SYG Laws</strong></p>

<p>For centuries, the Anglo-American law on homicide and self-defense have remained the same. Statutes against homicides prohibit unlawful killings, but the law against homicide has always allowed for self-defense.  A person under attack with deadly force may respond in kind.   A person suffering unlawful aggression may respond with the amount of force that is reasonably necessary to protect herself.  The law has always said that a killing in self-defense does not constitute criminal homicide, as long as the person defending herself had a reasonable belief that her life was in imminent danger. </p>

<p>From its earliest times, the law of self-defense has included an important exception.  When one under attack knows he can escape from danger by retreating, without risking further danger to herself, he must retreat.   Like the law against homicide, the rule of retreat attempts to avoid unnecessary death - even the death of an unlawful attacker - unless the circumstances present no alternative.  The rule of retreat is itself subject to an exception:  the rule has almways applied everywhere except in the home of the person under attack.  This exception to the rule of retreat, known as the castle doctrine,  makes sense:  the home is the last and final place to which one could retreat.  Thus a victim never had to retreat from an attacker in her own home; she could stand and fight back.</p>

<p>SYG laws change this ancient legal landscape in a fundamental way.  SYG laws abolish the rule of retreat in any place the person defending herself has a right to be.  Put another way, SYG laws take the rule of retreat from the home and extend it into public places.  A person under unjustified attack in a public place need not retreat, even if she knows she can get away in complete safety; she can stand her ground, and even use deadly force if she faces deadly force.  With an SYG law, one who kills under a claim of self-defense would not have to prove that she had no means of escape.  Instead, she need only show that she had a reasonable fear of death or deadly injury, and that the incident occurred in a public place in which she was lawfully present.</p>

<p>This "no retreat in public" idea is the central feature of Florida's SYG law.   The Florida law also gives criminal and civil immunity to one claiming an SYG defense.  When the killer makes an SYG claim, police cannot immediately arrest, detain, charge or prosecute, as they usually would.  Police and prosecutors may investigate, utilizing "standard procedures," but they cannot arrest unless the agency "determines that there is probable cause that the force that was used was unlawful."   Should the police or prosecutors choose to pursue charges anyway, the person is entitled to a pretrial hearing in which a judge decides whether the defendant should have received SYG immunity.  </p>

<p>Florida's SYG law, enacted in 2005, led to many new SYG laws across the United States.  According to Professor Tamara Lawson of St. Thomas University School of Law, as of 2014, thirty-four states had SYG provisions that eliminated the duty to retreat in public places. Legislatures created the SYG provisions twenty-five states; court decisions created them in the other nine states.    (These numbers do not include states that only have a no retreat rule in the home, since that is the traditional rule replaced by SYG.)</p>

<p><strong>II.	How Do SYG Laws Work in Practice? </strong></p>

<p>Proponents of SYG laws said that significant changes would follow enactment of these laws.  Crime would decrease, including violent crime and homicides, because criminals would know that victims could meet deadly force with deadly force.    The net effect would be less crime and deadly violence, especially killings. </p>

<p>Because almost ten years have passed since the enactment of Florida's 2005 SYG law, researchers now have data that has enabled them to study the effects of these laws.  These empirical evaluations cast doubt on the assumptions of SYG advocates about crime and violence.   The first thing researchers have tested empirically focuses on the central promise of SYG laws:  they will make us safer from serious crime, especially homicide.  In their paper "Does Strengthening Self-Defense Law Deter Crime or Escalate Violence?  Evidence from the Castle Doctrine,"  Texas A&M University researchers Cheng Cheng and Mark Hoekstra examined data on crime and homicide patterns from 2000 to 2010.  They compared rates of violent crime and homicide before and after passage of the SYG laws, and they also compared data from other states that did not pass SYG laws.  From these data, Cheng and Hoekstra made comparisons of SYG states and non-SYG states, both before and after passage of these laws; they also compared states in the same geographic regions.  The results did not show what proponents of SYG laws had predicted.  Concerning violent crimes - burglary, robbery, and aggravated assault - Cheng and Hoekstra found that SYG laws had no effect.  The authors found "no evidence of deterrence effects" for any of these crimes.   However, the frequency of one crime did change.  In SYG states, more homicides occurred after the passage of these laws than had occurred before.  SYG laws, the authors said, "increase homicides by a statistically significant 8 percent," which yields 600 more homicides per year across all states with SYG laws.   These results - not greater safety, but an eight percent increase in unlawful killings - seem to show that those who believed that SYG laws would decrease violent crime were wrong.</p>

<p>Another 2012 paper, by Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin of Georgia State University  independently produced similar results.  Using a different data source and a different methodology than Cheng and Hoekstra, McClellan and Tekin concluded that "Stand Your Ground laws are associated with a significant increase in homicides. . . ."  They say their results "are robust to a number of specifications and unlikely to be driven entirely by the killings of assailants."   Their findings "raise serious doubts against the argument that Stand Your Ground laws make America safer." </p>

<p>Other empirical work on SYG laws also reveals that SYG laws have a disparate racial impact.  In his study "Race, Justifiable Homicide, and Stand Your Ground Laws:  Analysis of FBI Supplementary Homicide Report Data,"  John K. Roman of the Justice Policy Center of the Urban Institute studied SYG data to determine whether "justifiable homicides differ by the race of the victim and offender" and whether certain "fact patterns of homicides increase racial disparities."  Roman aimed to "analyze objective national data that could measure the presence of racial disparities in rulings of justifiable homicides."   Roman's work demonstrated, first, that SYG states "have statistically significantly higher rates of justifiable homicide than non-SYG states."   Second, including race in the analysis revealed shocking patterns.  Roman writes that, when a state has a SYG law, "controlling for all other attributes, the odds a white on black homicide is found justified is 281 percent greater than the odds a white on black homicide is found justified."   And for cases that exhibit particular fact pattern, SYG laws "worsen the disparity."  Roman says that when the facts in a case show 1) a single victim; 2) a single shooter; 3) a male victim and a male shooter; 4) a victim and a shooter who are strangers to each other; and 5) the use of a gun, states with SYG laws show increased disparities between cases in which a white kills a black victim, and cases in which a black kills a white victim. </p>

<p>Thus SYG laws have increased deadly violence, and they have had a distinct racial impact.  If racial effects emerge when we examine killings taking place SYG laws, we need to ask why this occurs.  Are those who shoot under SYG laws racist bigots?  Or is there a deeper explanation?</p>

<p><strong>III.	Implicit Bias:  How It Operates and Its Impact</strong></p>

<p>For most of us, allegations that a particular person has engaged in racist behavior would cause us to look for specific types of racist conduct:  perhaps the use of racial epithets, or statements like "I'd like to hire _______ (fill in the name of a racial or ethnic group under discussion) but I can't - they just aren't responsible or smart enough."  Certainly, some people hold such attitudes; perhaps in some social contexts, they may say these things or act on these beliefs.  But the problem of racialized attitudes in American society is larger than old-school bigotry - and far more subtle.  The racism we see today rarely appears in these obvious ways.  Rather, the problem is unconscious racism:  in the words of the psychology literature, implicit bias.</p>

<p>Most Americans believe strongly in equality and fairness.  According to these beliefs, everyone deserves equal treatment, because we are all entitled to justice and fair dealing from others, and from the government.  But empirical studies have proven the existence of a different, hidden reality in our minds.  Almost everyone carries an intricate web of unconscious biases, preferring some groups and disfavoring others.  These biases may directly contradict our conscious beliefs.  And even though we do not know that these implicit biases are there, they may actually override our conscious beliefs about race.  Because of this, we may act negatively toward minorities without knowing it is occurring.</p>

<p>The best-known proof of implicit bias comes from the implicit association test, or IAT.  Anyone can take the IAT online, and millions have.   The IAT measures the speed of mental associations between racially-identifiable partial photographs of faces (the lowest part of the forehead, the eyes, the nose, and the space between the nose and mouth), and positive or negative words.  In the first parts of the test, the viewer hits a computer key to associate a white face with a positive word (e.g., good, flower, smile) or a black face with a negative word (bad, hostile, fight).  In the next part, the instructions are reversed:  the viewer hits the key when she sees a white face with a negative word, or a black face with a positive word.  As the viewer performs these tasks, the computer measures the speed with which the viewer hits the key, down to tiny fractions of seconds.  The computer then compares the reaction speed of the viewer on tasks congruent with stereotypes (associating white faces with positive words, or associating black faces with negative words) with the reaction speed for tasks not congruent with stereotypes (associating black faces with positive words, or associating white faces with negative words).  Regardless of conscious egalitarian values, most viewers react more rapidly when associating white faces with positive words than negative words; they also respond faster when associating black faces with negative words than positive ones.  The researchers called these differences implicit biases.  Implicit biases favoring whites show up in seventy-five percent of all of the 14 million persons who had taken the test through 2013,  including almost forty percent of black test takers.   In all of those who showed implicit bias for whites and against blacks, these biases may impact their thoughts and actions.  Just as important, they do not know these biases exist.</p>

<p>When implicit biases combine with heuristics, racialized thinking and action may occur.  Nobel Prize winning psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman described heuristics as rules of thumb people use to transform complex decisions in information-scarce environments into easier, nearly automatic analyses.   People use heuristics unconsciously and rapidly; they give us rapid and efficient ways of making decisions.  Heuristics often help us get things right; "frequently accurate," they move us toward good decisions without consuming a lot of "valuable cognitive resources."   But because people resort to heuristics when faced with thorny choices and a lack of time to gather information, they also "produce systemic errors of judgment that predictably recur in certain situations. . . ."   People have little or no conscious control these heuristic-based biases; indeed, they do not even know the heuristics are operating.   Our conscious minds can override heuristics, but in most situations, we use them unquestioningly - indeed, without even knowing that we are doing this.  This means heuristic-based errors are "difficult to eliminate or even recognize."   Human beings can live with some of this.  But when heuristics concern race and suspicion of criminality or violence, negative results may follow.</p>

<p>Implicit biases linking blacks with negative concepts in the minds of the great majority of people gives rise to a particular heuristic:  the association of blacks with crime and danger.  Phillip Atiba Goff and his co-author L. Song Richardson call the rule of thumb that associates blacks with crime and danger "the suspicion heuristic."   People in an uncertain situation may have difficulty predicting when they might face danger or violence, especially when encountering someone unknown.  Walking down a city street at night, toward an unknown person, allows precious little time to gather and process facts or evidence.  To deal with this, people "will make their judgments of [potential] criminality quickly, based on small slices of behavior, under highly stressful circumstances."   The suspicion heuristic begins to operate immediately and unconsciously; implicit negative associations with blacks become active.</p>

<p>This research squares with extensive evidence demonstrating how society equates blacks with violent street crime; our mental images - that is, stereotypes - feature blacks as criminals.  For example, in Brit Duncan's work, subjects saw mildly aggressive behavior by an African American person as more threatening than the identical behavior by whites.   Research by H. Andrew Sagar and Janet Ward Schofield of the University of Pittsburgh buttressed Duncan's findings.   Sagar and Schofield gave subjects drawings and verbal accounts of two-person interactions - for example, two boys bumping into each other.  The subjects rated the actor in the scenario as meaner and more threatening if the actor was African American than if the actor was white.  This perception was the same for both African American and white subjects.</p>

<p>The suspicion heuristic and our implicit bias therefore slant the judgments people make when they encounter blacks.  This happens unconsciously, without the knowledge that it is occurring, and even if people encountering blacks hold conscious egalitarian beliefs.  Whites, and even some blacks, will tend to think of black people they encounter as potential criminals who pose a danger.  Worse, the unconscious use of the suspicion heuristic can lead beyond thoughts, to actions.  According to Goff and Richardson, the suspicion heuristic can "influence behaviors as well" as perceptions, and "can result in people acting more aggressively than they might otherwise," all "without any conscious awareness that one is behaving this way." </p>

<p>The combined potential impact of implicit bias against blacks and the suspicion heuristic on the use of SYG laws is potentially catastrophic.  SYG laws lower the potential cost of engaging in deadly violence; one can use deadly force in any public place, even when avoiding violence is possible, and still use the SYG defense to argue that the jury should not convict.  Implicit bias against blacks, especially seeing blacks as likely to be violent or dangerous, increases the likelihood that people with weapons will shoot them; armed people are more likely to feel fear, and therefore to shoot.  And when the victim is black, members of juries - also infected with the same implicit bias - are more likely to sympathize with the shooter.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Roland Adjovi, Assistant Professor at <a href="http://www.arcadia.edu/">Arcadia University</a>, discusses some of the possible implications of the recent arrest and accusations levied toward Martina Johnson ...</p><strong>M</strong>artina Johnson joined the National Patriotic Front of Liberation (NPFL) of Charles G. Taylor in 1990. She was actively involved in the major military operation known as Operation Octopus, an attack on the capital Monrovia conducted in October 1992 as part of NPFL's fight against the government and the regional peacekeeping forces, ECOMOG. She is alleged to have been a commander implicated in crimes against humanity and war crimes. She is specifically alleged to have killed the relative of one of the three victims at the origin of the case against her in Belgium and to have injured one of those victims. These are only a sample of the atrocities that were committed at the checkpoint called Dry Rice Market, which she was manning with her fighters in the outskirts of Monrovia. It is alleged that those atrocities were committed against the civilian population, often on ethnic grounds. In addition, she is alleged to have taken part in the killing of the American Catholic nuns in Gardnersville on October 23, 1992. After the first civil war, she remained in Liberia and was appointed to lead the Security Department at the International Airport in Monrovia when Charles G. Taylor came to power in 1997. The defeat of Taylor led to her exile in 2002 until she was caught in Belgium a month ago.<br />
 <br />
African States often complained about the use (or abuse) of the universal jurisdiction principle for prosecution of Africans elsewhere than on the continent, especially in Europe where Hissène Habré (former dictator of Chad) but also Paul Kagamé (current President of Rwanda) were indicted or indirectly accused in criminal proceedings. That argument has recently been reinforced with the challenges of the ICC, especially in the two situations where African presidents are accused, Darfur and Kenya. The African Union then deployed an extensive political strategy leading to an amendment of the <a href="http://www.african-court.org/en/images/documents/Court/Interim%20Rules%20of%20Court/Final_Rules_of_Court_for_Publication_after_Harmonization_-_Final__English_7_sept_1_.pdf">Rules of Procedure of the Court</a> [PDF] in November 2013, but also a failed resolution before the UN Security Council. However, the strategy has been more successful on the continent with the recent adoption of a protocol granting criminal jurisdiction to the African Court of Justice and Human and Peoples' Rights including a provision (Article 46A bis) on the immunity of heads of state or government and other state officials. However, the discourse of African States often, if not always, does not address the failure of their legal system to provide remedies to the victims of the crimes. In this case, Liberia has done nothing to provide any avenue for the victims of the atrocities committed during the war, despite the <a href="http://trcofliberia.org/reports/final-report">report</a> of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and its recommendation for prosecution. Taylor's regime (1997-2003) was violating human rights and torturing dissident voices, but Taylor has been behind bars since 2006. In addition, the current regime has also failed to address the need of the victims to know the truth and, more importantly, to see at least some of the perpetrators sanctioned. That is the backdrop which makes cases like the one against Martina Johnson necessary but only outside of the continent. </p>

<p>In addition, the African States discourse often but deliberately ignores the fact that it is their own nationals who are taking the cases before the non-African courts. In this case, it was victims from Liberia led by a local organization, <a href="http://www.globaljustice-research.org/">Global Justice and Research Project</a> (GJRP), under the leadership of Hassan Bility, a Liberian journalist abused during Taylor's regime, who helped the victims to make their way to the Belgian judiciary (Martina Johnson having been living there with her husband, a Liberian with Belgian nationality). These victims were fortunate to find in GJRP and their Geneva-based partner organization <a href="http://www.civitas-maxima.org/">Civitas Maxima</a> the necessary support, both legal and financial, to navigate through the legal conundrum for effective litigation in a foreign legal system. And the strategy of the African States ought to accept that logic and address it: unless African States fix their legal system to allow genuine and effective remedies for the victims, some of them will continue seeking justice from whoever will offer them the opportunity, and that is just how the legal order functions. Even when there will be an African criminal court with jurisdiction over those crimes, if that court fails to serve the needs of a victim, that victim will still use other legal avenues including those abroad. Until the legal systems on the continent provide for better opportunities which the victims can trust, the number of cases outside will continue to grow. And there are numerous countries outside Africa offering such an opportunity. </p>

<p>Victims of the first Liberian civil war have been looking forward to their day in court. Some have made it. And we can only praise the opportunity. Martina Johnson was indicted and arrested on September 17 and a judge confirmed her detention on September 19. She challenged the detention and was granted an alternative form of detention (house arrest with electronic monitoring) for health reasons. The proceedings will continue and in due course, a date will be set for the trial. </p>

<p>As an African, I can only hope that the lawmakers and those in power on the continent understand that and make the necessary shift. It is in their own interest of survival while serving the needs of their population, who they should care about. </p>

		<title>The Ongoing Debate: Wiretaps and Background Conversations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnists Tamara Fisher and Jacquelyn Rembis, both students at <a href="http://www.lls.edu">Loyola Law School, Los Angeles</a>, discuss issues surrounding inadvertently recorded background conversations and the wide disparity of judicial opinions over their admissibility ...</j:header><strong>W</strong>iretaps</a> are an incredibly powerful tool for prosecutors. They allow law enforcement to listen to confidential conversations and use those conversations as evidence at trial. Such power is easily subject to abuse. As US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis noted in the 1928 case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5577544660194763070">Olmstead v. United States</a>, "[T]he evil incident to invasion of the privacy of the telephone is far greater than that involved in tampering with the mails. Whenever a telephone line is tapped, the privacy of the persons at both ends of the line is invaded ... " </p>

<p>Despite this legally recognized intrusion, the use of wiretaps continues to increase. According to an annual government <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/WiretapReports/wiretap-report-2013.aspx">report</a>, 3,576 wiretaps were authorized in 2013, resulting in a 5 percent increase from those reported in 2012. The number of wiretaps sanctioned by both federal and state courts continues to climb as those authorized by federal courts increased by 9 percent from the year before, totaling 1,476 of those authorized in 2013. Those approved by state courts grew by 3 percent, accounting for the remaining 2,100. Interestingly, 80 percent of authorized state orders came from just six states: California, New York, Nevada, New Jersey, Georgia and Florida. </p>

<p>The current controversy over wiretaps involves the use of background statements captured during a wiretap. For example, imagine a person who has the misfortune of speaking in the background during a wiretap. While there may be an order to tap someone's phone for conversations regarding a narcotics investigation, surveillance agents could hear the background conversation of an unknown person regaling with others as to how he cheats on his taxes. Once prosecutors identify that individual, they will want to use the background statements to prosecute him or her. Should those conversations, which are not specifically covered by the wiretap order, be admissible?</p>

<p>Federal courts are currently divided on this issue and California appellate courts have yet to confront it. A majority reject the use of such background conversations, yet a few courts will admit them so long as there is a lawful wiretap order. The decision on this issue often determines whether defendants can be tried and convicted for offenses that were never subject to a wiretap order. </p>

<p>To determine whether a conversation is admissible, courts initially look to the language of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, currently codified at <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-119">18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2510-2522</a>. Pursuant to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2518"> Section 2518(4)(c)</a>, law enforcement must submit an authorization order that specifies the form of communication to be intercepted and the particular crime to which it relates. Title III requires that law enforcement listen only to conversations that relate to the investigation, thereby minimizing interception to protect privacy rights. However, this provision does not directly answer whether inadvertently intercepted background conversations may be used as evidence.</p>

<p>Courts generally take a strict approach to Title III and do not admit the background conversations unless they are specifically authorized by the court's wiretap order. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17246686892179160576">United States v. George</a>, the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the lower court's judgment due to the use of evidence in the form of electronic surveillance outside the wiretap order. Similarly, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4875803608669209905">United States v. King</a>, the Southern District of California granted a motion to suppress background conversations because they were not covered by the 'wire communications' described in the order. According to these courts, wiretaps should be limited as much as possible to the specific order authorizing the interceptions. While background conversations might be interesting to law enforcement, they are beyond the scope of the court's order. In these jurisdictions, if law enforcement wants to intercept and use such information, they must apply to the court for an amended order.</p>

<p>Some courts are so troubled by the interception of background conversations that they will suppress conversations intercepted that would have been covered by the court's order. For example, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15348220438085817936">United States v. Scott</a> the court held that the government's interception of background conversations involved a failure to minimize adequately, thereby violating the court's Title III order. Similarly, the court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8653870495885354170">United States v. Borch</a> suppressed a monitored conversation when investigators recorded conversations that were clearly occurring when the telephone was inadvertently left off the hook. The court held that even though there was a Title III order, the conversations were more akin to a face-to-face conversation that was not covered under Title III as opposed to the recording of a phone conversation. </p>

<p>Yet, most courts will take a middle ground stance. The court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3016004867670808820">United States v. Lanza</a> decided to suppress non-pertinent conversations and admit all others so long as the officers made a good faith attempt to comply with the minimization requirement. In the alternative, the court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18434256990738972406">United States v. Couser</a> held that intercepted background conversations with a sufficient factual basis&#8212;such that a judge would have included them in the warrant&#8212;were admissible in the absence of bad faith from law enforcement.</p>

<p>For the majority of courts, minor violations of Title III do not require suppression of an entire wiretap. Instead, these courts are willing to evaluate all wiretap conversations and choose which to include in the record. This approach relaxes the requirements for law enforcement and permits a case-by-case analysis of what conversations should be admissible. While such leniency may seem at odds with privacy concerns, Justice Douglas clarified in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7806828638740492286">United States v. Chavez</a> that, "We did not go so far as to suggest that every failure to comply fully with any requirement provided in Title III would render the interception of wire or oral communications 'unlawful.'" </p>

<p>Given the vastly different approaches articulated by the courts, it is time to consider a bright-line rule for the admissibility of background conversations. Optimally, Congress would amend the statutory language of Title III to make clear whether such conversations should be admissible and to what extent. However, in the face of congressional inaction to amend the statute&#8212;which is likely given the current legislative landscape&#8212;it would be helpful for the courts to adopt a uniform approach themselves.</p>

<p>Given the enormously invasive potential of wiretaps, the burden should be on law enforcement to include a request for background conversations in the application for a wiretap order. If they do not, the conversations should be inadmissible. The ongoing taping of such conversations reflects a failure by law enforcement to properly minimize their interceptions as required by the statutory language of Title III. As such, all of the taped conversations should be excluded until there is compliance with the court's order.</p>

<p>In the end, Title III may be a necessary tool for law enforcement. But, as the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit articulated in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12416785794907476744">United States v. Hoffman</a>, its "intrusions [should be confined] as narrowly as possible so as not to trench impermissibly upon the personal lives and privacy of wiretap targets and those who, often innocently, come into contact with such suspects." In this time of growing government surveillance, at minimum law enforcement should comply with current governing statutes.</p>

Now, imagine John and Jane Doe, a couple who fell in love in high school and got happily married after years of dating. The only thing missing to complete their fairytale romance was a family. After many unsuccessful attempts, the couple soon learned that they were infertile. Seeking help from the medical profession, they learned about the use of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/art/">assisted reproductive technology</a> (ART) to enhance their chances of becoming parents. </p>

<p>Pursuing the ART method, John and Jane found a donor whose sperm or eggs they wanted to use. They were assured from the sperm or egg bank that they chose a donor that had undergone careful screening and had been tested for health problems as required by law. Based on these assurances, the couple conceived using the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/TissueSafety/ucm232876.htm">donated reproductive tissue</a> (DRT) that they procured from the bank and successfully gave birth to twins. Shortly after birth, both twins were diagnosed with a life threatening genetic disorder. This unfortunate outcome is the sad reality that arises from inadequate federal regulation of DRT in ART fertility treatments.  </p>

<p>ART treatments entail surgically removing eggs from a woman's ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory and returning them to the woman's body or implanting them in another woman's body. In the US alone, 20,000-30,000 babies a year are <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/art/ART2012/PDF/ART_2012_Clinic_Report-Full.pdf">conceived</a> (PDF) using ART. Additionally, the expanding and popular market of ART further supports the need for a more comprehensive federal regulation of DRT to protect the health of the conceived child. If institutions are not adequately regulated, the children conceived using ART will continue to be at risk of inheriting a genetic disorder. The effects also fall on the parents, as they too have to endure the emotional and financial hardships. </p>

<p>Currently, the only federal testing requirement for DRT is set out under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/21/part-1271">21 C.F.R. 1271</a>, which mandates testing DRT for communicable diseases, such as HIV, Hepatitis and Chlamydia. The regulation only requires institutions retain a summary of the medical testing records of the donor, not any personal identifying information. Although the federal regulation sets up a comprehensive regulatory framework for testing communicable diseases, it does not test for other health risks associated with the use of DRT, such as genetic diseases that can be passed on from the donor to the conceived child. </p>

<p>To alleviate this problem, a federal legislation mandating universal genetic testing of DRT is needed. Specifically, the legislation should mandate all institutions offer the option of genetic testing to all recipients of DRT and inform them of the pros and cons of testing. After, the decision then falls on the recipients to either accept or forgo the testing. Although all institutions would be required to comply with the genetic testing regulation, institutions would only be required to conduct genetic testing upon a recipient's request to do so. In the event that recipients forgo the testing, doctors partaking in the procedure would be responsible for warning recipients of the potential risks, and the recipients would then be responsible for the consequences of their decisions. Recipients who decline genetic testing would be required to sign a release form, releasing banks and institutions from any future legal claims relating to any genetic diseases. Similarly, to shield institutions from privacy claims, donors would also be required to sign a release form permitting institutions to release their test results in the event a recipient selects their DRT. </p>

<p>Since the current federal communicable disease testing legislation and a potential federal legislation mandating genetic testing both deal with the regulation of DRT, important guidelines and ideas set out in 21 C.F.R. 1271 can be used to construct the regulation for genetic testing of DRT. For example, the genetic testing regulation also would not require banks and clinics to retain personal identifying information of the donor, but instead would only require banks and clinics to retain a summary of the medical and testing records. Further, the regulation can include a standard list of which genetic diseases to test for by taking into account which genetic diseases are most prevalent or common.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a federal regulation mandating genetic testing can raise three issues: (1) how to define "genetic disease," (2) cost considerations and social and economic implications and (3) donor privacy concerns. First, the obstacle of defining "genetic disease" does not justify a decision not regulate this area because a clear and coherent definition of the term is not needed to determine that common diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis and Huntington's disease should be screened. </p>

<p>Second, although the cost of genetic testing will be shifted to DRT recipients, ART treatment is an accommodation, which enables certain people to procreate in cases where reproduction would otherwise be difficult or impossible. ART treatment is seen by many as a luxury, not a medical necessity. </p>

<p>Lastly, the possibility of this proposed regulation conflicting with the privacy interests of donors is minimal to nonexistent when donors give health care providers authorization to disclose health information that omits personal information. </p>

<p>ART may be the answer and solution to many infertile couples who cannot naturally conceive a child. However, this alternative method can cause more harm than good if it is not adequately regulated. Thus, a federal regulation establishing a genetic testing standard is needed to prevent the ongoing harmful effects of ART. Not only would this proposed regulation promote public safety, but it would also protect the interest of all those partaking in the ART treatment, the institutions, the doctors of the institutions, the donors, the recipients and, most importantly, the life of the unborn. </p>

		<title>The Crisis in Hong Kong: Can Comparative Law Help?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.smu.edu.sg/faculty/profile/56153/Shubhankar-DAM">Shubhankar Dam</a>, of the <a href="http://law.smu.edu.sg">Singapore Management University</a>, proposes a solution to the underlying issues which caused the ongoing protests in Hong Kong ... </p><strong>N</strong></font>early three weeks after they began, Hong Kong's student-led protests show little signs of abating. Parts of the central business district remain paralyzed. Skirmishes between the police and the protestors are on the rise. Peace has been breached more than once, initially with tear gas and pepper spray. Scuffles and arrests followed. Now a video of police officers allegedly beating a handcuffed activist has gone viral. As police action turns violent, the threat of "unimaginable consequences" in the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of China's Communist Party, hangs heavy. A resolution is urgently needed, before patience wears off and sanity breaks down.<br />
 <br />
The controversy has to do with the appropriate method of electing the chief executive. <a href="http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html">Article 45</a> of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini constitution, says that the Chief Executive "shall be selected by election or through consultations held locally and be appointed by the Central People's Government." Selection by universal suffrage, the provision adds, "is the ultimate aim." Thus far, executives have been indirectly elected. On August 31, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing reversed this. Henceforth, chief executives shall be directly elected, the Committee decided. However, only "pre-approved" candidates may stand for elections. Protestors want Beijing to reverse this latter decision. Party bosses though are in no mood for new concessions and have said so publicly. Activists seem unwilling to stand down. What, then, is the way out?<br />
 <br />
Enter the Indian Supreme Court and its recent decision on the right to vote. In <a href="http://www.right2info.org/cases/plomino_documents/r2i-people2019s-union-for-civil-liberties-pucl-and-another-v.-union-of-india/getfile?filename=peoples-union-of-civil-liberties-v.union-of-india.pdf">People's Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India</a> [PDF], the court concluded that under Indian law, the right to vote includes the right not to vote. This latter right is not merely about staying home on polling day. Rather, voters have a right to formally record their rejection of all candidates on the ballot paper itself. The right to vote, in other words, includes a right to vote for nobody.<br />
 <br />
"A voter may refrain from voting," the court said, "for several reasons including the reason that he does not consider any of the candidates in the field worthy of his vote." Indeed, "negative" votes are an important facet of free speech and liberty. As such, the right to reject all candidates must be "recognized and given effect to" in the same way as the right to vote for a particular candidate. The court ordered the Election Commission to modify its voting machines to include a "None of the Above Option" (NOTA) in the electronic ballot.<br />
 <br />
NOTA has many advantages, the court explained. It encourages voter participation, and thereby strengthens democracy. It fends off political frustration: Those dissatisfied with the existing crop of candidates can formally register their rejection. It also performs a signalling function. Resorting to NOTA on a large-scale is an implied warning to political parties to groom better candidates. Finally, NOTA helps maintain privacy; voters needn't publicly identify their disapproval by opting out of polling booths.<br />
 <br />
Many countries recognize NOTA. Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, France and Greece provide for it. Hong Kong should join this club. It may offer a meaningful way out of the current impasse. Introducing NOTA within the existing arrangement would imply that party mandarins in Beijing have the authority to pre-approve candidates. But Hong Kong voters retain the right to reject all or any their choices. The arrangement neatly acknowledges Hong Kong's simultaneous connection to and distinctiveness from China. Potentially, both sides gain.<br />
 <br />
Is there a legal basis for recognizing NOTA in Hong Kong? <a href="http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_3.html">Article 26</a> of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's Constitution, already acknowledges the right of permanent residents "to vote and ... to stand for election in accordance with law." Similarly, <a href="http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_3.html">Article 27</a> guarantees residents freedom of speech while privacy of communication is protected under Article 30. Properly marshalled, these rights and freedoms can easily lead to the conclusion that NOTA is a constitutional requirement; the option must be provided for on ballot papers.<br />
 <br />
What if a majority opt for it? Soon after the NOTA verdict in India, a petition sought clarification on this point. This time the court was less daring; it quickly recoiled from the powerful implications of its decision. NOTA is merely a protest, the court said; it has no constitutional or electoral significance. In other words, the person with the second highest votes, effectively a loser, shall be declared the winner. The clarification was unfortunate: it renders the negative vote democratically impotent.<br />
 <br />
Perhaps the rule should be different in Hong Kong. If NOTA polls the most number of votes in 2017, it should be taken to mean that permanent residents have rejected Beijing's choices. A re-election must be held with new nominations. This, however, is a matter of institutional design; there are no right answers. A simple majority for NOTA may compel new elections. Or the rule may be that NOTA must secure an absolute majority of all votes cast to trigger new elections.<br />
 <br />
This of course raises the spectre of a protracted election cycle. Beijing and Hong Kong may be locked in a permanent state of nominations and rejections. But the fear of this likelihood may also breed thoughtful conduct. Party bosses may nominate conscientiously; permanent residents should vote carefully. If both sides can incubate this version of NOTA, communist China may teach democratic India a lesson in the art of negative voting.<br />
 <br />
Reports indicate that the chief executive, CY Leung, has reached out to the protestors. He wants to restart talks, without compromising on the already agreed upon nomination process. Protestors should take him up on his offer; NOTA might give them a way out. This is in everybody's interest, especially those who are invested in the wellbeing of the students and their Umbrella Revolution. We mustn't forget: Umbrellas do not fend off bullets.</p>

		<title>There is No Constitutional Right to Marriage ... Of Any Kind</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu/administration/kelsey_rich">Richard Kelsey</a>, of George Mason University School of Law, discusses the Supreme Court's recent actions on same-sex marriage ...</p><strong>T</strong>he Constitution provides no citizen of any gender or orientation a Constitutional right to marriage. The Constitution is silent on the issue of marriage. It is not mentioned, and therefore it is not a power delegated to the federal government to regulate. For lawyers, judges and in particular, Supreme Court justices, the inquiry on this issue should end there&#8212;right where silence demands judicial inaction. </p>

<p>The Constitution is an elegant document that is rigid in its respect for federalism. Its framework of powers is encased in a document designed to require overwhelming support to change. So hard is it to amend the Constitution, it has only been done 27 times in our history. Since 1971, it has been amended properly only <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxvii">once</a>, and inconsequentially. Mostly, the Constitution has been amended repeatedly and improperly by the Supreme Court ... a job to which it is not tasked and for which it is ill-equipped.  </p>

<p>The Supreme Court's mandate is determining the Constitutionality of laws. It is not charged with creating new rights in the Constitution. The difference is stark. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673">Roe v. Wade</a>, it took over 65 pages for the court to create a right to abortion where the Constitution is silent on the issue. The Constitution is only six pages long. A competent jurist could read it and find no mention of abortion. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12010798883027065807">Plyler v. Doe</a>, the court found a Constitutional right for illegal aliens to receive a K-12 free public education. The right does not exist. This begs the question of whether or not the Supreme Court is competent or merely rogue. Justice Robert Jackson once famously wrote, "[w]e are not final because we are infallible, we are infallible only because we are final."    </p>

<p>In considering Constitutional questions, our Supreme Court often first considers its own opinions about the Constitution, rather than looking at the document itself. That's the problem. The document should be the primary source. The court need only apply the principles of statutory interpretation and construction in order to resolve many Constitutional claims. One principle of statutory interpretation is not to read into a law words not there. For example, the words "marriage," or "gay marriage" do not exist. Another principle of interpretation mandates that when determining the meaning of a statute, one must consider the plain meaning of the words. If the words don't exist, one need not consider any meaning, plain or otherwise. Finally, when considering the meaning of a line in any statute, one must consider the entire statute to make sure the interpretation is internally consistent. This brings us back to the elegance of our Constitution, its design and the mandate of federalism. </p>

<p>Judicially creating a right to marriage ignores the Constitution, eviscerates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">10th Amendment</a> and is an improper judicial amendment of the Constitution. It defies all principles of interpretation or construction. For the Supreme Court to create a Constitutional right to marriage, it must first ignore and render dead the 10th Amendment, that pesky little part of our Bill of Rights that states: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."</p>

<p>The people and the states have Constitutional rights. We have all the rights not delegated to the federal government. One of those countless rights is to permit us to determine whom, if anyone, ought to be given the right to marry and therefore accrue whatever benefits and burdens such license shall carry. The Supreme Court cannot create a Constitutional right to marriage without first violating the rights of the people under the 10th Amendment.  </p>

<p>There are innumerable opinions written by smart lawyers that purport to find, after 148 years in existence, that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">14th Amendment</a> suddenly sprouted a right to certain types of marriage. Some attempt to convert the 14th Amendment words "protections of the laws" to an affirmative right to equality of outcome under every law. In essence, 14th Amenders argue that the 14th Amendment gives birth to rights as peoples' morals and judgments change. These people see the Constitution not merely as a living document, but as a transformer, throwing off rights as necessary to meet needs. This view of the 14th Amendment would have one Amendment swallow the entire Constitution by empowering judicially-inspired legislation that ignores the separation of powers. To accede to this view, one would have to believe the 14th Amendment created gay marriage nearly 150 years after the great civil war of the 19th century fought over gay marriage. This judicial jujitsu is a Constitutional fraud on a country that no longer understands the importance of distributed power conceived in our federalism.  </p>

<p>Shifting attitudes are a natural change on many issues from marriage to taxes. When attitudes change, people are empowered to make laws that reflect their respective moral choices. That self-governance is the hallmark of the civil society, and it is done legislatively. Replacing political choices with judicial fiats runs afoul of the Constitution and fundamentally changes how our system of law-making works. If a law is to be wrong, it ought to be subject to a vote by the people, and not be handed down by the votes of a few people, adorned in robes, and based on wisdom outside our founding documents.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's recent tomfoolery has served to mandate gay marriage laws in some states while not in others.  Ironically, the Constitution envisioned different laws in different states. The difference is the Constitution considered that such differences in state laws would be the product of laws passed by the people. Through the Court's recent inaction, rejecting ripe appeals on gay marriage bans, it created by judicial inaction a patch-work system of rights that invalidated legislative action and substituted it for judicial activism. Ironically, the Court's inaction brought gay marriage to states that banned it, while leaving it banned in states that neither banned nor permitted it. It's a fascinating outcome, if it were not for the reality that the result is judicial politicking that re-writes our system of federalism.  </p>

<p>In 1972, in a moment of lucidity, the Supreme Court rejected a 14th Amendment-based appeal on gay marriage. The case sprang to life when a gay man attempted to obtain a marriage license in Minnesota. The Supreme Court of Minnesota <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14283825888588258352">rejected</a> all of the Constitutional arguments made by the Plaintiff. The US Supreme Court found a "want of federal jurisdiction" in rejecting the appeal. (One federal court just ruled that Baker still controls.) Many "Constitutional" scholars suggest that whatever precedential value the court's action had in <span class="casename">Baker</span>, it was eviscerated in the <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">US v. Windsor</a>. The <span class="casename">Windsor</span> case is more accurately described as the defense of states' rights case. In <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, the court found that a federal law could not trump the rights of states to determine what marriages it would recognize. In that instance, New York chose to recognize gay unions, and thus permit the benefits of heterosexual marriage. In short, the court rightfully upheld the rights of states to make marriage determinations, and it rejected federal interference. The Court noted:<br />
<blockquote>The recognition of civil marriages is central to state domestic relations law applicable to its residents and citizens. See <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3333072320986034235">Williams v. North Carolina</a>, 317 U.S. 287, 298 (1942) ("Each state as a sovereign has a rightful and legitimate concern in the marital status of persons domiciled within its borders"). The definition of marriage is the foundation of the State's broader authority to regulate the subject of domestic relations with respect to the "[p]rotection of offspring, property interests, and the enforcement of marital responsibilities." Ibid. "[T]he states, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, possessed full power over the subject of marriage and divorce . . . [and] the Constitution delegated no authority to the Government of the United States on the subject of marriage and divorce." <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6758624838835090969">Haddock v. Haddock</a>, 201 U. S. 562, 575 (1906).</blockquote></p>

<p><span class="casename">Windsor</span> serves only to re-affirm that the people have the right to define marriage as the people see fit, absent some other superseding federal right. In fact, according to <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, the Constitution prevents federal intrusion on that right of the people under the 10th Amendment unless a Constitutional right is implicated.   </p>

<p>Why did the Supreme Court duck an opportunity to resolve whether or not bans on gay marriage are Constitutional? The answer is simple; neither the Constitutional wing nor the Transformer wing of the Court knew for sure exactly how Justice Kennedy would come down on the issue. Accordingly, neither side wanted to grant the writ and do its job. In short, eight weak justices played politics with the Constitution, leaving the entirety of the breadth of the 14th Amendment, the life of the 10th Amendment, and the future of marriage rights in the hands of one man. That, the Constitution, never envisioned.  </p>

		<title>State Constitutional First Principles in Challenging the Texas Voter Photo Identification Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.stcl.edu/faculty/Rocky_Rhodes.htm">Charles W. "Rocky" Rhodes</a>, of the South Texas College of Law, analyzes valid and invalid grounds for challenging the Texas voter photo identification law under the Texas Constitution</p><strong>T</strong>he <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/supreme-court-allows-texas-voter-id-law-for-upcoming-election.php">Texas voter photo identification law</a>, which requires qualified, registered voters to present one of seven specified forms of picture identification for a vote to be counted, is under attack. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4165534821284721467">Veasey v. Perry</a>, the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas invalidated the law on several federal grounds, including that it was an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote, an unconstitutional poll tax, and a prohibited dilution of minority voting rights under the federal <a href="http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_VotingRightsAct_1965.pdf">Voting Rights Act</a> [PDF]. Although the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1900369129483295487">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stayed the implementation</a> of the district court's holding, the stay was "based primarily on the extremely fast-approaching election date," not the appellate court's preliminary assessment of the merits. On another front, Judge Lawrence Meyers of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, who is currently running for the Supreme Court of Texas, filed his own suit, <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/texas-judge-files-suit-over-states-voter-id-law.php">Meyers v. State</a>, challenging the law solely under the <a href="http://www.constitution.legis.state.tx.us/">Texas Constitution</a>. But his lawsuit&#8212;at least as currently fashioned&#8212;illustrates the dangers of state constitutional rights litigation without an appreciation of basic structural principles distinguishing state and federal constitutional claims.</p>

<p>The allegations in Meyers' lawsuit run afoul of state constitutional structural precepts at the heart of the American system of dual sovereignty and divided powers. The federal government possesses only the limited and enumerated powers detailed in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/overview">US Constitution</a>, which means that any legislation adopted by Congress without constitutional authorization is void. Yet state legislatures hold an inherent power to govern, subject only to limitations imposed by federal law and the state's constitution. As the Texas Supreme Court explained in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5136589693981369882">Government Services Insurance Underwriters v. Jones</a>, "The power and authority of a state legislature is plenary and its extent is limited only by the express or implied restrictions thereon contained in or necessarily arising from the Constitution itself."</p>

<p>So the question in challenging state legislative power under the Texas Constitution is not whether the act is authorized by the state constitution, but whether the act is barred by it. Meyers nonetheless alleges in his <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.texastribune.org/media/documents/POP1.09112014.pdf">petition</a> [PDF] that "the Voter-Identification Requirement far exceeds the Texas Legislature's power under the Texas Constitution to detect and punish election fraud." But this allegation is meaningless under the appropriate issue: whether the Texas Constitution prohibits the legislature from enacting a picture identification requirement for voting. And the state constitutional provision Meyers identifies to support his argument, <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CN/htm/CN.6.htm">article VI</a>, section 4, does not establish such a bar: "In all elections by the people, the vote shall be by ballot, and the Legislature shall provide for the numbering of tickets and make such other regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the purity of the ballot box; and the Legislature shall provide by law for the registration of all voters." This language does not preclude a voter picture identification requirement, but rather establishes a legislative duty to preserve the purity of the ballot box, detect fraud and establish a voter registration scheme. Even though the voter photo identification law appears to exceed the scope of the legislature's duty, section 4 nowhere restricts the legislature from using its plenary power to enact additional electoral regulations.</p>

<p>Meyers fares better in identifying a state constitutional limitation under article VI, section 2 of the Texas Constitution, which provides that every US citizen who is a resident of Texas and not disqualified by age, mental incompetence or felony conviction is a "qualified voter" with a "privilege of free suffrage" to vote at an election once registered to do so. While prior Texas cases have not always fulfilled the extent of this promise, this constitutional provision textually indicates that the legislature is not to interfere with the voting rights of registered qualified voters. A forceful argument can be made that, based on the plain meaning of this text, the state's photo identification law infringes upon the privilege of free suffrage of those over 500,000 registered and qualified Texas voters who do not have one of the seven types of photo identification now necessary to vote.</p>

<p>But Meyers is not the appropriate individual to bring this claim under another fundamental state constitutional law principle&#8212;limitations on state judicial power. Although state courts are not governed by the "case" or "controversy" requirement of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> of the US Constitution, state courts typically articulate their own justiciability doctrines to ascertain those disputes properly arising within the judicial power. Texas is no exception, with its courts long adhering to doctrines of self-restraint limiting the types of cases appropriate for judicial resolution to those involving mature, presently existing claims involving a real controversy between the parties that can be redressed by the judiciary. One of these restraining doctrines is standing. As explained by the Supreme Court of Texas in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2619153071208352877">Texas Association of Business v. Texas Air Control Board</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/standing">standing</a> examines whether the plaintiff is the appropriate party to bring suit under separation of powers principles and the state's "open courts" provision, which guarantees access to the courts only to those litigants suffering an injury. </p>

<p>Meyers has not satisfied the usual "<a href="http://www.gwlr.org/2014/07/01/sherman-2/">injury</a>" requirement for standing. Nowhere has he alleged that the state's photo identification law will prevent him from voting (presumably because he has one or more of the forms of photo identification required by the law). While he hints at the possibility of an act of "civil disobedience" in refusing to show his identification, this speculative conjecture is not enough to establish an actual or imminent harm. His other claimed injury&#8212;that the law creates a presumption that he is a felon guilty of election fraud if he does not present the required identification&#8212;is difficult to square with the terms of the photo identification law, which would allow him to cast a provisional ballot that will be counted if he presents one of the accepted forms of identification within six days to the voter registrar.</p>

<p>Meyers next contends that Texas law does not require him to prove injury, only standing. While he is correct that Texas, like most states, recognizes limited exceptions when a particularized injury is not required, these exceptions require pleading and proof&#8212;and Meyers has failed on both counts. He cannot claim standing as a taxpayer, for instance, because he has failed to even allege that the state is illegally expending funds as a result of the photo identification law. Nor has he alleged that any statute authorizes his standing irrespective of whether he has been injured. In short, he has ignored the limits on the state's judicial power and brought a claim that is a non-justiciable generalized grievance.</p>

<p>While his suit likely will be dismissed, this does not mean that the Texas voter photo identification law comports with the Texas Constitution. In a suit by an appropriate party, against the appropriate officials charged with implementing the law, meritorious state constitutional arguments are available, going beyond the federal claims ruled upon by the federal district court. Hundreds of thousands of registered Texas voters satisfying all the state constitutional qualifications to vote are being <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/rights-groups-join-challenge-to-texas-voter-id-law.php">denied their suffrage rights</a> because they do not have one of the seven forms of picture identification the law requires. Despite common misconceptions, these forms of identification are not necessary to conduct daily life: <a href="http://www.helpwithmybank.gov/get-answers/bank-accounts/identification/faq-bank-accounts-identification-02.html">photo identification is not required, for instance, to conduct banking business</a> under federal regulations, or always to <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/acceptable-ids">travel by airplane under TSA regulations</a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, registered, constitutionally qualified voters without the required forms of identification must now pay to obtain (unless already in possession of an official birth certificate) the needed records for the issuance of a photo identification in order to exercise the most basic of democratic rights. There is no pressing need for this restriction on the right to vote: the type of fraud sought to be prevented by voter photo identification, voter impersonation fraud, is exceedingly rare, with only two known cases (out of more than 20 million votes cast) in Texas in the decade before this law was enacted. The photo identification law thus appears to contravene both the explicit text and the spirit of the Texas Constitution, which protects the suffrage rights of constitutionally qualified, registered voters, irrespective of their ability to pay. But any such challenge under the Texas Constitution can only be made through an appropriate lawsuit, comporting with state constitutional first principles regarding state legislative and judicial power. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Kateryna Dronova, of <a href="http://voxukraine.org/en/">VoxUkraine</a>, discusses the Ukranian regulations governing IDP protection...</p><strong>O</strong>n October 20, 2014 the Ukrainian Parliament passed the Law on the Rights and Freedoms of <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/544a4e179.html">Internally Displaced People</a> (hereinafter the Law on IDP). This piece of legislation generally makes a good impression on the public and reflects the willingness of Ukrainian authorities to provide a proper, active response to the widespread <a href="http://www.cedos.org.ua/uk/migration/ukraine-faces-challenges-protecting-internally-displaced-persons">critique</a>. For instance, the <a href="http://unhcr.org.ua/en/2011-08-26-06-58-56/news-archive/1231-internally-displaced-people">Law on IDP</a> addresses three major requests previously expressed by Human Rights Watch: it establishes a Unified IDP State Registry, endorses simplified procedures for obtaining new residency registration and (in cooperation with UN bodies and reputable NGOs) takes steps aimed at raising awareness of government agencies' work on IDP problems. This law also introduces a set of protections for educational, property, and labor rights and regulates the provision of humanitarian help by broadening and upgrading the set of measures previously introduced by the Law On <a href="http://mfa.gov.ua/en/news-feeds/foreign-offices-news/23095-law-of-ukraine-no-1207-vii-of-15-april-2014-on-securing-the-rights-and-freedoms-of-citizens-and-the-legal-regimeon-the-temporarily-occupied-territory-of-ukraine-with-changes-set-forth-by-the-law-no-1237-vii-of-6-may-2014">Ensuring Rights</a> and Freedoms of Citizens and the Legal Regime in the Temporarily Occupied Territory of Ukraine (hereinafter the Law on Occupied Territories). However, there are a number of important issues either entirely ignored or only partially covered. This article aims to discuss serious omissions and grey areas in Ukrainian regulations governing IDP protection.</p>

                <p><strong>Definition and Citizenship Requirement</strong><br />
                    There is no globally accepted definition of IDP in international law and states have full discretion over outlining the notion in domestic legislation. Article 1 of the Law on IDP defines an internally displaced person as "[...] a citizen of Ukraine [...], who was forced to leave or voluntarily left the place of residence in order to avoid or as a result of the negative effects of armed conflict, temporary occupation, widespread violence, massive violations of human rights [...]." Thus, only Ukrainian citizens may benefit from protection granted under the Law on IDP. This definition narrows down the concept adopted in the <a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/3c3da07f7.html">Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement</a>, which defines IDP as "persons [...] who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence." Instead of citizenship, this definition requires an individual to demonstrate that he/she has been protractedly or permanently living in the particular state as a prerequisite to qualify for IDP status. </p>

                <p>Therefore, it covers a larger group of people affected by a conflict, including stateless persons or foreign nationals who have been permanently residing (or admitted for a prolonged period) in the conflict territory. While IDP status entitles this broader social group to the rights and guarantees relevant to their protection during displacement, return or resettlement, it does not automatically award them with rights specifically reserved to citizens (e.g. the right to vote). Hence, it is highly recommended to revise IDP's definition to include non-citizens permanently and habitually residing in the zone affected by the conflict&#8212;in the East/Crimea.</p>

                <p><strong>External and Internal Discrimination</strong> <br />
                    Unlike the Law on Occupied Territories, the Law on IDP contains a non- discrimination clause. Article 14 of the Law on IDP stipulates: "[i]nternally displaced persons shall enjoy the same rights and freedoms [...] as other persons. Discrimination on the ground that the person is internally displaced shall be prohibited in the exercise of any rights and freedoms." The narrative style of this article clearly indicates that the government is aware of the discrimination issues arising with respect to IDPs; but simultaneously, authorities are too busy to take a deeper insight into the problem and prefer to shrug off the critique by adopting a general blanket clause. It is important to note that IDPs most commonly face two types of discrimination: (1) discrimination of the IDP within the hosting community; and (2) discrimination among diverse social groups within IDP community. Article 14 attempts to address only the first type and is very unlikely to succeed.</p>

                <p>Various reputable international organizations have urged the Ukrainian government to address the problem of IDP's discrimination in hosting communities on multiple occasions. For instance, here is a July 2014 quote from HRW's <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/07/21/ukraine-letter-president-poroshenko-internally-displaced-persons">open letter </a>to President Poroshenko:<blockquote>"[i]n Vinnytysa and Lviv regions [there is] a rising level of resentment among the local population because of a fear that IDPs would take jobs and resources, especially in places that have received many displaced people."</blockquote> The growing dissatisfaction of the Western Ukrainian population with the increasing number of IDPs from the East is easily traceable through postings in social media. However, such problem is<a href="http://voxukraine.org/2014/08/01/25/"> not surprising</a>&#8212;population <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2014/03/ukraine">hosting </a>IDP do so at <a href="http://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home/news-and-views/press-briefing-notes/pbn-2014b/pbn-listing/iom-expands-its-assistance-to-di.html">significant costs</a> to themselves. In the Ukrainian context, this issue is additionally complicated by the notable cultural difference between the western and eastern populations in traditional social structures, behavioral norms, livelihoods, etc. The government is likely to worsen such adversarial attitudes by singling out the IDP category with the purpose of granting them additional benefits. So far the best <a href="https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/att3dyyq699-712_contat_hickel.pdf">advice </a> [PDF] to remedy such dissatisfaction is to address the needs of the displacement-affected communities (i.e. IDPs, hosting communities, communities receiving returning IDPs) instead of focusing solely on IDPs.</p>

                <p>The other problem of the utmost priority, emphasized by all international human rights organizations, is granting additional protection to the groups with inherent vulnerability within IDP populations&#8212;see principles 4, 7(3d), 18(3), 19(2), 20(3), 23(3,4)&#8212;of the Guiding Principles. Research <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/50f955599.pdf">reveals </a> [PDF] several categories of persons with inherent vulnerability: minors, single parents, older persons without family support, single or unaccompanied women, pregnant or lactating women, women-headed households, widows or orphans, persons with disabilities and traumatized persons and members of ethnic/religious minorities. These populations most often face sexual or economic exploitation, exclusion from political participation, hardships with claims concerning their traditional land/property and denial in assistance for needs, e.g. water consumption, medical treatment. Therefore, legislators and executives are obligated to develop and implement mechanisms for providing adequate remedies in cases of discriminatory practices and ensure the empowerment of these social groups.</p>

                <p><strong>Enforcement and State Responsibility</strong><br />
                    The Law on IDP does not introduce any specific enforcement mechanism or provisions that would hold the government responsible for a failure in implementation. The most controversial of all adopted provisions is Article 15(3), which stipulates that the responsibility to provide for an adequate compensation rests upon the state, which caused an internal displacement by the act of aggression or annexation of Ukrainian territory. There also exists a similar provision on Russia's responsibility for the violation of civil and political rights on occupied territories in Article 5(3) of the Law on Occupied Territories. These provisions raise eyebrows since there is no international judicial body that has recognized Russia's responsibility for any type of violations in the occupied Ukrainian territory. Even a hearing has yet to take place. </p>

                <p>In <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/16396.pdf">Georgia vs Russia</a> [PDF], the International Court of Justice established that Georgia was precluded from recourse since it failed to enter into negotiations with Russia or to follow special procedures under the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx">Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a>. Thus, certain diplomatic actions are required even prior to the international judicial bodies' address, while decisions of these bodies&#8212;once they gain jurisdiction to hear the case&#8212;may not necessarily favor Ukraine's position. However, Ukrainian legislators were obviously opinionated to assume Russian responsibility and incorporate this assumption into national legislation. This provision is even more nonsensical when considering the fact that Ukraine's domestic legislation does not affect the Russian Federation's legal responsibility in any possible way. Rather, Ukrainian authorities should focus on their own responsibility to protect their own citizens rather than search for alternative ways to shift the blame on Russia.</p>

                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
                    The newly adopted Ukrainian legislation governing the IDP protection has a very distinctive logic to its structure, if compared to international norms. Relevant international humanitarian laws envision <a href="https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jmf3.htm">three major blocks</a> of mechanisms aimed at protecting civilians: (1) measures aimed at preventing displacement; (2) measures undertaken during a displacement; and (3) measures enhancing the return of a displaced person. In contrast, the Ukrainian approach divides the population affected by a conflict into two major groups: citizens, who moved from the occupied territories&#8212;satisfying the criteria of the Law on IDP&#8212;and those who stayed (protected by the Law on Occupied Territories). </p>

                <p>However, such logic leaves various social categories (foreigners, stateless persons, refugees) without due attention. Additionally, both laws are pointing at various problematic issues in a chaotic manner; instead of addressing the needs of a certain social group on each of the three stages of displacement, legislators attempt to adopt a single measure to be in effect for an indefinite period of time (e.g. state registration or housing) and to tie certain rights to this measure (e.g. family reunification as part of the registration policy requirement). Although the concept of IDP is relatively new and it is hard to judge the effectiveness of this particular logic, Ukrainian authorities should be more cautious when setting the boundaries for IDP protection. They should develop and implement measures aimed at intensive political engagement of the displaced population and make sure that discriminatory treatment targeting IDP is not tolerated.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Masoud Mortazavi, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a>, Class of 2015, is the author of the fifth article in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law/academic-programs/student-journals/journal-civil-rights-and-economic-development">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Mortazavi discusses the ways in which professional sports have helped shape the narrative on gay rights...</j:header><strong>O</strong>n February 9, 2014, All-American University of Missouri football player Michael Sam publicly disclosed that he was gay in an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/sports/michael-sam-college-football-star-says-he-is-gay-ahead-of-nfl-draft.html?_r=0">interview</a> with the <em>New York Times</em>. Sam's announcement sent shock waves around the sports world. Many reactions were positive: the University of Missouri publicly <a href="http://www.mutigers.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/020914aaa.html">supported</a> him and the NFL released statements in support of Sam's decision to reveal his sexual orientation. He came out to his teammates in 2013 during his senior year and was largely well received by his teammates and college staff. However, Sam has also been met with homophobic remarks and resistance to his entry into the NFL. Some critics argued that Sam, along with the discussion about LGBT rights and gay athletes in sports, should be benched. </p>

<p>In spite of the controversy, the St. Louis Rams drafted Sam on the final day of the 2014 draft. He has already begun to challenge the hyper-masculine stereotypes that have long defined sports culture. By both identifying as a gay player and being a college standout, Sam has directly challenged the perception that gay men cannot also be aggressive, strong, talented athletes. By entering the NFL, Sam has shaken the strict adherence to hyper-masculine stereotypes in sports culture in which players, coaches, team owners, fans and staff often insist that a gay man will disrupt the balance of the locker room and negatively impact team performance. However, as the first openly gay NFL draft pick, Sam faces the possibility of discrimination and the reality of criticism in a way that no other athlete has before.</p>

<p>The NFL and the other three major sports leagues (NBA, MLB and NHL) have all made some strides in furthering the acceptance of gay athletes in sports: all four major leagues enumerate "sexual orientation" as a protected class in their Collective Bargaining Agreements and many players participate in initiatives such as the pro-acceptance "You Can Play Campaign." Sports have been a vehicle for change through their unifying power and promotion of players such as Jackie Robinson, who defied the longstanding exclusion of black players from professional sports. Racial tensions once divided the sports world in a similar way to LGBT discrimination, although gay athletes face the unique hurdle of the perceived dichotomization between hyper-masculinity and homosexuality. The sports world has certainly lagged in its acceptance of gay players, but the major leagues, along with individual players such as Michael Sam and his supporters, have the power to add significant weight to the national trend towards LGBT equality.</p>

<p>The movement for LGBT equality has experienced several major victories on a national and state level. In 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">gay marriage</a>. As of 2014, sixteen states and the District of Columbia have followed suit. This general trend was supported by the June 2013 decision by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">United States v. Windsor</a> to strike down Section Three of the Defense of Marriage Act ("<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/7">DOMA</a>"), which defined marriage as between one man and one woman and thereby denied legally married gay couples from receiving federal benefits. In the eight months following this landmark ruling, fifteen different courts have relied upon <span class="casename">Windsor</span> in striking down legislation preventing the recognition of gay marriage as a constitutionally protected right. Several states, including the overwhelmingly conservative states of Utah, Kentucky and Texas, have appeals pending after anti-gay legislation was struck down in court. However, a total of thirty-two states still have statutory or constitutional bans on same-sex marriage and anti-gay legislation is still being produced by state legislatures.  </p>

<p>The major sports leagues have not sidelined themselves from the national discourse regarding the advancement of LGBT equal rights. On February 19, 2014, the Arizona House of Representatives passed Senate Bill 1062. SB 1062 sought to amend the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a>, thereby allowing business owners to refuse service to prospective LBGT patrons as long as the refusal was based upon firmly held religious beliefs. Proponents of the bill argued that the bill merely protected the religious freedom of private business owners, but its critics, including Senator Ana Tovar (D-AZ), felt that the bill would "permit discrimination under the guise of religious freedom." Arizona is home to teams from all four major sports leagues: the Cardinals (NFL), the Suns (NBA), the Coyotes (NHL) and the Diamondbacks (MLB). Arizona is also slated to host Super Bowl XLIX in 2015. Adding to mounting pressure from businesses, the public, fellow politicians and economists pushed for Governor Jan Brewer to veto the bill. The  MLB and the NFL released league statements opposing SB 1062, and the Phoenix Suns released a joint statement with the WNBA's Arizona Mercury.</p>

<p>Through its public relations Twitter account, the MLB <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/68381068/mlb-statement-on-arizona-senate-bill-1062">released a statement </a>in which it invoked the memory of Jackie Robinson and stated that the league and its thirty teams "stand united behind the principles of respect, inclusion and acceptance...We welcome individuals of different sexual orientations, races, religions, genders and national origins." The statement went on to say that the MLB "has a zero-tolerance policy for harassment or discrimination based on sexual orientation, as reflected by [the MLB CBA]. Accordingly, MLB will neither support nor tolerate any words, attitudes or actions that imperil the inclusive communities that we have strived to foster within our game." The Suns' and the Mercury's <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ball-dont-lie/phoenix-suns-and-mercury-issue-statement-against-arizona-s-pending-anti-gay-law-035643224.html">joint statement </a>echoed this sentiment, stating in part that "[both teams] are steadfastly committed to the principles of inclusivity and acceptance, and cannot support anything that is not in line with that philosophy." </p>

<p>The potential of lost revenue for Arizona from the 2015 Super Bowl makes the actions taken by the NFL possibly the most impactful. In <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/arizona-cardinals/post/_/id/4773/cards-nfl-respond-to-controversial-bill">response </a>to the bill, NFL Spokesman Greg Aiello wrote, "Our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or any other improper standard. We are following the issue in Arizona and will continue to do so should the bill be signed into law..." Following this announcement, the NFL reportedly began investigating the necessary steps to remove Super Bowl XLIX from Arizona. This was not the first time that a controversy over equal rights threatened an Arizona Super Bowl; in 1993, the game, and its revenue, were moved from Arizona to California after state voters did not approve recognition of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a holiday. On February 26, 2014, Governor Brewer <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/arizona-governor-vetoes-bill-allowing-businesses-to-refuse-service.php">vetoed </a>SB 1062.</p>

<p>The major sports leagues have acted to advance civil rights in the past and they have the capacity to affect equally powerful change in the struggle for LGBT equality. The leagues have proven that through using their political and financial weight and mobilizing their enormous fan base, they can be major players on a national level. Still, gay athletes face an uphill climb towards equality in a culture where being gay has long been equated with weakness. However, there are signs that this is beginning to change. By establishing and continuing to be a vocal presence for change on a large cultural scale, it is possible for the major sports leagues to become an increasingly progressive force for LGBT rights.</p>

		<title>Teach Your Children to Watch What They Don&amp;apos;t Say</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Shaun Hiller, St. John's University School of Law Class of 2015, is the author of the seventh article in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law/academic-programs/student-journals/journal-civil-rights-and-economic-development">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Hiller discusses the invocation of silence and the role that it could play in criminal proceedings...</j:header></p>

<p>Since you were a young child, you were probably told that you should always watch what you say, but you were probably never told to watch what you don't say. Unfortunately after a recent Supreme Court ruling, we now need to be teaching children to watch what they do not say. "But why?" you may ask. The reason is because the Supreme Court has held that a person's silence may be used as evidence of his or her guilt.</p>

<p>Silence used as evidence of guilt? You must think I am crazy. How can not admitting guilt, or not saying anything at all, be used to prove a person's guilt? The answer lies in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15276354638064615661">Salinas v. Texas</a>, where the Court held that silence during police questioning prior to an arrest and prior to being <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6386252699535531764">Mirandized</a> can be used as substantive evidence of a person's guilt. You probably still don't believe me. You are probably thinking that this would be an obvious violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a>. Unfortunately, the court held that the Fifth Amendment does not protect pre-arrest, pre-<span class="casename">Miranda</span>  silence. Here are a few excerpts from the court's decision that support why it held that pre-arrest silence is not an invocation of the Fifth Amendment. "The government is entitled to every person's testimony." Yes, the court said that the government is entitled to your testimony unless the Fifth Amendment applies. But remember, it is the government who decides when the Fifth Amendment applies and apparently it does not apply to silence. A person must expressly invoke the Fifth Amendment. Gone are the days when no ritual was required for invoking an American's constitutional rights.</p>

<p>Now to see how the court's decision could affect the average American, pretend it's 7:00 pm on a Friday and two detectives knock on your door. They tell you that there was a double homicide at an apartment in town and that they would like to ask you some questions about it. They tell you that the victim was a Mrs. Jane Smith and her sister, Jessica Smith. You agree to accompany the officers to the police station and answer some of their questions. Their questions range from whether you knew the victims to whether you were at the victims' apartment that night. For approximately an hour you answer all of their questions. That is until they ask you if the ballistics on a gun that you own would match the ballistics of the bullets found at the crime scene. When the officers ask you if your gun will match, you do not answer. You do not say a word. You sit there quietly until the interview ends and you are allowed to leave. </p>

<p>Now most people would think that in the above situation, a prosecutor could not submit to a jury that you were guilty because you did not answer the police officer's question. But that is exactly what happened in <span class="casename">Salinas</span>. Mr. Salinas was asked if his shotgun would match the shotgun shells found at the scene of a double homicide and Mr. Salinas did not answer. Since Mr. Salinas refused to answer the officer's question, the officer suspected he was the perpetrator, which is an inference the Fifth Amendment is supposed to protect against.</p>

<p>The court failed to consider the many reasons why a person might choose to remain silent. A person may remain silent because he or she does not want to provide potentially incriminating evidence (which is likely the reason why Mr. Salinas chose to remain silent, but that should not negate the protections he is afforded as an American) or because he or she does not want personal secrets to become public knowledge. To force an American to explain why he or she is remaining silent defeats the purpose of remaining silent.</p>

<p>The court should have taken a liberal approach to determine whether a person invoked the Fifth Amendment, which would include remaining silent in the face of police questioning. This is because the amendment is commonly known to protect the "right to remain silent." Therefore, a person who is refusing to answer a question posed by a police officer is implicitly invoking his or her Fifth Amendment rights. And it is reasonable for a person to assume that another person is remaining silent because he or she does not want to answer the question posed to them. Their reasons for remaining silent should be left to them, not to the government, as the court held. A person's silence should not be used to insinuate that he or she is guilty of the charges alleged.</p>

<p>One can argue that it is not difficult to say "I invoke my Fifth Amendment rights" or "the Fifth Amendment protects me from self-incrimination," but people may forget to say these words, or they may not actually know that it is the Fifth Amendment that protects them from self-incrimination. They may only know that they are protected against self-incrimination from television shows such as "Law and Order." People should not be held accountable for not knowing the exact wording of the Amendment they seek the protection of or the need to specifically invoke it. The protections of the Fifth Amendment are meant to protect people, regardless of their specific knowledge of the Constitution.</p>

<p>In all likelihood, Mr. Salinas was guilty. He fled Harris County, Texas and lived under an assumed name. But Mr. Salinas' innocence was not the issue in the case. The issue was whether a person could invoke Fifth Amendment protections by remaining silent and the court decided a person could not. The court should not have made it easier for a person to be convicted of a crime. Instead, the court should have focused on protecting Americans' rights. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Kenneth Englade, discusses military justice system in the context of the Haditha incident in 2005 ...</p><strong>N<strong>ine years ago this week a squad from Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, was returning from a routine re-supply mission on the outskirts of Haditha in western Iraq when it was attacked with an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) that killed one Marine and wounded two others. It was the beginning of a day-long killing spree that ended with twenty-four Iraqi civilians dead: nine men (including four brothers); four women; six children between the ages of three and 14; four students at a technical school being driven to classes, plus their driver&#8212;all killed either in their homes or gunned down on the roadside.</p>

                <p>Thanks to the passage of time and clever manipulation by the US Marine Corps, the incident and the legal proceedings that followed have virtually disappeared from the public's memory. Forgotten or never fully recognized is the fact that that the Haditha proceedings turned the military justice system inside out, making a mockery of any naively held concepts of consistency with the spirit of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-II/chapter-47">Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)</a>, transparency, accountability, and prosecutorial competence.</p>

                <p>Eight men from the battalion, including the commander, were charged with crimes ranging from willful dereliction of duty, multiple counts of murder and aggravated assault. The proceedings dragged on for an unprecedented six years, mostly out of public view, which was the Corps' apparent objective. During that period, charges were dismissed against six of the men. One junior officer was tried and acquitted and the staff sergeant who participated in each of the events in which civilians were killed pled to a misdemeanor. He left the Corps with a General discharge under honorable conditions. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he served no time in the brig even though ordinarily he could have been sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/iraq-to-take-legal-action-over-haditha-killings.php">three months in jail</a> under UCMJ guidelines. </p>

                <p>From beginning to end, the handling of the incident and its aftermath was a fiasco; the worst known performance by a Corps legal unit in multiple cases in the organization's history. Normally, Corps trial counsel have a 93 percent conviction rate; in the Haditha proceedings it was 12.5 percent. Worse, it likely caused serious damage to the military justice system as a whole: harm that may not be evident but lingers below the surface, like an IED, that could explode with tragic consequences. </p>

                <p>The mistakes began almost immediately. Fewer than two hours after the civilians' bodies were collected and taken to the Haditha Hospital morgue, the Corps' Iraq Command issued a deliberately false news release contending that the men, women, and children were killed either in the IED explosion or during a cross-fire between Marines and insurgents. It simply wasn't true, although the reality was not revealed for four months. By then, a high-ranking Army officer had become suspicious and ordered an independent investigation. It was only then that the embarrassed Corps began its own examination. An indication of how the proceedings would advance was the fact that charges were not preferred until thirteen months after the incident.<br />
                    <br />
                    After jumping off to a reasonably brisk start, the proceedings came to an abrupt halt early in 2008. Following the required Article 32 hearings, the cases of four men were referred to trial. The group included the battalion commander, Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani, and Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich, the squad leader originally charged with eighteen counts of murder although his charges at trial were considerably reduced. All murder accusations against him had been dismissed.</p>

                <p>The first stumbling block to Wuterich's court-martial was a fight between the government and the broadcasting giant, CBS News. Trial counsel wanted access to information that CBS was unwilling to provide, citing <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> protection. The conflict led to hearings, appeals, counter-appeals and more hearings. Finally, it was resolved in the government's favor twenty-one months after it began.  </p>

                <p>By then, another situation had arisen. Wuterich's trial judge retired before the issue was settled, creating a vacancy that the Corps apparently was unprepared to fill. Military retirements do not take place overnight; the Corps had months to get ready. Despite this, it was March 2010&#8212;a year after the original judge retired&#8212;before a new judge took the bench. </p>

                <p>But that was not the end of the obstructions. Wuterich's lawyers, who had remained mostly on the sidelines during the Corps/CBS confrontation, launched an offensive in attempts to have <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17570834151761072300&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Wuterich's charges dismissed</a>. That dispute took almost a year to resolve. As a result, Wuterich, who had been charged in December 2006, did not go to trial until January 2012. It was the longest any court-martial had been postponed in US military history.  </p>

                <p>While the clashes over when Wuterich's trial would begin continued in the appeals courts, another frenzy brewed in the court-martial of Lieutenant Colonel Chessani. Charges against him were dismissed before trial because of the appearance of Unlawful Command Influence. Still, it was more than three years before he was forced to retire. All told, his case consumed four and a half years and went twice to the Navy-Marine Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>

                <p>Even after the courts-martials ended with Wuterich's trial, repercussions continued into the future. In April 2012, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus ordered the Corps to dismiss two enlisted men who had been witnesses in various proceedings, saying they lied on the stand. What happened in these cases is a mystery: they disappeared behind the Corps secrecy barrier and their fates are unlikely ever to be known because for the Corps to do so would be a violation of their right to privacy. Presumably they were kicked out, per the Navy secretary's request.</p>

                <p>Officially, the Haditha proceedings are history, but they should not be forgotten because they created more problems than they solved. From a military justice point of view, they should be viewed as a warning that something is wrong with the system and it needs to be adjusted.</p>

                <p>At the top of any list of possible reforms should be consideration of the policy regarding interlocutory appeals. Currently, there is no limit on how many may be filed in a particular case. But consider the abuses of Haditha: almost a dozen appeals were filed in only two cases during the proceedings but they required action by both of the military appeals courts. All told, it took the courts four years to sort them out. One issue in Wuterich's case&#8212;a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking relief in a complicated situation involving alleged improper severance of an attorney-client relationship&#8212;was heard three times by each of the two appeals courts.</p>

                <p>Another issue is the overwhelming power of the Convening Authority. There currently is a move by some in Congress to limit the CA's control, but only in cases involving sexual assault. That goal needs to be expanded. The first CA in the Haditha proceedings (eventually, there were four)&#8212;Gen. James Mattis&#8212;used his dominion to ignore directives from Corps headquarters to favor a colleague during preparations for Chessani's court-martial. This led to the dismissal of charges against Chessani, although he likely would have been convicted at court-martial.</p>

                <p>It also was Mattis who decided who would be charged and with what. It was a series of disastrous decisions. Charges against one officer were dismissed without an Article 32 hearing. Charges against another were tossed out because testimony showed he could not have been responsible for committing the crime. And a third was cleared because the Corps' case was so weak the jury quickly voted to acquit.</p>

                <p>Another matter that should be examined is the Corps transparency policy. Although this does not fall within the UCMJ, the Corps' adamant refusal to share information caused significant harm to the military justice system. By taking the issues to the appeals courts rather than airing them openly in trial courts, the Corps effectively denied the public the right to information. This pattern, which appears to have been deliberately planned to eliminate potentially injurious publicity, was compounded by the veil of secrecy thrown over the proceedings. The Corps, for example, refused access to motions, declined to name trial counsel, spurned requests for background on the judges and the Investigating Officers and turned down attempts to clarify specific points of military law. Questions filed under the Freedom of Information Act were ignored, bounced from office to office, or answered incompletely.</p>

                <p>The reason the Corps can get away with this is because it operates in a netherworld without discernible policies on what information should be released to the public and the media. Although military courts are part of the federal system, they are not Article III courts so information availability rules applicable to almost all federal courts and agencies do not apply. Motions are a good example. Although they are readily accessible in clerk's offices in federal and state courts, the Corps refused to release copies. The Corps makes its own determinations about sharing details; it is a law unto itself, accountable only to the President and the Secretaries of Defense and the Navy. It has no mandated obligation to the public or the media. The result, in the Haditha instance, is that the full ramifications of the proceedings were never thrown open for debate or study.</p>

                <p>If the military continues to retain its non-transparency proclivities and persists in hiding vital information, it leaves the door ajar for Congress to take a more active role in closing the loopholes revealed in the Haditha prosecutions. That could mean abolishment of the military justice system as it currently exists in favor of a one like that adopted by the British in which military courts have been replaced by a system dominated by civilians. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/about-us/full-time-faculty/faisal-kutty">Faisal Kutty</a> of Valparaiso University School of Law discusses the offenses of non-consensual publication of obscene materials and possible implication of the laws banning such offenses ...</p><strong>"I</strong> was just so afraid. I didn't know how this would affect my career," said Jennifer Lawrence, referring to the hacked nude photos of her posted online.  The three time academy award nominated actress spoke out for the first time in October in an exclusive interview with Vanity Fair. "It is not a scandal. It is a sex crime," the 24-year old said. "It is a sexual violation. It's disgusting. The law needs to be changed, and we need to change."</p>

<p>Though not strictly "revenge porn" (what activists call non-consensual pornography), Lawrence's story brought global attention to the growing problem of intimate images being shared publicly, usually by former romantic partners or abandoned lovers without consent. In fact, the US-based <a href="http://www.endrevengeporn.org/">End Revenge Porn campaign</a> documents that one out of ten ex-partners threatens to expose risqué photos and 60 percent of them follow through with it. And more than 3,000 porn sites dedicated to exposing, naming and shaming make their work easier. According to the <a href="http://www.cybercivilrights.org/">Cyber Civil Rights Initiative</a>, launched by victims and activists, this kind of "harassment raises the risk of physical attack, offline stalking, and emotional harm."   </p>

<p>Until recently, this modern-day cyber equivalent of throwing acid in woman's face was not attractive or compelling enough for legislators to tackle. Both the East and West have failed one way of the other. Indeed, even conservative societies are not immune. The most high profile Middle Eastern "revenge porn" case is that of <a href="https://lbpress.wordpress.com/2012/02/02/nicole-ballan-the-victimized-beauty/">Nicole Ballan</a>, the 1995 Miss Lebanon runner-up, whose compromising video was leaked to the public. The beauty queen disappeared from the pubic scene for years shortly after the leak, while her then-boyfriend Marwan Keyrouz was jailed. In 2013 Moroccan police took action against a Facebook page that "wreaked havoc in the Ochre City [Marrakesh] and tarnished the reputation of dozens of young women." The photos and videos are still circulating.</p>

<p>Though technically in many Middle East nations these offenses can be prosecuted under indecency, anti-pornography, defamation, invasion of privacy and other laws, the victims still may face backlash or re-victimization, even from authorities.  In fact, this may even bar many victims from coming forward.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in many Western jurisdictions free speech laws and sexual liberalism makes it even harder to criminalize.  However, a number of high profile suicides (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Audrie_Pott">Audrie Pott</a>, <a href="http://nobullying.com/amanda-todd-story/">Amanda Todd</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Rehtaeh_Parsons">Rehtaeh Parsons</a>, <a href="http://www.bustle.com/articles/9485-revenge-porn-legislation-called-for-in-brazil-following-17-year-olds-suicide">Julia Rebecca</a>) relating to leaked photos&#8212;not always revenge porn in the strict sense&#8212;have helped ignite some reforms and some urgency. Earlier in 2014 in a bold move Israel enacted a <a href="http://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp3_l205403826_text">law</a> that imposes a five year maximum sentence for the online distribution of sexual images without consent and classifies the perpetrator as a sex offender. A German court also joined the fray when it <a href="http://www.thelocal.de/20140522/court-forces-ex-lovers-to-delete-sexy-photos">ruled</a> that erotic photos of a former partner are no longer protected under the country's copyright laws and requires a party to delete them on request. The ruling is limited to nude or erotic photos.  </p>

<p>Since 2013, 13 American states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin have enacted legislation. While another 28 introduced bills in 2014. </p>

<p>Canadians continue to struggle with <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&DocId=6731159">Bill C-13</a>, the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act, as it passed another procedural hurdle in  Parliament in October. In the latest development, UK authorities in October revealed that the new <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2014-2015/0120/15120.pdf">Criminal Justice and Courts Bill</a> [PDF] includes an amendment specifically targeting "revenge porn" pictures and videos on the Internet. Perpetrators could face two years in jail.</p>

<p>The momentum appears to have moved the issue along, but due to low grade, rushed and careless drafting, many of the laws are attracting serious opposition. For instance, as pointed out by the American Civil Liberties Union and even some anti-revenge porn activists, some of the laws may even criminalize sharing photos of the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/abu-ghraib-torture-victims-may-sue-u.s.-corporation,-appeals-court-rules">Abu Gharib torture victims</a>. The ACLU has filed <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/az_nude_picture_complaint_0.pdf">suit</a> [PDF] challenging the <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/legtext/51leg/2r/bills/hb2515p.htm&Session_ID=112">Arizona bill</a> for being overbroad. "Arizona's law clearly violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>, because it criminalizes protected speech," said <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/author/lee-rowland">Lee Rowland</a>, a staff attorney with the ACLU.  She added, "States can address malicious invasions of privacy without treading on free speech, with laws that are carefully tailored to address real harms. Arizona's is not."</p>

<p>Privacy violations as well as increased police surveillance and search powers are also potential issues. The Canadian Bill C13, for instance, appears to address the non-consensual photo sharing as almost an after-thought. Arguably, it reeks of a disingenuous and opportunistic expansion of state power. Indeed, the bulk of the bill focuses on a number of new "lawful access" powers, such as lowered warrant threshold ("reasonable suspicion" as opposed to the "reasonable grounds to believe") for police access to online data, phone records or for digital tracking.  Among other things, the bill also grants immunity to telecoms that hand over data to law enforcement.</p>

<p>Each of these are valid concerns and must be addressed. The difficulty of doing so must not result in the scrapping or watering down of these necessary laws. Legislators should pay heed to the model statute and the recommendations from various stakeholders. They must follow through by drafting laws that respect privacy, limit police powers and do not trample on free speech rights. In the US context, one of the creative ways to attack this problem without trampling on the entrenched constitutional order would be to amend Section 230 of the 1996 <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/223">Communications Decency Act</a>, which inoculates online services and platforms from liability for user-generated content no matter how malicious. There is much flexibility in amending a statute that artificially protects entities well beyond what the Constitution provides. It is certainly wise to ask why Internet services and platforms should have more protection than others.</p>

<p>In addition, the border-less Internet world with its trans-jurisdictional complexities demand that this issue be placed on the international legislative docket, as well.  Indeed, if there were no local victims, then the Dutch national charged in the harassment-induced suicide of Canadian teen, Amanda Todd, may not have been arrested.</p>

<p>Moreover, discussions about the cultural milieu are wanting. Arguably, in some cultures it may take a nude photo, while in others even a partially clothed photo may be enough to devastate a life. Legislation must take into consideration not only malicious intent, but also the unique situation of the victim&#8212;something akin to the "thin skull rule" used in civil actions (essentially the idea that you take your victim as she is and you are responsible for all her losses even if your action would not have caused such losses in other people).</p>

<p>Lawrence's visceral reaction resonated with many. Yes, everyone has a right to his or her body, but a right without a remedy is no right. Lawrence has the resources and clout to seek recourse and to compel the state to act (because the photos were stolen). What about the other silent less fortunate and more vulnerable victims?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Pardis Camarda, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2015, is the author of the sixth article in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law/academic-programs/student-journals/journal-civil-rights-and-economic-development">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Camarda discusses attractiveness discrimination within the Title VII protection against sex discrimination...</j:header><strong>I</strong>n light of the 50th anniversary of <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> many people, including scholars and activists, have focused their discussions on employment discrimination. These discussions have centered on the history behind the Act, its effects on society and its shortcomings in protecting individuals today. Furthermore, these discussions have mainly involved discrimination based on sex and race, but have recently included discrimination based on other characteristics, such as sexual orientation and transgenderism. However, one characteristic is often left out of these discussions: attractiveness discrimination and its adverse effects on women. Attractiveness discrimination is a particular type of discrimination against women on the basis of their attractive qualities. Even where appearance discrimination is discussed, the specific issue of attractiveness discrimination is often left out.</p>

<p>As a woman entering the job market, I expect to be judged by my merits and qualifications for the job, not by how attractive I appear to my employer. This expectation is rooted in the 50 years of social progress that stemmed from the enactment of Title VII. It is true that we have come a long way from women being expressly denied jobs on the sole basis of their sex or race, however we also have a long way to go. For example, women like <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-01/news/is-this-woman-too-hot-to-work-in-a-bank/">Debrahlee Lorenzana</a> and <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/sexy-new-york-woman-fired-busty-article-1.1082045">Lauren Odes</a> have been the victims of appearance discrimination in the workplace for being too attractive. Lorenzana was fired from a Citibank branch in 2009 because her body was "too distracting" to her male coworkers and supervisors. Similarly Odes was fired from a lingerie company Native Intimates in 2012 because of her distracting physical features, i.e. her large breasts. Although Lorenzana and Odes wore clothing similar to their coworkers, their supervisors found them too attractive for employment. These women, and many more in similar positions, deserve an equal opportunity to secure employment as other individuals. They have a right to be evaluated based on performance rather than appearance.  Federal and state courts should interpret Title VII's provisions against sex discrimination in employment practices to include a prohibition against attractiveness discrimination, as it negatively affects women. </p>

<p>When I began research on this issue, I was very skeptical of my own thesis. "Discrimination against attractive women?" I thought that the more attractive the woman is, the higher her chance of securing employment. However, this was my misconception, also shared by popular thought. Although it is a counterintuitive thought, <a href="http://www.business.unr.edu/faculty/stedham/beauty%20is%20beastly.pdf">studies</a> (PDF) have shown that some attractive women are more adversely affected by discriminatory employment practices based on appearance than unattractive women. <a href="http://www.ec.bgu.ac.il/monaster/admin/papers/1006_2.pdf">Some of these studies</a> (PDF) also show that it does not matter whether the position sought requires specific appearance qualities necessary to perform employee's obligations, for example a position that requires public contact versus an office job with minimal public contact. Attractive women are being discriminated against in those positions as well. Moreover, <a href="http://www.ec.bgu.ac.il/monaster/admin/papers/1006_2.pdf">studies</a> (PDF) show that not only do women tend to see attractive women as a threat, but also men feel threatened by attractive women, especially in traditionally male-dominated employment environment. </p>

<p>Title VII specifically protects against sex discrimination. So, if women are specifically being discriminated against for being attractive, why shouldn't Title VII protect them? Only a few local municipal codes currently address and prohibit appearance discrimination in employment. In addition, appearance discrimination is broader than attractiveness discrimination as it may include discrimination on the basis of physical disabilities, height, weight and apparel. The above municipal codes encompass attractiveness discrimination based on a woman's physical appearance. However, this provides only limited protection to the women living in those jurisdictions. Federal and state laws do not address such issues. </p>

<p>Some critics may question the need to protect women from attractiveness discrimination by asking whether these protections are going too far. Is Title VII soon to be interpreted broadly enough to cover any and every characteristic? To answer this question, we should examine the intent of Congress when they enacted Title VII and explore  shortcomings in its application. This is exactly what our society has done during the past 50 years. The Supreme Court has interpreted Title VII broadly in order to effectuate Congress's intent to prohibit employment practices that adversely affect women. For example, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=780752418377134939">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</a>, the Supreme Court held that an employer acting on sex stereotypes that women are not aggressive violated Title VII. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=172357958960664770">Dothard v. Rawlinson</a>, the Supreme Court interpreted Title VII as prohibiting discrimination based on height and weight as it adversely affected women. </p>

<p>In both <span class="casename">Price Waterhouse</span> and  <span class="casename">Dothard</span>, the employer actions had a negative impact on women. Reacting to these developments, the Supreme Court repeatedly held that such employment practices were in violation of Title VII. Therefore given the purpose of Title VII and the Supreme Court's subsequent decisions, attractiveness discrimination against women should be interpreted as a violation of Title VII's prohibition against discriminatory employment practices on the basis of sex. </p>

<p>However, an exception should be made to the instances where employment practices based on appearance are a business necessity, e.g. the entertainment industry with actors and models specifically. The purpose of this exception is to protect certain businesses from the inability to perform their primary function&#8212;entertaining. As it is relevant for the entertainment industry, social standards of beauty play an integral role in how actors and models are hired. Apart from this exception, women should be protected from the adverse effects of attractiveness discrimination in employment through Title VII's existing provisions against sex discrimination.</p>

		<title>Shooting Blanks: Alabama&amp;apos;s New Gun Rights Amendment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.ua.edu/directory/People/view/Fredrick_Vars">Fredrick Vars</a>, of the University of Alabama School of Law, discusses the new Alabama Gun Control Law and argues that the state's gun regulations will be largely unaffected by the new constitutional amendment...</p><strong>A</strong>labama voters, on November 4, overwhelmingly <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/washington-and-alabama-vote-on-gun-laws.php">approved</a> a state constitutional <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/244899357/Amendment-3">amendment</a> providing that: <blockquote>every citizen has a fundamental right to bear arms and that any restriction on this right would be subject to strict scrutiny; and to provide that no international treaty or law shall prohibit, limit, or otherwise interfere with a citizen's fundamental right to bear arms.</blockquote> This supplanted a <a href="http://smartgunlaws.org/state-right-to-bear-arms-in-alabama/">prior state constitutional amendment</a> stating "every citizen has the right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state." What will be the effect of the new amendment?</p>

<p>Most of the important gun laws in Alabama are federal. The state constitution has no effect on federal law. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/supremacy_clause">Supremacy Clause</a> of the US Constitution dictates that result. For the same reason, the new Alabama amendment's assertion that treaties may not henceforth limit the right to bear arms is mistaken. Treaties trump state law, even state constitutional law.</p>

<p>On the other hand the <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/codeofalabama/constitution/1901/toc.htm">Alabama Constitution</a> can certainly circumscribe the Alabama legislature's power. Notwithstanding the political leanings of the state, Alabama currently regulates guns in at least three significant ways: (1) prohibiting possession by certain types of people; (2) requiring a permit for carrying a concealed weapon; and (3) prohibiting gun possession in certain places.  Can these regulations survive in light of the new amendment?</p>

<p><strong>Prohibiting Possession by Certain Types of People<br />
</strong><br />
The primary group of people prohibited under <a href="http://www.ago.state.al.us/File-Alabama-Weapon-Laws">Alabama law</a> from possessing a pistol consists of anyone previously convicted of a crime of violence. Before the new amendment, Alabama courts rejected the argument that this provision violated the state constitutional right to bear arms.  As the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama stated in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8530391749109921188">Bristow v. State</a>, the rationale was that the right to bear arms was subject to reasonable regulation and this regulation was reasonable.</p>

<p>The new amendment replaces "reasonableness" review with "strict scrutiny." To meet strict scrutiny, a law must infringe a constitutional right "only to the extent necessary to protect a compelling state interest and must do so in a narrowly tailored way, using the least restrictive means," as the Supreme Court of Alabama discusses in  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7534581155791678252">Ex parte E.R.G.</a> Preventing gun violence is obviously a compelling government interest, so the ban on pistol possession by violent criminals is constitutional if it is narrowly tailored to advance that goal.</p>

<p>Federal case law suggests that it is. Gun possession by individuals previously convicted of "a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" is prohibited by federal statute. The US Court for the District of Utah held in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8764208832947746005">United States v. Engstrum</a> that this prohibition was narrowly tailored to the compelling government interest in keeping firearms out of the hands of individuals who pose a risk of violence. To be sure, Alabama's prohibition goes beyond domestic violence, but it finds ample support in <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rprts05p0510.pdf">statistics</a> (PDF) showing that about one third (33.1%) of violent offenders are rearrested on a violent charge within five years of release from state prison. Thus Alabama's key person-based restriction will pass strict scrutiny.</p>

<p><strong>Restrictions on Concealed Weapons<br />
</strong><br />
Carrying a concealed firearm in Alabama without a permit is illegal. Is carrying a concealed firearm part of the right to bear arms in Alabama? Before the new amendment, the answer was no, as the Supreme Court of Alabama held in <a href="http://www.constitution.org/2ll/bardwell/state_v_reid.txt">State v. Reid</a>: <blockquote>The constitution in declaring that, "Every citizen has the right to bear arms in defence of himself and the State," has neither expressly nor by implication, denied to the Legislature, the right to enact laws in regard to the manner in which arms shall be borne.</blockquote> The Alabama Supreme Court reasoned that concealed, as opposed to openly carried, firearms were not needed to defend oneself and the State.<br />
 <br />
The new amendment however protects the "right to bear arms" without any connection to self-defense or defense of the state. One might conclude that whether a manner of carrying firearms advances a defensive purpose no longer matters. A potential implication might be that concealed-carry is now protected even though open-carry has greater protective value.  But the new amendment retains the word "bear" and the courts from other jurisdictions have concluded that the right to bear arms does not include the right to conceal arms. An example thereof is the North Carolina Court of Appeals' decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2633458117257869506">Kelly v. Riley</a>.</p>

<p>That view is not unanimous, so it may be necessary to examine further Alabama's restrictions on concealed-carry. Sheriffs have discretion under the <a href="http://www.ago.state.al.us/File-Alabama-Weapon-Laws">law</a> to deny a concealed-weapon permit if they have "a reasonable suspicion that the person may use a weapon unlawfully or in such other manner that would endanger the person's self or others." Significantly more stringent restrictions on concealed weapons have generally been upheld against challenges under the federal constitution, but these cases (for example <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6595725860193302445">Kachalsky v. County of Westchester</a>) did not apply strict scrutiny. It is therefore unclear how Alabama's law would fare under strict scrutiny. The restriction serves basically the same purpose as the violent-criminal prohibition: keeping concealed firearms out of the hands of risky individuals. The issue is whether a sheriff's suspicions are narrowly tailored to that goal. In other words, can sheriffs reliably enough identify high-risk individuals?</p>

<p>Search and seizure case law provides a close analogy. The <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html">US Constitution</a> permits law enforcement officers to stop and frisk individuals&#8212;thus infringing a fundamental right to be secure in their persons&#8212;upon reasonable suspicion of dangerousness, as the US Supreme Court held in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17773604035873288886">Terry v. Ohio</a>. If sheriffs can uncover firearms after the fact upon reasonable suspicion, that should be enough to justify preventing concealment up front. The problem with this analogy is that one's rights are violated only by "unreasonable" searches and, as explained above, the new Alabama amendment expressly disavows a reasonableness standard.</p>

<p>Parade permits are another analogy. Because parades are constitutionally protected speech, a permitting regime must not delegate overly broad discretion to government officials and restrictions must be narrowly tailored according to US Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15663411359492122494">Forsyth County, Georgia v. Nationalist Movement</a>. Ordinances that give law enforcement the discretion to deny permits based on perceived danger alone are typically struck down, but denials based on a "reasonable belief" of "imminent danger" are allowed as the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held in <a href="http://openjurist.org/934/f2d/318/christian-knights-of-ku-klux-klan-invisible-empire-inc-v-stuart-t">Christian Knights of Ku Klux Klan Invisible Empire, Inc. v. Stuart</a>. This suggests that adding an "imminence" requirement to the existing Alabama concealed-carry statute could satisfy strict scrutiny.</p>

<p><strong>Restrictions on Where Firearms Can be Carried<br />
</strong><br />
A private citizen generally may not possess a firearm in certain places, including police stations, prisons, courthouses and inpatient psychiatric facilities. Such restrictions have to my knowledge never been reviewed under strict scrutiny, but it is hard to envision an Alabama court overturning them. The need for safety in these locations is surely compelling and disallowing guns would seem narrowly tailored to that end. Place-based restrictions will be unaffected by the new amendment. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that Alabama's gun regulations will be mainly unaffected by the new constitutional amendment.  The reason is simple: Alabama's current gun laws are already relatively permissive. The real effect of the amendment, if any, will be forward-looking: making it more difficult to adopt restrictive gun measures in the future. That was going to be tough in Alabama well before the adoption of this new amendment.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/walter-olson">Walter Olson</a>, of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, discusses tribal rights and Indian burials and argues that Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act has caused the effect opposite to what Congress actually intended ...</p><strong>D</strong>oes Congress really mean for the laws it passes to achieve the opposite of their stated intent, or does it just seem that way sometimes? Consider the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-32">Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act</a>, or NAGPRA, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 following a relatively uncontroversial passage through Congress. On its face, NAGPRA is meant to prevent the untimely disturbance of human remains and ensure respect for their final resting place as directed by their survivors. Twenty-five years later the law has come to the point of threatening to order that otherwise undisturbed graves from long ago be dug up. For the moment the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has drawn the line and said no, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/23/us-jimthorpe-lawsuit-idUSKCN0IC1WD20141023">turning down</a> a suit under the law seeking to order a Pennsylvania town to yield up the remains of Native American sports great Jim Thorpe for reburial under tribal auspices in Oklahoma.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.cmgww.com/sports/thorpe/">Jim Thorpe</a> was one of America's greatest athletes, some would say the very greatest. After his death in 1953, following the wishes of his widow, his remains were laid to rest in the newly renamed town of Jim Thorpe (formerly Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk). More than a half century later, and twenty years after NAGPRA's passage, two of his sons from an earlier marriage filed suit demanding that Thorpe be reburied in Oklahoma on ancestral lands of his Sac and Fox tribe. Other Thorpe relatives, meanwhile, disagreed and wanted him left in the town where he had been laid to rest in accord with Patsy Thorpe's arrangements.</p>

                <p>Few if any lawmakers had foreseen such a fact pattern in the original debate over NAGPRA, which built on outrage at the desecration of Indian burial sites by looters and sensation-seekers. Along with providing for review of federally funded disturbance of burial grounds, the law aimed at requiring cultural institutions that receive federal funds to return holdings of human remains and related objects to persons who can show they are descendants of the deceased.</p>

                <p>Almost from the moment the law was enacted, it began to see tactical use as a way for opponents to block land development. In a recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/science/seeking-stars-finding-creationism.html?_r=2">piece in the New York Times</a>, George Johnson cited ways in which the law has frustrated legitimate scientific endeavor, including the emplacement of astronomical observatories on reputedly sacred mountains.</p>

                <p>The provisions pertaining to human remains have also blocked scientific advance. The most notable example is the <a href="http://overlawyered.com/?s=%22kennewick+man%22">Kennewick Man</a> episode, recounted recently in a riveting <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/kennewick-man-finally-freed-share-his-secrets-180952462/?no-ist=&no-cache=&page=1">article by Douglas Preston in Smithsonian</a>. There, aggressive interpretation of the law by the federal government closed down an important archaeological dig even though the prehistoric remains that had been discovered had no evident link to any current tribe.</p>

                <p>To return to the Thorpe suit, perhaps the most curious hurdle it faced was showing that the borough of Jim Thorpe counts as a "museum" subject to the law. If that sounds wacky, blame Congress, because it is a completely straightforward reading of the statute. Drafters in their wisdom chose to define a "museum" for NAGPRA purposes as "any institution or State or local government agency (including any institution of higher learning) that receives Federal funds and has possession of, or control over, Native American cultural items." Since the town is a government agency and does receive federal funds, it would seem to count as a museum under the law. At least so the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania <a href="http://www.cwlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Jim-Thorpe-Documents.pdf">found</a> [PDF].</p>

                <p>The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, however, <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/132446p.pdf">reversed</a> [PDF]. While agreeing that this was the law's literal reading, it took issue with the "clearly absurd result" of letting the law provide "a sword to settle familial disputes within Native American families." There is already talk of a possible appeal, which&#8212;like the pending <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-114.htm">King v. Burwell</a> challenge to <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-subsidies-for-health-care-exchanges.php">ObamaCare</a>&#8212;may turn on how readily courts can lay aside plain statutory language as "absurd" as opposed to merely unwelcome to some litigants. And the fact is that to some on the plaintiffs' side, there is nothing unwelcome, let alone absurd, about the prospective outcome. The case has become a <em>cause célèbre</em> in Indian Country, where it has been described as the first of more actions to come intended to "repatriate" persons of Indian blood who died in modern times.</p>

                <p>Even should the tribal advocates prevail on the museum definition question, they will still need to overcome another NAGPRA provision that provide immunity to institutions acquiring Indian remains with "full knowledge and consent of the next of kin." Presumably that will require challenging whether Patsy Thorpe&#8212;who, as supporters of the lawsuit point out with some frequency, was of non-Indian descent&#8212;had appropriate legal authority to make decisions at the time.</p>

                <p>In a nation where people regularly fall in love across ethnic lines, laws that assign rights differentially to some members of families based on descent or tribal affiliation are especially hard to justify under US Constitution's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a>. We have already seen how by entitling tribes to a role in family law proceedings, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-21">the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978</a> undermines the rights of non-Indians, such as the <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/constitutional-flaws-indian-child-welfare-act">birth mother</a> in last year's <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rrights-expert-concerned-over-american-indian-adoption-case.php">Baby Veronica case</a>. Say what you will about the Third Circuit's reasoning, it at least postpones the day when tribal enmities extend into our very cemeteries, and even the dead cannot escape counting based on race.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Dmytro Galagan, of <a href="http://voxukraine.blogspot.com/">VoxUkraine</a>, discusses the ongoing natural gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia ...</p><strong>O</strong>n November 16, 2014, NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine (Naftogaz) and OJSC Gazprom (Gazprom) informed that they had filed lawsuits against each other at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (SCC). Whereas Naftogaz seeks to revise the gas price and recover USD 6 billion of overpayment for the gas supplied since 2010, Gazprom demands USD 4.5 billion in what Russian company claims to be outstanding debt for the natural gas provided to Ukraine in November-December 2013 and April-June 2014.</p>

                <p>The dispute arose in April 2014 when, after occupation of the <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/crimean-lawmakers-approve-new-pro-russian-constitution.php">Crimean Peninsula</a>, the Russian Federation abolished zero customs duty for the gas export to Ukraine. Gazprom thus set the gas price at USD 485 per 1,000 m3 and demanded USD 2.2 billion from Naftogaz for the gas already supplied. In turn, Ukraine confirmed its willingness to pay for the Russian gas provided that the price remains at the level of 1Q 2014, USD 268.5 per 1,000 m3 and transferred USD 786.3 million for the gas imports in February and March 2014. Further negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian energy monopolists proved to be futile. In June 2014 <a href="http://www.gazprom.com/f/posts/14/521939/verbatim-report-miller-novak-2014-06-16-en.pdf">Gazprom switched </a>Naftogaz to prepayment for future gas supplies and called for repayment of USD 4.458 billion in outstanding debts&#8212;USD 1.451 billion for November-December 2013 and USD 3.007 billion for April-May 2014.</p>

                <p>The basis for the controversy is the natural gas sale-purchase <a href="http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/ru/publish/article?art_id=247720650&cat_id=244843950">contract</a> [in Ukrainian] for the period of 2009-2019 No KP of January 19, 2014 ("Contract"), the text of which was leaked to Ukrainian press. The Contract may be characterized by the following features: it links the price for gas to the oil prices (article 4.1) and contains so-called "take-or-pay" (article 2.2.5) and "price review" (article 4.4) clauses. The contractual price is set every quarter year on the basis of the gas oil and low sulfur fuel oil prices published in <a href="http://www.platts.com/products/oilgram-price-report">Platt's Oilgram Price Report</a>. The take-or-pay provision requires Naftogaz to pay for at least 41.6 bcm (80 percent of the 52 bcm "yearly contractual volume" set forth in article 2.2) of natural gas whether or not it actually consumes that amount of gas. Finally, the "price reopener" clause allows either party to request revision of the contractual price if this party believes that the situation on the energy market changed to the extent that the contractual price no longer reflects market prices for natural gas.</p>

                <p>Oil-indexed formulas are common in long-term gas supply agreements for historical reasons: natural gas lacked liquid spot and forward markets; gas was primarily extracted along with crude oil which had more reliable market indicators, and thus it was reasonable to link the gas price to oil to make it competitive with an alternative fuel. However, the situation has substantially changed over the past twenty years: development of <a href="http://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/oil-gas/liquefied-natural-gas">liquefied natural gas</a> ("LNG") infrastructure, shale gas boom and emergence of gas trading hubs, including <a href="http://www.platts.com/price-assessments/natural-gas/uk-nbp">National Balancing Point</a> (UK), <a href="http://www.gasterra.nl/en/products-and-services/todays-market/hub-trading">Title Transfer Facility </a>(the Netherlands), <a href="http://www.iceendex.com/trading-clearing/derivatives-markets/gaspool-gas-futures/">Gaspool</a> and<a href="http://www.net-connect-germany.de/cps/rde/xchg/ncg/hs.xsl/index.htm?rdeLocaleAttr=en&rdeCOQ=SID-19B61047-AC5020FE"> NCG</a> (Germany), blurred the link between oil and gas trade and brought liquidity to the natural gas market. As a result, gas prices in long-term supply agreements that are linked to the prices for oil may significantly diverge from the spot market gas prices, therefore prompting purchasers to abolish oil-indexed formulas.</p>

                <p>The present Naftogaz-Gazprom arbitration is not the first to address pricing in long-term gas supply agreements in Europe, but rather a continuation of the trend started several years ago due to the above developments in natural gas extraction and trade, as well as to the European Union's gas market liberalization efforts, in particular through the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/legislation/third_legislative_package_en.htm">Third Energy Package</a>. To mention just a few examples, in 2012 Italian energy group Edison won in arbitration a EUR 450 million discount on its LNG purchases from Qatar's Rasgas and a comparable sum from Algeria's Sonatrach. Similarly, in 2013 the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC") arbitration adjusted price formula of a long-term contract between Gazprom and RWE, Germany's second-largest utilities company and awarded RWE compensation for the overpayments made since May 2010. In all these cases arbitral tribunals removed the link of the contractual gas price to the price for oil.</p>

                <p>Faced with uncertainty of price review outcome, energy market players may prefer to settle their dispute rather than arbitrate them. For instance, when in 2012 E.ON, a German-based utility company, and Gazprom reached an agreement to retroactively adapt pricing conditions for the period since 4Q 2010 and thus end the ongoing arbitration proceedings, E.ON expected the settlement to have a positive effect of about EUR 1 billion on its half-year results. Similarly, in February 2014 Eni, an Italian multinational oil and gas company, signed a settlement agreement with Norway's Statoil to adjust the terms of the long-term gas supply contract to the changed market conditions and bring to an end arbitration proceedings previously initiated by Eni.</p>

                <p>Ukraine and Russia have also been engaged in negotiations for several months to reach a mutually acceptable solution and ensure the flow of Russian gas to Ukraine in winter. Finally, on October 30, 2014, representatives of Ukraine (Energy Minister Yuri Prodan), the Russian Federation (Energy Minister Alexander Novak) and the European Commission (Vice-President Gunther H. Oettinger) <a href="http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=247650141&cat_id=244314975">signed</a> a trilateral binding protocol and an addendum to the Naftogaz-Gazprom Contract setting out the following framework:</p>

                <p>Gas debts: Ukraine will pay to Gazprom USD 3.1 billion, calculated on the basis of a preliminary price of USD 268.5 per 1,000 m3, in two tranches: USD 1.45 billion to be transferred immediately and USD 1.65 billion by the end of 2014. Naftogaz reportedly executed the first tranche on November 4, 2014.</p>

                <p>Future supplies: Gazprom will deliver gas following advanced monthly payments by Naftogaz based on the price below USD 385 per 1,000 m3, calculated according to a formula in the present Contract and a discount in export duties by the Russian Federation. Ukraine is free from the take-or-pay clause in the Contract and may order as much gas as it needs. Until the end of 2014 Naftgaz foresees to purchase 4 bcm of natural gas for USD 1.5 billion.</p>

                <p>However, this solution is only an interim one: it covers the period until the end of March 2015, whereas the final price for gas and thus the sum of debt to be paid to Gazprom remains to be determined by the SCC arbitration.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, taking into account development of the natural gas market, success of gas review arbitrations initiated by European purchasers, and presence of the price re-opener clause in the Naftogaz-Gazprom Contract, Ukrainian party seems to have good chances to obtain a positive decision in arbitration&#8212;adjustment of the oil-indexed price for the natural gas and rebate for the past excessive payments. Nevertheless, given that arbitration may be a lengthy process (not less than 1.5 years) and past results in other cases do not guarantee future success before the arbitral tribunal, Naftogaz and Gazprom may well try to have another round of negotiations, possibly with involvement of the European Union, to reach a more sustainable solution. And, due to confidential nature of international arbitration and traditional lack of transparency in gas relations between Russia and Ukraine, we will be able to see how the dispute unfolds only through the prism of the companies' press releases and statements made by Ukrainian and Russian politicians.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Nathaniel R. Helms, author of <em>No Time for Truth: The Marines, Justice, and the Haditha Incident</em>, discusses the Haditha Incident and the military justice system ...</p><strong>K</strong>enneth Englade recently offered <a href="/hotline/2014/11/kenneth-englade-haditha-redux.php">his interpretation</a> of the so-called <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haditha">Haditha Massacre</a>, an unfortunate label applied to a far more reprehensible event that ultimately left eight US Marines standing before the bar of military justice. His final product is as underwhelming as it is skewed.</p>

                <p>As reported, the incident at Haditha began with an Iraqi insurgent ambush against a squad of 12 US Marines in Haditha, Iraq. The ancient Sunni Muslim city lies in the restive al Anbar Province in western Iraq. The ambush on November 19, 2005 erupted a few months shy of the third anniversary of the American invasion there. The ambush triggered a day-long battle that ultimately left one Marine dead, 11 gravely wounded, as well as three dozen Iraqi combatants and defenseless civilians dead, including several children who were wounded and orphaned. All were killed or injured by well-aimed Marine Corps rockets, bombs and infantrymen armed with the deadliest personal weapons money can buy. The US spent billions of dollars training and equipping these men to be relentless killers. Ultimately, America got what it paid for. </p>

                <p>Sadly, by November 19, 2005, the celebrated American-fueled "drive up to Baghdad" to seize ethereal weapons of mass destruction and destroy an odious dictatorship was long forgotten. The passive occupation had morphed into thirty-two months of burgeoning internecine violence. Death was everywhere, and Iraq was a smoking hole. Then, suddenly, crushing big-unit slap downs were out and Iraqi-friendly counter-insurgency tactics were in. When the ambush and subsequent horror were revealed, "shock and awe" had indeed been replaced by shock and "uh-oh." Unfortunately, somebody forgot to tell the Marines. World opinion&#8212;never supportive&#8212;turned particularly sour after a sensationalized report in a US magazine alleged the ambushed Marines had intentionally slaughtered the defenseless civilians in a rampage of retribution. The grave crimes were allegedly compounded by sympathetic officers who aided and abetted the enlisted mens' attempts to evade justice by a variety of means. </p>

                <p>Ostensibly in place to curb excessive battlefield violence were several layers of international and American laws aimed at ensuring a so-called clean war&#8212;an oxymoron if there ever were one. Arcane and unenforceable,  they in part mandated legal prohibitions aimed at diminishing deaths of noncombatants. Arguably the most definitive and least enforceable of these presumptive mandates were (and remain) the illusory "customary laws" of battlefield decency and current international laws of war, promulgated by the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/150?OpenDocument">Hague Conventions of 1889</a> and 1907, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/geneva_conventions">Geneva Conventions of 1949</a> and the Nuremberg Conventions, adopted by the UN on December 11, 1945. Collectively these prohibitions are known informally in American military legal ranks as the Laws of Land Warfare. The purpose of them is to protect the innocent victims of war regardless of which side they are on. These laws are categorized as <em>jus in bello</em> (law in war), <em>jus ad bellum</em> (law on the use of force) and <em>jus contra bellum</em> (law on the prevention of war). Current events continue to demonstrate how effective they truly are.</p>

                <p>American service members who violate any of the aforementioned mandates face potential prosecution under the provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-II/chapter-47">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a>. This code guides the promulgation of Standard Operating Procedures, Rules of Engagement  and specific orders and directives applicable to unique combat circumstances and other exigencies of military service. Violating any of those instruments can lead to criminal prosecution by a variety of military and Federal law enforcement agencies and institutions. However, UCMJ and its associated components were not created to ensure justice for alleged military defaulters; they were written to ensure the good order and discipline of the Armed Forces of the US in time of war. Justice is ideal, but ensuring discipline is the purpose.</p>

                <p>Such was the case for four officers and four enlisted Marines who were indicted almost a year to the day after the alleged excesses were committed. Many forces immediately came into play when they were charged. The UCMJ provides for both the prosecution and defense of alleged perpetrators. A senior officer, in this case three-star Lieutenant General James N. Mattis (called the "convening authority"), was appointed by the Commandant of the Marine Corps to decide what should be done. He was aided by a staff legal officer called a Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) to advise him when, how, who and why the alleged defaulters should be prosecuted. Incidentally, the Marine lawyer responsible for recommending these actions is now Major General John R. Ewers, Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Corps' senior legal authority. <br />
                    <br />
                    After consultations with his SJA Mattis, he made a reputedly unfettered decision to prosecute the accused for murder, aggravated assault, dereliction of duty, lying and cover-up. Once he decided on his course of action, Mattis directed the prosecutorial team assembled by his SJA to act upon the criminal complaints they decided upon. Meanwhile, his legal staff designated how the procedures would be implemented to include deciding which of his staff lawyers would be defense attorneys, who would fill the jury pool (called a "panel" in military parlance) and what access would be provided to the public. All of this was predicated to ensure an outcome the convening authority, and the US Marine Corps, wished to see. Most of the time, that is precisely what happens. While all of this was going on, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld set up a shadow "body" composed of high-ranking Pentagon and administration officials to oversee the Haditha investigations, leak secret documents and pontificate grandly, the most damning evidence of the political motivations and influence over the ongoing prosecutions.</p>

                <p>Englade calls the procedure initiated by Mattis "a clever manipulation [of UCMJ]" by the US Marine Corps that  "turned the military justice system inside out, making a mockery of any naively held concepts of consistency with the spirit of the UCMJ." For reasons unfathomable to this observer, Englade asserts the UCMJ "fosters transparency, accountability and prosecutorial competence." Only an uninitiated civilian could believe that. Nothing is further from the truth. In fact, the opposite is correct. The last thing any convening authority seeks is transparency, accountability and prosecutorial competence. Anonymity, invisibility and quiet, immediate implementation of predetermined sentence is the real goal. Military discipline only works well when its recipients believe the only alternative to disobedience of orders is to believe any lawful alternative will include swift, harsh and certain retribution. </p>

                <p>Nobody sane willingly obeys orders that will almost certainly get them killed. It is a reality that has survived the millennia. To combat perceived cowardice, the powers-that-be have always resorted to heinous measures to obtain cooperation. Examples abound. In World War I, the French revived the practice of decimation, a procedure Roman Legions once practiced to ensure esprit by killing every tenth man in any unit that failed its mission whether or not the condemned were guilty of anything. During World War II, the British executed 350 men by firing squad for Lack of Moral Fiber and the Soviet Union admitted shooting 150,00 men for desertion. Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin once told Prime Minister Winston Churchill "it  takes a very brave man to be a coward in the Red Army." It is law filled with contradictions and extremes.</p>

                <p>Closer to home, the US executed 160 soldiers and other members of the armed forces between 1942 and 1961. There have been no military executions since 1961, although the death penalty is still available under the UCMJ. It certainly isn't without precedence. During World War I, the US Army executed 36 soldiers by hanging between November 5, 1917 and June 20, 1919. Eleven unfortunates fell from grace in France while the remaining 25 hangings occurred in the continental US. During World War II, when more than 50,000 American service members deserted in Europe, the US Army shot one man and imprisoned thousands more, often with sentences of twenty to fifty years, to encourage fortitude. Of the total court-martialed for all offenses, 106 were executed for murder (including twenty-one involving rape), fifty-three for rape and unfortunate Eddie Slovik for desertion. Most were black. Charging, executing and imprisoning American service members capriciously is certainly not without precedence.<br />
                    <br />
                    To put a fine point on this thesis, American armed forces can and will manipulate the implementation and execution of military law to suit its needs. In the case of eight Marines charged with murdering twenty-four civilians at Haditha,  finding them guilty did not suit its needs for political reasons far outside the scope of this article. Another fine example is the case of Mr. William Laws Calley, a former Army officer found guilty of murdering twenty-two unarmed South Vietnamese civilians during the Vietnam War. After several sentencing reductions, his original sentence of life in prison was turned into an order of house arrest, but after three years, President Nixon reduced his sentence to fulfilled with a presidential pardon.</p>

                <p>After Haditha, eight men from the maligned infantry battalion, including the commander, were prosecuted. All of them faced ruination and long terms of imprisonment. Ultimately, charges were dismissed against six Marines, including the commander. One lieutenant was tried and acquitted post-haste of hindering the investigation in a mockery of military jurisprudence. Finally, the staff sergeant charged with leading the massacre was convicted of negligent dereliction of duty and discharged from the Corps without serving a day in confinement. Six calendar years earlier, Staff Sergeant Frank D. Wuterich was charged with twenty-eight counts of murder and aggravated assault, as well as lesser charges. He faced life in prison without parole. He ultimately pleaded guilty to misdemeanor dereliction of duty, equivalent to unlawfully having his hands in his pockets. It should however be noted that putting them there is a grave threat to good order and discipline that calls for a maximum penalty of three months in jail. </p>

                <p>Mr. Englade argues the "handling of the incident and its aftermath was a fiasco; the worst known performance by a Corps legal unit in multiple cases in the organization's history. Normally, Corps trial counsel have a 93 percent conviction rate; in the Haditha proceedings it was 12.5 percent. Worse, it likely caused serious damage to the military justice system as a whole." On the contrary, there were no mistakes in the entire seven year ordeal except in the case against Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani, the defendant's commanding officer and a career Marine officer with an impeccable record. He was a marked man. The Marine Corps tried everything it could to crush his career and drive him in disgrace from the Corps. In that instance, it failed miserably when his investigating officer and two appellate courts found then Col. Ewers guilty of offering bad advice to Lt. Gen. Mattis that led to the dismissal of charges against Chessani for improper command influence in the prosecution of his case. Even the motive of that remarkable gaff has been questioned and examined ever since. </p>

                <p>The Marine Corps rewards esprit and holds commanders who create grief for the institution ultimately responsible for their actions. The Marine Corps wanted his head and worked diligently to obtain it. It didn't, however, anticipate he would be represented by a powerful civilian advocacy law firm with deep pockets and crackerjack lawyers. The mistakes that led to his complete exoneration began immediately after he was charged and didn't conclude until he was allowed to retire from the Marine Corps with his rank and integrity intact. It was not an accident. When the tenants of the UCMJ was challenged by competent authority, it could not withstand the scrutiny of precedent and withered on the vine.</p>

                <p>It is easy now to look back on the painful seven years it took to bring the case to a close and point out the glaring legal errors, the evidentiary inconsistencies and lies, deceit and obfuscation practiced by all the players involved in the longest, most expensive and fruitless criminal prosecution in the history of the US. It however was not a conspiracy, or an attempt to cover-up criminal behavior; it was the validation of a unique, unfair and malleable UCMJ that has as much to do with justice as military music has to do with beautiful serenades.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.onu.edu/faculty_staff/faculty_staff_profiles/jean_marie_kamatali">Jean-Marie Kamatali</a>, of Ohio Northern University Pettit College of Law, discusses the use and misuse of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em>...</p><strong>D</strong>espite increasing domestic and international pressure on Thailand to repeal or revise the provision of its criminal code on <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/l%C3%A8se-majest%C3%A9"><em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em></a>, the military government has not only resisted this pressure but has further intensified its application. The controversial <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/thailand-student-sentenced-for-insulting-king-in-facebook-post.php"><em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em></a> provision is enshrined in Article 112 of the <a href="http://www.samuiforsale.com/law-texts/thai-criminal-procedure-code.html">Thailand Criminal Code</a>.  It provides that "Whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent, shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years."</p>

<p>At first glance the resistance of Thailand to change this provision may be understandable. After all the crime of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> is not punishable in Thailand only; almost every monarchy in the world has a provision that punishes it. Criminal codes in monarchies&#8212;including The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Jordan, Morocco and Malaysia&#8212;punish this act. Moreover, the United Kingdom and Japan started decriminalizing it only recently. Even in non-monarchy countries such as Italy, Poland and Turkey, <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> laws still exist. In 2008, a French citizen was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/07/26/yes-it-really-was-a-crime-in-france-to-insult-the-president-until-this-week-heres-why/">found guilty</a> of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> by a French tribunal for insulting President Nicolas Sarkozy. The European Court of Human Rights found in 2013, however, that the decision of this French court was in violation of the European Convention of Human Rights, pushing France to review its <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> law.</p>

<p>The bigger problem of <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/thailand-editor-sentenced-for-defaming-king.php">l&egrave;se-majest&eacute; in Thailand</a> is not, however, that this act is punishable under the country's criminal code. It is rather about the content of this provision and how it is applied. In other words, although l&egrave;se-majest&eacute; laws are in <a href="https://www.fidh.org/en/asia/thailand/16506-thailand-lese-majeste-detentions-skyrocket-under-military-rule">general a threat to human rights</a>, particularly the right to free speech; in Thailand the content of this provision and its application move this threat to a higher level.</p>

<p>Starting with its content, Thailand's provision on <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> contains a very harsh punishment; a minimum of three years and a maximum of fifteen years is a very high punishment and do not meet the principle of proportionality of sentences. In assessing the proportionality of sentences, factors such as the harm caused or threatened to the victim have to be taken into consideration. In the specific case of Thailand, the victim protected by this provision, the King, has never complained about criticisms directed to him. On the contrary in 2005 King Bhumibol Adulyadej said: "Actually, I must also be criticized. I am not afraid of the criticism ... if you say that the King cannot be criticized, it means the king is not human."  </p>

<p>Proportionality can also be assessed by comparing the sentence of one crime with other crimes of equal or higher seriousness. An analysis of the Thailand Criminal Code shows that the crime of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> is one of the crimes with the harshest punishment. This offence is punished as severely as manslaughter. Compared to offenses in similar category, however, such as defamation and the offense of insulting officials, <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> carries a much higher punishment. While <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> carries a minimum of three years and a maximum of fifteen years, defamation is punishable by imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine not exceeding twenty thousand Baht (about $600), or both. The offense of insulting officials caries an imprisonment not out of one year or a fine not out of two thousand Baht (about $61), or both. </p>

<p>There is no evidence that harsh punishment of this crime as applied in Thailand has any real deterrent effect. Harsh punishments rarely deter people from exercising their human rights. They rather lead to defiance and revolt.</p>

<p>Thailand is not the only country that prescribes severe penalties disproportionate to the seriousness of this crime. Unlike Thailand, however, the provisions on <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> in these countries have not been applied in centuries and have fallen into desuetude.  </p>

<p>The second problematic aspect of the <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> provision in Thailand is related to the matter of its application. The most disturbing application of this law results from its categorization in Thailand as a crime against national security. </p>

<p>It is not disputed that the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/pages/viewdetails.aspx?chapter=4&src=treaty&mtdsg_no=iv-4&lang=en">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> ratified by Thailand in 1996 allows its state parties to subject free speech to certain restrictions as long as they are provided by law and are necessary (a) for respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) for the protection of national security, public order, public health or morals. These limitations cannot, however, be based on assumed facts, their necessity must be proved by the government.</p>

<p>When justifying limitation that <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> imposes on free speech, most countries base the human rights limitation on the need to protect the rights and reputations of others. In contrast, Thailand uses the national security argument. Thailand argues that <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> is an offense against the security of the state because the monarchy is one of Thailand's principal national institutions. It is not clear, however, why, if the goal is to protect national institutions, it is only this institution that is protected by a <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> provision. This approach seems also to be in serious violation of the <a href="http://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/joburgprinciples.pdf">Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information</a> [PDF]. These principles provide that: "expression that constitutes ... criticism of, or insult to, the nation, the state or its symbols, the government, its agencies, or public officials" among other things "shall not constitute a threat to national security."  </p>

<p>Another problem related to the application of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> provision in Thailand is its politicization. There is a correlation between the decrease in arrest and prosecution for <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> during democratic regimes in Thailand and their increase during the military control of the country. According to <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18073343">David Streckfuss</a>, a Thailand historian scholar, before the 2006 coup there was an average of five <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> cases per year. Since then, more than 400 cases have been brought to court. This even vastly underestimates police activities. In November 2014 the police reported that in recent years the police dealt with 10,000 cases of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em>. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/21/thailand-human-rights-watch-letter-un-human-rights-council-candidacy">Human Rights Watch</a> argued that <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> arrests are used by the military regime more to prove its loyalty to the monarchy than its commitment to the rule of law. Police, public prosecution, courts and administrative authorities are often afraid of rejecting allegations of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> out of concern they might be accused of disloyalty to the monarchy. Also those charged with <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> are routinely denied bail and held in prison for many months awaiting trial. Recent reports that <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> trials are held behind closed doors in military courts even for civilian defendants are raising other human rights issues. </p>

<p>The abuse of the <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> law is no secret to the Thailand government. In 2010 Prime Minister Abhisit acknowledged its abuse and set up an Advisory Committee to advise the police and public prosecutor on the merits of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> cases. Because of military pressure this committee did not, however, last for more than a month.</p>

<p>The problem of the <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> provision in the Thailand criminal code and its application is the tip of iceberg to a more serious crisis: one of rule of law and democratic governance. The prosecution of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> has been used by the military to limit free speech, weaken de<em></em>mocratic institutions and justify their authority as the only group speaking on behalf of the King. This approach cannot, however, be sustainable. It is alienating the legitimacy of the government and the judiciary and their support among Thailand citizens and it is leading to the isolation of Thailand internationally. The latter was recently illustrated by the Human Rights Council's rejection of Thailand's application to join it.  The revision or repeal of the provision of the criminal code on <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> is therefore needed not only because it is essential for human rights but also because it is necessary for the development of rule of law and democratic governance in Thailand.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Anton Moiseienko, PhD Student at Criminal Justice Centre, <a href="http://www.law.qmul.ac.uk/">Queen Mary University of London</a>, discusses the problem of recovery of stolen state assets and describes what obstacles Ukraine may face in its pursuit of the governmental assets diverted by the Yanukovich regime ...</j:header><strong>A</strong> year passed on November 21, 2014 since mass protests erupted in Kiev, Ukraine that ultimately led to the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovich. It is widely <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11244345/Ukraine-protests-one-year-on-Of-course-we-havent-achieved-our-goals.html">thought</a> that one of the principal reasons behind the upheaval was unprecedented graft of Mr. Yanukovich and his entourage. In the aftermath of Ukraine's revolution the new government pledged to recover assets allegedly looted and stacked abroad by the ex-president and his associates.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly there is a plethora of legal and practical issues that Ukraine must face in pursuing this commitment. These are not unique to Ukraine. Any country massively exploited by its corrupt leadership is bound to confront similar impediments, as did <a href="/forum/2014/08/lauren-carasik-haiti-democracy.php">Haiti</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/gaddafi-appears-before-libya-court.php">Libya</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/philippines-prosecutors-file-government-corruption-charges.php">Philippines</a> and many others. So what are these difficulties and how have Ukraine and its foreign partners been acting so far?</p>

<p>Repatriation of criminally acquired assets is a daunting endeavor. For one thing one should first identify them. In very old times criminals would bury treasure chests in cellars and thereby conceal their shady fortunes. Today bank secrecy and company secrecy perform similar functions, insofar as beneficiaries behind corporate entities can remain unknown. In recognition of this, on November 16, 2014 the G20 has adopted <a href="https://www.g20.org/sites/default/files/g20_resources/library/g20_high-level_principles_beneficial_ownership_transparency.pdf">High-Level Principles on Beneficial Ownership</a> [PDF] as part of the organization's anti-corruption agenda.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="http://www.li.com/docs/default-source/publications/ukraine_imr_a4_web.pdf">report</a> [PDF] by Oliver Bullough of <em>The Guardian</em>, Mr. Yanukovich and his associates used a network of companies spread across various jurisdictions, e.g. Austria, Cyprus, Latvia, Switzerland and UK, to funnel their ill-gotten gains. It is <a href="http://www.dw.de/uk-drives-hunt-for-ukraines-missing-billions/a-17602436">suspected</a> that a large chunk of money ended up in UK, Middle East or Singapore. In some cases attorney-client privilege helped avoid disclosure of the shell companies' beneficial owners, which is a commonplace in <a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/Laundering%20the%20Proceeds%20of%20Corruption.pdf">laundering the proceeds of corruption</a> [PDF].</p>

<p>The amount in question is unclear so far. Ukraine's prosecution service <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/30/us-ukraine-crisis-yanukovich-idUSBREA3T0K820140430">asserts</a> that $100billion were misappropriated but there are good reasons to be skeptical of this grandiose assessment. The figures however <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304163604579531604140316262">may</a> indeed run into billions of American dollars. What is not controversial is that grand corruption flourished in Ukraine before the revolution and remains endemic now, with devastating consequences for the population's welfare.</p>

<p>Good-faith and proactive cooperation of other states is essential if Ukraine is to overcome hindrances in finding the assets of its former officials. On April 29-30, 2014 the <a href="http://star.worldbank.org/star/UFAR/ukraine-forum-asset-recovery-ufar">Ukraine Forum on Asset Recovery</a> was held in London to reaffirm the Western states' commitment to assist Ukraine and establish the necessary contacts. It was attended by the US Attorney General Eric Holder, who <a href="http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2014/5/1/holder-unveils-new-fbi-kleptocracy-squad-at-ukraine-asset-re.html#">announced</a> the creation of a specialized FBI anti-kleptocracy squad. Also present were UK Home Secretary Theresa May, Foreign Secretary William Hague joined by high-ranked Ukrainian prosecutors and representatives of numerous <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ukraine-forum-on-asset-recovery-chairs-statement">European countries and international organizations</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j2-RiA9Uw4">According to Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Justice Ruslan Riaboshapka</a> [in Ukrainian], meetings at the forum were essential to secure what he believes to be "highly efficient" cooperation. In August 2014, Ukraine <a href="https://www.baselgovernance.org/sites/collective.localhost/files/documents/press_release_2014-08-11.pdf">mandated</a> [PDF] the Basel Institute on Governance's International Centre for Asset Recovery, a Swiss NGO, to assist in recovery of Mr. Yanukovich's assets and liaise with Ukraine's foreign partners.</p>

<p>Another crucial step is to freeze assets, which is a preventive measure normally taken either at the haven state's own initiative or upon the aggrieved state's request. (Importantly, Article 54(2) of the widely ratified UN Convention against Corruption obliges state parties to ensure that assets may be frozen based upon a substantiated order issued by another state's competent authority.) In Ukraine's case, Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein were <a href="http://star.worldbank.org/star/node/709">remarkably prompt</a> at freezing assets of Mr. Yanukovich and his close associates. On March 6, 2014 the Council of the EU <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2014:066:0001:0010:EN:PDF">introduced</a> [PDF] an EU-wide freeze of their assets. The same day US President Barack Obama signed an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/06/executive-order-blocking-property-certain-persons-contributing-situation">executive order</a> that empowers the Secretary of the Treasury to designate, <em>inter alia</em>, those individuals involved in the misappropriation of state assets of Ukraine. Their assets were subject to freeze and their travel to the US subject to prohibition. In a matter of days the Secretary of the Treasury <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/17/fact-sheet-ukraine-related-sanctions">exercised</a> these powers against Yanukovich and several other Ukrainians.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/EU/XXV/EU/04/31/EU_43135/index.shtml">Several</a> Ukrainians on the sanctions list are currently contesting the EU's measures before the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ). For example, top legal aide of the toppled regime Andiy Portnov <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=154081&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=10926">claims</a> that the EU measures violated his right to defend himself, his right to an effective remedy and the right to property. He also alleges that the Council did not state sufficient reasons for blacklisting him. The susceptibility of EU sanctions to human rights challenges is apparent from the ECJ's existing case law, in particular the famous case of <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CJ0402&from=EN">Kadi</a> (for discussion of the right to property implications of sanctions, see para. 368 et seq.). While casting any predictions is hardly appropriate, one might imagine that the outcome of <span class="casename">Portnov v. Council</span> and other related cases will hinge on the quality of information provided by Ukraine or collected by the EU member states' law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>Inevitably, Ukraine's ultimate goal is to secure confiscation of misappropriated assets and their repatriation. An interesting legal question is whether confiscation must be triggered by a request issued by Ukraine, with a judgment of a Ukrainian court attached to it, or whether the haven state can determine on its own that the assets were stolen and confiscate them. Domestic laws differ on this point. For instance, the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs <a href="http://star.worldbank.org/star/sites/star/files/faq_on_frozen_of_assets_of_politically_exposed_persons.pdf">explains</a> [PDF] that Switzerland will require a judgment of Ukrainian courts that would establish the illicit provenance of assets. In contrast, UK enables civil (non-conviction based) asset forfeiture. Such forfeiture is independent of any criminal proceedings and the civil burden of proof applies. UK has <a href="http://star.worldbank.org/star/sites/star/files/obtaining_assistance_from_the_uk_in_asset_recovery_ukrainian.pdf">expressed</a> [Ukrainian, PDF] its readiness to cooperate with Ukraine should it want to resort to non-conviction based forfeiture.</p>

<p>One difficulty that Ukraine faced in terms of its own domestic law was its inability to try the absconded ex-president <em>in absentia</em>. This has been changed through an amendment of the <a href="http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1689-18">Criminal Code of Ukraine</a> passed in October 2014 [Ukrainian]. The law also expands the scope of crimes that may result in confiscation orders being issued.</p>

<p>Human rights may come into play with regard to foreign enforcement of such orders. For instance, Radha Ivory <a href="http://www.utrechtlawreview.org/index.php/ulr/article/view/247/241">suggests</a> that enforcing a confiscation order issued by a foreign state may fall foul of the European Convention on Human Rights if the relevant proceedings in that foreign state entailed a "flagrant" denial of justice. Although no case law directly supports the contention it holds much appeal. Thus, European states had better be slightly cautious in dealing with Ukrainian judgments that might be tainted by corruption or political interference.</p>

<p>Lastly, confiscated assets will have to be repatriated to Ukraine. The return of misappropriated assets is one of the pillars of the <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/">UN Convention against Corruption</a>, covered by the provisions of Chapter V of the Convention. The Convention allows the repatriating state to deduct its reasonable expenses incurred in investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings. Of course proper implementation of the Convention in domestic law is crucial. In practice the ease of achieving repatriation will greatly depend on the credibility of Ukraine and its achievements in fighting public corruption. Few countries will want to go to the trouble of returning funds that will end up being embezzled by the current officials. An example of good practice is the establishment of <a href="https://www.baselgovernance.org/sites/collective.localhost/files/documents/131024_selected_case_studies.pdf">various regimes for monitoring</a> [PDF] the use of repatriated funds.</p>

<p>That said, part of the money will probably never be recovered. For instance, at the moment it would be unrealistic to hope for Russia's cooperation and compliance with its obligations under the UN Convention against Corruption. This unfortunately is the sad reality for now.</p>

<p>To sum up, there is a host of legal and practical hindrances that Ukraine needs to overcome in its pursuit of the moneys allegedly diverted by Mr. Yanukovich and his "family." The supposed wrongdoers will vigorously resist efforts to locate, freeze, confiscate and return stolen assets and further legal battles should be expected. The best recipe for Ukraine is a competent and impartial domestic investigation of the previous regime's misdeeds, as well as broader transformations on its way to the rule of law.</p>

		<title>Ireland v. UK: Revisiting the Treatment of the &amp;apos;Hooded Men&amp;apos;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/staff-directory/leach-philip">Philip Leach</a>, of Middlesex University and the European Human Rights Advocacy Centre (EHRAC), discusses how the Irish government has urged the European Court of Human Rights to reopen the 1978 case Ireland v. UK ...</p><strong>T</strong>he Irish government announced this week that it is applying to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/amnesty-urges-ireland-to-reopen-uk-torture-case.php">re-open</a> the case it instigated in the early 1970s against the UK government concerning the treatment in detention of fourteen IRA suspects, following their arrest by the British army under internment powers. In its 1978 judgment in the interstate case of <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57506">Ireland v. UK</a>, the court found the use of five interrogation techniques (wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, sleep deprivation and deprivation of food and drink) violated the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment under <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">Article 3</a> [PDF] of the European Convention on Human Rights, but did not constitute torture. The prior decision in the case by the European Commission of Human Rights had, by contrast, found such treatment to amount to torture. The Commission found that the five techniques were designed to cause severe mental and physical stress in order to obtain information and described them as a "sophisticated method to break or even eliminate the will." For the court, however, the interrogation techniques did not cause suffering of the requisite intensity and cruelty to justify a finding of torture.</p>

<p>The request for the judgment to be reviewed follows the broadcast of an RTÉ documentary about the case that aired in June, <a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/player/prime-time/2014/0604/">The Torture Files</a>, which exposed newly-discovered archive documents from the public records office in London. On December 2, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Charlie Flanagan TD, <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/news-and-media/press-releases/press-release-archive/2014/december/hooded-men-case-northern-ireland/">announced</a> the application for the revision of the judgment:<blockquote>On the basis of the new material uncovered, it will be contended that the ill-treatment suffered by the 'Hooded Men' should be recognised as torture.</blockquote></p>

<p>According to the Irish government, the documentary alleged that the British authorities purposely misled the European Commission and court by withholding information, and claimed that the decision to use the interrogation techniques was taken at cabinet level. The Pat Finucane Centre <a href="http://www.patfinucanecentre.org/newsletter/pfcnews12.pdf">reported</a> [PDF] that these documents include medical evidence, relevant to the impact of the internees' treatment.</p>

<p>Four decades on, where might this lead? The European Court's power of revision is seldom invoked. It has very rarely been the basis of a successful challenge to a core substantive finding in a judgment, which is what the Irish government is seeking to achieve in this case. It is considered exceptional, because the procedure challenges the principle of the finality of judgments. <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Rules_Court_ENG.pdf">Rule 80</a> [PDF] of the ECHR's rules of court allows revision where a decisive new fact is discovered. The exacting conditions are threefold:<br />
<blockquote>(i)	a fact has been discovered which might have a decisive influence;<br />
(ii)	when the judgment was delivered the fact was unknown to the court; and<br />
(iii)	when the judgment was delivered the fact could not reasonably have been known to the requesting party.</blockquote> </p>

<p>The requirements on timing allow a case to be re-opened even many years after the original judgment, because the key juncture is the point at which the party became aware of the "decisive new fact." From then, there is a six month time limit to reapply to the Strasbourg Court, which the Irish government seems to have complied with in this case&#8212;if it became aware of the "new fact" when the documentary was broadcast in June.</p>

<p>The court's power of revision has most frequently been applied where applicants have died before judgment in their case was issued, and changes therefore need to be made to the named recipients of any damages awarded, or indeed to <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-112529">amend</a> the award of damages itself. In <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-101474">Nicola v. Turkey</a>, the applicant's successful Convention claim concerning the denial of access to his property was later overturned when it transpired that he had not in fact been the owner of the property. A judgment may also be revised where the court itself makes an error. For example, the case of <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-114781">Naumoski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</a> was re-opened because the court got the date of a domestic court judgment wrong. In <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-110445">Damir Sibgatullin v. Russia</a>, a finding of a violation of Article 38 of the Convention (the failure to facilitate the court's examination of a case) was overturned when the court accepted that it incorrectly found that the government failed to submit certain key witness statements. In fact it had done so, but there had been a glitch with the court's IT system. </p>

<p>The difficulties inherent in the preconditions applied to requests for revision are illustrated in <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-58175">McGinley and Egan v. UK</a>, which concerned the fairness of proceedings before the Pensions Appeal Tribunal (PAT). The applicants took part in nuclear tests conducted at Christmas Island in 1958 and they complained, unsuccessfully, about the lack of access to the contemporaneous records of the tests. When the applicants subsequently lodged correspondence relating to other comparable PAT proceedings, and sought revision of the judgment, the European Commission accepted that the conditions for submitting such a request were satisfied. The Commission found that the letters cast doubt on the government's assertion as to how the PAT disclosure process operated. Accordingly, the new facts might have had a decisive influence on the court's judgment had they been known to the court at the time. </p>

<p>When the case passed to the court, however, it rejected the request for revision on the basis that the applicants had in fact been aware of the existence of the body of correspondence in question, before the court's judgment was delivered (even though it accepted that the applicants may not have obtained the letters in question themselves until after the judgment had been delivered). They were facts which therefore "could reasonably have been known" to the applicants prior to the judgment. This precondition may well be raised in the 'Hooded Men' case, if there are questions as to when the Irish government had access to the documents featured in the RTÉ documentary, or indeed as to its prior knowledge of the existence of those documents.</p>

<p>The question as to whether newly discovered documents would have had a "decisive influence" was in issue in <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/webservices/content/docx/001-58046?TID=thkbhnilzk.">Pardo v. France</a>. Mr. Pardo originally complained of various violations of his right to a fair hearing. Specifically, he had not been granted an oral hearing before the court of appeal, even though, he claimed, the president of the court said that there would be such a hearing. The European Court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify Mr. Pardo's version of events. When he later submitted various documents obtained from the court of appeal's case file, the European Court initially found that the documents revealed that Mr. Pardo was correct, and accepted his request for revision. However, it subsequently dismissed his application, finding that the documents would not have had a decisive influence on the original judgment.</p>

<p>If the Irish government is successful in meeting the preconditions for revision in the 'Hooded Men' case, how likely is it that the original 1978 judgment will be substantively revised? In a well-known passage in <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-58287">Selmouni v. France</a>, the court explicitly recognized that the thresholds applicable to the concepts of torture, on the one hand, and inhuman and degrading treatment on the other, can be re-calibrated, because of the application of the "living instrument" principle. If the Irish government's revision request is accepted, the court's task will be to assess the treatment of the internees as against its conception of what constitutes torture in 2015 (assuming the case is decided next year) rather than standards applicable in the 1970s. Indeed, in a 2005 <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/71.html">House of Lords</a> judgment, Lord Bingham, in light of this passage, suggested that the techniques complained of in <span class="casename">Ireland v. UK</span> could well be characterized as torture.</p>

<p>Torture has been defined by the European Court as "deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering". The generally higher standards imposed by human rights norm now will mean that there is a greater likelihood of a finding of torture (although it is of course not inevitable). For example, if the new documents include pertinent medical evidence as to the long term consequences of the ill-treatment, that is one of the factors which would be relevant to its classification, as the court held in <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/fra/pages/search.aspx?i=001-59100">Egmez v. Cyprus</a>. The court reiterated more recently in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Secret_detention_ENG.PDF">secret rendition cases,</a> [PDF] aside from the infliction of physical pain, the level of victims' mental suffering, their anguish and stress, will be highly relevant to the question of the classification. In its 2010 judgment in <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-99015">Gäfgen v. Germany</a>, the court found that a threat of torture can itself amount to torture. </p>

<p>The effects of ill-treatment on victims may well depend on their particular vulnerabilities, as the court held in <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=975779&Site=COE">Menesheva v. Russia</a>. The practice of hooding the victims of extraordinary rendition was one of the factors relevant to a finding of torture in <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-115621">El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</a>, as was blindfolding in <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-58751">Dikme v. Turkey</a>. In <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-146044">Al Nashiri v. Poland</a>, the court found that the applicant had been tortured by the CIA in detention in Poland, employing various premeditated interrogation measures, including hooding and the use of stress positions. The explicit aims of such interrogation were "to psychologically 'dislocate' the detainee, maximize his feeling of vulnerability and helplessness, and reduce or eliminate his will to resist ... efforts to obtain critical intelligence." Clearly, if any of the new documents in the 'Hooded Men' case provide further evidence as to the purposive element to the ill-treatment, that may also be an important factor for the court.</p>

<p>Interstate cases still remain a real <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/InterStates_applications_ENG.pdf">rarity</a> [PDF] in Strasbourg&#8212;the most recent being an application by <a href="http://www.ejiltalk.org/ukraine-russia-and-crimea-in-the-european-court-of-human-rights/">Ukraine against Russia</a> concerning its occupation of Crimea and its military operations in eastern Ukraine. Whatever the outcome of the review application, the Irish government is to be applauded for seeking to utilize and engage in a process that reflects the collective responsibility of the Council of Europe states. As <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/ukireland-landmark-hooded-men-torture-case-should-be-re-opened-2014-11-24">Thomas Hammarberg</a> recently argued, "It should be in the interest of the UK government, as a signatory of the UN Convention against Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights, to ensure that facts be clarified in this critical case and remedial action be taken."     </p>

		<title>Why the Supreme Court&amp;apos;s Decision Not to Decide Same-Sex Marriage Made a Mess in Kansas</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/profiles/jackson-jeffrey.html">Jeffrey D. Jackson</a>, of the Washburn University School of Law, discusses the complexities of applying state and federal court orders to state marriage laws ...</p><strong>O</strong>n October 6, 2014, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/us-supreme-court-refuses-nationwide-ruling-on-same-sex-marriage.php">denied certiorari</a> [PDF] on all seven cases challenging state bans on same-sex marriage, which effectively allowed the decisions in the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth, Seventh and Tenth Circuits to stand. For the Supreme Court, this action allowed the justices to avoid confronting a contentious issue. However, for states such as Kansas, which is in one of the affected circuits but whose statute had not been challenged, the Supreme Court's avoidance set up a period of confusion and legal uncertainty that has imposed real costs. Even after several months, the dust has still not fully settled, and much still remains up in the air. The Kansas experience provides a good illustration of what can happen when the court chooses not to resolve important legal issues.</p>

<p>Although Kansas is in the Tenth Circuit, that circuit's opinion striking down the same-sex marriage bans in Utah and Oklahoma did not control as to its ban because, unlike decisions from the US Supreme Court, decisions of a federal circuit court are not binding on the constitutionality of state laws that are not at issue in the case. Thus, even though Kansas's law was almost indistinguishable from the laws that the Tenth Circuit had struck down in Utah and Oklahoma, and therefore would almost certainly meet the same result were it challenged in federal court, the fact remained that it had not been. Therefore, it remained the law of the state.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this wrinkle in court hierarchy was not well-understood. <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article2532006.html">Early news reports</a> made it seem as though the Supreme Court's denial had actually legalized same-sex marriage in every state in the Tenth Circuit. This led some couples to attempt to apply for marriage licenses immediately, only to be <a href="http://m.cjonline.com/news/2014-10-06/gay-couple-denied-marriage-license-shawnee-county-could-become-plaintiffs?v=%3Cem%3E30%20min%207%20sec%3C%2Fem%3E%20ago#gsc.tab=0">turned down</a>. </p>

<p>Matters took another turn the next day, when the chief judge of the district court in the Tenth Judicial District, which covers Kansas's most populous county, issued an <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/state/article2627409.ece/binary/Amended%20Admin%20Order%2014-11.pdf">administrative order</a> [PDF] directing judges and court clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The judge's order recognized that the order was not compelled by the Supreme Court's denial or the Tenth Circuit's decisions, but issued it "in order to provide guidance and avoid confusion." Unfortunately, the effect was the opposite of that intended, especially because there was a <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/government-politics/article2645901.html">serious question</a> regarding the judge's authority to issue such an order without a case or controversy before him. On October 10, after 51 applications were approved and one wedding occurred, the Kansas Supreme Court stepped in and issued a <a href="http://www.kscourts.org/State_v_Moriarty/112590.pdf">temporary stay</a> [PDF] of the order.</p>

<p>On that same day, two couples who had been denied marriage licenses <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/doc._1_complaint.pdf">filed suit</a> [PDF] in Kansas federal district court, naming as defendants the Secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and the Clerks of the District Courts for the Seventh and Eighteenth Judicial Districts. The complaint in <span class="casename">Marie v. Moser</span> asked that Kansas's constitutional and statutory bans on same-sex marriage be declared unconstitutional, and that the court require the issuance of marriage license to same-sex couples on the same terms as opposite sex couples and recognize such marriages as valid. Three days later, on October 13, the plaintiffs moved for <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/doc._4_memorandum_in_support_of_plaintiffs_motion_for_preliminary_injunction.pdf">a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order</a> [PDF]. </p>

<p>On November 4, the Federal District Court issued a <a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2014/11/245530706-2-14-cv-02518-29-ORDER.pdf">38-page ruling</a> [PDF], granting a preliminary injunction. The court held that, given the Tenth Circuit's precedent, "plaintiffs have shown a strong likelihood that they will succeed in establishing that [the Kansas <a href="https://kslib.info/405/Kansas-Constitution">constitutional</a> and statutory bans] violate their rights guaranteed by the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> to the United States Constitution." Therefore, the court enjoined the defendants from enforcing the bans. The court then stayed its ruling until November 11 to allow the defendants to seek a stay pending review from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>Once again, the headlines were misleading. <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/judge-strikes-down-kansas-gay-marriage-ban">The story as reported on MSNBC's site</a> was a typical example, trumpeting "Judge strikes down Kansas gay marriage ban." Readers of the story learned that "a federal judge on Tuesday declared the state's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional." </p>

<p>Except he hadn't. Lost in the rush was the fact that the judge had only declared that it was likely that the plaintiffs would prevail, the standard for granting preliminary injunctive relief. The judge's decision did not conclusively reach the merits of the case. Therefore, there had not been an actual decision on constitutionality, but instead only a decision enjoining the defendants, most notably the clerks of the courts of two Kansas Judicial Districts, from refusing to issue marriage licenses.</p>

<p>After a request for a stay was turned down by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, Kansas's Attorney General filed an emergency request for a stay with the US Supreme Court. On November 10, a temporary <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/111014zr_0971.pdf">24-hour stay</a> [PDF] was granted. Although fairly routine, this<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/questions-fly-kansas-scotus-temporarily-blocks-marriage-equality"> caused a moment of consternation</a> for same-sex marriage proponents, because on November 6, the Sixth Circuit had become the first federal circuit to<a href="http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/Sixth%20Circuit%20opinion.pdf"> uphold a state ban</a> [PDF] on same-sex marriage. Suddenly, there was a question regarding what the Supreme Court might do, causing the head of Equality Kansas, a proponent of same-sex marriage, to advise gay and lesbian couples to "rush to the altar as soon as possible." The fears were somewhat allayed on November 12, when the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/111214zr_2co3.pdf">lifted the temporary stay</a> [PDF], thus allowing the Federal District Court's order to take effect.</p>

<p>On November 18, the Kansas Supreme Court followed suit, <a href="http://www.kscourts.org/State_v_Moriarty/112590.pdf">lifting its stay</a> [PDF] of the state district judge's administrative order in the Tenth Judicial District, thereby allowing marriage licenses to be issued in that district. Although expressly not opining as to the constitutionality of Kansas's ban, or the breadth of the federal injunction, the Kansas Supreme Court did establish one important point: it held that district judges were within their jurisdiction to make a determination as to whether a marriage license could be issued to same-sex couples. The court also determined that it would wait to allow the federal court action to play out before addressing the merits of the case. With all of the stays lifted and a preliminary injunction in place, it appeared that the situation regarding same-sex marriage in Kansas was finally beginning to clear.<br />
	<br />
Except that it still hasn't. Despite<a href="https://aclukansas.org/aclu-of-kansas-files-marriage-equality-suit/"> arguments by proponents</a> such as the American Civil Liberties Union that the matter should be considered settled and same-sex marriage legal throughout the state, this is manifestly not the case. While a declaration that Kansas's ban is unconstitutional would indeed have to be followed, no such declaration currently exists. Rather, the preliminary injunction extends only to the defendants in the federal district court case, and enjoins only them from enforcing or applying the bans. That is, it enjoins the court clerks of the Seventh and Eighteenth Judicial Districts from refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. It is unclear what its effect might be on the third defendant, the Secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, as his duties consist only of furnishing forms, worksheets and certificates for marriage licenses under Kansas law and maintaining a vital statistics database of marriages. It appears that, under the injunction, he is merely prohibited from issuing forms that exclude same-sex couples or failing to enter their marriages into the database. Determining who is qualified to marry in Kansas is a judicial function, and thus not within his purview. Meanwhile, the federal district court case itself is still pending.<br />
	<br />
So what do we know so far? Some things are clear. Same-sex couples may apply for marriage licenses in the Seventh and Eighteenth judicial districts in Kansas, and under terms of the temporary injunction in Marie v. Moser, such a license must be granted if the applicants are otherwise qualified. Same-sex couples may also apply for marriage licenses in the Tenth Judicial District, and they will be granted them by the administrative order of the district court, whose validity, if not ultimate legality, the Supreme Court upheld. Same-sex couples can also apply for marriage licenses in any other judicial district in Kansas. However, whether or not they will be granted them is subject to the independent judgment of the district court in that judicial district as to whether they are "legally entitled" to such a certificate, taking into account all of the authorities on the matter. As of November 20, <a href="http://m.kcur.org/?utm_referrer=#mobile/65038">approximately 24 of Kansas's 105 counties have decided to issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples</a>. Moreover, under <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/statute/023_000_0000_chapter/023_025_0000_article/023_025_0005_section/023_025_0005_k/">state law</a>, marriage licenses issued by one judicial district can be used by those couples to marry anywhere within the state. Thus, those same-sex couples who wish to marry in Kansas may do so, although they may have to travel to different county to obtain the license.<br />
	<br />
The validity and effect of those marriages is a little murkier, however. Because there has been no definitive federal or state ruling on the constitutionality of the Kansas ban, the state has continued to enforce the ban where not prohibited by the injunction. The state has taken the position that it will not otherwise recognize those marriages for purpose of benefits such as name changes or employee benefits. Until there is a final determination, it is not clear whether any of the marriages entered into so far are valid. While it would seem inconceivable that a final decision, whether at the district court, Tenth Circuit, or US Supreme Court, would uphold Kansas's ban at this point, the matter is still up in the air.<br />
	<br />
It appears that in ducking the issue of the constitutionality of state same-sex marriage bans, the United States Supreme Court sought to avoid a controversial decision, while at the same time hoping that events in the lower courts would make such a decision ultimately unnecessary. Of course, with the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit's decision upholding the constitutionality of some state bans, it looks as though this strategy may ultimately prove unavailing. Unless the Sixth Circuit overturns its panel on en banc review, the Supreme Court will either have to resolve the split, or live with the untenable situation where laws against same-sex marriage violate the Constitution in some parts of the United States, but not others. In the meantime, however, the court's decision not to decide has posed real human costs in the states, in terms of uncertainty and confusion over the state of same-sex marriage.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.wayne.edu/profile/peter.hammer/">Peter J. Hammer</a>, of  Wayne State University Law School, discusses the socioeconomic disparities that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals experience in Michigan ...</p><strong>I</strong>n an increasing number of domains, from worker rights, to <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">marriage inequality</a>, to state-imposed "Emergency Managers," almost exclusively in majority-minority cities, Michigan is becoming known as the "Mississippi of the North," hence the moniker "Mich-issippi." <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-5-worst-states-for-lgbt-people-20141124">A recent Rolling Stones article</a> ranked Michigan as one of the "5 worst states for LGBT people," along with Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and Louisiana.</p>

<p>Mississippi's historic reputation for suppressing civil rights is well known. Last June, we observed the 50th anniversary of the murder of the three civil rights workers near Philadelphia, Mississippi, as depicted in the film <em><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mississippi-burning-murders-resonate-50-years-later/">Mississippi Burning</a></em>. Those killings came on the heels of violent protests in 1962 over efforts to enroll James Meredith at the University of Mississippi.  </p>

<p>Few people appreciate the significant role played by the 1875 Mississippi Plan in violently ending post-Civil War reconstruction, or how rewritten state constitutions enshrined discriminatory practices and undermined the very functioning of democracy throughout the South. The truth is that majoritarian democratic processes can often be in opposition to the flourishing of civil rights.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://genderidentitywatch.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/bassett-v-snyder.pdf">Bassett v. Snyder</a> [PDF], Federal District Court Judge David Lawson provides insights into the life and daily struggles faced by gay, lesbian and transgender citizens of Mich-issippi. At issue was <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2011-2012/publicact/htm/2011-PA-0297.htm">Public Act 297</a>, a law revealingly entitled the "Public Employee Domestic Partner Benefit Restriction Act." The legislation did exactly what its title indicated: "prohibited local units of government from continuing to furnish health care and other fringe benefits to the domestic partners of their employees."  </p>

<p>Finding that the law was motivated by anti-gay animus, Lawson declared the provision unconstitutional, even under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Equal Protection Clause's</a> more lenient rational basis test. "[T]he primary purpose of Act 297 was to deny health benefits to the same-sex partners of public employees, and that can never be a legitimate governmental purpose."</p>

<p>It is sad, but not surprising, when anti-gay legislation is introduced in state houses across the country. It is something entirely different when anti-gay legislation such as Public Act 297 is introduced, wins super-majority support in the State House and Senate, is signed into law by the Governor and is vigorously defended by the state-elected Attorney General. But this is majoritarian democracy in Mich-issippi.  </p>

<p>What does the reality of the democratically enshrined anti-gay animus documented in <span class="casename">Bassett</span> imply for the challenge to the state's ban on marriage equality being litigated in <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/14a0275p-06.pdf">DeBoer v Snyder</a> [PDF]?  </p>

<p>The two issues are inextricably interconnected. In a 2004 referendum, a majority of citizens voted to amend the state constitution to prohibit marriage equality. The language was broad: "the union of one man and one woman in marriage shall be the only agreement recognized as a marriage or similar union for any purpose."  <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ikiw23554oavyh55co1zxa55))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-article-i-25">Mich. Const. Art. 1, § 25</a>. In the political campaign, proponents claimed that the broad language was necessary to ensure the provision could not be circumvented through enactments such as civil unions, but disclaimed any desire to attack well-established domestic partnership benefits provided by public employers.</p>

<p>Once adopted, however, the marriage shield quickly became a benefits sword. The Attorney General issued an <a href="http://www.ag.state.mi.us/opinion/datafiles/2000s/op10247.htm">opinion</a> asserting that the marriage ban also prohibited domestic partnership benefits provided by public employers.  </p>

<p>I was one of the plaintiffs in a state lawsuit challenging the Attorney General's interpretation. The suit maintained that whatever the amendment provided in terms of marriage, neither the language nor the voter intent prohibited public employers from providing domestic partnership benefits to their employees. The Circuit Court agreed and the Attorney General appealed.</p>

<p>I was in the courtroom when oral arguments were held. The three Appellate Court judges exhibited extreme physical discomfort resulting from being present in the same room as numerous gay and lesbian litigants. In my entire career, I have never seen such juvenile antics in what was supposed to be a professional setting. Yet, these were the jurists who would rule on the legality of my domestic partnership benefits. Not surprisingly, a unanimous panel decision held that the marriage amendment not only banned same-sex marriage, it prohibited domestic partnership benefits as well. The state Supreme Court <a href="http://www.danpinello.com/NationalPride.htm">affirmed</a>. The shield had indeed become a sword.</p>

<p>The Appellate and Supreme Court judicial opinions serve as exemplars of how formalistic textual analysis can easily slide into pretext for results-driven judicial outcomes. This is part of a larger devolution of doctrine, procedure and judging in a legal system that now makes it nearly impossible for civil rights plaintiffs to obtain justice in Mich-issippi.  State courts no longer serve as legitimate checks on the discriminatory abuses of voters, legislators or the state executive.</p>

<p>Undaunted, a number of public employers, including the state's leading universities, amended their benefits agreements to establish "Other Qualified Adult" plans that allowed employees to designate a person of either sex with whom they live and share finances to receive benefits. Similar action was taken by the Michigan Civil Service Commission.</p>

<p>As Lawson <a href="https://genderidentitywatch.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/bassett-v-snyder.pdf">noted</a> [PDF], these actions outraged powerful, conservative state legislators. Representative Peter Lund, who later co-sponsored the Public Employee Domestic Partner Benefit Restriction Act, characterized the [Michigan Civil Service Commission] decision as "an absolute abomination ... that shifts people's hard earned dollars into the pockets of same-sex partners." Representative Ken Yonker reacted by issuing a press release condemning the decision as "disgusting" and one that "makes a mockery of the moral fabric that has made America what it is today."</p>

<p>Public Act 297 was subsequently introduced and passed.  </p>

<p>Proving the existence of anti-gay bias behind the "Public Employee Domestic Partner Benefit Restriction Act" was not difficult in this context. Animus could be inferred from the title of the legislation, the novel nature of the mandate and its deviation from historic practices, the lack of any defensible alternative public policy justification, as well as these pre-enactment statements of the legislators.</p>

<p>Significantly, Lawson highlighted a number of other characteristics defining life in Mich-issippi for gay, lesbian and transgender citizens: We are leading targets of hate crimes. We face substantial discrimination in obtaining housing. The state provides us no protection against discrimination in employment. We can be fired from employment or be denied service in public accommodations with no recourse to state anti-discrimination laws. Indeed, nearly twelve years since the decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284&q=lawrence+v.+texas&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Lawrence v. Texas</a>, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), the state has failed to repeal its laws prohibiting fundamental expressions of intimacy.</p>

<p>Given the oppressive interconnection between the state's ban on marriage equality and its prohibition of domestic partnership benefits, what are the implications of finding of legislative anti-gay bias in <span class="casename">Bassett</span> for the challenge to the marriage ban in <span class="casename">DeBoer</span>?  </p>

<p>In <span class="casename">DeBoer</span>, Federal District Court Judge Bernard Friedman put the state's justifications for banning same-sex marriage on trial. After lengthy evidentiary hearings, Judge Friedman held that the state' marriage ban "impermissibly discriminates against same-sex couples in violation of the Equal Protection Clause because the provision does not advance any conceivable legitimate state interest."</p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit recently reversed Judge Friedman's decision. Unable to challenge the district court's factual findings, the majority opinion essentially reasons that facts do not matter. The ban on marriage equality could be salvaged on the basis of "rational speculation" regardless of evidentiary support. As characterized by the dissent, most of the majority decision reads not like a judicial opinion, but rather like a "TED Talk" in praise of federalism and the wisdom of state-led social change: voters and legislators should have the final say. Burkean courts should not interfere in the process.</p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit's reasoning falls flat. Trust in federalism's "laboratories of experimentation" may be wise in revealing new strategies for utility regulation, but such trust is misplaced in regards to the protection of civil rights. The 1875 Mississippi Plan may be one of the most extreme examples of how democracies can be hijacked and turned into systems of oppression, but the lessons are generalizable. Mich-issippi is also burning.</p>

<p>The juxtaposition of <span class="casename">Bassett</span> and <span class="casename">DeBoer</span> is revealing. In real-time controversies over domestic partnership benefits and marriage equality, public actors in the state legislature, the judiciary and the executive have proven themselves incapable of protecting the rights of their citizens. Instead, state democratic processes have demonstrated themselves to be infused with anti-gay animus.  In this frame, the "rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data" cited by the Sixth Circuit becomes a very thin veil for irrational bias, prejudice and discrimination.    </p>

<p>Martin Luther King would become visibly irritated when people counseled him to be "patient." A voter referendum was not a viable remedy for Mr. and Mrs. Loving of Virginia. For a brief 20-hour window in September 2014, I had the right to marry my partner of over 20 years, but I have never had a right not to be fired from my job due to vile forms of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The state offers no such protection.</p>

<p>Lawson's opinion in <span class="casename">Bassett</span> serves as a wake-up call: anti-gay legislative bias is alive and well in Mich-issippi. This has to fundamentally alter how courts frame the legal issues in the debate over marriage equality in <span class="casename">DeBoer</span> and the trust they can place in majoritarian politics and in the experiments of federalism. In this setting, deference to state's rights is simply a license for continuing discrimination.  </p>

<p>Postscript: While drafting this essay, capping a year-long effort that catalyzed support from the business community, advocates of amending state law to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, introduced legislation in the State House. Earlier, the Republican co-sponsor of the bill had been primaried and lost his seat because of his support for the legislation. The Speaker of the House has now declared the effort <a href="http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=69297">dead</a>. Instead, the House Judiciary Committee voted to approve a so-called "religious freedom act" that would make it easier to discriminate against members of the gay, lesbian and transgender community in the state. Mich-issippi still burns.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Nick Stratouly, St. John's University School of Law Class of 2015, is the author of the eighth article in a twelve-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law/academic-programs/student-journals/journal-civil-rights-and-economic-development">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Stratouly discusses gaps in federal anti-discrimination legislation...</j:header><strong>J</strong>uly 2, 1964. A snapshot of the US at this point in history, unfortunately, was pretty bleak. President Kennedy had been assassinated just seven months before; the nation was still caught up in the tumult of the <a href="http://www.crmvet.org/">Civil Rights Movement</a>, which had been struggling to achieve equality for nearly 10 years. On this date, though, the nation shined bright: President Johnson signed the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_rights_act_of_1964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> into law. A sweeping piece of legislation, the Act <a href="/thisday/2013/06/president-kennedy-proposed-civil-rights-act-of-1964.php">outlawed discrimination</a> in a whole host of settings, including the workplace. The workplace anti- discrimination law, known as <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII</a>, prohibited discrimination in the workplace based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin&#8212;a huge victory for those who fought during the Women's and Civil Rights Movements.</p>

<p>July 2, 2014. Moving forward to this year, a snapshot of the US on July 2, 2014 would hopefully include the media heralding the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/02/statement-president-50th-anniversary-civil-rights-act-1964">50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Act</a> with statistics about improved equality in the workplace. Unfortunately, and while I do not wish to undermine the great changes that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 brought to American society in the last 50 years, one minority&#8212;non-English speakers&#8212;still have little to celebrate. Because Title VII enumerates "race, color, religion, sex and national origin" as the five "protected" characteristics, its scope is limited. In fact, one minority group&#8212;non-English speakers, who actually make up 25% of Americans or 65 million people&#8212;receives little to no protection under Title VII. The Act, in all of its historic and legislative breadth, leaves these 65 million people out in the cold (both figuratively and literally, if someone is fired from a job for speaking a language other than English in the workplace).</p>

<p>￼Many of these 65 million people work in places that have so-called <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/immigrants-facts.cfm">"English-only policies"</a>&#8212;workplace rules that mandate employees speak English at all times except for breaks. While some may see these policies as an effective business strategy (i.e., with all employees speaking one language, the business is more efficient), the opposite is true. These policies foster feelings of isolation, inferiority and intimidation&#8212;none of which help make business more "efficient." Instead these policies undermine the cooperative workplace environment that is often crucial to the success of a company.</p>

<p>Yet the problems with English-only policies do not end there. Beyond the workplace, the feelings of inferiority and isolation leech into linguistic and cultural communities as a whole. Employees working in environments with English-only policies must divorce themselves from their linguistic identity; because linguistic identity is a crucial component of cultural identity, culture and therefore diversity suffers. A dearth of diversity as a result of English-only policies is anathema to every idea of the US as a "melting pot." A monolingual and monocultural society is incredibly sterile&#8212;by enclosing ourselves in our own culture, we lose the diversity of viewpoints and exposure that are crucial to an ever-globalizing and cosmopolitan world.</p>

<p>Beyond that, though, these English-only policies actually do more damage to the US in terms of reducing our economic competitiveness. By ensuring English-speakers have a "safe harbor" in the workplace, English-only policies have the penumbral effect of actually decreasing the number of Americans who can speak a second language. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/collegeprose/2012/08/27/americas-foreign-language-deficit/">Statistics demonstrate</a> that the number of bilingual Americans (18%) is deplorable compared to other parts of the world (53% of Europeans). With bilingualism as one of the top employment traits sought by both ￼American and multinational companies, Americans are losing out. English-only policies certainly do not help. In fact, they may only serve to further this widening language gap.</p>

<p>What is the solution? For the aggrieved non-English speaker, many nativists would simply say "learn English." Unfortunately, that is not the solution to the problem. Forcing someone to learn English parallels forcing someone to work a particular job (i.e., a secretarial position) simply because of his or her gender. Granted the language one choses to speak is technically a "mutable" characteristic, but requiring someone to change the language he or she chooses to speak is neither fair nor just.</p>

<p>Additionally the difficulty with using English-only policies to foster English-language acquisition is that the acquisition actually does not happen. Despite this "incentive" to learn English, the language acquisition rate for those who receive instruction in English remains low, which means that, even after instruction, non-English speakers still report having no or minimal knowledge of English. Why? One idea is that the language acquisition cost is borne by those least able to bear that cost. Minority, non-English speakers are often on the lower end of the income scale. Ironically, nativists want this same group to bear the cost of their own language acquisition. In this system, language itself becomes an entry cost to the market and a barrier to those who otherwise would be participants.</p>

<p>English-only policies clearly go against everything Title VII was aimed at preventing. The main goal of Congress in enacting Title VII at the apex of the Civil Rights Movement was to foster equal economic opportunity. By barring a large number of eligible and able participants from the job market, English-only policies contravene this Congressional goal. The litany of negative effects&#8212;inferiority, isolation, intimidation, discrimination, xenophobia and monoculturalism&#8212;borne out of these policies demonstrates that Title VII fell short of its noble goal, at least right now.</p>

<p>Luckily the solution is simple: All Congress needs to do is add two words to the list of enumerated protected characteristics &#8212;"and language." This change would have ensured the excitement of July 2, 1964 was felt this year on July 2, 2014, as Title VII turned fifty years old. While two words may seem like a lot of legislation for the current "do-nothing" Congress, I think it's a fair tune-up for a fifty-year old law that deserved much celebrating this past July.</p>

		<title>Cleveland Police Evade Ohio&amp;apos;s Mandatory DNA Collection Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Danielle Ardner, <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University Law School</a>, Class of 2016, discusses how Cleveland police are obstructing Ohio's mandatory DNA collection law...</j:header><strong>I</strong>t was 15 years before serial rapist and murderer Larry McGowan had his DNA properly collected in Ohio as mandated by law. McGowan is currently <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2013/09/man_suspected_as_cleveland_ser.html">serving</a> an 11-year sentence for an Akron rape, where Akron police were finally able to obtain his DNA during a 2012 arrest. Once McGowan's DNA was entered into the Ohio DNA Databank, his DNA identified him as a suspect in a string of rapes in Cleveland reported between 1996 through 2010, as well as the 1997 rape and murder of another woman. </p>

<p>McGowan is a career criminal, having been intertwined with the justice system for more than a decade, while managing to evade mandatory DNA collection. McGowan is one of at least 300 prisoners a state lab determined did not have their DNA properly collected and entered into appropriate databases.</p>

<p>Serial killer and rapist <a href="http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/05/anothony_sowells_dna_collected.html">Anthony Sowell</a> and suspected serial rapist <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/rape-kits/index.ssf/2014/02/post_6.html">George Young</a> are two other high-profile individuals who escaped Ohio's mandatory DNA collection law. In Sowell's case, his DNA was never entered into the massive national database used to identify criminals and link them to their crimes. State officials are unaware of how his DNA sample was lost. Young's DNA, however, was never collected, because Cleveland police failed to collect it when he was arrested in 2012 for his involvement in a shooting. Why are Cleveland police resisting Ohio's mandatory DNA collection law?</p>

<p>In 2011, Ohio enacted a <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2901.07">law</a> that requires all adults arrested for a felony to submit to a DNA collection. The law has been criticized for being overly "broad and intrusive." Those concerned about their civil liberties being violated are stuck asking why DNA samples are taken prior to conviction, as opposed to after conviction, as previous law required.</p>

<p>Collecting DNA samples from arrestees has been a growing trend since 1997, when Louisiana <a href="http://www.nij.gov/topics/forensics/evidence/dna/pages/collection-from-arrestees.aspx">became the first state</a> to pass such legislation. Then, eight years later, four more states passed arrestee DNA collection laws. Congress next passed the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/14135a">DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005</a>, enabling states to upload arrestee DNA profiles to the National DNA Index System (NDIS), and between 2006 and 2011, 23 more states passed arrestee DNA collection legislation into law. In 2011, Ohio became one of 28 states to pass arrestee DNA collection legislation. The federal government has also passed legislation authorizing arrestee DNA collection.</p>

<p>Although collecting DNA samples is mandatory by law in Ohio, Cleveland police have been falling short on upholding their end of the law. In 2014, from January through August, Cleveland police made <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2014/09/cleveland_police_not_following.html">6,608 arrests</a> for felony charges, but only 2,001 DNA samples made it to Ohio's crime lab. In 2013, Cleveland police made 10,136 felony arrests, but only submitted 1,589 samples to Ohio's Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The number correlation between felony arrests and DNA collections portrays a frightening reality: Cleveland police are obstructing Ohio's mandatory DNA collection law.</p>

<p>A Cleveland police department <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1306028-gpos-regarding-dna-collection-2.html">policy</a> allows felony arrestees to refuse DNA collection in exchange for a misdemeanor charge of obstructing official business. However, only one person arrested for a felony who refused to provide a DNA sample to Cleveland police so far this year was charged with obstructing official business. Cleveland Municipal Court Administrative Judge Ronald Adrine stated that he rarely sees misdemeanor cases concerning charges for those refusing to submit a DNA sample after a felony arrest. Judge Adrine recalled having only one such case.</p>

<p>The duty to collect DNA samples falls on Cleveland police officers. Judge Adrine stated that Ohio law gives police agencies the authority to collect these DNA samples without a warrant and he specifically pointed out that the law says police officers "shall" do it.</p>

<p>Police in Columbus are also failing to adequately enforce Ohio's DNA collection law. If arrestees in Columbus refuse a DNA swab, officers in charge of transporting the arrestee simply write "refused" on a card and give it to a supervisor.  In Toledo, Akron, Parma and Cincinnati, the police will obtain a court order from a judge to force individuals who refuse DNA testing to give law enforcement a sample.</p>

<p>Cleveland police could be trying to protect arrestees' civil liberties, but the protection of civil liberties is not directly the concern of Cleveland police. However, police are responsible for upholding the law.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3234257148722545343&q=maryland+v.+king&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Maryland v. King</a>, the Supreme Court ruled that it is reasonable for police officers to collect DNA samples from those arrested for felonies. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, stated that "taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee's DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure," that is reasonable under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a>.</p>

<p>DNA collection via cheek swabbing is "quick and painless," providing "unparalleled accuracy" of identification of the arrestee, according to Justice Kennedy.  He further stated that DNA is used to "connect the arrestee with his public persona," as indicated in police records, "assessing the danger he poses to the public." Justice Kennedy noted that "criminal history is critical" when processing a suspect.</p>

<p>There are concerns over exonerated or innocent arrestees' DNA being kept in the databases after release. Brendan Heil, in his Law Review <a href="http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1413&context=clevstlrev">article</a> [PDF], argues that Ohio's DNA law subjects those found innocent to "repetitive privacy intrusions" every time a DNA search is conducted. Although controversial, the Supreme Court held in <span class="casename">King</span> that collecting an arrestee's DNA before conviction is "a reasonable part of the booking process."</p>

<p>Collecting DNA prior to conviction, rather than post-conviction, leads to the collection of more samples, broadening and expanding the DNA databases and increasing the efficiency for solving and preventing violent crimes. More DNA samples in the database lead to more hits during database searches, which in turn leads to a larger number of crimes being solved and a greater amount of criminals being held accountable for their wrongdoing. You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide.</p>

<p>The office of Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, provides the <a href="http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/OhioAttorneyGeneral/files/f6/f6cdc701-4221-43c6-92a9-b84d8b8f20d6.pdf">DNA collection kits</a> [PDF] to every police department for free. DeWine's office also provides training on proper collection to minimize errors when collecting buccal swabs to ensure the correct demographic information is collected and included with each DNA sample.</p>

<p>Ohio's mandatory DNA collection law is meant to assist law enforcement in identifying arrestees, connecting their DNA to their criminal record and to ultimately provide a comprehensive report into who this arrestee is and what they are capable of. The DNA samples are then entered into databases and are used as an extremely useful investigative tool for solving and preventing violent crimes.</p>

<p>Cleveland is no stranger to police corruption, but police should not be hindering the work of other law enforcement officers, investigators, prosecutors and government officials by violating Ohio's laws. It is the duty of police officers to protect, serve and uphold the law. Cleveland police would never release an individual without obtaining their fingerprints, so they should uphold and vigilantly advocate for DNA collection of felony arrestees, instead of disregarding state law.</p>

<p>Cuyahoga County Prosecutor <a href="http://prosecutor.cuyahogacounty.us/">Timothy J. McGinty</a> stated that he is "baffled by Cleveland's policy" because "besides being counter to state law, it potentially prevents crimes, like rapes, from being solved." McGinty described Cleveland police as performing "substandard police work" by not always collecting DNA samples for felony arrests, as mandated by law.</p>

<p>Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Brian McDonough stated that "the simple act of following the law to collect DNA upon a felony arrest will ultimately be what helps prosecutors put away the worst of the worst."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center discusses the recently released Senate Torture Report ... </p><strong>T</strong></font>he recently released <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/senate-report-enhanced-interrogation-techniques-ineffective.php">Torture Report</a> of the Senate Intelligence Committee adds another layer of proof of serial international criminality that was manifestly authorized and/or facilitated by Bush, Cheney, Rice, Gonzales, Rumsfeld, Addington, Rizzo, Rodriguez, Yoo and several others during what George W. Bush admitted in September 2006 was his "program" of "secret" detention and "tough" interrogation tactics.</p>

<p>Later in 2010, in his memoir, Bush also admitted that he had authorized waterboarding. At the time, twenty-nine US federal and state court cases, three cases from the European Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and seven US Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices of other countries had already <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1989099">recognized</a> that waterboarding and related inducement of suffocation are forms of torture. Cheney also admitted in 2010: "I was a big supporter of waterboarding. I was a big supporter of the enhanced interrogation techniques." Rice <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijEED_iviTA&feature=related">admitted</a> in 2009: "I conveyed the authorization of the administration to the agency, that they had a policy authorization." In his book, John Yoo admitted in 2006: "some of the worst possible interrogation methods we've heard of in the press have been reserved for the leaders of al-Qaeda that we've captured" and, with remarkable candor and abandonment, "I've defended the administration's legal approach to the treatment of al-Qaida suspects and detainees," including the use of torture.</p>

<p>As John Yoo recounted in his 2006 book, detention, denial of Geneva protections and coercive interrogation "policies were part of a common, unifying approach to the war on terrorism;" instead of "following the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/human-rights/geneva-conventions/p8778">Geneva Conventions</a>," the inner-circle decided whether such "would yield any benefits or act as a hindrance;" the inner circle knew that following Geneva law would "interfere with our ability to ... interrogate," since "Geneva bars 'any form of coercion;'" for the inner-circle, "[t]his became a central issue" and, contrary to time-honored methods of lawful interrogation to obtain reliable intelligence, following "'Geneva's strict limitations on ... questioning'" supposedly "made no sense;" they calculated that "treating the detainees as unlawful combatants would increase flexibility in detention and interrogation;" and the question became merely "what interrogation methods fell short of the torture ban and [allegedly] could be used" as "coercive interrogation," which actually included equally unlawful cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  </p>

<p>The Senate Report allows one to add other information about the Bush-Cheney "program" of enforced disappearance and torture to the <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1989099">Torture Timeline</a> September 2001&#8212;2007. Importantly, facilitation of such serial criminality involves criminal complicity, which can occur when a person is aware that his or her conduct (e.g., writing a memo stating that waterboarding is not torture) can or will assist or facilitate conduct of a direct perpetrator. The person who aids and abets need not know that the conduct of the direct perpetrator is criminal or, for example, whether it does in fact constitute torture or some other widely-known and unavoidably criminal conduct such as cruel or inhumane treatment. It suffices that an accused was aware of the relevant factual circumstances. Even a direct perpetrator need not have known that his or her act amounted to an inhumane act either in the legal or moral sense. Furthermore, all acts of assistance, by words or acts and omissions, that lend encouragement or support will suffice if the accused knows or is aware that such conduct can or will facilitate the use of what happens to be an illegal tactic or form of treatment.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Convention Against Torture</a> and the 1949 Geneva Conventions both require the United States to either initiate prosecution of or to extradite every person who is reasonably accused of having criminal responsibility with respect to torture. President Obama should confirm to the nation that no one is above the law.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Cliff H. Mason II, <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University School of Law</a>, Class of 2016, examines police procedure in the wake of several high profile police-involved deaths and discusses new qualifications aimed at raising the standards for police recruits...</j:header><strong>W</strong>hat if your grandfather was gunned down standing in his own garage?  Sadly, that was the reality and demise of 72 year-old Jerry Waller who was shot <a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/crime/article3844374.html">several times</a> in Fort Worth, TX. The shooter was a rookie police officer responding to a burglary call. Tragically, the call was for a different house and the inexperienced officer's mistake deprived Waller's family a chance to say good-bye. Young, nervous and often times undereducated police officers are involved in shootings like this too often. Requiring more education and experience may help rid the impulsive deficiencies of youthful police officers. </p>

<p>Grade school teachers must earn a bachelor's degree and meet instructional standards, <a href="http://www.nj.gov/education/code/current/title6a/chap9.pdf">including pedagogy</a> [PDF], to acquire a teacher's certificate in most states. These educators receive years of academic study culminating in 5-10 months observing an established teacher before becoming eligible to direct their own class. These qualifications are generally accepted as necessary hurdles as society recognizes the need for quality and competent K-12 instructors.</p>

<p>Professionals in the service industry have similar heightened barriers of entry.  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/personal-care-and-service/barbers-hairdressers-and-cosmetologists.htm">Cosmetologists</a> in all states must earn a certificate from an accredited cosmetology program and complete necessary hours of practice on mannequin heads and live client volunteers.  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/plumbers-pipefitters-and-steamfitters.htm">Plumbers</a> and <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/electricians.htm">electricians</a> complete four to five years of apprenticeship learning under veterans in the field to earn their licenses in most states.  This list of professions requiring specialized education and experience is extensive. Legislatures in concert with labor leaders demand heightened qualifications, recognizing the inherent dangers associated with performing certain duties, absent sufficient education or training.</p>

<p>Professionals complete extensive studies and earn specialized certificates to demonstrate aptitude. Equally rigorous training and experience ought to be required to serve on a police force. Americans have mistakenly devalued the role of police by allowing exceptionally low barriers to persist despite the complex and high stress nature of police work.</p>

<p>Along these lines, Congress should enact legislation adopting minimum standards for qualification to serve as police officer in the US, by passing a "B.A.D.G.E." law recognizing the "Balance of Age and a Degree in General Education" necessary to properly police a community. Specifically: 1) instituting an age restriction of 25 years by the date of hire; and 2) requiring a bachelor's degree in any field (six years of military service with an honorable discharge shall qualify as an alternative to fulfilling the degree requirement. No amount of service circumvents the age requirement). No specific area of undergraduate concentration should disqualify a candidate since police departments are comprised of individuals with varying skill sets. Differing educational backgrounds and areas of expertise are needed to advance the mission of law enforcement.</p>

<p>Congress may set such standards using the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/spending_power">spending power</a>, Art. I §8 of the US Constitution. Every state receives federal funds from the <a href="http://ojp.gov">Office of Justice Programs</a>, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ovw">Office on Violence Against Women</a> and the <a href="http://www.cops.usdoj.gov">Community Oriented Policing Services Office</a>.  Unless states refuse this federal funding, BADGE overcomes <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> challenges.</p>

<p>Opposition to BADGE will claim raising standards may diminish the size of the applicant pool, causing a police shortage, however the evidence does not support this allegation. Tens of thousands of qualified Americans with advanced degrees would welcome opportunities to serve their communities, especially considering the competitive salaries and benefit packages of police officers. Laws like BADGE will only pass if leaders are willing to risk political capital advocating for it.</p>

<p>At the moment, the minimum recruitment age for serving in the majority of America's police departments ranges from <a href="http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/personnel/police">18</a> to <a href="http://www.joinlapd.com/qualifications.html">21</a>. Recruits must also have at least completed high school and possess American citizenship. Barriers to entry should never be so lax that more people are eligible for a position than not eligible. Considering the rising national distrust of police and the current lack of qualifications needed to become a police recruit, raising the qualification standards with BADGE will draw populist appeal.</p>

<p>Of the millions thronging to submit applications to become a police officer, it is unlikely that many will be dismissed due to the high school requirement. High school diplomas should never serve as the primary criterion for selecting persons tasked with diffusing conflicts where lives are at stake. Furthermore, the brain's prefrontal cortex is responsible for complex cognitive, emotional and behavioral functioning and is still developing in a teenager. They cannot be prepared for the emotional stress of quality police work.</p>

<p>In an <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=141164708">interview</a> with NPR, Sandra Aamodt, neuroscientist and coauthor of <em>Welcome to Your Child's Brain</em>, explained that, "the stage of development our brains initiate during puberty are only half complete at age 18."  Aamodt later noted that the prefrontal cortex helps to plan and organize behavior to reach goals while inhibiting impulses. Acknowledging neurological development studies is key when referencing age restrictions. As a matter of broad scientific consensus, the prefrontal cortex is not fully developed in men till age 25 and two to three years earlier in women. Thus, imposing an age restriction of 25 on those commissioned to "protect and serve" makes practical sense.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://hrweb.mit.edu/worklife/youngadult/brain.html">MIT Young Adult Development Project</a> discovered that, "The brain is not fully mature at 16, when we are allowed to drive, or at 18, when we are allowed to vote, or at 21, when we are allowed to drink, but 25, when we are allowed to rent a car."  Continuing to ignore comprehensive neurological studies is inexcusable and adversely affects communities nationwide. Thrusting individuals into life-threatening situations whose cognitive abilities are still maturing is not in society's best interest. Admittedly, older does not always make for higher quality applicants, but neuroscience shows it does directly affect ones ability to make higher quality decisions in high-pressure situations. Current crops of youthful, nervous police recruits who don't yet have the maturity to be levelheaded community leaders cannot continue to represent the standard.</p>

<p>The City of Minneapolis posts a disclaimer following a list of responsibilities on their <a href="http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/police/recruiting/police_recruiting_recruit">Police Recruit homepage</a>, which reads, "[We] reserve the right to limit the number of candidates in the exam process based on a review of application and supplemental application." Though valid, this disclaimer could effectively be enhanced by limiting acceptable applications via raised minimum requirements. This eliminates any potentially arbitrary or capricious hiring denials and simultaneously improves the candidate pool.</p>

<p>To be clear, a bachelor's degree does not open previously hidden pathways to hiring. Degrees do not automatically translate into superior communication ability or confer special propensity for problem solving. However, earning a bachelor's degree is a key marker for setting the individual levels of achievement necessary to form a selective pool of highly qualified candidates. Contrary to fantastical television dramas, police work seldom culminates in shootouts at the O.K. Corral. It is mostly laden with paperwork and investigation. Police paperwork is often available for public consumption and a regard for specificity and patience assists in its production and efficiency</p>

<p>Especially with law enforcement, barriers to entry must serve a cognizable function&#8212;to restrict persons from holding positions they are unqualified for. Teenagers lacking professional experience are typically not prepared to manage a crisis. Police departments that place young people in dangerous situations are putting those young people at risk for a failure that irrevocably affects everyone involved.</p>

<p>Some police departments recognize the fundamental need for highly qualified police, namely, Boise, ID, Houston, TX, Memphis, TN and Colorado Springs, CO. These police departments require applicants reach age 21 by the hire date and have accumulated sufficient academic credit to complete 75% of a bachelor's degree. Conversely, departments like, Detroit, MI, Boston, MA (the nation's oldest department), Seattle, WA and Miami, FL all accept teenage applicants with only a high school diploma.</p>

<p>Anyone concerned or disgusted by the steadily rising trend of police brutality and instances of excessive force will appreciate and support the BADGE qualification increases. All others will continue to defend the status quo and blindly accept poor policing. Perhaps, hiring more qualified applicants will minimize the risk to departments and society at large, as heightening minimum standards maintains professional integrity and minimizes risk. Life and the preservation thereof is at stake if the current status quo remains.</p>

		<title>Human Rights 365 in Crimea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Anastasiia Shtanieva, a practicing lawyer and trained mediator, discusses the current situation in Crimea and focuses on legal mechanisms to fight human rights violations on the peninsula...</p><strong>T</strong>he Human Rights Day is observed annually on the 10th of December (commemorating the date of adoption of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/udhr/documents/udhr_Translations/eng.pdf">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [PDF]). This year's official slogan is "<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/HRDay2014/Pages/HRD2014.aspx">Human Rights 365</a>," which symbolizes that every day is the Human Rights Day. In the view of this the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/">urged</a> the states "to honor their obligation to protect human rights everyday of the year" and people "to hold their governments to account."</p>

                <p>Launching new human rights protection campaigns, organizing demonstrations and protests would be popular ways for people to answer such a call. In the past, actions like these were often scheduled on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Day">Human Rights Day</a>. However, it seems that this 10th of December in Crimea will pass without any special events, since the local authorities <a href="http://tyzhden.ua/News/125418">denied</a> [Ukrainian] the motion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Tatars#After_Ukrainian_independence">Committee on Protection of Rights of the Crimean Tatars</a> to hold a Human Rights Day demonstration in Simferopol (capital of the peninsula). </p>

                <p>In their response, the authorities explained the refusal due to the New Year Eve's festivities, which shall take place in the city center starting December 1, as well as possible impediments to the citizens and public transport. Moreover, the Crimean prosecutor's office presented a <a href="http://www.unn.com.ua/uk/news/1415607-krimskim-tataram-zaboronili-miting-na-zakhist-prav-lyudini">warning</a> [Ukrainian] to the leaders of the Committee that any extremist activity will be not acceptable with regard to conduction of public demonstrations.  Similar anti-extremist warnings were issued to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mejlis_of_the_Crimean_Tatar_People">Mejlis</a> (the representative body of the Crimean Tatar People) and several media outlets earlier this year. It means that the respective authorities found the media was engaged in extremist activity. The media source will face liquidation unless they stop publishing materials designated in the warnings as dangerous. </p>

                <p>Governmental methods to fight extremism raised concerns before (e.g. <a href="https://netpol.org/2014/04/22/new-definition-of-domestic-extremism/">UK application of the term "domestic extremist</a>"). Such methods should not be used as a pretext for abuse of power and human rights violations. The <a href="http://www.rg.ru/oficial/doc/federal_zak/114-fz.shtm">Russian Federal 2002 law</a> [Russian] "On Counteracting Extremist Activity" gives a considerably broad definition to extremism, which can be extended to all individuals and organizations that provided any assistance in the activity of persons accused of extremism. This law also provides for creation of a <a href="http://minjust.ru/ru/extremist-materials?field_extremist_content_value=&page=12">list of extremist literature</a> [Russian], which currently contains over 2,500 titles. <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/droi/dv/4_41_statementbrussels_/4_41_statementbrussels_en.pdf">According to Russian activists</a> [PDF], misuse of this law is becoming a repressive instrument against very different groups in Russia.</p>

                <p>The introduction of the notion of "extremism" is not the only new thing resulting from the change in effective control over the Crimean peninsula. Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/crimea1114web.pdf">report</a> [PDF] "Rights in Retreat: Abuses in Crimea", published in November 2014 raised a <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/hrw-human-rights-abuses-rampant-in-crimea.php">number of concerns</a> such as imposition of Russian citizenship on residents of Crimea, failure to investigate forced disappearances of people, unwarranted searches, persecution of groups and individuals opposed to Russian occupation. The human rights activists also stress that the <em>de-facto</em> authorities allow the 'self-defense forces' to conduct the searches and that the percentage of the Crimean Tatars in the local authorities <a href="https://meduza.io/feature/2014/12/02/my-ne-gortsy-s-nami-tak-ne-nado.">declined</a> [Russian] from about 15% to 3% after this autumn's elections. Another violation is limitation of the Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar languages in public education despite that the new "constitution" of the Crimea declared three state languages (Russian, Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar). According to the "minister" of education of the Crimea the number of school with classes taught in Ukrainian <a href="http://tyzhden.ua/News/121041">decreased</a> [Ukrainian] to 20 as of October 10, 2014 (before the occupation there were more than 150 such schools).</p>

                <p>All in all, the HRW report as well as the <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CommDH(2014)19&Language=lanEnglish">report</a> of the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights allow to draw a conclusion that there are <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/-/in-crimea-serious-human-rights-violations-and-attacks-on-minorities-and-journalists-require-urgent-action?inheritRedirect=true&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coe.int%2Fen%2Fweb%2Fcommissioner%2Fnews%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_easZQ4kHrFrE%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-1%26p_p_col_count%3D1">three groups rendered vulnerable</a> by the current state of affairs: the indigenous Crimean Tatars, ethnic Ukrainians and all those who have refused Russian citizenship.</p>

                <p>In such situation not only the state, which has effective control, but also the state of citizenship of the Crimea residents shall put all efforts for the protection of human rights. As Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Niels <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/russia-urged-to-investigate-deaths-and-abductions-of-crimea-activists.php">Muižnieks</a> [JURIST] underlined during his recent visit to Kyiv, Ukrainian citizens living in the Crimea should not be isolated and Ukraine needs to do everything in its power to protect their rights. Starting from late February only a few steps have been taken in this direction. </p>

                <p>According to the Ukrainian Justice Minister, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) is <a href="http://ukr.segodnya.ua/politics/pnews/v-minyuste-razyasnili-sut-iskov-ukrainy-k-rossii-563107.html">considering three cases filed by Ukraine against Russia</a> [Russian]. The applications were based on article 33 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</a> [PDF], which allows any contracting state to file an application against another state for violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention. </p>

                <p>The first inter-state application was filed on 13 March 2014 (after the foreign military troops appeared in Crimea but before the so-called 'referendum'). Due to increasing concerns about possible human rights infringements the Ukrainian government requested the imposition of interim measures based on Article 39 of the ECHR Rules. This request was satisfied and the President of the Third Section of the ECHR called upon both Contracting Parties to "refrain from taking any measures, which might entail breaches of the Convention rights of the civilian population and to comply with their engagements under the Convention, notably in respect for Articles 2 (right to life) and  3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment). This interim measure remains in force.</p>

                <p>In this case (application no. 20958/14) the Government of Ukraine maintains that Russia, by having effective control over the respective territory, exercised jurisdiction and failed to prevent various violations of the Convention (Article 2&#8212;right to life, Article 3&#8212;prohibition of inhumane or degrading treatment), Article 5&#8212;right to liberty and security, Article 6&#8212;right to a fair trial, Article 8&#8212;right to respect for private life, Article 9&#8212;freedom of religion, Article 10&#8212;freedom of expression, Article 11&#8212;freedom of assembly and association, Article 13&#8212;right to an effective remedy and Article14&#8212;prohibition of discrimination of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (protection of property) and Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (freedom of movement) to the Convention). The Russian government is still to submit its comments on the admissibility of the application. The second case <span class="casename">Ukraine v. Russia</span> (no. 43800/14) was lodged on June 13, 2014 and concerned abduction and transportation of orphans from Eastern Ukraine to Russia. The third case (no. 49537/14) seeks protection for Crimean Tatar leader Mustafa Dzhemilov and his son Hayser, who is illegally held in custody in Russia. </p>

                <p>The court practice of the ECHR on inter-state cases is rather small with one decision that stands out. In 2001 it decided the merits of <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-59454#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-59454%22]}">Cyprus v. Turkey</a> (no. 25781/94), which concerned the situation in Northern Cyprus after the Turkish invasion in 1974. Awarding the compensation was postponed till 2014, when the court ordered Turkey to pay Cyprus 90,000,000 Euros for 14 violations of the Convention (right to liberty, right to property, right to a fair trial, right to respect of private life and others).</p>

                <p>Apart from filing cases with international courts, there are also steps that can be undertaken by Ukraine to protect its citizens' rights.  Among those, on March 20, 2014 the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) adopted a <a href="http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1140-18">resolution No. 1140-VII </a> [Ukrainian] "On Declaration of the Verkhovna Rada regarding the Guarantees of the Rights of the Crimean Tatar People in the State of Ukraine".  This document recognized the Crimean Tatars as indigenous people, recognized their representative and executive bodies acting in the Crimea and strongly condemned any attempts to limit the rights of all nations in the Crimea caused by the Russian occupation. Unfortunately most actions state in the resolution have not been implemented. Also, there is a lot to improve for the Crimean residents, who maintained Ukrainian citizenship, and, for example, are experiencing difficulties with Ukrainian authorities when crossing the administrative border with the Crimea.</p>

                <p>To conclude, both the <a href="http://www.dw.de/ukraine-parliament-approves-yatsenyuks-new-government/a-18106993">newly elected Ukrainian government</a> and the Russian government, which claims his citizens' rights are its priority, have a unique opportunity to adopt a Human Rights 365 approach for the people in Crimea.    </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.cwsl.edu/faculty-staff-and-campus-directories/faculty-and-staff-directory/g/glenn-c-smith">Glenn C. Smith</a> of<a href="https://www.cwsl.edu"> California Western School of Law</a> discusses the Ninth Circuit's denial of intervention in Peruta v. County of San Diego...</p><strong>"Y</strong>ou snooze, you lose."</p>

<p>At first blush, this maxim seems to capture the essence of the US District Court for the Ninth Circuit's November 12, 2014 split-panel decision in <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2014/11/12/10-56971%20Peruta%2011-12-14%20Order.pdf">Peruta v. County of San Diego</a> [PDF]. <span class="casename">Peruta</span> held that the California Attorney General and a major gun-control-advocacy organization waited too long to intervene and ask for the <em>en banc</em> review the county defendant decided not to seek. <span class="casename">Peruta</span> also denied intervention to two associations representing law-enforcement, already in the lawsuit as <em>amici</em>.</p>

<p>Far from being merely an arcane fight over federal procedure, <span class="casename">Peruta</span> is ultimately about the ability of major stakeholders to get authoritative guidance on important, unresolved constitutional questions flowing from the Supreme Court's recent forays into <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> rights. Depending upon the outcome of post-decision maneuvering&#8212;explored at the end of this commentary&#8212;the <span class="casename">Peruta</span> majority may have insulated the Ninth Circuit from further review of its <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2014/02/28/10-56971_motion_to_intervene.pdf">earlier controversial ruling</a> [PDF] invalidating strict restrictions on concealed-carry gun permits. Assuming that the US Supreme Court would not likely step into this kind of seemingly discretionary and procedural issue, insulating the latest <span class="casename">Peruta</span> decision from <em>en banc</em> Ninth Circuit review might equate to immunity from any further review.</p>

<p><strong>The Background and Basic Controversy: The Underlying Dispute Began as a Challenge to San Diego County's Denial of a Concealed-Weapon Permit</strong></p>

<p>California law <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/firearms/pdf/cfl2013.pdf">generally forbids</a> [PDF] most residents from the open or concealed carrying of firearms, but individual gun owners can get concealed-carry permits upon a showing of "good cause." Individual cities and counties have discretion to define the specifics of what such a showing requires in their jurisdictions. Like other California urban areas&#8212;but unlike most rural counties&#8212;San Diego applied a restrictive standard for good cause. Essentially, permit seekers could not just invoke a generic safety concern. They had to show through restraining orders or law-enforcement letters that they faced security threats "distin[ct] from the mainstream" San Diegan.  </p>

<p><span class="casename">Peruta</span> gave Ninth Circuit judges a chance to weigh in on key Second Amendment uncertainties in play since two Supreme Court opinions recognized an individual constitutional right to gun ownership applying to (and potentially invalidating) strict state and local gun-control laws (<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2739870581644084946">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5141154246897960488">McDonald v. City of Chicago</a>). In their February 2014 opinion reversing a federal district court opinion in favor of the county, the <span class="casename">Peruta</span> judges opined for many pages about the importance of the right to bear arms outside of the home, the strong scrutiny appropriate for laws regulating public engagement with firearms and the unconstitutionality of restrictive concealed-carry laws. </p>

<p>As noted in a previous <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/federal-appeals-court-holds-ca-may-not-challenge-concealed-weapons-laws-in-municipalities.php">JURIST report</a>, <span class="casename">Peruta's</span> pro-gun rights discussion is "being cited as a precedent in other gun challenges and some California counties have already chosen to follow it." So, when the county defendant announced that it would not appeal its loss up the Ninth Circuit ladder, the State of California, the non-profit Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and two associations representing California law-enforcement officials sought <em>en banc</em> review before an eleven-judge panel.</p>

<p><strong>The Peruta "Intervention Round" and the Basic Majority/Dissent Positions</strong></p>

<p>In order to request <em>en banc</em> review, the state, the Brady Campaign and the associations needed to be formally recognized as "intervenors" in the underlying dispute. This implicated the rights of non-parties to intervene in a federal civil lawsuit under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_24">Fed. R. Civ. P. 24</a>. </p>

<p>The two-judge <span class="casename">Peruta</span> majority (Republican-appointed Judges O'Scannlain and Callahan) saw the intervention requests as unjustifiably "untimely." Applying a standard three-factor test, the majority objected that the would-be intervenors waited "more than four years after the case began" and acted only when it had reached the appellate stage (at which intervention should be "extremely rare.") Finding no good reason for the delay, and seeking to avoid "encourag[ing] interested parties to impede litigation by waiting...until the final stages of a case," the majority turned thumbs down.</p>

<p>In dissent, Chief Judge Thomas (Democratic-appointed) saw the would-be intervenors' initial failure to join the fray as entirely justified, because the controversy had "morphed" from a "narrow but important" challenge to one county's policy into "another challenge entirely"&#8212;one that "considered the constitutionality of Calfornia's [entire] firearm regulatory framework." The dissenter evoked a "liberal policy in favor of intervention [as of right];" he also argued for two additional alternative bases upon which permissive or equitable intervention should be granted. </p>

<p><strong>Assessing the Positions: Determining Whether the Majority or the Dissent Approach is Better Requires Answering Three Questions</strong></p>

<p>First, what is the correct characterization of the would-be intervenors' motivations and justifications? Long knowing about the implications and significance of the challenge, did they merely seek to "avoid some inconvenience to themselves by waiting," as the majority implied? Did they seek to "impede" the litigation, the policy downside the majority worried about? Or, were their motives more creditable&#8212;such as maximizing scarce litigation resources and, in the case of the Attorney General, deferring to the lead of local officials? At least the two law-enforcement associations were already participating as <em>amici</em>, so they cannot be said to have "waited out" the controversy. Ultimately, this motive question is tied to a second question of characterization: who's view about the ultimate stakes involved in <span class="casename">Peruta</span> is the more persuasive? </p>

<p>The majority seems right as a technical matter that <span class="casename">Peruta</span> only formally challenged San Diego's refusal to let a general self-defense assertion be sufficient "good cause" for a concealed-weapon permit. This means that the dissenting judge failed to persuade in arguing that intervention by the state is mandated by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2403">28 U.S.C. § 2403(b)</a>, which requires it "wherein the constitutionality of any statute of that State affecting the public interest is drawn in question."</p>

<p>But the dissenting judge is correct that as a practical matter both the Peruta plaintiff and the appellate majority at important times conflated the broader California gun-carrying regulatory scheme with the San Diego policy. For example, the majority referred to both as an intertwined "California scheme" whose constitutionality needed to be analyzed "as a whole." </p>

<p>This leads to the third and ultimate question: which is more important in an intervention case such as <span class="casename">Peruta</span>&#8212;form or substance? Here, the dissent is ultimately more persuasive.</p>

<p>Although not technically a ruling on broader gun regulations in California or the other states within the reach of the Ninth Circuit, there is no gainsaying that last February's <span class="casename">Peruta</span> opinion (by the same three judges, who split 2-1) constitutes a major discussion by a weighty court. The opinion spends 17 pages on an extensive exegesis of how the Second Amendment text, "original public understanding," contemporaneous judicial precedents and post-Amendment legislation and commentary apply to public gun toting. Then, for 11 pages the opinion comprehensively critiques other circuit court analyses regarding what level of scrutiny should attend judicial review of a variety of gun-control laws.</p>

<p>Thus, there is great force to the dissenting judge's assertion that the <span class="casename">Peruta</span> majority's gun-rights pronouncements "will greatly impact any future litigation pertaining to [the] constitutionality" of California gun-control laws. Similarly persuasive is that California and its residents have "a significant protectable interest" in at least seeking broader judicial review of the 2-to-1 judge majority's pro-gun rights sentiments. Judicial efficiency and the public interest, supposedly important variables in intervention decisions, would have been served by a less hidebound application of mandatory and permissive intervention rules.</p>

<p><strong>A Last Irony</strong></p>

<p>I can't resist ending by pointing to an ironic comparison between <span class="casename">Peruta</span> and the otherwise <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17941114802734225386">unrelated case</a> in which the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/california-supreme-court-ends-legal-challenges-to-same-sex-marriage.php">ducked the merits</a> of Proposition 8's ban on same-sex marriage. </p>

<p>There, it was the official California defendants, including then-Attorney General Jerry Brown, who declined to appeal a judicial invalidation of <a href="http://www.voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/title-sum/prop8-title-sum.htm">Proposition 8</a>. It then fell to the proponents of the voter initiative, who had been allowed to intervene in the district court proceeding, to press an appeal. The Supreme Court famously held that initiative proponents lacked standing to mount the appeal; the result was that the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1984506746130471324">lower court invalidation</a> of Proposition 8 (with all its interesting arguments that same-sex marriage bans flunked strict and rational-basis scrutiny) was insulated from further appellate review.</p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Peruta</span>, by ironic contrast, the shoe is on the other foot. The (county) defendant's refusal to further defend its policy left it to California officials, among others, to mount an appeal. But they have now been denied the right to do so. Apparently, turn about is fair play.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: Present Status of the Three-Judge Panel Ruling and the San Diego County Policy</strong></p>

<p>As of this writing, it is unclear whether the <span class="casename">Peruta</span> majority's holding against intervention will stick. In the aftermath of the November 12 decision, the San Diego County Sheriff's <a href="http://sdsheriff.net/licensing/ccw.html">website</a> declined to implement the panel ruling at present because of the possibility that the Ninth Circuit would order <em>en banc</em> review on its own. Then, on November 27, the California Attorney General <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-appeals-ninth-circuit-concealed-weapons-permit">announced</a> that she would seek <em>en banc</em> review of the intervention denial. (<em>En banc</em> review of the denial of <em>en banc</em> review?  Interesting!) </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Gregory Fouladi, Valparaiso University School of Law Class of 2016, discusses the Constitutional ambiguity surrounding Federal Agency phishing techniques ... </j:header><strong>I</strong>magine a scenario where you are sitting in a private area of your home browsing on your personal computer. You may have be doing research, reading the news, shopping for Christmas gifts, uploading photos or talking with long distance relatives via web cam. Now imagine a team of federal officers at a government agency monitoring your searches, tracking the location of your IP address, and watching from the other side of your computer's camera. In today's world this is becoming America's new reality.</p>

<p>Federal agencies are using a technique known as "phishing" to obtain evidence and against suspected criminals.  The art of phishing finds security weaknesses in computer programs to gain control of the user's PC. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2013/12/06/352ba174-5397-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98_story.html">Phishing </a>is done in a number of forms most notably through the use of a malware created by the FBI.  </p>

<p>The malware's purpose is to install a malicious software that obtains control of any PC. The agents send the malware to users through some form of an online link. Once the user opens the link, the malware is permanently installed to your PC arming the FBI with the ability to monitor your location, searches, documents and web camera.</p>

<p>MSNBC.com first reported the use of this network investigative technique in 2001. The article reported that "the FBI plans hacker-style intrusion techniques ... called <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3341694/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/fbi-software-cracks-encryption-wall/%23.VHYv72fwsdU#.VJRzYV4B8">'Magic Lantern</a>' that uses deceptive email attachments and operating-system vulnerabilities to infiltrate a target system." This marked the beginning of an unprecedented era of intrusion that has dramatically unfolded.</p>

<p>The first reported implementation of the malware was revealed by Christopher Soghoian, Principal Technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, DC. According to Mike Carter of the <em>Seattle Times</em>, he presented a set of <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/fbicipav-08pdf">documents</a> [PDF] from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) that "reveal that the FBI dummied up a story with an Associated Press byline ... with an email link in the style of The <em>Seattle Times</em> including details about the subscriber and advertiser information."</p>

<p>After creating the false news story, the FBI sent the <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024888170_fbinewspaper1xml.html">article </a> to 15 year old high school student Lacey Timberline, who they suspected of making bomb threats. The link was sent to the inbox of the Lacey's Myspace account. Once she opened the link, the secret malware was permanently installed on the suspect's computer. At that point, the FBI was able to access her location and Internet Protocol (IP) information. Lacey ultimately was convicted of making bomb threats, identity theft, and felony harassment due to communications written from his PC.</p>

<p>Representatives of the <em>Seattle Times</em> were appalled to find out that the FBI had misrepresented their name in order to obtain evidence against a suspected criminal. The renowned news source believed that its readers would no longer trust the information that they presented, and that this incident has damaged its reputation. <em>Seattle Times</em> Editor Kathy Best said: "We are outraged that the FBI misappropriated the name of the <em>Seattle Times</em> to secretly install spyware on the computer of a crime suspect ... Not only does that cross the line, it erases it ... The FBI's actions, taken without our knowledge, traded on our reputation and put it at peril." It is now clear that the federal government is willing to deceive the public, at everybody's expense, in order to advance its criminal investigations.</p>

<p>In 2010 federal agents of the DEA created a fake <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-dept-will-review-practice-of-creating-fake-facebook-profiles/2014/10/07/3f9a2fe8-4e57-11e4-aa5e-7153e466a02d_story.html">Facebook </a>account in an attempt to lure in suspected members of a drug ring.  Sondra Arquiett filed a suit against the DEA after a fake Facebook account was created under her name. Arquiett was arrested for minor drug charges and ordered to serve probation. While detained, Arquiett's cell phone was confiscated by the DEA agents. According to the Syracuse federal law suit, "DEA agent Timothy Sinnigen used stored pictures and information to make a remarkably accurate Facebook page." Included in the Facebook page were pictures of Arquiett, her son, and niece. The DEA Agents continued using the Facebook page for a period of three months. According to the lawsuit: "Sinnigen then utilized the Facebook page to initiate contact with individuals he was investigating with regard to an alleged narcotics distribution ring ... the DEA is not disputing the facts in the lawsuit, but insisted Arquiett lost all rights to her cell phone data when her gadget was confiscated." Arquiett claims that now she is in fear for her life and suffers from severe emotional distress because "by posing as her on Facebook, Sinnigen had created the appearance that Arquiett was willfully cooperating in his investigation of the narcotics trafficking ring, thereby placing her in danger." Arquiett's attorney has since agreed to resolve the dispute through mediation. The courts have struggled to interpret these cases in a number of ways and judges have looked to both sides of the dispute when they decide to issue warrants.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15694190716388212297"> United States v. Forrester</a>, the court held that "IP addresses and the To/From fields in emails are the legal equivalent of dialed phone numbers and the government can get a court order to obtain them without showing probable cause as would be needed in a search of one's home." The <span class="casename">Forrester</span> Court cited an earlier case,<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3033726127475530815"> Smith v. Maryland</a>, where the US Supreme Court said that "the contents of the calls could not be listened in on without proving probable cause to a judge."</p>

<p>Applying these holdings to the current phishing techniques, it would appear that federal agencies may obtain the IP address of an individuals PC without establishing probable cause, but could not uncover the contents or the specific activity of the PC without first establishing probable cause and obtaining a judge issued warrant. The allowance of federal agencies to use phishing techniques has become a matter of judicial discretion. Judges are having to make these powers up as they go along, and there is not much basis for them to be uniform in their decision-making.</p>

<p>The most shocking feature of the federal government's phishing expedition is the ability to remotely activate the PC's webcam.  According to an article published in 2012 by the <em>Washington Post</em>,<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2013/12/06/352ba174-5397-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98_story.html"> Marcus Thomas</a>, the former assistant director of the FBI's Operational Technology Division in Quantico, said <blockquote> "The FBI has been able to covertly activate a computer's camera&#8212;without triggering the light that lets users know it is recording&#8212;for several years, and has used that technique mainly in terrorism cases or the most serious criminal investigations." In an effort to arrest a suspected terrorist only known as 'Mo', a federal judge in Denver approved a warrant that would allow collecting "real-time images by activating cameras connected to computers."</blockquote>  </p>

<p>In a 2013 Houston bank fraud investigation, the FBI requested a warrant to remotely activate video feeds from a personal computer. Judge Steven W. Smith rejected the warrant saying that it was "extremely intrusive" and ran the risk of accidentally capturing information of people not under suspicion of any crime. He wrote that "such surveillance may violate the Fourth Amendment's limits on unwarranted searches and seizures."</p>

<p>The<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment"> Fourth Amendment</a> of the Constitution states:<blockquote>"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."</blockquote>A strong argument emerges that the use of the federal government's phishing techniques conflicts with the meaning, intent, and text of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. In the phishing process, there is no "particularity describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized," but instead, the federal government obtains a warrant solely to compromise an individual's general IP address, and from there, goes on a "phishing expedition" for anything it can possibly find.  </p>

<p>These techniques are excessive and possibly illegal procedures used by the FBI to obtain suspected criminals.The FBI's strategies are evolving daily in response to our current technological advancements. Since the online world is still relatively adolescent, it is extremely complicated to regulate this world both for daily consumers and government agencies. Public opinion and Constitutional challenges will determine the future direction of these investigations. At this point, the acceptance of phishing is being determined on a case by case basis.  It has merely become a matter of judicial discretion.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://staffprofiles.bournemouth.ac.uk/display/sbachmann">Sascha-Dominik Bachmann</a>, of Bournemouth University in the UK, discusses the present use of incendiary weapons within its legal framework and why the use of such weapons is most likely to continue, as a response to Human Rights Watch's call to end incendiary weapon use in <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/hrw-calls-for-strict-international-law-to-end-incendiary-weapons-use-in-ukraine-and-syria.php">Ukraine and Syria</a> ...</p>
"<strong>I</strong>ncendiary weapons, as the term is understood in international humanitarian law (IHL) describes weapons that act mainly through fire and heat. Napalm and white phosphorous are probably the best known incendiary substances used in <a href="http://www.weaponslaw.org/weapons/incendiary-weapons">incendiary weapons</a>."</p>

<p>Incendiary weapons as well as phosphorous munitions is one of the inventions of twentieth century warfare: from the flame thrower in WWI and WWII, carpet bombing in WWII, the use of Napalm in South East Asia during the Vietnam War and to the well reported use of white phosphorous by Israel during Operation Cast Lead in Gaza in 2009. Incendiary weapons were developed and have been used mainly due to their 'effectiveness' in combat: they destroy biological tissue while sparing hard surfaces and the infrastructure. Incendiary weapons can also used defensively, e.g., as a smoke screen (white phosphorous) or offensively in mortar bombs, rockets and artillery ammunition.</p>

<p><strong>Some legal considerations on the use of incendiary weapons </strong><br />
The <a href="http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/ccwc">1981 Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) Convention</a>, together with the <a href="http://www.clusterconvention.org/the-convention/convention-text/">2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions</a> and the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/580">1997 Anti-Personnel Mine Convention</a> aim to protect civilian non-combatants by limiting the use of certain weapons. Article 1 of Protocol III of the CCW defines an incendiary weapon as "any weapon or munition which is primarily designed to set fire to objects or to cause burn injury to persons through the action of flame, heat, or combination thereof, produced by a chemical reaction of a substance delivered on the target." It excludes from this definition certain types of multipurpose munitions which have only incidental and/or additional incendiary effect: battlefield illumination and smoke as examples for the first category and armor piercing projectiles and so called combined effect munitions when used solely against military target as an example for the second category.</p>

<p>Article 2 clarifies that any direct targeting of civilians or the use of air delivered incendiary weapons against military targets which are situated in civilian settlement areas are prohibited under Protocol 3 of the CCW. Israel's use of white phosphorous against Hamas targets in Gaza during the 2009 Operation Cast Lead would constitute such a violation if the criterion of distinction was not met &#8212;if one was to assume that it was used for offensive and not defensive purposes such as a smoke screen etc. </p>

<p><strong>White Phosphorous:</strong><br />
Due to the lethality of white phosphorous for humans &#8212;"it causes deep burns through muscle and down to the bone, continuing to burn until deprived of oxygen. It can contaminate other parts of the body, or even people treating the injuries, poisoning and irreparably damaging <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/015/2009/en/8f299083-9a74-4853-860f-0563725e633a/mde150152009en.pdf) at 37 and HRW http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/Incendiary%20Weapons_Recent%20Use%20and%20Growing%20Opposition_Nov2014_final.pdf">internal organs</a>" [PDF]. Its offensive use would qualify as indiscriminate and hence prohibited under international humanitarian law when directed against civilians deliberately outside the military context of smoke camouflage, signaling or battlefield illumination. </p>

<p><strong>Incendiary Weapons and International Humanitarian Law</strong><br />
Any direct targeting of civilians or indiscriminate use of air delivered incendiary weapons would not only constitute a breach of Protocol III of the CCW but also a violation of International Humanitarian Law, the jus in bello. Protocol Additional to the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/publications/icrc-002-0173.pdf">Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949</a> [PDF], and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), <a href="https://www.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/470-750065">8 June 1977</a> protect in general the civilian population and individual civilians from any indiscriminate attacks. The use of incendiary weapons in such instances would violate the specific safeguards of Arts. 51(4)(b) and (c); 51(5); and 57(2)(a)(ii) of the Protocol I. Such violations could lead to individual criminal responsibility for  war crimes committed by using certain prohibited weapons, projectiles, and material and methods of warfare under Article 8(2) (b) (xx) of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">1998 Rome Statute</a> [PDF] of the International Criminal Court.</p>

<p><strong>Amendment of CCW III </strong><br />
In November 2014, Human Rights Watch and Harvard Law School's International Human Rights Clinic called on all nations and especially CCW states to publicly condemn the use of incendiary weapons, express support for reviewing CCW Protocol III on incendiary weapons and work toward developing stronger protections <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/Incendiary%20Weapons_Recent%20Use%20and%20Growing%20Opposition_Nov2014_final.pdf">for civilians</a> [PDF]. The memorandum calls for adopting a broader definition of prohibited incendiary weapons by including said multipurpose munitions and also reiterates any use in civilian areas, regardless of the mode of delivery. The call is important and will hopefully contribute to the existing initiatives to outlaw the use of such weapons and to maintain public pressure on policymakers. </p>

<p><strong>Future Outlawing and non proliferation</strong><br />
In addition to agreeing on a binding international legal regime which outlaws the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of any type of incendiary weapon including small arms ammunition, an effective system of control and enforcement would be needed. Using the example of Nuclear Non Proliferation with its various approaches to such measures one has to look into the various aspects of verification of disarmament at the State Party level, the related approaches to industrial non&#8212;proliferation and state sanctioned territorial exclusion zones as future steps towards an incendiary weapons free battlefield of the future. </p>

<p><strong>Problem is the asymmetry of 21st century conflict</strong><br />
In addition to a comprehensive ban of incendiary weapons it would need a generation long, holistic approach by the main State parties to ensure that new proliferation of incendiary weapons and the use of existing stockpiles will come to an end&#8212;something which I feel amounts to 'wishful thinking' as we see the number of asymmetric and conventional conflicts increasing.  </p>

<p>The lethality of incendiary weapons when targeting humans which translates into effectiveness in terms of any military use makes it highly unlikely that the use of incendiary weapons will come to an end anytime soon. However it is this lethality and its dual use capacity (offensive/defensive) which makes the use of incendiary weapons so 'attractive' when fighting insurgencies as the examples of its use as weapons in asymmetric conflict scenarios show: the U.S. used incendiary weapons in Vietnam, the Russians in Chechnya in 1994, the US Marines during the battle of Fallujah in Iraq <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/wp.htm">in 2004 </a> and the now reported use in Syria and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/11/10/ukraine-syria-incendiary-weapons-threaten-civilians">in Ukraine </a>. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.rechten.vu.nl/en/about-the-faculty/faculty/faculty/criminal-law-and-criminology/fry.asp">Elinor Fry</a>, of <a href="http://www.vu.nl/en/">VU University Amsterdam in the Netherlands</a>, discusses the ICC's problematic jurisdiction over foreign <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/icc-prosecutor-contemplating-war-crimes-charges-against-islamic-state-fighters-report.php">Islamic state fighters</a>...</p><strong>I</strong>n an <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/internationaler-strafgerichtshof-den-haag-erwaegt-ermittlungen-gegen-auslaendische-is-kaempfer-1.2228977">interview</a> with the <em>Süddeutsche Zeitung</em> published on November 20, the Chief Prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda, said her office is considering the possibility of investigating acts that could be qualified as war crimes or crimes against humanity committed by the <a href="http://www.clarionproject.org/sites/default/files/islamic-state-isis-isil-factsheet-1.pdf">Islamic State</a> (IS) [PDF] fighters. Bensouda's statement pertains to the earliest stage of possible ICC involvement: an initial assessment meant to identify those crimes that appear to fall within the court's jurisdiction (phase one of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press and media/press releases/Documents/OTP Preliminary Examinations/OTP - Policy Paper Preliminary Examinations  2013.pdf">preliminary examination process</a> [PDF], not to be confused with the formal initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 53(1) of the ICC's <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [PDF]). While the crimes committed by IS are <a href="http://www.ejiltalk.org/why-the-icc-should-be-cautious-to-use-the-islamic-state-to-get-out-of-africa-part-2/">likely to fall</a> within the court's subject-matter jurisdiction, and jurisdiction can be exercised over nationals of States Parties based on the statute's active nationality principle, this jurisdictional scheme presents some serious challenges. It raises the question whether the issue of foreign IS fighters is really one for the ICC prosecutor to take on without the UN Security Council (SC) or Syria and Iraq taking action.</p>

<p>IS&#8212;not just a terrorist group but a military and political organization seeking to impose its radical understanding of Islam on all who cross its path&#8212;has focused on building its "state" ever since it joined the <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian civil war</a> in 2013. Governed from Raqqa in Syria, IS now holds large <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/06/daily-chart-9">sections</a> of Syrian and Iraqi territory. Reports of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/24/world/middleeast/the-fate-of-23-hostages-in-syria.html">beheadings</a>, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/HRC_CRP_ISIS_14Nov2014.pdf">mass killings, rape, slavery and other atrocities</a> [PDF] have been making headlines worldwide for the past year, while more and more foreign fighters are making their way to the self-declared Islamic caliphate. </p>

<p>International attention shifted to the unprecedented number of citizens of states other than Iraq and Syria joining the ranks of IS after the SC adopted <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11520.doc.htm">Resolution 2170</a> this summer, calling on all UN members states to take measures to "suppress the flow of foreign terrorist fighters," bring them to justice and discourage people to travel to Syria and Iraq for the purpose of joining terrorist groups. According to an SC <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/foreign-jihadist-iraq-syria-unprecedented-un-isis">report</a> obtained by <em>The Guardian</em> in October, over 15,000 people from more than 80 countries have joined IS and similar extremist groups. Other sources state that <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29372494">more than 3,000</a> Europeans have joined IS. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29043331">largest groups</a> are not European though; they appear to be from Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.</p>

<p>Pursuant to Article 13 of the Rome Statute, the ICC's jurisdiction can be triggered in three ways: (1) the SC refers the situation to the court, (2) a State Party refers the situation to the court pursuant to Article 14, or (3) the ICC prosecutor initiates an investigation <em>proprio motu</em> pursuant to Article 15. In the case of an SC referral, other preconditions for the exercise of jurisdiction are bypassed, meaning it does not matter whether or not the territorial state or the state of active nationality is a State Party to the Rome Statute. The other two options leave these preconditions intact: pursuant to Article 12(2) the court may exercise jurisdiction over conduct that occurred on the territory of a State Party or over persons who are nationals of a State Party. Article 12(3) provides states not party to the statute with the possibility of signing a declaration accepting <em>ad hoc</em> jurisdiction of the ICC with respect to a particular crime, which for all intents and purposes then equates them with states parties.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the flow of foreigners to IS is considerable and that many of the fighters' countries of origin&#8212;European states, Tunisia, Jordan and Australia, to name a few&#8212;are <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states parties/Pages/the states parties to the rome statute.aspx">States Parties</a> to the Rome Statute of the ICC. Since neither Syria nor Iraq&#8212;the states on the territory of which the crimes took place&#8212;is a State Party to the statute, and assuming they will not accede to the statute anytime soon or make a declaration under Article 12(3), there remain two possible avenues by which the crimes of foreign IS fighters could come within the court's reach. </p>

<p>First, the SC could refer the situation to the court. <a href="http://justiceinconflict.org/2014/08/18/international-justice-and-isis-an-icc-intervention-in-iraq/">Others</a> have already assessed the chances of this option in relation to events in northern Iraq and I will not go into the political dimension of this issue. Suffice it to say that an SC referral is extremely unlikely given current geopolitics. To name one factor in this respect, a US-led <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/world/middleeast/us-and-allies-form-coalition-against-isis.html">operation</a> is active in the conflict and the US, a permanent member of the SC, would probably not want the ICC to get involved and potentially scrutinize this military effort. Moreover, it is hard to imagine how the 'situation' would be defined. The crimes committed by IS are closely linked to the Syrian civil war&#8212;in relation to which an SC referral <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11407.doc.htm">failed</a> earlier this year. Moreover, states not party to the statute would probably push for an explicit exclusion of jurisdiction over their nationals in the referral&#8212;a widely <a href="http://justiceinconflict.org/2014/05/09/the-icc-in-syria-three-red-lines/">criticized</a> standard clause that has been added to previous SC referrals (see <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2005/sc8351.doc.htm">Darfur</a> and <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2011/sc10187.doc.htm">Libya</a>).</p>

<p>Second, in the absence of an SC referral, the ICC prosecutor can use her proprio motu power to investigate. The court would then only have jurisdiction over the nationals of states that are parties to the Rome Statute. This would provide a way the foreign IS fighters could be prosecuted despite Syria and Iraq not being states parties. However, an even greater challenge with situational demarcation arises here. The statute makes a distinction between situations and cases. A preliminary examination or the initiation of an official investigation pursuant to Article 53(1) concerns a given situation, not a case. As the Pre-Trial Chamber reminded in the decision authorizing the Prosecutor's proprio motu investigation in the Kenya situation, a case starts after the issuance of an arrest warrant or a summons to appear pursuant to article 58 of the statute (<a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc854287.pdf">para. 44</a> [PDF]). Cases <em>arise from</em> situations. To prevent prejudiced or one-sided investigations, the SC or States Parties cannot refer cases, only situations. When the court's jurisdiction is triggered by the proprio motu power of the Prosecutor and is based on the nationalities of alleged perpetrators, demarcation of the situation is not based on territorial jurisdiction but on personal jurisdiction. The situation under investigation is then technically demarcated exclusively by future events: the cases that may arise from it. This effectively puts the cart before the horse and renders the investigation of the situation highly biased and fragmented, because it already focuses on possible perpetrators when it should be looking into events more objectively at the situation stage.</p>

<p>While demarcation of a situation exclusively based on the active nationality principle is unusual, it is not unprecedented. The (recently re-opened) preliminary examination into the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure of the court/office of the prosecutor/comm and ref/pe-ongoing/iraq/Pages/iraq.aspx">situation in Iraq</a> concerns alleged responsibility of British troops for war crimes involving systematic detainee abuse in Iraq from 2003 until 2008. There are a number of factors, though, that make this situation less difficult to demarcate than a possible ICC inquiry into IS foreign fighters. First, the geographical parameters are better definable: the crimes allegedly occurred at 14 military detention facilities and other locations under the control of UK Services personnel in southern Iraq, as opposed to scattered over patches of two countries. Second, the examination focuses on UK nationals alone, not an array of different nationalities, leaving open the possibility of investigating the higher end of the hierarchy structure allegedly responsible. </p>

<p>With IS, this is trickier. While the IS leadership structure appears to be "<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/HRC_CRP_ISIS_14Nov2014.pdf">largely dominated by foreign fighters</a>" [PDF], those at the top end of the <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/18/world/meast/isis-syria-iraq-hierarchy/">IS hierarchy</a> are not from countries falling under ICC jurisdiction. In fact, the highest ranks are reportedly filled with Iraqi <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/world/middleeast/army-know-how-seen-as-factor-in-isis-successes.html?_r=1">former Saddam loyalists</a>, most of whom <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story">met</a> a decade earlier when being held in the Camp Bucca prison in southern Iraq. This matters, because the ICC prosecutor's policy is only to pursue those <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/1fa7c4c6-de5f-42b7-8b25-60aa962ed8b6/143594/030905_policy_paper.pdf">leaders bearing greatest responsibility</a> [PDF]. This is not to say that foreign fighters, even mid-ranking, could not still bear 'greatest responsibility' for a given crime, but when forced to focus on foreign IS fighters alone, it is possible that the most responsible amongst that so-defined group are not the most responsible for the crimes as such. The most responsible at the top of the IS hierarchy could remain untouched, which is&#8212;theoretically at least&#8212;not the case in relation to the situation in Iraq dealing with UK officials of all ranks. This focus on the most responsible is a prosecutorial policy, not a legal requirement, but it raises the question whether this policy must be applied within the ambit of those falling under the court's jurisdiction or in the context of crimes committed by IS in general. The latter is most likely to be correct. This makes the court's role questionable in relation to IS violence when centered on a select group of alleged perpetrators of lower ranks, and arguably, bearing less responsibility.</p>

<p>Given that the matter of foreign IS fighters is not manifestly beyond the court's jurisdiction, it may very well be that the Prosecutor will proceed to phase two of a preliminary examination, which is its formal commencement (<a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press and media/press releases/Documents/OTP Preliminary Examinations/OTP - Policy Paper Preliminary Examinations  2013.pdf">para. 80</a> [PDF]). Further analysis of the situation during this next phase will entail an assessment in relation to the statute's (situational) gravity threshold&#8212;where the same question arises: what are the parameters of the 'situation'?&#8212;as well as complementarity requirements, namely whether any potential cases arising from the situation would be admissible under Article 17. The latter includes gathering information on relevant national proceedings in the countries foreign fighters are from. In the spirit of the complementarity principle, this could mean that the court is (partially, depending on the country) barred from further action. There are a number of national jurisdictions that appear to be dealing with the issue of their nationals going abroad to fight for IS. For instance, prosecutions have been initiated and/or completed in <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Rechtbanken/Den-Haag/Nieuws/Pages/Syri%C3%ABganger-krijgt-drie-jaar-gevangenisstraf.aspx">the Netherlands</a>, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10843771/UK-man-who-fought-in-Syria-is-first-to-be-convicted-of-terror-offences-related-with-the-conflict.html">the UK</a>, <a href="http://www.worldtribune.com/2014/05/02/jordan-hosting-prosecuting-islamist-fighters-trained-fight-syria/">Jordan</a> and <a href="http://theconversation.com/foreign-fighter-passports-and-prosecutions-in-governments-sights-30197">Australia</a>. </p>

<p>Expectations are often too high with respect to the ICC&#8212;a court of last resort with limited means and a restricted jurisdictional reach. The fact that the statute theoretically allows an ICC probe does not mean it is justified or realistic to proceed. Not only do the jurisdiction requirements create problems, the practical concerns are immense, too, bearing in mind the difficulties and danger involved with investigating in IS-controlled areas. Having said that, a mere possibility of a preliminary examination, or even a remark in a newspaper that the Prosecutor is considering starting one, can serve as catalyst for national prosecutions and definitely puts accountability for IS crimes on the international agenda. For now, perhaps that is all we should read into Bensouda's words, because the only way IS atrocities can be dealt with comprehensively is if, in addition to national jurisdictions, the SC, Syria or Iraq take action to that end&#8212;the SC by referring the situation to the ICC and Syria or Iraq by acceding to the statute or accepting the court's <em>ad hoc</em> jurisdiction.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Clarence Leatherbury from Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law discusses the <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/un-report-criticizes-us-compliance-with-anti-torture-treaty.php">debate </a>over torture techniques and our nations security... </j:header><strong>T</strong>he American public was recently given information about the CIA's torture of suspected terrorists during the Bush Administration, stirring up the debate over whether the torture of detainees is necessary and/or beneficial to America's security.</p>

<p>To combat these recent revelations, some politicians and pundits have given the usual standardized "national security" responses which Americans have repeatedly heard since the aftermath of 9/11. US Senator Dan Coats stated, <blockquote>"The hallmark of a free society is open and transparent government, but certain disclosures must be carefully weighed against the potential damage to the national security interests of the United States and the security of the men and women who serve our country overseas. This report contains no recommendations and offers only an nonconstructive, partisan account of the last decade's counter-terrorism efforts. It is now time for the Senate Intelligence Committee to move past this long-settled issue and focus on the vitally important national security challenges currently facing our country." </blockquote></p>

<p>The late US Senator <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sen-robert-byrd/our-obligation-to-investi_b_193593.html">Robert Byrd</a>, who always carried a copy of the Constitution in his pocket, saw things quite differently from Mr. Coats when he wrote, <blockquote>"It is our choice as a nation whether to pursue the path of truth ourselves, or leave the details of the abuse to be painfully revealed by others." He went on, "As long as those who condoned and approved these despicable acts are permitted to escape the consequences, we allow our moral standing in the world to be severely compromised. September 11th did not suddenly legalize torture, nor did it exonerate those who authorized such a heinous deviation from the rule of law."</blockquote></p>

<p>Contrary to the neoconservative views of today, torture was frowned upon by the classical conservatives of yesterday. While facing the wrath of the British Army, George Washington instructed his soldiers to treat the captives with "humanity, and let them have no reason to complain of our copying the brutal example of the British Army in their treatment of our unfortunate brethren who have fallen into their hands." And during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln issued <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/02/12/1186321/-Lincoln-and-Torture-Necessity-Does-Not-Admit-Of-Cruelty-a-Birthday-Reprise">General Orders No. 100</a>, this code of military conduct for the Union Armies barred torture.</p>

<p>Some politicians and pundits argue that the post 9/11 torture was done out of necessity, the Revolutionary and Civil War were wars that determined the fate of the United States yet Washington and Lincoln never found such acts to be justifiable. If torture was not necessary during the most perilous of times in our nation's history, then it is not necessary today. To fortify this point, on April 18, 1988, the <a href="http://tomwoods.com/podcast/ep-304-the-torture-report-and-what-it-left-out/">United Nations Convention Against Torture </a>was signed by President Ronald Reagan. The ratified convention states, "No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture."</p>

<p>One must understand that those who oppose torture are also not apologetic to the Islamic criminals who committed such heinous crimes. They oppose torture because they support civility. They oppose torture because it breeds hate and resentment throughout the world, instead of peace and understanding. They oppose torture because it is linked to the un-American precedent of 'guilty until proven innocent' which has been firmly ingrained at <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/obama-to-expedite-closing-of-guantanamo-bay-prison.php"> Guantanamo Bay</a>, Abu Ghraib, Bagram and other military and secret CIA prisons around the world.</p>

<p>There is an ancient maxim that says it is better to let ten guilty men go free than to imprison an innocent man. This principle is in line with America's presumption of innocence, but today those democratic ideas have been tarnished due to the suspension of <em>habeas corpus</em> and enhanced interrogations of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. During the Afghanistan War, the US implemented a bounty <a href="http://tomwoods.com/blog/cantor-defeated-more-on-gitmo-swap-justin-raimondo-on-the-tom-woods-show/">program </a>to pay Afghan farmers and peasant's monetary rewards to capture or give information on potential enemy combatants. The Afghan people's average annual national income per capita is around $410 so the financial incentive to act as a bounty hunter for the US government became a profitable venture for some. However, the financial incentives led to what many believe were false accusations causing innocent civilians to be placed in Bahrain and Guantanamo Bay prisons. The US government has acknowledged that it has detained prisoners indefinitely without trial. To the individuals who have had their freedom taken away unjustly, the mental torture of knowing that fact must be a thousand times more devastating than any bodily torture a state agent can subject them to.</p>

<p>Supporters of the current military tribunals routinely argue that it's too dangerous to try the detainees in a civilian court. But as Congressman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiCFda-UMug">Ron Paul</a> reminded everyone on May 21, 2012, ". . . our Article Court 3 system is a strength not a weakness. The right to face our accuser, the protections against hearsay evidence, the right to a jury trial, these are designed to protect the innocent and to determine and then punish guilt. And they have been quite successful thus far."</p>

<p>You will hear supporters of the methods used at Guantanamo Bay and other secret prisons claim the techniques worked and now America is safer as a result. This simply is not true. History shows torture is an ineffective tool in getting information and can actually have the unintended consequences of weakening a country's national security. For example, the CIA has coined the term '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q8GA4ja2Y0">blowback</a>' which refers to the unintended consequences which stem from military interventions abroad. In this case, the blowback will be the increased recruitment to terrorist organizations and retaliation against innocent Americans and Christians around the world due to the acts of torture committed on Muslims by the US government. For example, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/28/AR2008112802242.html">Matthew Alexander</a>, who was involved in over 300 interrogations of suspected terrorist stated, "I learned in Iraq that the No. 1 reason foreign fighters flocked there to fight were the abuses carried out at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo." Due to Alexander's high moral values, he blatantly refused to torture any detainee but was still able to get better information than his interrogator comrades who tortured detainees during interrogations. Furthermore, a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/12/the-humane-interrogation-technique-that-works-much-better-than-torture/383698/">study </a>published in 2014, by Jane Goodman-Delahunty, of Australia's Charles Sturt University found that confessions are four times more likely when interrogators implement a respectful stance and build bonds with detainees versus engaging in torture against detainees.</p>

<p>Truth and freedom are indivisible. Americans need to know the truth about the illegal and immoral actions taken by their government officials so they can take necessary steps to see that those officials who violated US treaties, who lied to Congress, and who blackened the<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment"> 8th Amendment</a> are no longer given the opportunity to represent a country established on inalienable rights and the rule of law. To be looked upon as a virtuous leader by the world's citizens, our government cannot succumb to the same authoritarianism, ruthlessness and cruelty that has taken hold every single government that has graced this earth. The torture that took place at Guantanamo Bay and other secretly run US prisons around the world is not honorable nor is it in line with the rule of law and the natural rights of man. For the United States to remain the world's beacon of light as a free nation, we must always hold ourselves to the highest standard. Those who authorized or engaged in such acts should repent for their crimes against humanity. The US should <a href="http://gitmoobserver.com/2014/10/11/how-can-the-president-close-guantanamo-bay-by-clarence-b-leatherbury/">close </a>Guantanamo Bay prison while still maintaining control of the land to help promote free trade, peace and diplomacy with Cuba. Such actions would go a long way in strengthening America's image, economy and security.  </p>
